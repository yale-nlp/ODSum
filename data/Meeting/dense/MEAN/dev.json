        "Query": "What were the Professor's thoughts on the results and clustering in language generation?",
        "Summary": "Summary:\nThe professor expressed surprise at the better-than-expected results and concluded that MSG had no impact. However, he observed that the inclusion of French and Spanish in the multilingual English model had a negative effect. The professor was not enthusiastic about clustering and suggested giving more weight to the most promising bands in the model. Currently, the model treated all bands equally. In terms of the SmartKom generation module, the syntax-to-prosody rules for English will be rewritten, and OGI will provide a variety of synthesizer voices to choose from.",
        "Article": "professor a: We 're not recording yet , are we ? grad g: Well , I don't think phd f: No , that that wasn't recorded . phd f: I guess I have to d stop doing this sigh of contentment , you know , after sipping cappuccino or something . phd f: I was just noticing a big s professor d: So are we recording now ? Is this phd e: Yeah . professor d: So , what were we gonna talk about again ? So we said we said data collection , which we 're doing . Do we do th do you go around the room and do names or anything ? grad g: I think that phd e: It 's a good idea . grad g: u usually we 've done that and also we 've s done digits as well , but I forgot to print any out . Besides with this big a group , phd b: You can write them on the board , if you want . I it 'd be even better with this big grad g: it would take too much time . phd e: Mari ? postdoc h: What professor a: What ? professor d: It 's not that long . professor d: w u phd e: So that thing the little th that part should be pointing upwards . professor a: It 's kind of professor d: Oh , yeah , the element , yeah , n should be as close to you your mouth as possible . So what we had was that we were gonna talk about data collection , and , you you put up there data format , professor a:  . professor d: and other tasks during data collection , professor a: So , I think the goal the goal was what can we do how can you do the data collection differently to get professor d: and professor a: what can you add to it to get , some information that would be helpful for the user - interface design ? Like grad g: especially for querying . postdoc h: Well , one thing that came up in the morning in the morning was the , i  , if he I ,  if he has s I I don't remember , Mister Lan - Doctor Landry ? grad g: Landay . postdoc h: La - Landay ? So he has , these , tsk note - taking things , professor a:   postdoc h: then that would sort of be a summary which you wouldn't have to solicit . professor a: Well , if if you actually take notes as a summary as opposed to n take notes in the sense of taking advantage of the time - stamps . So action item or  , reminder to send this to so - and - so , blah - blah - blah . grad g: But if we had the CrossPads , we could ask people , you know , if if something comes up write it down and mark it somehow , postdoc h:   And so , you know phd f: the down - side to that is that he sort of indicated that the , quality of the handwriting recognition was quite poor . I don't think there 'd be so many that you couldn't have someone clean it up professor a: So grad g: pretty easily . We also could come up with some code for things that people want to do so that for frequent things . So , if that you know , if if we just keep it simple then maybe it 's still useful . professor d: I just realized we skipped the part that we were saying we were gonna do at the front where we each said who we were . professor a: But anyway , shall we do the roll call ? professor d: No , not a No , I just My mind went elsewhere . So , yeah , I 'm Morgan , and where am I ? I 'm on channel three . postdoc h: Should we have used pseudo - names ? Should we do it a second time with pseudo No . professor d: I 'm Rocky Raccoon on channel phd e: Let me , turn that off . grad g: And , do you want to do the P D As and the P Z phd e: Oh . phd e: PDM - right , PZA - right PDA - right , PDA - left . grad g: Yeah , and eventually once this room gets a little more organized , the Jimlets will be mounted under the table , and these guys will be permanently mounted somehow . postdoc h: I have a question on protocol in these meetings , which is when you say \" Jimlet \" and the person listening won't know what that is , sh shou How how do we get Is that important information ? You know , the Jimlet  , the box that contains the professor d: Well , suppose we broaden out and go to a range of meetings besides just these internal ones . There 's gonna be lots of things that any group of people who know each other have in column common that we will not know . professor d: we we were originally gonna do this with VLSI design , and and and the reason we didn't go straight to that was because immediately ninety percent of what we heard would be jargon to to us . Should we do it and , if so , what 'll we have them do ?  , do we have s people write summaries ? Everybody or one person ? And then , do we ask people for how they would query things ? Is that phd f: There 's there 're sub - problems in that , in that where or when do you actually ask them about that ? professor a: Right . phd f: that was One thing I was thinking about was is that Dan said earlier that , you know , maybe two weeks later , which is when you would want to query these things , you might ask them then . phd f: But there 's a problem with that in that if you 're not If you don't have an interactive system , it 's gonna be hard to go beyond sort of the first level of question . professor d: There 's there 's another problem grad g: And professor d: which is , we certainly do want to branch out beyond , recording meetings about Meeting Recorder . And , once we get out beyond our little group , the people 's motivation factor , reduces enormously . And if we start giving them a bunch of other things to do , how you know , we we did n you know another meeting here for another group and and , they were fine with it . But if we 'd said , \" OK , now all eight of you have to have to come up with , the summar \" grad g: Well , I asked them to and none of them did . grad g: So , I I asked them to send me ideas for queries after the meeting postdoc h:   grad g: So I didn't track them down and say \" please do th do it now \" . professor d: I I 'm worried that if you did even if you did push them into it , it it it might be semi - random , professor a: Right . professor d: as opposed to what you 'd really want to know if you were gonna use this thing . grad g: I just don't know how else to generate the queries other than getting an expert to actually listen to the meeting and say \" that 's important , that might be a query \" . Well , there is this other thing which y which you were alluding to earlier , which is , there are certain key words like , you know , \" action item \" and things like that , which could be used in , t to some degree finding the structure . phd e: Although professor a: W postdoc h: And and I also , was thinking , with reference to the n  , note - taking , the advantage there is that you get structure without the person having to do something artificial later . And the fir third thing I wanted to say is the summaries afterwards , I think they should be recorded instead of written because I think that , it would take so long for people to write that I think you wouldn't get as good a summary . professor a: How about this idea ? That normally at most meetings somebody is delegated to be a note - taker . professor a: And So why don't we just use the notes that somebody takes ? postdoc h: Yeah . grad g: that gives you a summary but it doesn't really How do you generate queries from that ? phd e: Well . But , maybe a summary is one of the things we 'd want from the output of the system . phd b: Actually And so grad g: James and I were talking about this during one of the breaks . And the problem with that is , I 'm definitely going to do something with information retrieval even if it 's sort of not full full - bore what I 'm gonna do for my thesis . And so if someone wants to do that , that 's fine , but it 's not gonna be me . professor d: Well , I think that we  , the the f the core thing is that you know once we get some of these issues nailed down , we need to do a bunch of recordings professor a: Well professor d: and send them off to IBM and get a bunch of transcriptions even if they 're slightly flawed grad g: Yep . professor d: And then , i i we can start l looking and thinking , what do we want to know about these things and at the very least . So , if you could sense just when people are writing , and you tell them not to doodle , or try not to be using that for other purposes , and each person has a note pad . Then you c you can just have a fff plot of wh you know , who 's writing when . But I bet that 's that will allow you to go into the sort of the hot places where people are writing things down . phd b: you can tell when you 're in a meeting when everybody stops to write something down that something was just said . phd b: It may not be kept in the later summary , but at that point in time is was something that was important . phd b: And that wouldn't take any extra postdoc h: That 's a nice idea . phd b: Or someone could just pu you could just put your hand on the pad professor d: It professor c:   It 's professor d: That 's a good idea but that doesn't Maybe I 'm missing something , but that doesn't get to the question of how we come up with queries , right ? professor a: Well , what it does phd b: Well , then you can go to the points where the you could actually go to those points in time and find out what they were talking about . phd b: And grad g: y professor a: I I think it 's an interesting thing . I don't think it gets at the the queries per - se , but it does give us an information fusion sort of thing that , you know , you wanna i say \" what were the hot - points of the meeting ? \" phd b: Yeah . professor d: That that 's what  , is that I think it gets at something interesting but if we were asking the question , which I thought we were , of of of , \" how do we figure out what 's the nature of the queries that people are gonna want to ask of such a system ? \" , knowing what 's important doesn't tell you what people are going to be asking . phd e: Well , see , there are th professor a: I think you could say they 're gonna ask about , when  , when did so - and - so s talk about blah . phd b: At least you can find the locations where there are maybe keywords professor d: Maybe . grad g: i this would tell you what the hit is , phd b: and grad g: not what the query is . grad g: And so you could you can generate a query from the hits , professor a: Right . grad g: but phd b: We don't even know what  , if you want to find out what any user will use , that might be true for one domain and one user , professor d:   professor d: Yeah , but we 're just looking for a place to start with that phd b:  . professor d: because , you know , th what what what James is gonna be doing is looking at the user - interface and he 's looking at the query in in i We we have five hours of pilot data of the other stuff but we have zero hours of of of queries . So he 's just sort of going \" where where do I where do I start ? \" professor a: w Well , th you could do I think the summaries actually may help get us there , professor d: OK . One , if you have a summary if you have a bunch of summaries , you can do a word frequency count and see what words come up in different types of meetings . professor a: So \" action item \" is gonna come up whether it 's a VLSI meeting , or speech meeting , or whatever . So words that come up in different types of meetings may be something that you would want to query about . professor a: the second thing you could possibly do with it is just run a little pilot experiment with somebody saying \" here 's a summary of a meeting , what questions might you want to ask about it to go back ? \" grad g: Yeah , I think that 's difficult because then they 're not gonna ask the questions that are in the summary . professor a: Well grad g: But , I think it would give professor a: That 's one possi one possible scenario , though , is you have the summary , grad g:   So that that is another use of Meeting Recorder that we haven't really talked about , which is for someone else , as opposed to as a remembrance agent , which is what had been my primary thought in the information retrieval part of it would be . But , I guess if you had a meeting participant , they could use the summary to refresh themselves about the meeting and then make up queries . phd e: But th there is this ,  There is this class of queries , which are the things that you didn't realize were important at the time but some in retrospect you think \" oh , hang on , didn't we talk about that ? \" And it 's something that didn't appear in the summary but you professor a:   phd e: And that 's kind of what this kind of , complete data capture is kind of nicest for . phd e: Cuz it 's the things that you wouldn't have bothered to make an effort to record but they get recorded . So ,  And th there 's no way of generating those , u u until we just until they actually occur . phd e: But  , it 's difficult to sort of say \" and if I was gonna ask four questions about this , what would they be ? \" Those aren't the kind of things that come up . postdoc h: I also think that w if if you can use the summaries as an indication of the important points of the of the meeting , then you might get something like y So if th if the obscure item you want to know more about was some form of data collection , you know , maybe the summary would say , you know , \" we discussed types of na data collection \" . If you if you had the the larger structure of the of the discourse , then if you can categorize what it is that you 're looking for with reference to those l those larger headings , then you can find it even if you don't have a direct route to that . postdoc h: I think that grad g: That 's a pretty fine grain that the note - taker will have to take . I think you got to have somebody who knows the pro knows the topic or you know , whose job it is delegated to be the note - taker . phd b: No , but someone who can come sit in on the meetings and then takes the notes with them that the real note - taker grad g: But they phd b: And that way that one student has , you know , a rough idea of what was going on , and they can use it for their research .  , this isn't really necessarily what you would do in a real system , grad g:   But if he has some students that want to study that then they should sort of get to know the people and attend those meetings , professor d:   Their sort of note - taking application stuff they 've been doing for the last couple of years , and I don't think anyone is still working on it . grad g: And so the question is \" is there such a person ? \" And I think right now , the answer is \" no \" . professor a: Well professor d: I 've b been thinking grad g: We 'll just have to see . professor d: I 've been thinking about it a little bit here about the  , th this , e  I think that the now I 'm thinking that the summary a summary , is actually a reasonable , bootstrap into this into what we 'd like to get at . It 's it 's not ideal , but we you know , we we have to get started someplace . So I was I was just thinking about , suppose we wanted to get w We have this collection of meeting . So now we have five hours of meetings and , you ask me , \" Morgan , what d you know , what kind of questions do you want to ask ? \"  , I wouldn't have any idea what kind of questions I want to ask . So in fact if I looked at summary of it , I 'd go \" oh , yeah , I was in that meeting , I remember that , what was the part that \" And and th I think that might then help me to think of things even things that aren't listed in the summary , but just as a as a as a refresh of what the general thing was going on in the meeting . One , as sort of a refresh to help bootstrap queries , professor d:   professor a:  phd b: So how does the summary get generated ? professor a: Well , i i ? phd b: I 'm not against the idea of a summary , grad g: By hand . phd b: but I wanted to think carefully about who 's generating it professor a: Or , d o phd b: and how because the summary will drive the queries . professor a: What I I think , you know , in most meetings , phd b: So professor a: this one being different , but in most meetings that I attend , there 's somebody t explicitly taking notes , frequently on a laptop  , you can just make it be on a laptop , phd b:   professor a: so then yo you 're dealing with ASCII and not somebody you don't have to go through handwriting recognition . postdoc h: I I I think that , there 's we 're using \" summary \" in two different ways . postdoc h: And what I originally thought was , if you asked someone \" what was the meeting about ? \" phd b: OK . postdoc h: And then they would say \" well , we talked about this and then we talked about that , and so - and - so talked about \" And then you 'd have , like I e My thought was to have multiple people summarize it , on recording rather than writing because writing takes time and you get irrelevant other things that u take time , that professor a:   postdoc h: Whereas if you just say it immediately after the meeting , you know , a two - minute summary of what the meeting was about , I think you would get , with mult See , I I also worry about having a single note - taker because that 's just one person 's perception . And , you know , it it 's releva it 's relative to what you 're focus was on that meeting , professor d:   professor d: A postdoc h: So , my proposal would be that it may be worth considering both of those types , you know , the note - taking and a spontaneous oral summary afterwards , professor a: OK . postdoc h: no longer than two minutes , professor d: Adam , you can postdoc h: from multiple people . professor d: but but , my impression was that , pretty much , true that the meetings here , nobody sits with a w  , with a laptop grad g: Never . Does anyone ? phd b: Dan ? professor d: I grad g: Dan is the one who who most frequently would take notes , phd e: Yeah . Most of the meetings we have are four or five people grad g: That 's true are four or five people . professor d: and you 're not you don't have somebody sitting and taking minutes for it . professor a: So , I think it depends on whether it 's a business meeting or a technical discussion . grad g: The IRAM meeting , they they take notes every professor d: Do they ? grad g: There 's  a person with a laptop at each meeting . phd b: I don't know how , but for instance , the outline is sort of up here and that 's what people are seeing . phd e: We sh we should grad g: I agree , but but you you just you g end up with video , postdoc h: I agree . phd e: f u I think for this data capture , it would be nice to have a digital camera grad g: Yeah , different phd b: y phd e: just to take pictures of who 's there , where the microphones are , and then we could also put in what 's on the board . grad g: But don't you think that 's Don't you think that But postdoc h: I agree .  , I I just think  , I think that right now we don't make a record of where people are sitting on the tables . phd e: Not not as part of the not as a part of the data that you have to recover . phd e: Just just in terms of phd b: We should just Like archiving it or storing it . postdoc h: It 's i because discourse is about things , phd b: Because someone postdoc h: and then you have the things that are about , and it 's recoverable . phd b: someone later might be able to take these and say \" OK , they , you know at least these are the people who were there phd e: So phd b: and here 's sort of what they started talking about , and \" and just postdoc h: Yes . professor d: Li postdoc h: Like you said , three snapshots professor d: L L L postdoc h: and professor d: Liz , you postdoc h: Just to archive . professor d: u  , Liz , you sa you sat in on the , subcommittee meeting or whatever phd e: Actually professor d: on you on the subcommittee meeting for for at the ,  that workshop we were at that , Mark Liberman was was having . They they they they h must have had some discussion about video and the visual aspect , and all that . But I 'm just saying first of all there 's a whole bunch of fusion issues that DARPA 's interested in . And there 's also I think a personal interest on the part of Mark Liberman in this kind of in storing these images in any data we collect professor d:   phd b: And professor d: I think you  , that the key thing there is that this is a description of database collection effort that they 're talking about doing . professor d: And if the database exists and includes some visual information that doesn't mean that an individual researcher is going to make any use of it . professor d: So ,  grad g: But that it 's gonna be a lot of effort on our part to create it , and store it , and get all the standards , and to do anything with it . So we 're gonna So we 're gonna do what we 're gonna do , whatever 's reasonable for us . phd b: I think even doing something very crude professor d: But having phd b: Like I know with ATIS , we just had a tape recorder running all the time . phd b: And later on it turned out it was really good that you had a tape recorder of what was happening , even though you w you just got the speech from the machine . So if you can find some really , you know , low , perplexity , grad g: Low fidelity . And if it 's simple as  , as simple as just the digital phd b: Otherwise you 'd you lose it . professor d: Well , minimally , what what Dan is referring to at least having some representation of the p the spatial position of the people , postdoc h: Yeah . professor d: so ,  grad g: Well , once the room is a little more fixed that 's a little easier professor d: Yeah . grad g: But phd b: Also CMU has been doing this and they were the most vocal at this meeting , Alex Waibel 's group . And they have said , I talked to the student who had done this , that with two fairly inexpensive cameras they they just recorded all the time professor d:   phd b: and were able to get all the information from or maybe it was three from all the parts of the room . So I think we would be we might lose the chance to use this data for somebody later who wants to do some kind of processing on it if we don't collect it at all . The problem with it is you 'll have more people who don't want to be filmed than who don't want to be recorded . grad g: So that there 's going to be another group of people who are gonna say \" I won't participate \" . phd b: Or you could put a paper bag over everybody 's head grad g:  phd b: and not look at each other and not look at boards , and just all be sitting talking . phd b: That would be an interes Bu postdoc h: Well professor d: Great idea . But I think y she 's we 're just proposing a minimal preservation of things on boards , phd b: Yeah . postdoc h: sp spatial organization And you could anonymize the faces for that matter . You know , this is grad g: But , you know , that 's a lot of infrastructure and work . postdoc h: We can talk about the grad g: To set it up and then anonymize it ? postdoc h: It 's just one snapshot . phd b: No , it wa n not ,  professor a: No , no , no , no . Maybe we don't want to spend that much more time discussing it , phd f: Did they store it digitally , or ? postdoc h: but phd b:   I think they just phd f: or just put it on videotape ? phd b: I think they just had the videotapes with a c you know , a counter or something . Well , I think for  , for our purposes we probably will d phd b: I 'm not sure . professor d: we we might try that some and and we certainly already have some recordings that don't have that , which , you know , we we 'll we 'll get other value out of , I think . postdoc h: Th The thing is , if it 's easy to collect it it th then I think it 's a wise thing to do because once it 's gone it 's gone . And phd b: I 'm just The community If LDC collects this data u  , and L - if Mark Liberman is a strong proponent of how they collect it and what they collect , there will probably be some video data in there . phd b: And so that could argue for us not doing it or it could argue for us doing it . The only place where it sort of overlaps is when some of the summarization issues are actually could be , easier made easier if you had the video . professor d: I think at the moment we should be determining this on the basis of our own , interests and needs rather than hypothetical ones from a community thing . professor d: As you say , if they if they decide it 's really critical then they will collect a lot more data than we can afford to , and and will include all that . professor d: professor a: e professor d: I I I 'm not worried about the cost of setting it up . In other words , it 's it it 'd be kind of silly to collect it all and not look at it at all . And so I I I think that we do have to do some picking and choosing of the stuff that we 're doing . But I I am int I do think that we m minimally want something we might want to look at at some some , subsets of that . Like for a meeting like this , at least , take a Polaroid of the of the of the boards , phd b: Of the board . phd b: Or at least make sure that the note - taker takes a sh you know , a snapshot of the board . professor d: a and know the position of the people phd b: That 'll make it a lot easier for meetings that are structured . phd b: otherwise later on if nobody wrote this stuff on the board down we 'd have a harder time summarizing it or agreeing on a summary .  , this is shared knowledge among all the participants , and it 's a shame to keep it off the recording . grad g: except in postdoc h: s grad g: er , if we weren't recording this , this this would get lost .  , I just think that the grad g: The point is that we 're not saving it anyway . postdoc h: Well professor a: What do you mean we 're not saving it anyway ? I 've written all of this down and it 's getting emailed to you . That would be the other alternative , to make sure that anything that was on the board , is in the record . postdoc h: Well professor a: Well , that 's why that 's why I 'm saying that I think the note - taking would be I think in many for many meetings there will be some sort of note - taking , in which case , that 's a useful thing to have  , we  , we don't need to require it . professor a: so so we won't worry about requiring these things , but the more things that we can get it for , the more useful it will be for various applications . professor d: So So , departing for the moment from the data collection question but actually talking about , you know , this group and what we actually want to do , so I guess that 's th the way what you were figuring on doing was was was , putting together some notes and sending them to to everybody from from today ? OK . professor d: So so the question that that we started with was whether there was anything else we should do during during th during the collection . professor d: And I guess the CrossPads was certainly one idea , and we 'll get them from him and we 'll just do that . Right ? And then the next thing we talked about was the was the summaries and are we gonna do anything about that . professor a: So , if I 'm collecting data then there is this question of do I use CrossPads ? professor d: Yeah . professor a: So , I think that if we really seriously have me collect data and I can't use CrossPads , it 's probably less useful for you guys to go to the trouble of using it , unless you think that the CrossPads are gonna n I 'm not I 'm not sure what they 're gonna do . But but having a small percentage of the data with it , I 'm not sure whether that 's useful or not . professor d: I guess the point was to try again , to try to collect more information that could be useful later for for the UI stuff . professor d: So it 's sort of Landay supplying it so that Landay 's stuff can be easier to do . professor d: So it it Right now he 's g operating from zero , professor a: Nothing . professor d: and so even if we didn't get it done from UW , it seems like that would could still You shou professor a: OK . phd b: I think it 'd be useful to have a small amount of it just as a proof of concept . grad g: And and they seem to not be able to give enough of them away , so we could probably get more as well . So if it if it seems to be really useful to you guys , we could probably get a donation to me . I think it it it will again depend on Landay , and if he has a student who 's interested , and how much infrastructure we 'll need . grad g: but if it requires a lot of our time , we probably won't do it . professor d: I guess a lot of the stuff we 're doing now really is pilot in one sense or another . That if if people have something in front of them phd b: I 'd be sort of cool . So , I j I think we should just say this is not we don't want to put any extra burden on people , but if they happen to generate minutes , could could they send it to us ? grad g: Yeah . What I was gonna say is that I don't want to ask people to do something they wouldn't normally do in a meeting . professor d: So who who does this summarization ? postdoc h: Yeah , I 'm thinking that grad g: People in the meeting . grad g: You know , just at at the end of the meeting , before you go , postdoc h:  - huh . phd e: People with radio mikes can go into separate rooms and continue recording without hearing each other . phd b: Well , then you should try them a few weeks later postdoc h: How fascinating . phd b: and They have all these memory experiments about how little you actually retain grad g: And see score them ? phd e: That 's right . phd b: and wasn't phd e: If we do if we collect four different summaries , you know , we 're gonna get all this weird data about how people perceive things differently . professor a: But but again , like the CrossPads , I don't think I would base a lot of stuff on it , professor d: Ru grad g: I d yeah , I don't know how you would do it , though . professor a: because I think I know when I see the the clock coming near the end of the meeting , I 'm like inching towards the door . grad g: Maybe e Is email easier ? postdoc h: Well , I think if grad g: I when you first said do do it , spoken , what I was thinking is , oh then people have to come up postdoc h:   postdoc h: Yeah , I 'd just try Well , however the least intrusive and and quickest way is , and th and closest to the meeting time too , cuz people will start to forget it as soon as they l leave . But , I don't think that they 'll necessarily you 'll you 'll get many people willing to stay . professor a: But , you know , if you get even one postdoc h: w professor d: Well , I think it 's like the note - taking thing , postdoc h: I would s Yeah . professor d: that that y that you can't certainly can't require it or people aren't gonna want to do this . postdoc h: And I 'm also wondering , couldn't that be included in the data sample so that you could increase the num you know , the words that are , recognized by a particular individual ? If you could include the person 's meeting stuff and also the person 's summary stuff , maybe that would be  , phd e: Yeah . postdoc h: Under the same acoustic circumstance , cuz if they just walk next door with their set - up , nothing 's changed , phd e: Right . postdoc h: just phd f: So I have a question about queries , grad g: God , that 's bugging me . phd f: which is , grad g: Can we turn that light off ? postdoc h: You turn phd f:  grad g: If can we turn that just that that let professor d: The fl the fluorescent light is flickering . grad g: Yeah , there 's a phd b: Oh , it is it is like OK . professor a: That and y Too much caffeine and really tired , grad g: Too much caffeine . phd f: the question I had about queries was , so what we 're planning to do is have people look at the summaries and then generate queries ? Are are we gonna try and o grad g: We we 've just been talking , how do we generate queries ? phd f: Yeah . phd f: so , the question I had is is have we given any thought to how we would generate queries automatically given a summary ?  , I think that 's a whole research topic un unto itself , professor d: Mmm . phd f: n phd b: Shouldn't Landay and his group be in charge of figuring out how to do this ? professor d: Yeah . phd b: They 're the expert phd e: Mari ? professor a: Yeah ? phd e: Someone wants to know when you 're getting picked up . Is someone picking you up ? professor a: what 's our schedule ? professor d: Well , you still wanted to talk with Liz . professor a: Let 's see , you and I need dis  , no , we did the Liz talk . professor a: We need to finish this discussion , and you and I need a little time for wrap - up and quad chart . So , grad g: And what ? professor a:  professor d: I 'm at your disposal . professor a: what what 's the plan for this discussion ? We should professor d: I think we should be able to wind up in another half - hour or something , you think ? grad g: At least . professor a: So , I think phd b: It 's interesting that he 's got , like , this discussion free professor d: Well , we still haven't talked about the action items from here and so on . professor d: And professor a: e e why don't you say five - thirty ? I don't phd e: OK , five - thirty . grad g: Well , in answer to \" is it Landay 's problem ? \" , he doesn't have a student who 's interested right now in doing anything . So I don't think he wants to do information retrieval , query generation , that sort of stuff . professor d: Yeah , well there 's gonna be these student projects that can do some things but it can't be , yeah , very deep . u I I actually think that that , again , just as a bootstrap , if we do have something like summaries , then having the people who are involved in the meetings themselves , who are cooperative and willing to do yet more , come up with with with queries , could at least give give Landay an idea of the kind of things that people might want to know .  , ye Right ? If he doesn't know anything about the area , and the people are talking about and and ,  phd b: But the people will just look at the summaries or the minutes and re and sort of back - generate the queries . phd f: Well , I 'm not sure I 'm not sure that 's a solved problem . phd f: Right ? Of how to how to generate queries from a phd b: How to do this from the summary . phd b: So what you want to h to do is , people who were there , who later see , minutes and s put in summary form , which is not gonna be at the same time as the meeting . phd b: and , like , make up some stuff to which these notes would be an answer , or or a deeper Yeah . phd b: You postdoc h: I 'm also wondering if we could ask the the people a a question which would be \" what was the most interesting thing you got out of this meeting ? \" Becau - in terms of like informativeness , phd b: That 's a good one . postdoc h: it might be , you know , that the summary would would not in even include what the person thought was the most interesting fact . professor a: But actually I would say that 's a better thing to ask than have them summarize the meeting . postdoc h: Because you get , like , the general structure of important points and what the what the meeting was about . postdoc h: So you get the general structure , the important points of what the meeting was about with the summary . But with the \" what 's the most interesting thing you learned ? \"  , so the fact that , I know that Transcriber uses Snack is something that I thought was interesting phd b: Going to see the kids . So , you could ge pick up some of the micro items that wouldn't even occur as major headings professor a:   professor c: Are you thinking about just asking one participant or all of them ? grad g: As many are willing to do it . Cuz you 'll get cuz you 'll get very different answers from everybody , right ? professor c: and then Yeah . phd e: So grad g: Well , maybe one thing we could do is for the meetings we 've already done  , I we didn't take minutes and we don't have summaries . professor a: But actually it would be an easy thing to just go around the room and say what was the most interesting thing you learned , grad g: Mmm . postdoc h: And that I think it would pick up the micro - structure , the some some of the little things that would be hidden . professor d: Boy , I I don't know how we get at this postdoc h: That would be interesting . professor c: Yeah , but when you go around the room you might just get the effect that somebody says something grad g: Or want to get up and leave . professor c: and then you go around the room and they say \" yeah , me too , I agree . professor c: So phd e: On the other hand people might try and come up with different ones , right ? professor d: Well phd e: They might say \" oh , I was gonna say that one but now I have to think of something else \" . grad g: Well , you have the other thing , that that they know why we 're doing it . We 'll  , we 'll we 'll be telling them that the reason we 're trying to do this is is to d generate queries in the future , so try to pick things that other people didn't say .  , It seemed The kind of , interest that I had in this thing initially was , that i basically the form that you 're doing something else later , professor a:   So it 's really the imp the the list of what 's important 's in the something else professor a: Right . professor d: in fact if if it was really major , if it 's the thing that really stuck in your head , then you might not need to go back and and and check on it even . So it 's it 's that you 're trying to find You 're you 've now You weren't interested Say I I said \" well , I wasn't that much interested in dialogue , I 'm more of an acoustics person \" . professor d: But but thr three months from now if for some reason I get really interested in dialogue , and I 'm \" well what is what was that part that that that , Mari was saying ? \" grad g: Yeah , like Jim Bass says \" add a few lines on dialogue in your next perf \" professor a:  professor d: Yeah . professor d: And then I 'm trying to fi  , that 's that 's when I look in general when I look things up most , is when it 's something that didn't really stick in my head the first time around and but for some new reason I 'm I 'm I 'm interested in in in the old stuff . professor a: Well , I That 's hard to generate professor d: So , I don't I don't know . phd f: Do we professor a: and and I think that 's half of what i I would use it for . But I also a lot of times  , make you know , think to myself \" this is interesting , professor d:   professor a: So , things that I think are interesting , I would be , wanting to do a query about . And also , I like the idea of going around the room , because if somebody else thought something was interesting , I 'd kind of want to know about it and then I 'd want to follow up on it . That that might get at some of what I was I was concerned about , being interested in something later that w  , I didn't consider to be important the first time , which for me is actually the dominant thing , because if I thought it was really important it tends to stick more than if I didn't , but some new task comes along that makes me want to look up . grad g: But But what 's interesting to me may not b have been interesting to you . grad g: Yeah , I I think you can't get at all of it , professor d: Yeah . phd f: The question the question then is h h how much bias do we introduce by you know , introduce by saying , you know , this was important now and , you know , maybe tha something else is important later ? professor d:   But postdoc h: Well , and and one thing , we we 're saying \" important \" and we 're saying \" interesting \" . But I I I guess that 's the question , really , is that  , postdoc h:   professor d: W phd f: does building queries based on what 's important now introduce an irreversible bias on being able to do what Morgan wants to do later ? professor d: Well , irreversible . phd f: That 's that 's professor d: I I  , I guess what I what I I keep coming back to in my own mind is that , the soonest we can do it , we need to get up some kind of system postdoc h: Yeah . professor d: so that people who 've been involved in the meeting can go back later , even if it 's a poor system in some ways , and ,  and ask the questions that they actually want to know . If you know , if  , as soon as we can get that going at any kind of level , then I think we 'll have a much better handle on what kind of questions people want to ask than in any anything we do before that . postdoc h: I will say that that I I chose \" interesting \" because I think it includes also \" important \" in some cases . postdoc h: Well , and and also i it puts a lot of burden on the person to to evaluate . You know , I think inter \" interesting \" is is non - threatening in professor a: OK - OK . professor a: In the interest of , grad g: Importance ? postdoc h: Yeah . professor a: No , i in the interest of generating some minutes here , and also moving on to action items and other things , let me just go through the things that I wrote down as being important , that we at least decided on . CrossPads we were going to try , if Landay can get the ,  get them to to you guys , and see if they 're interesting . professor a: getting just , digital pictures a couple digital pictures of the the table and boards to set the context of the meeting .  , and then going around the room at the end to just say qu ask people to mention something interesting that they learned . So rather than say the most interesting thing , something interesting , postdoc h: k professor a: and that way you 'll get more variety . \" And then the last thing c would be for those people who are willing to stay afterwards and give an oral summary . professor a: OK ? Does that pretty much cover everything we talked about ? That well , that we want to do ? postdoc h:   grad g: Yeah , that 's like n I think that 's gonna predominantly end up being whoever takes down the equipment then . postdoc h: And and that would also be that the data would be included in the database . phd e: there is still this hope that people might actually think of real queries they really want to ask at some point . phd e: And that if if that ever should happen , then we should try and write them down . grad g: Give them a reward , a dollar a query ? phd e: Yeah , really . So professor d: Well , and again , if we can figure out a way to jimmy a a a a very rough system , say in a year , then  , so that in the second and third years we we actually have something to postdoc h: Yeah .  , the level of the query could be , you know , very low - level or very high - level . And it gets fuzzier and fuzzier as you go up , right ? grad g: Well , we 're gonna phd b: So you need to have some sort of if you start working with queries , some way of identifying what the you know , if this is something that requires a a one - word answer or it 's one place in the recording versus was there general agreement on this issue of all the people who ha phd e:  . phd b: In fact , they 're very meaningful cuz they 're very high - level . phd b: It But it may well grad g: But professor d: Because  , b because it depends on , what our goal is . grad g: Really ? professor d: If our goal is Wizard of Oz - ish , we might want to know what is it that people would really like to know about this data . professor d: And if it 's if if it 's something that we don't know how to do yet , th great , phd e: Yeah . grad g: Yeah , I was thinking about Wizard of Oz , but it requires the wizard to know all about the meetings . phd e: Well just imagine if professor d: But but just phd e: Get people to ask questions that they def the machine definitely can't answer at the moment , professor d: Yeah . w Just \" what would you like to know ? \" phd e: but grad g: Yep . postdoc h: I I was wondering if if there might be one s more source of queries which is indicator phrases like \" action item \" , professor a: OK . postdoc h: Yeah , that 's something to be determined , something to be specified , phd b: Well , probably if you have to sit there at the end of a meeting and say one thing you remember , it 's probably whatever action item was assigned to you . phd b: So , in general , that could be something you could say , right ? I 'm supposed to do this . Well , but then you could you could prompt them to say , you know , \" other than your action item \" , you know , whatever . phd e: Well postdoc h: But but the action item would be a way to get , maybe an additional query . Well , but you know , but you could get again @ @ professor a: Well , we 're piloting . professor a: or maybe we should wait until the summary of this until this meeting is transcribed and then we will hav professor d: We we had  , phd e: Yeah . professor d: somewhere up there we had milestones , but I guess Did y did you get enough milestone , from the description things ? professor a: I got Yeah . In fact , why don't you hand me those transparencies so that I remember to take them . professor d: And , you know , there 's obviously detail behind each of those , as much as is needed . What I have down for action items is we 're supposed to find out about our human subject , requirements . professor a: people are supposed to send me U R for their for web pages , to c and I 'll put together an overall cover . We professor a:  ? phd e: we need to look at our web page professor a: And and you also need to look at your web page phd e: and make one that 's that 's p professor a: and clean it up by mid - July . And so ,  professor a: How about if I just c  , Right now all I want I personally only want text data . I think the only thing Jeff would do anything with right now But I 'm just speaking fr based on a conversation with him two weeks ago I had in Turkey . professor d: Wh postdoc h: You could email to both of us , just  , if you wanted to . postdoc h: I don't think either of us would mind recei professor a: OK . postdoc h: but but in any case I 'd be happy to send you the professor a: And your email is ? professor d: i postdoc h: Edwards at ICSI . professor a: And then professor d: In in our phone call , before , we we ,  It turns out the way we 're gonna send the data is by , And ,  and then what they 're gonna do is take the CD - ROM and transfer it to analog tape and give it to a transcription service , that will grad g: Oh , is this IBM ? professor d: Yeah . postdoc h: Yeah , using foot pedals professor d: Yeah , foot foot pedals postdoc h: and professor d: and grad g: so do they How are they gonna do the multi - channel ? professor d: See , that 's a good question . professor d: probably about like you did , grad g: Mix ? professor d: and then there will be some things you know , many things that don't work out well . And that 'll go back to IBM and they 'll they 'll ,  they run their aligner on it and it kicks out things that don't work well , which you know , the overlaps will certainly be examples of that . professor d: We 'll give them all the the multi - channel stuff grad g: So we 'll give them all sixteen channels professor d: and grad g: and they 'll do whatever they want with it . phd b: But you also should probably give them the mixed You know , equal sound - level professor d: Yeah . professor d: It 's also won't be adding much to the data to give them the mixed . phd f: But w phd b: I phd f: It 's not professor a: Right . phd b: You should that may be all that they want to send off to their transcribers . Related to to the conversation with Picheny , I need to email him , my shipping address and you need to email them something which you already did . I I m emailed them the Transcriber URL , the on - line , data that Adam set up , The URL so they can click on an utterance and hear it . And I was gonna m email them the which I haven't yet , a pointer to to the web pages that we that we currently have , cuz in particular they want to see the one with the the way the recording room is set up postdoc h: Good . grad g: And then p possibly postdoc h: I C - I CC ' ed Morgan . grad g: Not an immediate action item but something we do have to worry about is data formats for for higher - level information . We were gonna grad g: Well , or d or not even higher level , different level , prosody and all that sort of stuff . professor a: That 's postdoc h: Well ,  professor a: W My my u feeling right now on format is you guys have been doing all the work phd e: Well  , yeah . So , what n important thing professor a: but Cuz I 'm not actually touching the data , postdoc h: Well , it c phd e: Right . professor d: So a key thing will be that you we tell you postdoc h: Great . phd f: and \" professor d: We also had the ,  that we were s  , that you were gonna get us the eight - hundred number professor a: Oh , yeah . professor d: and we 're all gonna we 're gonna call up your Communicator thing and and we 're gonna be good slash bad , depending on how you define it , users . professor c: Now , something that I mentioned earlier to Mari and Liz is that it 's probably important to get as many non - technical and non - speech people as possible in order to get some realistic users . Cuz we don't want people who already know how to deal with dialogue systems , professor a: Yeah . Or , like if you have a professor c: who know that you shouldn't hyper - articulate , for instance , and things like that . professor a: Or , like if you have somebody who makes your your plane reservations for you , professor c: So . e You know , it could result in some good bloopers , which is always good for presentations . professor d: My mother would have a very interesting conversation with it grad g: He would never use it . So I have the professor d: We talked about that we 're getting the recording equipment running at UW . And so it depends , w e e e they 're you know , they 're p m If that comes together within the next month , there at least will be , major communications between Dan and UW folks phd e: Yeah .  , professor a: I 'm I 'm shooting to try to get it done get it put together by the beginning of August . professor d: as to phd e: we should talk about it , but postdoc h: Mmm . professor a: So , you know , if professor d: But we have it it 's it 's pretty We don't know .  , he he s  , he said that it was sitting in some room collecting dust professor a: We don't know . professor d: and and so we don't know , professor a: i It 's probably unlikely that we 'll pull this off , professor d: i e professor a: but a at least it 's worth trying .  , and I will email these notes  , I 'm not sure what to do about action items for the data stuff , although , then somebody I guess somebody needs to tell Landay that you want the pads . professor d: and he also said something about outside there that came up about the outside text sources , that he he may have grad g:   professor a: Oh ! professor d: some text sources that are close enough to the sort of thing that we can play with them for a language model . phd e: Yeah , that was  , that was What he was saying was this he this thing that , Jason had been working on finds web pages that are thematically related to what you 're talking about . But it 's p it might be phd e: so professor a: But but that 's actually what I wanna do . grad g: Un - unfortunately Landay told me that Jason is not gonna be working on that anymore . He seemed when I asked him if he could actually supply data , he seemed a little bit more reluctant . If I don't get something grad g: Who ? Landay or Jason ? professor a: Landay . professor a: you know , otherwise , if you guys have any papers or I could I could use ,  I could use your web pages . You 've got all the web pages on the Meeting Recor professor d: Yeah , why search for them ? professor a: Yeah ! professor d: They 're we know where they are . professor d: There 's there 's some , Carnegie Mellon stuff , right ? On on meeting recording , grad g: Yep . professor a: So , there 's there 's ICSI , Xerox , professor d: and phd b: And there 's You should l look under , like , intelligent environments , professor d: And Xerox . phd b: smart rooms , grad g: the \" Georgia Tech Classroom Two Thousand \" is a good one . J There 's th That 's where I thought you would want to eventually be able to have a board or a camera , professor a:   phd b: because of all these classroom grad g: Well , Georgia Tech did a very elaborate instrumented room . I think that 's good enou that 's that 's pretty much all I can think of . postdoc h: Can I ask , one thing ? It relates to data data collection and I and I 'd and we mentioned earlier today , this question of  , so , I s I know that from with the near - field mikes some of the problems that come with overlapping speech , are lessened . But I wonder if  , is that sufficient or should we consider maybe getting some data gathered in such a way that , u w we would c  , p have a meeting with less overlap than would otherwise be the case ? So either by rules of participation , or whatever . postdoc h: Now , you know , it 's true , we were discussing this earlier , that depending on the task so if you 've got someone giving a report you 're not gonna have as much overlap . phd f: Adam ! postdoc h: But , i i  , so we 're gonna have s you know , non - overlapping samples anyway . But , in a meeting which would otherwise be highly overlapping , is the near - field mike enough or should we have some rules of participation for some of our samples to lessen the overlap ? professor d:  . phd e: turn off professor a: I don't think we should have rules of participation , but I think we should try to get a variety of meetings . That 's something that if we get the the meeting stuff going at UW , that I probably can do more than you guys , postdoc h: OK . Just want to be sure there 's enough data to professor a: phd b: They 're still gonna overlap , postdoc h: OK , good . phd b: but Mark and others have said that there 's quite a lot of found data from the discourse community that has this characteristic and also the political Y you know , anything that was televised for a third party has the characteristic of not very much overlap . professor d: Wasn - but w I think we were saying before also that the natural language group here had less overlap . postdoc h: because you know , it is true people can modify the amount of overlap that they do if if they 're asked to . postdoc h: Not not entirely modify it , but lessen it if if it 's desired . But if if that 's sufficient data I just wanted to be sure that we will not be having a lot of data which can't be processed . So I 'm just writing here , we 're not gonna try to specify rules of interaction but we 're gonna try to get more variety by i using different groups of people postdoc h: Time . And I you know , I I know that the near f near - field mikes will take care of also the problems to s to a certain degree . professor a: Cuz if I recorded some administrative meetings then that may have less overlap , because you might have more overlap when you 're doing something technical and disagreeing or whatever . Well , I just as as as a contributary eh , so I I know that in l in legal depositions people are pr are prevented from overlapping . They 'll just say , you know you know , \" wait till each person is finished before you say something \" . professor a: Well , the reason why I didn't want to is be why I personally didn't want to is because I wanted it to be as , unintrusive as possi postdoc h:   I just want to be sure we don't that we 're able to process , i u  , you know , as much data as we can . Did they discuss any of that in the the meeting they had with L Liberman ? phd b:   professor d: What phd b: And there was a big division , professor d: What what do they phd b: so Liberman and others were interested in a lot of found data . phd b: So there 's lots of recordings that They 're not close - talk mike , professor d: Yeah . phd b: but And and there 's lots of television , you know , stuff on , political debates and things like that , congre congressional hearings .  , and then the CMU folks and I were sort of on the other side in cuz they had collected a lot of meetings that were sort of like this and said that those are nothing like these meetings . And , I guess we just left it as @ @ that if there 's found data that can be transformed for use in speech recognition easily , then of course we would do it , professor d:   Is that is that going to be publicly available , phd b: As far as I know , they h have not . grad g: It 's also it 's not it 's not near - far , right ? phd b: I 'm not sure .  , if people were interested they could talk to them , but I I got the feeling there was some politics involved . grad g: Cuz I had thought they 'd only done far - field , phd b: I think you need to talk to Waibel and grad g: intelligent - room sorts of things . phd b: But they had multiple mikes and they did do recognition , and they did do real conversations . Well , once we send out postdoc h: Yeah , I think professor d: we still haven't sent out the first note saying \" hey , this list exists \" . But but , once we do that professor a: Is that an action item ? professor d: Yeah . We should at least check that everybody here ? grad g: I think everyone here is on the list . grad g: I I added a few people who didn't who I knew had to be on it even though they didn't tell me . grad g: You are on it , aren't you ? postdoc h: Yeah , I am . So \" found data \" , they mean like established corpora of linguistics and and other fields , right ? phd b: What they mean is stuff they don't have to fund to collect , postdoc h: It sounds like such a t phd b: and especially good postdoc h: Yeah , OK . It 's things occur without any You know , the pe these people weren't wearing close - talking mikes , but they were recorded anyway , like the congressional hearings and , you know , for legal purposes or whatever . Of course it 's not \" found \" in the sense that at the time it was collected for the purpose . phd b: But what he means is that You know , Mark was really a fan of getting as much data as possible from you know , reams and reams of stuff , of broadcast stuff , postdoc h: That 's interesting . phd e: We should go around and say something interesting that happened at the meeting ? professor a: Oh . phd b: Rrrh ! grad g: Now , I was already thinking about it , so professor d: Oh ! Good man . phd b: I grad g: So , I really liked the idea of what I thought was interesting was the combination of the CrossPad and the speech . So , can you determine the interesting points by who 's writing ? Can you do special gestures and so on that that have , special meaning to the corpora ? I really liked that . postdoc h: Well , I I just realized there 's another category of interesting things which is that , I I found this discussion very , i this this question of how you get at queries really interesting . And and the and I and the fact that it 's sort of , nebulous , what what that what kind of query it would be because it depends on what your purpose is . So I actually found that whole process of of trying to think of what that would involve to be interesting . I just sort of thought we we went around a nice discussion of the factors involved there , which I thought was worthwhile . grad g: Did you take pictures of the boards ? phd e: Not that I postdoc h: Yeah .  , I will take pictures of them , but postdoc h: That 's a good point . phd f: I 'm gonna pass because I can't  , of the Jane took my answer . But I will say  , I will actually  , a spin on different slightly different spin on what you said , this issue of , realizing that we could take minutes , and that actually may be a goal . So that that may be kind of the test in a sense , test data , the the template of what we want to test against , generating a summary . I think the question of how to generate queries automatically was the most interesting question that came up , and it 's something that , as you said , is a whole research topic in itself , so I don't think we 'll be able to do anything on it because we don't have funding on it , in this project . professor d: Well , being more management lately than than research , I think the thing that impressed me most was the people dynamics and not any of the facts . phd e: How are we gonna find that in the data ? grad g: Well , if we had people wearing the wireless mikes all the time phd e: Oh , yeah . grad g: Yeah , I think phd f: Well , one thing you could search for is were people laughing a lot . phd e: How happy were they ? professor d: I 'd probably search for something like that . postdoc h:  h Do we need do I need to turn something off here , or I do unplug this , or ? professor d: Now these we turn off <doc-sep>grad e: Hello ? professor a: So everybody everybody 's on ? phd d: Today 's professor a: Yeah . professor a: eh e and  I guess Chuck you weren't there either , so the  phd b: I was there . professor a: Oh you were there ? phd b: With Hynek ? professor a: Yeah . professor a: What was the w what was the downsampling problem again ? phd c: So we had professor a: I forget . phd c: So the fact that there there is no  low - pass filtering before the downsampling . phd c: There is because there is LDA filtering but that 's perhaps not  the best w m professor a: Depends what it 's frequency characteristic is , yeah . So we discussed about this , about the  professor a: Was there any conclusion about that ? phd c:  \" try it \" . So again this is th this is the downsampling  of the  the feature vector stream phd c:  . professor a: and  Yeah I guess the the  LDA filters they were doing do have   let 's see , so the the the feature vectors are calculated every ten milliseconds so  the question is how far down they are at fifty fifty hertz . Does anybody know what the frequency characteristic is ? phd c: We don't have yet professor a: Oh OK . And the third point  was the  , yeah , the on - line normalization where , well , the recursion f recursion for the mean estimation is a filter with some kind of delay professor a: Yeah . For this , the conclusion of Hynek was , well , \" we can try it but \" professor a:  - huh . professor a: Try try what ? phd c: So try to   take into account the delay of the recursion for the mean estimation . And so while discussing about these these LDA filters , some i issues appeared , like well , the fact that if we look at the frequency response of these filters it 's  , well , we don't know really what 's the important part in the frequency response and there is the fact that in the very low frequency , these filters don't don't really remove a lot .  and that 's probably a reason why , yeah , on - line normalization helps because it it , professor a: Right . Yeah , but perhaps everything could should be could be in the filter ,  the the mean normalization and Yeah . phd c: And this was this LDA  tuning perhaps and Hynek proposed again to his  TRAPS , so . phd c: Yeah , professor a:  I g I guess the key thing for me is is figuring out how to better coordinate between the two sides phd c:  . professor a:  I was talking with Hynek about it later and the the sort of had the sense sort of that that neither group of people wanted to to bother the other group too much . And and I don't think anybody is , you know , closed in in their thinking or are unwilling to talk about things but I think that you were sort of waiting for them to tell you that they had something for you and and that and expected that they would do certain things and they were sor they didn't wanna bother you phd c:   professor a: and they were sort of waiting for you and and and  we ended up with this thing where they they were filling up all of the possible latency themselves , and they just had hadn't thought of that .  it 's true that maybe maybe no one really thought about that that this latency thing would be such a a strict issue phd c: Yeah . Well professor a: in in  the other phd c: Yeah I don't know what happened really , but professor a: Yeah . Because , well , we discussed about that about this problem and they told us \" well , we will do all that 's possible to have enough space for a network \" but then , yeah , perhaps they were too short with the time and professor a: Then they couldn't . Well maybe we should just   you 're you 're bus other than that you folks are busy doing all the all the things that you 're trying that we talked about before right ? And this machines are busy and you 're busy phd c: Yeah . professor a: Let 's let 's , I think that as as we said before that one of the things that we 're imagining is that  there there will be  in the system we end up with there 'll be something to explicitly   do something about noise phd c:   professor a: in addition to the  other things that we 're talking about and that 's probably the best thing to do . And there was that one email that said that it sounded like   things looked very promising up there in terms of  I think they were using Ericsson 's approach or something and in addition to They 're doing some noise removal thing , right ? phd c: Yeah , yeah . phd c: And phd d: Yeah , I modified it well , modifying I studied Barry 's sim code , more or less . and we have some the feature for Italian database and we will try with this feature with the filter to find the result . phd d: and maybe try another type of spectral subtraction , I don't professor a: When you say you don't have a result yet you mean it 's it 's just that it 's in process or that you it finished and it didn't get a good result ? phd d: No . No , no n we have n we have do the experiment only have the feature the feature but the experiment have phd c: Yeah . So  I suggest actually now we we we sorta move on and and hear what 's what 's what 's happening in in other areas like what 's what 's happening with your investigations about echos and so on . grad f: Oh  Well  I haven't started writing the test yet , I 'm meeting with Adam today professor a:   grad f:  and he 's going t show me the scripts he has for  running recognition on mee Meeting Recorder digits . grad f:  I also  haven't got the code yet , I haven't asked Hynek for for the for his code yet . Cuz I looked at  Avendano 's thesis and I don't really understand what he 's doing yet but it it it sounded like  the channel normalization part  of his thesis  was done in a a bit of I don't know what the word is , a a bit of a rough way  it sounded like he  he he it it wasn't really fleshed out and maybe he did something that was interesting for the test situation but I I 'm not sure if it 's what I 'd wanna use so I have to I have to read it more , I don't really understand what he 's doing yet . Yeah I haven't read it in a while so I 'm not gonna be too much help unless I read it again , phd d: It 's my phd c: Oh yeah ? phd d: I know this is mine here . The  so you , and then you 're also gonna be doing this echo cancelling between the the close mounted and the and the the the what we 're calling a cheating experiment  of sorts between the distant grad f:  I I 'm ho Right . grad f: I I think he 's at least planning to do it for the cl close - mike cross - talk and so maybe I can just take whatever setup he has and use it . Yeah actually  he should  I wonder who else is I think maybe it 's Dan Ellis is going to be doing  a different cancellation . One of the things that people working in the meeting task wanna get at is they would like to have cleaner close - miked recordings . So  this is especially true for the lapel but even for the close close - miked  cases  we 'd like to be able to have  other sounds from other people and so forth removed from So when someone isn't speaking you 'd like the part where they 're not speaking to actually be So what they 're talking about doing is using ec  echo cancellation - like techniques . It 's not really echo but  just   taking the input from other mikes and using   a  an adaptive filtering approach to remove the effect of that  other speech .  what was it , there was there was some some some point where eh  Eric or somebody was was speaking and he had lots of silence in his channel and I was saying something to somebody else  which was in the background and it was not it was recognizing my words , which were the background speech on the close close mike . phd b: Yeah that was actually my I was wearing the I was wearing the lapel and you were sitting next to me , professor a: Oh you it was you I was Yeah . phd b: and I only said one thing but you were talking and it was picking up all your words . So I think I think Dan Ellis or somebody who was working with him was going to  work on that . And  I don't know if we 've talked lately about the the plans you 're developing that we talked about this morning  I don't remember if we talked about that last week or not , but maybe just a quick reprise of of what we were saying this morning . So continuing to  extend phd b: What about the stuff that  Mirjam has been doing ? And and S Shawn , yeah . professor a: But that 's   all that 's is a a certainly relevant  study and , you know , what are the features that they 're finding . professor a:  what are the variables , what we 're calling this one , what are the variables that they 're found finding useful phd c:  . professor a:  for phd b: And their their targets are based on canonical mappings of phones to acoustic f features . And that 's certainly one thing to do and we 're gonna try and do something more f more fine than that but   so  So I guess you know what , I was trying to remember some of the things we were saying , do you ha still have that ? Yeah . professor a: There 's those that  yeah , some of some of the issues we were talking about was in j just getting a good handle on on  what \" good features \" are and phd b: What does what did  Larry Saul use for it was the sonorant  detector , right ? How did he H how did he do that ? Wh - what was his detector ?   professor a: And the other thing you were talking about is is is where we get the targets from . So  , there 's these issues of what are the what are the variables that you use and do you combine them using the soft \" AND - OR \" or you do something , you know , more complicated  and then the other thing was so where do you get the targets from ? The initial thing is just the obvious that we 're discussing is starting up with phone labels from somewhere and then  doing the transformation . But then the other thing is to do something better and eh w why don't you tell us again about this this database ? This is the phd b:  ! professor a: And then tell them to talk naturally ? Yeah , yeah . professor a: Maybe you could go to these parlors and and you could , you know you know have have , you know , reduced rates if you if you can do the measurements . You could what you could do is you could sell little rings and stuff with embedded you know , transmitters in them and things professor a: Yeah . phd b:  ! There 's a bunch of data that l around , that people have done studies like that w way way back right ?  I can't remember where  Wisconsin or someplace that used to have a big database of Yeah . I remember there was this guy at A T - andT , Randolph ? or r What was his name ? Do you remember that guy ?  , researcher at A T - andT a while back that was studying , trying to do speech recognition from these kinds of features . professor a: Do you mean eh but you  Mar phd c: Well he was the guy the guy that was using professor a: you mean when was was Mark Randolph there , or ? phd b: Mark Randolph . phd c: Is it the guy that was using the pattern of pressure on the tongue or ? phd b: I can't remember exactly what he was using , now . But I know I just remember it had to do with you know  positional parameters phd c: What Yeah . So the only the only  hesitation I had about it since ,  I haven't see the data is it sounds like it 's it 's continuous variables and a bunch of them . professor a: I don't know how complicated it is to go from there What you really want are these binary labels , and just a few of them . And maybe there 's a trivial mapping if you wanna do it and it 's e but it I I I worry a little bit that this is a research project in itself , whereas  if you did something instead that like  having some manual annotation by  you know , linguistics students , this would there 'd be a limited s set of things that you could do a as per our discussions with with John before phd b:   professor a: but the things that you could do , like nasality and voicing and a couple other things you probably could do reasonably well .  the other thing you could do is boot trying to to  get those binary variables and take the continuous variables from  the   the data itself there , but I I 'm not sure phd b: Could you cluster the just do some kind of clustering ? professor a: Guess you could , yeah . So anyway that 's that 's  that 's another whole direction that cou could be looked at .  in general it 's gonna be for new data that you look at , it 's gonna be hidden variable because we 're not gonna get everybody sitting in these meetings to wear the pellets and  . phd b: So you 're talking about using that data to get  instead of using canonical mappings of phones . phd b: So you 'd use that data to give you sort of what the the true mappings are for each phone ? grad e:   So wh yeah , where this fits into the rest in in my mind , I guess , is that  we 're looking at different ways that we can combine  different kinds of of rep front - end representations  in order to get robustness under difficult or even , you know , typical conditions . And part of it , this robustness , seems to come from  multi - stream or multi - band sorts of things and Saul seems to have a reasonable way of looking at it , at least for one one  articulatory feature . The question is is can we learn from that to change some of the other methods we have , since  , one of the things that 's nice about what he had I thought was that that it it  the decision about how strongly to train the different pieces is based on  a a reasonable criterion with hidden variables rather than  just assuming that you should train e e every detector  with equal strength towards  it being this phone or that phone . It 's a soft \" AND \" , I guess but in in principle you you wanna get a strong concurrence of all the different things that indicate something and then he \" OR 's \" across the different soft \" OR 's \" across the different  multi - band channels . And  the weight yeah , the target for the training of the \" AND \" \" AND ' ed \" things is something that 's kept  as a hidden variable , and is learned with EM . Whereas what we were doing is is  taking the phone target and then just back propagating from that phd b: So he doesn't have professor a: which means that it 's it 's  i It could be for instance that for a particular point in the data you don't want to   train a particular band train the detectors for a particular band . You you wanna ignore that band , cuz that 's a Ban - band is a noisy noisy measure . professor a: And we don't We 're we 're still gonna try to train it up . In our scheme we 're gonna try to train it up to do as well well as it can at predicting . phd b: So he doesn't have to have truth marks or Ho grad e: F right , and  he doesn't have to have hard labels . professor a: Well at the at the tail end , yeah , he has to know what 's where it 's sonorant . But he 's but what he 's - but what he 's not training up  what he doesn't depend on as truth is grad e: Right . professor a:  I guess one way of describing would be if if a sound is sonorant is it sonorant in this band ? Is it sonorant in that band ? grad e: Right . professor a: Is it sonorant in that band ? i It 's hard to even answer that what you really mean is that the whole sound is sonorant . professor a: then it comes down to , you know , to what extent should you make use of information from particular band towards making your decision . And   we 're making in a sense sort of this hard decision that you should you should use everything  with with  equal strength . professor a: And  because in the ideal case we would be going for posterior probabilities , if we had  enough data to really get posterior probabilities and if the if we also had enough data so that it was representative of the test data then we would in fact be doing the right thing to train everything as hard as we can . But  this is something that 's more built up along an idea of robustness from from the beginning and so you don't necessarily want to train everything up towards the phd b: So where did he get his  his tar his  high - level targets about what 's sonorant and what 's not ? grad e: From  canonical mappings  at first phd b: OK . grad e: and then it 's unclear  eh phd b: Using TIMIT ? or using grad e: using TIMIT phd b:  - huh .  we ha we have a kind of iterative training because we do this embedded Viterbi ,  so there is some something that 's suggested , based on the data but it 's it 's not I think it s doesn't seem like it 's quite the same , cuz of this cuz then whatever that alignment is , it 's that for all all bands . professor a: Well no , that 's not quite right , we did actually do them separate tried to do them separately so that would be a little more like what he did . But it 's still not quite the same because then it 's it 's  setting targets based on where you would say the sound begins in a particular band . Might be closer I guess if we did a soft soft target   embedded neural net training like we 've done a few times  f the forward  do the forward calculations to get the gammas and train on those .  what 's next ? phd b: I could say a little bit about w stuff I 've been playing with . You 're playing ? phd b: I  Huh ? professor a: You 're playing ? phd b: Yes , I 'm playing .  so I wanted to do this experiment to see   what happens if we try to  improve the performance of the back - end recognizer for the Aurora task and see how that affects things . And so I had this  I think I sent around last week a this plan I had for an experiment , this matrix where I would take the  the original  the original system . So there 's the original system trained on the mel cepstral features and then com and then  optimize the b HTK system and run that again . So look at the difference there and then  do the same thing for the ICSI - OGI front - end . professor a: What which test set was this ? phd b: This is that I looked at ? professor a:   phd b: So as far as I 've gotten is I 've  been able to go through from beginning to end the  full HTK system for the Italian data and got the same results that  that  Stephane had . So  I started looking to and now I 'm I 'm sort of lookin at the point where I wanna know what should I change in the HTK back - end in order to try to  to improve it . One of the first things I thought of was the fact that they use the same number of states for all of the models professor a:   phd b: and so I went on - line and I  found a pronunciation dictionary for Italian digits professor a:   phd b: and just looked at , you know , the number of phones in each one of the digits .  you know , sort of the canonical way of setting up a an  system is that you use  three states per phone and  so then the the total number of states for a word would just be , you know , the number of phones times three . And so when I did that for the Italian digits , I got a number of states , ranging on the low end from nine to the high end , eighteen . Now you have to really add two to that because in HTK there 's an initial null and a final null so when they use  models that have eighteen states , there 're really sixteen states . And so  their guess of eighteen states seems to be pretty well matched to the two longest words of the Italian digits , the four and five which  , according to my , you know , sort of off the cuff calculation , should have eighteen states each . So my guess  And then if you I I printed out a confusion matrix   for the well - matched case , and it turns out that the longest words are actually the ones that do the best . So my guess about what 's happening is that you know , if you assume a fixed the same amount of training data for each of these digits and a fixed length model for all of them but the actual words for some of them are half as long you really  have , you know , half as much training data for those models . Because if you have a long word and you 're training it to eighteen states ,  you 've got you know , you 've got the same number of Gaussians , you 've gotta train in each case , professor a:   phd b: but for the shorter words , you know , the total number of frames is actually half as many . phd b: So it could be that , you know , for the short words there 's because you have so many states , you just don't have enough data to train all those Gaussians . So  I 'm going to try to  create more word - specific   prototype H M Ms to start training from . professor a: Yeah , it 's not at all uncommon you do worse on long word on short words than long words anyway just because you 're accumulating more evidence for the for the longer word , phd b:   phd b: Yeah so I 'll I 'll , the next experiment I 'm gonna try is to just  you know create  models that seem to be more w matched to my guess about how long they should be . phd b: And as part of that  I wanted to see sort of how the  how these models were coming out , you know , what w when we train up  th you know , the model for \" one \" , which wants to have nine states , you know , what is the  what do the transition probabilities look like in the self - loops , look like in in those models ? And so I talked to Andreas and he explained to me how you can calculate the expected duration of an  just by looking at the transition matrix professor a:   phd b: and so I wrote a little Matlab script that calculates that and so I 'm gonna sort of print those out for each of the words to see what 's happening , you know , how these models are training up , professor a:   I d I did quickly , I did the silence model and and  that 's coming out with about one point two seconds as its average duration and the silence model 's the one that 's used at the beginning and the end of each of the string of digits . And so the S P model , which is what they put in between digits , I I haven't calculated that for that one yet , but  . So they basically their their model for a whole digit string is silence digit , SP , digit , SP blah - blah - blah and then silence at the end . professor a: Are the SP 's optional ?  skip them ? phd b: I have to look at that , but I 'm not sure that they are . Now the one thing about the S P model is really it only has a single s emitting state to it . phd b: So if it 's not optional , you know , it 's it 's not gonna hurt a whole lot professor a: I see . phd b: and it 's tied to the center state of the silence model so it 's not its own  It doesn't require its own training data , professor a:   phd b: So it , it 's pretty good the way that they have it set up , but  i So I wanna play with that a little bit more . I 'm curious about looking at , you know how these models have trained and looking at the expected durations of the models and I wanna compare that in the the well - matched case f to the unmatched case , and see if you can get an idea of just from looking at the durations of these models , you know , what what 's happening . professor a: Yeah , I think that  , as much as you can , it 's good to d sort of not do anything really tricky . professor a: Not do anything that 's really finely tuned , but just sort of eh you know you t you i z phd b: Yeah . professor a: The premise is kind of you have a a good person look at this for a few weeks and what do you come up with ? phd b:   professor a: And  phd b: And Hynek , when I wa told him about this , he had an interesting point , and that was th  the the final models that they end up training up have I think probably something on the order of six Gaussians per state . And Hynek was saying that well , probably in a real application , you wouldn't have enough compute to handle models that are very big or complicated . But you know , it depends on what the actual application is and it 's really hard to know what your limits are in terms of how many Gaussians you can have . professor a: I I I what I thought you were gonna say i but which I was thinking was  where did six come from ? Probably came from the same place eighteen came from . professor a:  that 's another parameter , right ? that that maybe , you know ,  you really want three or nine or phd b: Yeah , yeah . Well one thing  , if I if if I start  reducing the number of states for some of these shorter models that 's gonna reduce the total number of Gaussians . professor a: how much better can you make it ? And  since they 're only simple things there 's nothing that you 're gonna do that is going to blow up the amount of computation phd b:   professor a: if you found that nine was better than six that would be O K , I think , actually . I really wasn't even gonna play with that part of the system yet , professor a:  -  , OK . phd b: I was just gonna change the the t professor a: Yeah , just work with the models , yeah . So  what 's  I guess your plan for You you you guys ' plan for the next next week is just continue on these these same things we 've been talking about for Aurora and phd c: Yeah , I guess we can try to have some kind of new baseline for next week perhaps . And then do other things , play with the spectral subtraction , and retry the MSG and things like that . I think that after all of this   confusion settles down in another some point a little later next year there will be some sort of standard and it 'll get out there and hopefully it 'll have some effect from something that that has  been done by our group of people but  e even if it doesn't there 's there 's go there 'll be standards after that . phd b: Does anybody know how to  run Matlab sort of in batch mode like you c send it s a bunch of commands to run and it gives you the output . Is it possible to do that ? grad e: I I think  Mike tried it phd b: Yeah ? grad e: and he says it 's impossible so he went to Octave . phd c: What is Octave so ? It 's a free software ? grad e: What 's that ?  , Octave ? phd c: Yeah . phd c: And it does the same syntax and everything eh like Matlab , or ? grad e:  i it 's a little behind , it 's the same syntax but it 's a little behind in that Matlab went to these like  you can have cells and you can you can  implement object - oriented type things with Matlab .  Octave doesn't do that yet , so I think you , Octave is kinda like Matlab  four point something or . phd b: If it 'll do like a lot of the basic matrix and vector stuff grad e: The basic stuff , right <doc-sep>phd e: Ah grad f: Wh - what causes the crash ? phd a: Did you fix something ? phd c: Hello . grad f: Oh , maybe it 's the turning turning off and turning on of the mike , right ? professor b: you think that 's you ? Oh . phd e: Mmm , channel five ? Doesn't work ? professor b: Yeah , that 's the mike number there , mike number five , and channel channel four . So  I also copied  the results that we all got in the mail I think from  from OGI and we 'll go go through them also . phd d: The PLP , the PLP with JRASTA , the MSG , and the MFCC from the baseline Aurora . We 've trained  several neural networks on so on the TI - digits English and on the Italian data and also on the broad  English  French and  Spanish databases . Mmm , so there 's our result tables here , for the tandem approach , and  , actually what we we @ @ observed is that if the network is trained on the task data it works pretty well . Our our  There 's a We 're pausing for a photo phd c: Chicken on the grill . phd a: How about over th from the front of the room ? phd c: Yeah , it 's longer . And  actually we have  , results are similar Only on , phd a: Do you mean if it 's trained only on On data from just that task , phd d: yeah . But actually we didn't train network on  both types of data   phonetically ba phonetically balanced  data and task data . So , professor b: So how  clearly it 's gonna be good then phd a: So what 's th professor b: but the question is how much worse is it if you have broad data ?  , my assump From what I saw from the earlier results ,  I guess last week , was that  , if you trained on one language and tested on another , say , that the results were were relatively poor . professor b: But but the question is if you train on one language but you have a broad coverage and then test in another , does that is that improve things i c in comparison ? phd d: If we use the same language ? professor b: No , no , no . Different lang So  If you train on TI - digits and test on Italian digits , you do poorly , let 's say . professor b: I don't have the numbers in front of me , phd d: But Yeah but I did not  do that . E So , you didn't train on TIMIT and test on on Italian digits , say ? phd d: We No , we did four four kind of of testing , actually . The second test is trained on a single language  with broad database , but the same language as the t task data . The third test is by using ,  the three language database professor b: W which in phd d: and the fourth is professor b: It has three languages . That 's including the w the the phd d: This includes professor b: the one that it 's phd d: Yeah . phd d: Yeah And the fourth test is  excluding from these three languages the language that is the task language . So  for  TI - digits for ins example  when we go from TI - digits training to TIMIT training  we lose  around ten percent ,  . And then when we jump to the multilingual data it 's  it become worse and , well Around  , let 's say , twenty perc twenty percent further . phd d: But the first step is al already removing the task s specific from from phd a: Already , right right right . phd a: So they were sort of building here ? phd d: And we lose phd a: OK ? phd d: Yeah .  So , basically when it 's trained on the the multilingual broad data  or number so , the the ratio of our error rates  with the baseline error rate is around  one point one . professor b: I i if you compare everything to the first case at the baseline , you get something like one point one for the for the using the same language but a different task , and something like one point three for three three languages broad stuff . phd d: Tas - task data professor b: I I I meant something different by baseline phd d: we are u Yeah . professor b: So if we call a factor of w just one , just normalized to one , the word error rate that you have for using TI - digits as as training and TI - digits as test , phd d: Mmm . professor b: If we call that \" one \" , then what you 're saying is that the word error rate for the same language but using  different training data than you 're testing on , say TIMIT and so forth , it 's one point one . professor b: you do go to three languages including the English , it 's something like one point three . professor b: And if you exclude English , from this combination , what 's that ? phd d: If we exclude English ,  there is not much difference with the data with English . So what what it 's saying here is just that \" yes , there is a reduction in performance , when you don't  have the s when you don't have  phd a: Task data . So it 's So when you go to a different task , there 's actually not so different . It 's when you went to these So what 's the difference between two and three ? Between the one point one case and the one point four case ? I 'm confused . The only difference it 's is that it 's multilingual  professor b: Cuz in both in both both of those cases , you don't have the same task . professor b: So is is the training data for the for this one point four case does it include the training data for the one point one case ? phd d:  yeah . professor b: How m how much bigger is it ? phd d:  It 's two times , grad f: Yeah ,  . professor b: So it 's two times , but it includes the but it includes the broad English data . professor b: So you have band - limited TIMIT , gave you  almost as good as a result as using TI - digits on a TI - digits test . OK ? phd d:  ? professor b:  and  But , when you add in more training data but keep the neural net the same size , it  performs worse on the TI - digits . OK , now all of this is This is noisy TI - digits , I assume ? Both training and test ? phd d:  professor b: Yeah . We we we may just need to  So  it 's interesting that h going to a different different task didn't seem to hurt us that much , and going to a different language  It doesn't seem to matter The difference between three and four is not particularly great , so that means that whether you have the language in or not is not such a big deal . professor b: It sounds like   we may need to have more of  things that are similar to a target language or  . You have the same number of parameters in the neural net , you haven't increased the size of the neural net , and maybe there 's just just not enough complexity to it to represent the variab increased variability in the in the training set .  So , what about So these are results with  th that you 're describing now , that they are pretty similar for the different features or or  phd d: let me check . For the PLP with JRASTA the the we This is quite the same tendency , with a slight increase of the error rate ,  if we go to to TIMIT . There there is a difference actually with b between PLP and JRASTA is that JRASTA seems to perform better with the highly mismatched condition but slightly slightly worse for the well matched condition . professor b: I have a suggestion , actually , even though it 'll delay us slightly , would would you mind running into the other room and making copies of this ? Cuz we 're all sort of If we c if we could look at it , while we 're talking , I think it 'd be phd d: Yeah , yeah . professor b: I 'll I 'll sing a song or dance or something while you do it , too . phd a: The  What was Was this number forty or It was roughly the same as this one , he said ? When you had the two language versus the three language ? professor b:  . That 's interesting because it it seems like what it 's saying is not so much that you got hurt  because you  didn't have so much representation of English , because in the other case you don't get hurt any more , at least when it seemed like  it it might simply be a case that you have something that is just much more diverse , phd a:   I wonder were  all three of these nets using the same output ? This multi - language  labelling ? grad f: He was using  sixty - four phonemes from SAMPA . phd a: So this would From this you would say , \" well , it doesn't really matter if we put Finnish into the training of the neural net , if there 's gonna be , you know , Finnish in the test data . \" Right ? professor b: Well , it 's it sounds  , we have to be careful , cuz we haven't gotten a good result yet . professor b: But I I I I think it does suggest that it 's not so much   cross language as cross type of speech . professor b: It 's it 's  But we did Oh yeah , the other thing I was asking him , though , is that I think that in the case Yeah , you you do have to be careful because of com compounded results . I think we got some earlier results in which you trained on one language and tested on another and you didn't have three , but you just had one language . Didn - Wasn't there something of that ? Where you , say , trained on Spanish and tested on on TI - digits , or the other way around ? Something like that ? phd e: No . professor b: This may have been what I was asking before , Stephane , but but , wasn't there something that you did , where you trained on one language and tested on another ?  no no mixture but just grad f: I 'll get it for you . professor b: We 've never just trained on one lang phd d: Training on a single language , you mean , and testing on the other one ? professor b: Yeah . phd d: So the only task that 's similar to this is the training on two languages , and that professor b: But we 've done a bunch of things where we just trained on one language . Either thi this is test with  the same language but from the broad data , or it 's test with  different languages also from the broad data , excluding the So , it 's it 's three or three and four . phd e: The early experiment that phd a: Did you do different languages from digits ? phd d:  . You mean training digits on one language and using the net to recognize on the other ? phd a: Digits on another language ? phd d: No . professor b:  What phd c: These numbers are  ratio to baseline ? professor b: So ,  wha what 's the phd d: So . professor b: This this chart this table that we 're looking at is  , show is all testing for TI - digits , or ? grad f: Bigger is worse . phd d: The upper part is for TI - digits grad f: Yeah , yeah , yeah . phd d: And the first four rows is well - matched , then the s the second group of four rows is mismatched , and finally highly mismatched . professor b: Well , What was is that i What was it that you had done last week when you showed Do you remember ? Wh - when you showed me the your table last week ? phd d: It - It was part of these results . phd a: So where is the baseline for the TI - digits located in here ? phd d: You mean the HTK Aurora baseline ? phd a: Yeah . professor b:   let 's see PLP  with on - line normalization and delta - del so that 's this thing you have circled here in the second column , phd d: Yeah . Actually I I  forgot to say that the multilingual net are trained on  features without the s derivatives  but with increased frame numbers . And we can we can see on the first line of the table that it it it 's slightly slightly worse when we don't use delta but it 's not not that much . What 's MF , MS and ME ? phd a: Multi - French , Multi - Spanish phd d: So . professor b: OK so I think what I 'm what I saw in your smaller chart that I was thinking of was was there were some numbers I saw , I think , that included these multiple languages and it and I was seeing that it got worse . In fact it might have been just this last category , having two languages broad that were where where English was removed . What I we hadn't seen yet was that if you added in the English , it 's still poor . professor b:   now , what 's the noise condition  of the training data phd d: Still poor . The noise condition is the same It 's the same  Aurora noises  , in all these cases for the training . professor b: So there 's not a statistical sta a strong st statistically different noise characteristic between  the training and test phd d: No these are the s s s same noises , professor b: and yet we 're seeing some kind of effect phd d: yeah . At least at least for the first for the well - matched , grad f: Well matched condition . professor b: So there 's some kind of a a an effect from having these  this broader coverage  Now I guess what we should try doing with this is try testing these on u this same sort of thing on you probably must have this lined up to do . So what appears is that perhaps Spanish is not very close to Italian because  , well , when using the the network trained only on Spanish it 's the error rate is almost  twice the baseline error rate . Is there any difference in So it 's in the  So you 're saying that when you train on English and  and and test on phd d: Yeah . professor b: No , you don't have training on English testing phd d: There there is another difference , is that the noise the noises are different . professor b: In in what ? phd d: Well , For for the Italian part  the  the  networks are trained with noise from Aurora TI - digits , phd e: Aurora - two . professor b: Do we have any  test sets  in any other language that  have the same noise as in the Aurora ? phd d: And phd e: Mmm , no . phd a: Can I ask something real quick ? In in the upper part in the English stuff , it looks like the very best number is sixty point nine ? and that 's in the  the third section in the upper part under PLP JRASTA , sort of the middle column ? phd d: Yeah . phd a: So that 's matched training ? Is that what that is ? phd d: It 's no , the third part , so it 's  highly mismatched . phd a: So why do you get your best number in Wouldn't you get your best number in the clean case ? phd c: Well , it 's relative to the  baseline mismatching phd d: Yeah . And then so , in the in the  in the non - mismatched clean case , your best one was under MFCC ? That sixty - one point four ? phd d: Yeah . But , what is  what is currently running , that 's  , i that just filling in the holes here or or ? pretty much ? phd d: no we don't plan to fill the holes professor b: OK . phd d: but actually there is something important , is that  we made a lot of assumption concerning the on - line normalization and we just noticed  recently that  the approach that we were using was not  leading to very good results when we used the straight features to HTK . So basically d if you look at the at the left of the table , the first  row , with eighty - six , one hundred , and forty - three and seventy - five , these are the results we obtained for Italian  with straight mmm , PLP features using on - line normalization . And the , mmm what 's in the table , just at the left of the PLP twelve on - line normalization column , so , the numbers seventy - nine , fifty - four and  forty - two are the results obtained by  Pratibha with  his on - line normalization  her on - line normalization approach . phd a: Where is that ? seventy - nine , fifty professor b: it 's just sort of sitting right on the  the column line . So these are the results of OGI with on - line normalization and straight features to HTK . And the previous result , eighty - six and so on , are with our features straight to HTK . phd d: So what we see that is there is that   the way we were doing this was not correct , but still the networks are very good . professor b: So , do you know what was wrong with the on - line normalization , or ? phd d: Yeah . There were diff there were different things and basically , the first thing is the mmm , alpha  value . I assume that this was not important because  previous results from from Dan and show that basically the both both values g give the same same  results . Actually ,  what we were doing is to start the recursion from the beginning of the utterance . phd d: And Pratibha did something different is that he  she initialed the  values of the mean and variance by computing this on the twenty - five first frames of each utterance . There were other minor differences , the fact that she used fifteen dissities instead s instead of thirteen , and that she used C - zero instead of log energy .  , I changed the code  and now we have a baseline that 's similar to the OGI baseline . phd d: We It it 's slightly  different because I don't exactly initialize the same way she does . Actually I start , mmm , I don't wait to a fifteen twenty - five twenty - five frames before computing a mean and the variance to e to to start the recursion . phd d: I I use the on - line scheme and only start the re recursion after the twenty - five twenty - fifth frame . So  I retrained the networks with these well , the the the networks are retaining with these new features . phd d: So basically what I expect is that these numbers will a little bit go down but perhaps not not so much professor b: Right . It it will learn how to normalize and professor b: OK , but I think that given the pressure of time we probably want to draw because of that especially , we wanna draw some conclusions from this , do some reductions in what we 're looking at , phd d: Yeah . professor b: and make some strong decisions for what we 're gonna do testing on before next week . So do you are you w did you have something going on , on the side , with  multi - band or on on this , phd d: Yeah I professor b: or ? phd d: No , I we plan to start this  so , act actually we have discussed  @ @  , these what we could do more as a as a research and and we were thinking perhaps that  the way we use the tandem is not  , well , there is basically perhaps a flaw in the in the the stuff because we trained the networks If we trained the networks on the on a language and a t or a specific task , professor b:   phd d: what we ask is to the network is to put the bound the decision boundaries somewhere in the space . phd d: And  mmm and ask the network to put one , at one side of the for for a particular phoneme at one side of the boundary decision boundary and one for another phoneme at the other side . And so there is kind of reduction of the information there that 's not correct because if we change task and if the phonemes are not in the same context in the new task , obviously the decision boundaries are not should not be at the same place . professor b: I di phd d: But the way the feature gives The the way the network gives the features is that it reduce completely the it removes completely the information a lot of information from the the features by   placing the decision boundaries at optimal places for one kind of data but this is not the case for another kind of data . professor b: It 's a trade - off , phd d: So professor b: right ? Any - anyway go ahead . So  what we were thinking about is perhaps  one way to solve this problem is increase the number of outputs of the neural networks .  , I I think you could make the same argument , it 'd be just as legitimate , for hybrid systems as well . phd d: Yeah but , we know that professor b: And in fact , th things get better with context dependent versions . professor b: Yeah , but it 's still true that what you 're doing is you 're ignoring you 're you 're coming up with something to represent , whether it 's a distribution , probability distribution or features , you 're coming up with a set of variables that are representing  , things that vary w over context . So , for that reason , when you in in in a hybrid system , when you incorporate context one way or another , you do get better scores . I I 'm I 'm sort of And once you the other thing is that once you represent start representing more and more context it is  much more  specific to a particular task in language . So   , the the acoustics associated with  a particular context , for instance you may have some kinds of contexts that will never occur in one language and will occur frequently in the other , so the qu the issue of getting enough training for a particular kind of context becomes harder . We already actually don't have a huge amount of training data  phd d: Yeah , but mmm , the the way we we do it now is that we have a neural network and basically the net network is trained almost to give binary decisions . professor b: It 's and and it is true that if there 's two phones that are very similar , that  the i it may prefer one but it will give a reasonably high value to the other , too . Yeah , sure but  So basically it 's almost binary decisions and  the idea of using more classes is to get something that 's less binary decisions . Because then you would say that in that this phone in this context is a one , but the same phone in a slightly different context is a zero . phd d: But yeah , but professor b: That would be even even more distinct of a binary decision . phd d: Yeah , but if professor b:  for instance , the the thing I was arguing for before , but again which I don't think we have time to try , is something in which you would modify the code so you could train to have several outputs on and use articulatory features phd d: Mmm . professor b: cuz then that would that would go that would be much broader and cover many different situations . Yeah , but I think Yeah , perhaps you 're right , but you have more classes so you you have more information in your features . phd d: because it 's it 's information that helps to discriminate , professor b:   phd d: if it 's possible to be able to discriminate among the phonemes in context . phd d: But the professor b:  we we could disagree about it at length phd d: Mmm . professor b: but the the real thing is if you 're interested in it you 'll probably try it phd d: Mmm . But but what I 'm more concerned with now , as an operational level , is  , you know , phd d: Mmm . professor b: what do we do in four or five days ?  , and so we have to be concerned with Are we gonna look at any combinations of things , you know once the nets get retrained so you have this problem out of it . professor b: are we going to look at multi - band ? Are we gonna look at combinations of things ?  , what questions are we gonna ask ,  now that , we should probably turn shortly to this O G I note .  , how are we going to combine with what they 've been focusing on ?  ,  we haven't been doing any of the L D A RASTA sort of thing . professor b: And they , although they don't talk about it in this note , there 's  , the issue of the  Mu law business  versus the logarithm , so . professor b: So what i what is going on right now ? What 's right you 've got nets retraining , Are there is there are there any H T K trainings testings going on ? phd d: N phd e: I I I 'm trying the HTK with eh , PLP twelve on - line delta - delta and MSG filter together .  professor b: And is this with the revised on - line normalization ? phd e: Ye -  , with the old older , phd d: Yeah . professor b: but again we have the hope that it We have the hope that it maybe it 's not making too much difference , phd e: Yeah . Well , something using place of articulation which which leads to nine , I think , broad classes . And then , something that combine both , and we have twenty f twenty - five ? grad f: Twenty - seven . professor b: So what you do  I just wanna understand phd d:  For the moments we do not don't have nets , professor b: so You have two net or three nets ? Was this ? How many how many nets do you have ? No nets . phd d: It 's just Were we just changing the labels to retrain nets with fewer out outputs . So you 're having multiple nets and combining them , or ?  , how are you how are you coming up with If you say  If you have a place characteristic and a manner characteristic , how do you phd d: It - It 's the single net , phd a: I think they have one output . grad f:  -  phd d: if we have twenty - seven classes , professor b: I see . professor b: So you 're sort of going the other way of what you were saying a bit ago instead of yeah . I think it will get worse because Well , I believe the effect that of of too reducing too much the information is basically basically what happens professor b:  - huh . phd d: and professor b: But you think if you include that plus the other features , phd d: but Yeah , because there is perhaps one important thing that the net brings , and OGI show showed that , is the distinction between sp speech and silence Because these nets are trained on well - controlled condition . So this is one thing And But perhaps , something intermediary using also some broad classes could could bring so much more information . professor b: And then  , just to remind me , all of that goes into  , that all of that is transformed by  , K - KL or something , or ? phd d:   phd d: or  , phd e: No transform the PLP phd d: per phd e: and only transform the other I 'm not sure . professor b: Well no , phd d: This is still something that professor b: I think I see . phd d: yeah , we don't know professor b: So there 's a question of whether you would phd e: Two e @ @ it 's one . So that 's something that you 're you haven't trained yet but are preparing to train , and phd d: Yeah . professor b: So I think , you know , we need to choose the choose the experiments carefully , so we can get  key key questions answered  before then phd d:   professor b: and leave other ones aside even if it leaves incomplete tables someplace , it 's it 's really time to time to choose .  professor b: OK , so  , Something I asked So they 're they 're doing the the VAD I guess they mean voice activity detection So again , it 's the silence So they 've just trained up a net which has two outputs , I believe .  I asked  Hynek whether I haven't talked to Sunil I asked Hynek whether they compared that to just taking the nets we already had and summing up the probabilities . To get the speech voice activity detection , or else just using the silence , if there 's only one silence output . But on the other hand , maybe they can get by with a smaller net and maybe sometimes you don't run the other , maybe there 's a computational advantage to having a separate net , anyway . professor b: there 's a an example or two that you can find , where it made it slightly worse , but  in in all but a couple examples .  how are trained the the LDA filter ? How obtained the LDA filter ? phd d: Mmm . phd e: Yeah ,  for example , LDA filter need a set of a set of training to obtain the filter . phd e: And maybe for the Italian , for the TD TE on for Finnish , these filter are are obtained with their own training set . That 's that 's so that 's a that 's a very good question , then now that it I understand it . It 's \" yeah , where does the LDA come from ? \" In the In earlier experiments , they had taken LDA from a completely different database , right ? phd e: Yeah . Yeah , because maybe it the same situation that the neural network training with their own phd d: Mmm .  , but  to tell you the truth , I wasn't actually looking at the LDA so much when I I was looking at it I was mostly thinking about the the VAD . And  , it ap it ap Oh what does what does ASP ? Oh that 's phd d: The features , yeah . phd e: what is what is the difference between ASP and  baseline over ? phd c: ASP . professor b: And it 's This is mostly better than baseline , although in some cases it 's a little worse , in a couple cases . professor b: I think this was I think this is the same point we were at when when we were up in Oregon . phd d: I think I think it 's the C - zero using C - zero instead of log energy . phd a: They s they say in here that the VAD is not used as an additional feature . professor b: Shouldn't it be phd d: Because phd a: Does does anybody know how they 're using it ? professor b: Yeah . professor b: if you look down at the block diagram , they estimate they get a they get an estimate of whether it 's speech or silence , phd a: But that professor b: and then they have a median filter of it . professor b: You find stretches where the combination of the frame wise VAD and the the median filter say that there 's a stretch of silence . professor b: Right ? So  phd a: So it 's it 's I don't understand . You mean it 's throwing out frames ? Before professor b: It 's throwing out chunks of frames , yeah . There 's the the median filter is enforcing that it 's not gonna be single cases of frames , or isolated frames . professor b: So it 's throwing out frames and the thing is  , what I don't understand is how they 're doing this with H T phd a: Yeah , that 's what I was just gonna ask . professor b: This is phd a: How can you just throw out frames ? professor b: Yeah . Well , you you can , phd d: i professor b: right ?  y you you phd d: Yeah . Yeah , so  in the i i in the in the decoding , you 're saying that we 're gonna decode from here to here . professor b: I think they 're they 're they 're treating it , you know , like  well , it 's not isolated word , but but connected , you know , the the phd a: In the text they say that this this is a tentative block diagram of a possible configuration we could think of . No they they have numbers though , right ? So I think they 're they 're doing something like that . I think that they 're they 're I think what  by tha that is they 're trying to come up with a block diagram that 's plausible for the standard . In other words , it 's   from the point of view of of  reducing the number of bits you have to transmit it 's not a bad idea to detect silence anyway . I 'm just wondering what exactly did they do up in this table if it wasn't this . But it 's the thing is it 's that that that 's that 's I I Certainly it would be tricky about it intrans in transmitting voice ,   for listening to , is that these kinds of things  cut speech off a lot . professor b: It does introduce delays but they 're claiming that it 's it 's within the the boundaries of it . professor b: And the LDA introduces delays , and b what he 's suggesting this here is a parallel path so that it doesn't introduce  , any more delay . I it introduces two hundred milliseconds of delay but at the same time the LDA down here I don't know Wh what 's the difference between TLDA and SLDA ? phd c: Temporal and spectral . The temporal LDA does in fact include the same so that I think he well , by by saying this is a b a tentative block di diagram I think means if you construct it this way , this this delay would work in that way phd a: Ah . So  I think that it 's it 's nice to do that in this because in fact , it 's gonna give a better word error result and therefore will help within an evaluation .  , as you know , part of the problem with evaluation right now is that the word models are pretty bad and nobody wants has has approached improving them . So it 's possible that a lot of the problems with so many insertions and so forth would go away if they were better word models to begin with . So  The question we 're gonna wanna go through next week when Hynek shows up I guess is given that we 've been if you look at what we 've been trying , we 're  looking at  , by then I guess , combinations of features and multi - band  , and we 've been looking at cross - language , cross task issues . And I guess when he comes here we 're gonna have to start deciding about  what do we choose from what we 've looked at to  blend with some group of things in what they 've looked at And once we choose that , how do we split up the effort ?  , because we still have even once we choose , we 've still got  another month or so ,  there 's holidays in the way , but but  I think the evaluation data comes January thirty - first so there 's still a fair amount of time to do things together it 's just that they probably should be somewhat more coherent between the two sites in that that amount of time . phd a: When they removed the silence frames , did they insert some kind of a marker so that the recognizer knows it 's knows when it 's time to back trace or something ? professor b: Well , see they , I I think they 're  . They 're they 're getting around the way the recognizer works because they 're not allowed to  , change the scripts for the recognizer , I believe . professor b:  that 's sort of what the way I had imagined would happen is that on the other side , yeah you p put some low level noise or something . professor b: Most recognizers don't like zeros but but you know , put some epsilon in or some rand phd a: Yeah .  i w Or something professor b: Maybe not a constant but it doesn't ,  don't like to divide by the variance of that , but  it 's phd a: That 's right . or else ,   maybe there is some indicator to tell it to start and stop , I don't know . Otherwise , if it 's just a bunch of speech , stuck together professor b: No they 're phd a: Yeah . And   I think  , I wanna look at these numbers off - line a little bit and think about it and and talk with everybody  , outside of this meeting .  , but  No  it sounds like  there there there are the usual number of of little little problems and bugs and so forth but it sounds like they 're getting ironed out . And now we 're seem to be kind of in a position to actually  , look at stuff and and and compare things .  I don't know what the One of the things I wonder about , coming back to the first results you talked about , is is how much ,  things could be helped by more parameters . Because anyway when we go to twice as much data and have the same number of parameters , particularly when it 's twice as much data and it 's quite diverse , I wonder if having twice as many parameters would help . How are we doing on the resources ? Disk , and phd d: I think we 're alright , professor b: OK . professor b: Are were you folks using Gin ? That 's a that just died , you know ? phd d: Mmm , no . professor b: That 'll be It 's a seven hundred fifty megahertz  SUN phd d:  . grad g: Do we Do we have that big new IBM machine the , I think in th professor b: We have the little tiny IBM machine that might someday grow up to be a big IBM machine . It 's got s slots for eight ,  IBM was donating five , I think we only got two so far , processors . So instead of having eight processors that were eight hundred megahertz , we ended up with two that are five hundred and fifty megahertz . So I don't think anybody has been sufficiently excited by it to spend much time  with it , but  Hopefully , they 'll get us some more parts , soon and  , yeah , I think that 'll be once we get it populated , that 'll be a nice machine . grad g: And if we can do things on Linux , some of the machines we have going already , like Swede ? professor b:   And it does have two processors , you know and Somebody could do you know , check out  the multi - threading libraries . And  i it 's possible that the  , I guess the prudent thing to do would be for somebody to do the work on on getting our code running on that machine with two processors even though there aren't five or eight . There 's there 's there 's gonna be debugging hassles and then we 'd be set for when we did have five or eight , to have it really be useful . You don't get the don't get the visuals but grad g: I is it  mostly  the neural network trainings that are  slowing us down or the HTK runs that are slowing us down ? professor b: I think yes .  , Isn't that right ?  I think you 're you 're sort of held up by both , right ? If the if the neural net trainings were a hundred times faster you still wouldn't be anything running through these a hundred times faster because you 'd be stuck by the HTK trainings , phd d: Mmm . professor b: But if the HTK  I think they 're both It sounded like they were roughly equal ? Is that about right ? phd d: Yeah . grad g: Because ,  I think that 'll be running Linux , and Sw - Swede and Fudge are already running Linux so ,  I could try to get  the train the neural network trainings or the HTK stuff running under Linux , and to start with I 'm wondering which one I should pick first . professor b: probably the neural net cuz it 's probably it it 's it 's  Well , I I don't know . They both HTK we use for  this Aurora stuff   , I think It 's not clear yet what we 're gonna use for trainings  Well , there 's the trainings  is it the training that takes the time , or the decoding ?  , is it about equal between the two ? For for Aurora ? phd d: For HTK ? professor b: For Yeah . Well , I don't know how we can I don't know how to Do we have HTK source ? Is that Yeah . professor b: You would think that would fairly trivially the training would , anyway , th the testing  I don't I don't think would parallelize all that well . But I think that you could certainly do d  , distributed , sort of Ah , no , it 's the each individual sentence is pretty tricky to parallelize . phd a: They have a they have a thing for doing that and th they have for awhile , in H T And you can parallelize the training . professor b: Yeah ? phd a: And run it on several machines professor b: Aha ! phd a: and it just basically keeps counts . phd a: I don't what their scripts are set up to do for the Aurora stuff , but phd d: Yeah . professor b: Something that we haven't really settled on yet is other than this Aurora stuff ,  what do we do , large vocabulary training slash testing for  tandem systems . So I I think the the advantage of going with the neural net thing is that we 're gonna use the neural net trainings , no matter what , for a lot of the things we 're doing , grad g: OK . professor b: whereas , w exactly which  Gaussian - mixture - based  thing we use is gonna depend  So with that , maybe we should  go to our digit recitation task . I think we can @ @ You know Herve 's coming tomorrow , right ? Herve will be giving a talk , yeah , talk at eleven . Did  , did everybody sign these consent Er everybody Has everyone signed a consent form before , on previous meetings ? You don't have to do it again each time Yes "

        "Summary": "The remote design was praised by the marketing team for its user-friendly layout, allowing users to easily reach all buttons with one thumb, regardless of hand size. The prominent placement of the on-off button and attractive colors were also noted as positive features. To cater to both left- and right-handed individuals, mute buttons were positioned on either side. For international appeal, channel buttons would be labeled with numbers while the rest would feature easily recognizable symbols. Marketing also suggested incorporating a humorous element into the shell design, playing on the concept of a rapid snail. The user interface and industrial designers agreed on this idea. The remote's unique selling points would include voice recognition, a feature not commonly found in remotes within the same price range, and its adorable appearance, with the snail image serving as a visual attraction. However, practicality would not be a standout feature, as it was assumed that all competitors would offer this.",

Those are kind of easy    goals ,  and I'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop .  we will discuss  later on more ideas about  how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things .  we are going to use a a pred a project method  during  this development ,  which consists of three different design stages .  the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design ,  all of these stages   mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then  meet to discuss our   the the the progressions , yes . project manager:  the first stage , the functional design  we are going to search for the user requirements , and we will  make a specific  specification of that .  the second is the technical functional design ,  what effect should the remote have ? Well in this case control t the the television I think .  to  presentate , to show us  a file you'll need to  place it in your project documents folder , which is on your desktop , at least it should be . project manager: sensors , so do not grab it here , but a lit more a little bit more to the  to the end .  you can insert a new  slide or or white-board   file  by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button . user interface: or should we only use it in the in the meetings ? project manager: Yeah , in the meetings , only in the meetings .  to  oh well , I'm I wrote down the documents  should be in the project documents folder if you want to  discuss it with us .  as a little training  I will ask Ruud first to draw   your own animal on a new slide  with  a different colour and a different line width than the one  now selected . marketing: project manager:  Roo , could you do the same please ? But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width . Well , it looked more than a bunny than a cat , but it works , industrial designer: Well , I'll give it a try . user interface: project manager: Okay , so  you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to .  user interface: industrial designer: marketing: project manager: we  we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold  , if there is market  interest ,  in in more than one country . And  the production costs should not be more than  twelve Euro fifty , so we should keep that in mind by  w w during the development ,  because  , well , those are important numbers . industrial designer: Yes ,  I have some technical  issues which I would like to present to you  before we start the discussion , because  there might be some  project manager: Limitations . I would like to think about  the implementation of  of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities . So if someone of you comes up with  ideas ,  I'll try to translate them in technical functions , but  there might be some impossibilities .  and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product . industrial designer: I have some  initial ideas about some things  which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming  discussion . user interface: And for a cell phone ? industrial designer: Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them . We're not  living in the  nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not  project manager: industrial designer: is not really  hot  technical stuff anymore . user interface: But Yeah , but the infrared , it's  , well , a little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that . user interface: But all the T_V_s are  equipped with infrared , so industrial designer: But it's cost-effective . user interface: Or you shou sh use a industrial designer: So marketing: user interface: you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote . So that's just my role , I'll just  give you  everybody some technical input , and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what  the product should be and how it should look , project manager: Yeah . project manager: Okay , so the the main por  the main points you are  telling us are focus on the inter  operability , industrial designer: Yes , project manager: and industrial designer: so one thing  one remote control should  control one or more  pieces of equipment , project manager: Okay , and and  industrial designer: and the way of communicating with these equipments .  there are other things like  how to make it trendy , which is I think   most  Ru  Ruud's  role . project manager: H how do you think the remote should  function for the user ? user interface: Well , I had a few  things in mind .  well , the interoperability , just like  Sebastian said ,  the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different   Yeah  , what is it , devices ? project manager: Yep . user interface:  so i i I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in  a store . user interface: It's not for  for  for  Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product , project manager: Okay , so we're we're going business to consumer , user interface: right ? project manager: not we're we're it's not a user interface: Yeah , I do I don't know that . industrial designer: We're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ? project manager: No . industrial designer: we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad  public , so it should fit to every device . project manager:  Ruud , y do you agree ? marketing: Yeah , I think I think they're right , yeah . user interface:  Well , the techni fu technical function  what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the T_V_ . user interface: Well , that's just the fu the technical function is pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task  as an  as an  device .  but furthermore industrial designer: And you you see  the buttons as a as a means of doing this ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Or are there any o other controls ? user interface: Yeah , or maybe you want a touch-screen or industrial designer: Are there only any other cont Well , user interface: But industrial designer: I I've seen these remote controls with  this little stick  which you can move forward , sidewords . And  it's very easy for a user to to switch user interface: They're very vu vulnerable . industrial designer: to to switch b  between  channels or  change  between tracks on a on a C_D_ , on on a chapters , you know , on a D_V_D_ player .  point at a T_V_ , I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_ , industrial designer: user interface: Yeah , just don't even point it , so in that case infrared should  maybe  be restriction to that . project manager:  industrial designer:  is that  are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ? So when you're not able to point at the device  the range is very limited . For T_V_ , you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T_V_ , so I don't think think the range should be a problem to that , industrial designer: user interface: but if you want to  get it working with a radio , and you're in outside your garden with just one  speaker , then maybe the range should be  industrial designer: project manager: Okay , gentlemen ,   just a reminder , we d we have five minutes left for this meeting industrial designer: Okay . user interface:  You should able to feel the buttons without  it mis  you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons , so it should be as user interface  for feeling should be  good to understand . user interface: And of course you don't always know where all buttons are , so it should be visible al  in dark too . user interface: So when it's dark project manager: user interface: Those are two really  user interface project manager:  I'll write down glow in the dark . industrial designer: Do do you project manager:  do you have anything already w  ab idea about how the market  will respond to the such a product ? Or what we should take  in account when developing such a product ? marketing:  I think most most things have already been said , like  control multiple devices . project manager: Because ? marketing:  well , he said about n abo what he said about pointing . Okay , Sebastian , did you have any other ideas ? industrial designer:  well yes , I had ,  about three minutes ago , project manager: user interface: industrial designer: but I've seem to forget them forgot them . industrial designer:   would it be nice for a user to have display on this  remote control , on which you can see functions ? Which makes it easier to operate it . Well , maybe I  but it it can be quite simple , industrial designer: I I don't know . project manager: Yeah , yeah , okay , because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product . project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: Well , that's more project manager: twelve Euro fifty , yeah . I think the the financial part of this project  implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product . project manager: So  maybe we could  for example  only light the buttons that are   applicable at that moment or user interface: But  Necessary , yeah . user interface: 'Cause I think Bluetooth  industrial designer: It's use  a lot of  project manager: Well does it ? user interface: Yeah , I know it from the cell phone .  industrial designer: Well , cell phones have  integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it's it seems to work  quite okay . user interface: But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day .  next meeting starts in thirty minutes and  , well , you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it <doc-sep>And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly . industrial designer: project manager: user interface: industrial designer: Well , I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and  user interface:  . B did you send us an email about this ? project manager: not yet , user interface: industrial designer: project manager: but if you want user interface: Yeah , we we received an email about this  d designs . project manager: Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ? industrial designer: user interface: Ah it's Okay . marketing: I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . user interface: 'Kay , we can project manager: So there are so we have three user interface: So there are three kinds of designs , that's all . project manager: So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? Any any volunteer ? industrial designer: I think our  responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager . user interface: Are you using the you are doing the in industrial designer: Yeah I I'm I'm Well , maybe we have okay so I industrial design . It was a little confusion about my  project manager: user interface: Ah industrial designer: but it's alright . industrial designer: Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done project manager: industrial designer: and what are your ideas about the project manager: About the design or Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ? industrial designer: Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess . industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno I project manager: And of course it should not be very costly . industrial designer: Well I I think that Norman and I would think about  the technical points and  we should discuss it in the next meeting , or user interface: Need to collect information .  , what is most important in a in a remote control ? What is the most important function aspect ?  . project manager: You won't user interface: Or or you can say for example ,  I want  to list all the programme tonight . Y you know , instead of  remote control it's doing the some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . project manager: I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . user interface: No , because no , project manager: S user interface: it's not very a lot . industrial designer: I I think if you want t to choose  from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use  w  I dunno marketing: I'm a okay . marketing:  the main  function of remote control is to have something in the hand project manager: In the hand . marketing: If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog user interface: Yeah . marketing: if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . industrial designer: marketing:  we have some or something , different technology but project manager: This is it's user interface: Yeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that  there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea project manager: industrial designer: but I I think that technically it would be  a little bit   more tricky to to achieve this than just to user interface: No . They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . user interface: And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons . industrial designer: Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to  navigate  through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so project manager: This is good idea . Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? industrial designer: Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen user interface: Good idea . industrial designer: and just  with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f user interface: I think I think that will be revol revolutionary . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: Because all the T_V_  the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . So I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff user interface: Okay . project manager: So we have five minutes to user interface: Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . project manager: Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we industrial designer: user interface: Five minutes . marketing: And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of user interface: Okay . marketing: So , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark  some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . industrial designer: Oh right so user interface: Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: Be before before writing you can  sit and that says what we what we said user interface:  . So so the most functional des  the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . The user can choose w which one they want , right ? industrial designer: Yeah , by content or by channel , user interface: By content or by channel . user interface: Okay , so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content . industrial designer: I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so user interface: Okay . And  industrial designer: I think that's the the things to do user interface: The main thing . user interface: So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get  the funct this is the functional designer ? That's the first aspect . project manager: So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ? And we'll discuss the other other aspects <doc-sep>project manager:  for the aim of this meeting now is to to make presentation about  the work for each one . user interface: project manager: And take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote control . project manager: and I think we don't need lighting adaptive , so the remote control should be only used for the the television . industrial designer: So  Well I have a PowerPoint pr presentation stored in my in my personal folder project manager: Here . project manager: industrial designer: Right , so  I will talk about the the w working design and user interface: F_ five . industrial designer: And  well I I will present my my first idea on how to build the our new remote control for television . So I think the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve  what we want to do . user interface: industrial designer: So   I'm thin  I think  I I'll do a survey about what is  what is available on the market and what what is the the cheapest possible things we hav we can use . Then  I will try with the technical team to to build a prototype and to see  with  h how this little box would  look look like . user interface: industrial designer: And how an and we can  start troubleshooting first  com communication problems or things like that . user interface: industrial designer: And when we are ready with this first prototype I I think we can add some software functionalities on a programmable chip like browsing by content or  things like that . Okay so can you go down  So , wha what I think for now is we don't want to have a remote control w which is wired user interface: project manager: industrial designer: so  I think we u we can use a battery for the . And the communication with the T_V_ set is  made through  infrared communication So  this is the the schema of the o of the future  remote controls user interface: Did you draw it ? marketing: project manager: Wow . industrial designer: so  you can you can see the components ,  battery and  the two chips goes to the infrared  connection to the T_V_ set . industrial designer: The one on top is for the  well the functionali the functionalities user interface: marketing: One is a communication . industrial designer: and the the th red  sorry the green one is is to well , putting things together ,  f transform the data into  qu into the format to to  to communicate with the T_V_ set . I think we should use a F_P_G_A_ for for the functionalities which is easy to to t user interface:  . What is F_P_G_A_ ? industrial designer: It's field programmable  something array . user interface: So why's it how is it different from the Bluetooth ? industrial designer: Well ,  a F_P_G_A_ is just a chip you can  you can pr programme it  wi with wh whatever you want . industrial designer: And  well the Bluetooth chip is just responsible to  make the communication  between  the two devices .  So this are the they have to work together ? Or ? Do they have to work together or two separate choice industrial designer: No . marketing: Or it's something like isn't hardware the first one ? And the second one is for the software . marketing: Okay , and how about the battery power ?  you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared ? industrial designer:  no no no no , I think  we have  to to  have  embedded  b batteries in in the project manager: . user interface: industrial designer: And  I I don't think it will need  very  much power to make it run , so user interface:  . user interface: Because you are using because you are using Bluetooth , if some people have P_D_A_ they can use their P_D_A_ to control the T_V_ if they want to , right ? industrial designer: That's a good idea . marketing: project manager: Ma industrial designer: Also , but but I I I think  the the goal is to sell our remote control . So the the purpose is to to find  the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have . user interface: and  and I found that  the function of remote control is to send messages to television set . user interface: For example switch on , switch off , switch the next channel and so on and so on . marketing: G user interface: So I found two very good prototypes for for this interface from our competitors industrial designer: user interface: so can you industrial designer: project manager: This are usual functionality . industrial designer: user interface: But then  loo but then I found if you look at you see on the left one there are too many buttons industrial designer: project manager: And they are small . O on the right I tried to play with the problem is that  if I have hundred channels I have  I have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and I have to compose the number industrial designer: Yeah . And then I I look at the user manual they are a hundred pages thick , so we don't want that . You can navigate on T_V_ screen and we can the user's preference and we need to have the T_V_ connected to internet so we end in order to access the T_V_ programmes by X_M_L_ and we need some to do some preprocessing . From the technical aspect , the processing should be done on the T_V_ set than on the on the remote controller , right ? industrial designer: user interface: And then we the speech recognition as  Harry says we may just put in we may K_I_V_ . project manager: What do you mean by the pa pa processing will be done on the T_V_ user interface: Yeah , all the processing is done the T_V_ is a compu has some processing power the project manager: than the industrial designer: So we have to t project manager: So we should have specific T_V_ ? Or ? We can use this . project manager: Yeah , we don't marketing: user interface: Yeah because are you just wondering what controller okay . industrial designer: I think there there is there is al there there is a a technology like show view who is already available on most of the T_V_ set on recorders or thing like that user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and we can try t to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because user interface: Okay . user interface: So i the processing on on the remote controller project manager: Yeah , user interface: so it can u be used in any T_V_ , any conventional T_V_ sets ? project manager: we . project manager: Keep the navigation industrial designer: We d we don't we we don't need really much buttons to i if we have a screen to navigate on on the T_V_ so  project manager: but user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: It's easy to build , user interface: industrial designer: it does not consume much power . marketing: Oh , but you have a catch there ,  assume that  if you want to go to if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine , then . user interface: industrial designer: Well , then y you you go to the main menu and  you have  go to channel user interface:  . No , because you choose by channel , so you choose by T_V_ program industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: but  I I think i i if you if you want to to make  well a a big jump but  well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could marketing: But project manager: So you are user interface: Ah . user interface: A mouse or industrial designer: Well , not a mouse but  something that that says more clearly that  right , left , up , down , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: well , the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator , maybe directly , or marketing:    . So it'll beep if you wanna find it marketing: too small that it goes under the sofa and we can't find it . project manager: user interface: you just  shout y h just it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device . user interface: And responds to you , and industrial designer: marketing: Yeah , that's right . marketing: Okay , after having the inputs from industrial design and user interface , I think most of the points which I want to are already covered here . user interface: marketing: And to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested , then what we have done is we have put a feedback forms in all the magazines , and the users send the feedbacks , and based on that These are the findings which we got and yeah adding of a speech interface is always good for a T_V_ remote but the technology We already know that as discussed earlier industrial designer: Well I I think it will be a , yes , a bit complicated to  make a speech recognisers runs on the small  ts user interface: project manager: marketing: An it does how feasible it is . I if you just recognise  numbers is a limited you have limited vocabulary marketing: Oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones . industrial designer: And this can allow to choose the the program , for instance without  adding  buttons user interface: Yeah . And of course most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive , project manager: marketing: so this is an important criteria here is user interface: But project manager: But do you think what they sug suggested s possibility . user interface: I no I I think that  i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with  reasonable cost . marketing: user interface: Maybe not less , but they may be willing to pay little bit more for comfort , marketing: Little bit more if it's with extra features . industrial designer: Well ,  project manager: There is in the marketing: for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes . industrial designer: marketing: Or they say movie name or I don't go for movie names but only for the numbers on the channel , or volume up , volume down , brightness , contrast . industrial designer: we we just have to find a mean how to to add a m a a a microphone or  well yes a microphone into the the remote control , so marketing: I think user interface: industrial designer: I well project manager: I think i industrial designer: it will be alright . project manager: What about lighting adaptive options ? marketing: Yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting , but I think  not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required . user interface: So you need s special T_V_ sets to do that ? Or it's it's done via this remote controller ? It's very complex . marketing:  industrial designer: Yeah , I think it's a bit complex too user interface: marketing:  yeah , it's for the  industrial design and users interface designers to decide if it's going to be working or not . industrial designer: For our next product , our new T_V_ set with  automatical  sound adjustment light marketing: I think project manager: user interface: Yeah , then we can conclude that . So any things to to discuss ? Or any suggestions ? user interface: marketing: I think as I discussed th that four points would be good for  marketing . And regarding the teletext  these are the subtitl these are the text information which you got on the televisions . marketing: And  if you are a French guy watching an English movie you would like to have it in French . industrial designer: marketing: So , the remote it should have some it should give me some flexibility of choosing the ch languages . industrial designer: Yeah , but well what about the the new project's requirement ? I I I think we should give up with teletext , no ? project manager: I think we we can we is the . Well , so maybe we we can j we can already think  about a way to to access the internet via the television . industrial designer: Because if user interface: Using the T_V_ to access the internet ? Or what ? I didn't quite understand industrial designer: Yeah , but  we can think that in a few years there will be T_V_ set that can access the internet . industrial designer: So it's a good idea if i i if we i if if we  think about how to to to build up our remote  control w with this functionality in a w which will c which will come in a few years . industrial designer: So if we already have it in our remote control project manager: So you have to anticipate the the future ? industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: well , not not to implement it , but to well , to find a way to to add to add this functionality in a yeah , in an in an easy manner , if is possible "

        "Query": "Summarize Marketing's opinions and discussions on the size, design, and functionality of the remote control.",
        "Summary": "The team discussed the size of the remote control, with Marketing suggesting that the TV itself could have a user-friendly remote control system using different technology. However, the Project Manager believed that this idea would not appeal to men and Marketing eventually gave up on it. The group also debated whether installing a new remote would be seen as a technological innovation, with Marketing recommending voice recognition technology due to its fashionable and trendy appeal. The Marketing team emphasized the importance of innovation, considering the use of fruit and vegetable logos and primary colors on the remote control. They also noted that younger people were more interested in features like LCD screens and speech recognition, while older people were willing to spend more money on larger remote controls. Marketing highlighted the volume and channel buttons as the most important and should be easily accessible.",
        "Article": "marketing: user interface: industrial designer: marketing: industrial designer: project manager: user interface:  project manager: industrial designer: user interface: No , no . Not all the small buttons , you don't know project manager: Is this positive or negative , that  big buttons ? industrial designer: Big buttons , positive . industrial designer: All all small buttons like when you have  like a hundred buttons on your remote control , you won't know what they're working for . What are your experiences ? user interface:  well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the T_V_ set . And  I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED   a LED on the corner of the of the remote . And that if you push the button the LED  gives a light , and  and you see that it's working .  project manager: So and do they always have that ? user interface: Yeah , but No no no . marketing:  at home we have a T_V_ , a video  recorder , a D_V_D_ player , and a satellite receiver . But  i it it had a lot of buttons on it , and you didn't know which one was what . So what ideas do you have for it , for the new remote control ? What what does it have to have ? industrial designer: The weight . industrial designer: When you push a but a button on the T_V_ , then you hear some  some sort of bleep . industrial designer: marketing: Yeah I think it  from a marketing point of view , it also has to look nice . So you don't won't have to change the batteries  once a week or  once every two weeks <doc-sep>And  I want to introduce myself ,  my name is  Shrida Daseri and  I'm a project manager for this new project which we are going to discuss now . And what you're  drawing ? user interface:  sure my name is Agnes and I'm an user usability user interface designer . So thanks for coming for the meeting first of all , and  we have a long time , just twenty-five minutes to discuss about  this project and the the project initiation . First of all I want to ask  Mister Ed about your  marketing plan and your product plan and  marketing: Well I think that we'll see that throughout the day in how we're going to put this together as a marketing to to market the product . We'll have to see on a through discussion on where we're gonna go from here and from with this . project manager: - but  do you already have like a functional design or a technical design or marketing:  for the moment not yet . project manager: Oh for the moment not yet , okay , but  what's what's your  do you have some project plan , something with you or marketing: Good question . No , this is like I said that we have to be discussed between all of us and we'll go from there . Okay , so  by when you think you can  give me some kind of  project plan , okay , a discussion with  marketing: Certainly by the next meeting .  Okay , so there's any questions or  first of all about  this project ? industrial designer: What is the goal of the project ? project manager:  the goal of the project I think maybe I'll  hand out to the Ed , okay , so to explain  what is the project because he's in the sales and the accounting . marketing: industrial designer: marketing: I'm in the sales I'm supposed to explain them what to do . We have to define exactly what our product is , from  project manager: Yes , so can you explain  what exactly the product is ? marketing: From what I had in mind we're supposed to be marketing coffee , is that right ? project manager: Oh I think  , if I'm not wrong , we're making the remote control . I had a first part of mine was to make a remote control for a new f remote control for television , and afterward I had a discussion about coffee so project manager: Yes . marketing: Something  visual that has something that will will draw people to buy the product , project manager: marketing: because I think everybody's experienced with  remote controls , and some remote controls are are worth  throwing out the window .  th most of them ar I don't know we're have to come up with a new idea on how to make it a lot easier to use , project manager: marketing: 'cause a lot of times  spend  half a day through the instruction book trying to figure out how to use it . project manager: And  what abo  Christine , what about your  the industrial design plan ? Are you have a design already on this product or  you're still working on the design ? industrial designer:  no , I I have not begun working on the design , project manager: industrial designer: and  I  I actually didn't know we were designing a remote control , I thought we were designing a new monitor .  the website I went to look at had some announcements about an introduction of a   some sort of a seven inch  monitor , and  I understood that that was the project goal . So  I'm glad I didn't d do any work  ahead of time because  I clearly didn't understand the project goal . industrial designer:  I just did s see that we were starting a new project together and there was going to be a four member team composed of these people , and  that's about  that's project manager: industrial designer: and I I read through the different steps , and what my responsibilities were relative to the steps . project manager: So  you'll be leading the team for your design team or how many members is working in the team , for the design ? industrial designer:  for the industrial design ? project manager: Yes . marketing: project manager: That's industrial designer:  because  , you know , you can  you can make it  you have different choices with different financial models . project manager: Yeah , but  before we talk about  the finance , okay ,  do you have some idea how we can  sell this product or project in the market and how much is going to benefit to the company and  of course it's to the individual also . industrial designer: Well , you know  , I kind of think that in general you have to do   y you have to have something that's very fashionable , that's  very attractive that  people see and recognize  its goal , and  they immediately wanna have it  have one of their own . So it would really would need to  something like the iPod would be good , seems to have caught on fairly well , project manager: industrial designer: so  d  you know , I don't care what it does , just so it looks cool . project manager: Okay , but   when you think you can give me like a kind of design on the functional design or the technical design ? industrial designer: Well ,  I've got a lot of other projects I'm doing right now  and so I'll have to wait and see how those  how those go . project manager: Yeah , but  I need something in the writing , so like  what's your functional design , what's your technical design , and  how many people you need for this project , and what's the time frame you're looking , okay , and what is the budget , maybe  initial budget you're looking , okay , and  how is going to the market , okay , industrial designer: project manager: so you've you've had to meet with the marketing team and how they're going to market and what are the marketing strategic plan , okay , when are you going to introduce , okay , and by the time you introduce the product and  you know there there would be a competition , okay , so I need some kind of   the plan in the writing from you . Okay , and it's po industrial designer: And when would you like that ? project manager: B as soon as possible . industrial designer:  well if  if we have enough time  then d do you think  two weeks is a is close enough ? project manager: Yes I think  that would be good , because I need to go to the management and  tell them what we are going to do , and  what cost is , okay , and what's the time frame and what's the project plan , because  without any  documentations , I cannot go to the management and say , so we are going to do this and we need this much money , okay , so then it's it's difficult for me to say , okay , that's the reason I need  some kind of plan from you , initially , okay , then we can have the further discussion again . industrial designer:  are there other people who will be contributing to the plan ? project manager: Yes , of course , if you need some help ,  so let me know . So , who are the people you need  from the marketing or  the technical side or  the administration point of view , okay , to add in any documentation , or some technical point of view , industrial designer: project manager: so just let me know so I can  coordinate all the teams . And  Ed  so what's what do you think about  this  project for the remote control and d do you have some already planned something for your marketing strategy or  the sales strategy ? marketing: Well not yet other than  doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do  , what they're building , their designs , their ideas , project manager:  . marketing: It should be a fairly large market because  the number of people that  the competition , project manager: marketing:  th I agree it has to be something it has to be something new , it has to be something that that draws people saying eh , I like this . Whether it works or not , they have to first say I like this , I like the design , and then it's gotta be simple to use . project manager: Yes , so what I  prefer maybe  you need to interact  more with the Christine , okay , because you know what she is going to do it , okay , and you know how to sell it . Okay , because  she is doing the design , but you are the core because you are in the marketing , okay , marketing: Yeah . project manager: so because you need to sell and you're the responsible for the all the money , the finance , okay , tomorrow . project manager: So , what I prefer , okay , so you need to interact with the Christine more and  within her team , okay , who is using the functional design or technical design , okay , marketing: project manager: and  you need to come up with some kind of plan , okay , how we are going to do the your sales plan , okay , th marketing: Do we already have a cost limit on this , th an idea of how much  we want to market this for , how much it's gonna sell for , project manager: Th That that's marketing: that's up that's up to us to decide , eh ? project manager: Yes , that's you have to decide , okay , so the best thing is you  both of  the Christine and you discuss with yourself , okay , and come up with the cost , and how we are going to compete in the market , okay , in the the technically , or in the sales wise , okay , the commercial wise , okay . Then  we have to design , okay , how long it will take the whole project , okay , how much is going to cost us , and how much we are going to benefit for the company . Okay , so I think it's  maybe if we can  give me some kind of your  the sales plan , okay , including the technical what  she's going to talk to you within the team , okay , then it will help me to discuss with the management for further , okay , and put it in the the proper project plan . Okay , and if you need  any coordination in between  compared to the maybe the some technical vendors or commercial vendors , okay , depends if you want to have some   marketing plan or technical plan , okay , so you let me know .  my job from what I understood was to look at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable , it's acceptable to the people who are gonna use it and look at the best ways to do that . user interface: So I think I'll have to interact with Christine and discuss with her , so that she's not designing something that my studies will show right off the bat that it's not going to work , project manager: Th Christine , yeah . Which is user interface: and so it's sort of it's a loop that feeds in , but I don't think necessarily that I'm in a coordinating position for it . Yeah , so basically you need to interact with Christine more , okay , for the user acceptability , okay , and the testing , okay , user interface: Yeah . project manager: then you will user interface: Which will also feed into the marketing , project manager: Yes . user interface: because depending on what users want , depends on how you sell it , what tag lines you attach to it , how you try to make it more attractive to users .  , and then I guess build the plan based on all of that , because I think you need to take all the factors into account . But what I request , okay , keep Ed in the loop , okay , in between your  meeting and Christine meeting , because  he should know what's happening . Okay and please please copy all the mails , okay , all the discussions to me , okay , so I need to submit to the management . user interface: So , the immediate next step is to start determining the functional design , or project manager: Yes . To come up with the functional design and  to discuss with Ed , okay , and how it's going to be work , and  first of all with your user acceptance , okay , how it looks like and how it's going to be work in the market , okay , user interface: industrial designer: Would you mind  at the conclusion of our meeting could could you send us a copy of your slides ? project manager: Yes , I will . project manager: I'll copy ,  le let us keep all the emails and all the copies , okay , share each other , okay , so you know everybody what's happening , okay ? user interface: Sure . project manager: And if anything you need anytime so please either you can call me , or just send me email , or  just come and  knock my door , okay , so I'm available here <doc-sep>user interface: Why won't it wake up ? Is it on ? marketing: The power light doesn't work . Okay , so I just show you the m the no   the the the the the the minutes , minute . project manager: Okay , so we just talked about  Oh you want me to show that there or user interface: No , industrial designer:  no . And the functions are volume , channel to choose channels , an on-off , a mute  button , and a text T_V_ button . project manager: So I just want to give you  Mike again , the first  presentation of your marketing: Shall I start ? project manager: Yeah . I searched the web ,  and  I searched  on this d document , recent investigation of the remote control market .  but  they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look and feel . And then  that  This is a point of discussion , because we just decided that we don't make use of  L_C_D_ or  speech recognition . marketing: But  this is the second  important  aspect , and I think  we must use some of the new technology , to be  innovative . And it says  fashion-watchers of   Pari  France and  Italy , yeah ,  have detected the following trends . marketing: But the  the next  aspect also in contrast to last year , the feel of material is expe   is expected to be spongy . marketing: But spongy , what what does spongy says ? industrial designer: Spongy . project manager: because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground . project manager: Is it a bit like like the the the the remote control ? user interface: How are you gonna make it ? project manager: R_ soft . industrial designer: Yeah , marketing:  industrial designer: I've some  material  information , but I'll give you it later in my presentation . marketing: Okay ? project manager: marketing: What do I think ?  because a fancy look is the most important thing  for remote control  control , I think about changeable fronts . Yeah , how do we do that ? Maybe speech ? We ma must have some kind of gadget . marketing: Intro project manager: Because it's only twelve and a half Euros you have to spend on every remote control . user interface: So  industrial designer: Yeah , well actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost . But maybe it's cheap user interface: Yeah , industrial designer: and it's easy to implement . I d They don't say how much it will cost , so  but  marketing: user interface: if we implement  speech recognition , I think it would be better to implement L_C_D_ as well . So you can say , you can user interface: Since you have to  configure speech thing . project manager: But that's definitely more expensive than user interface: Yeah , that's that's something I dunno . But a telephone also have a L_C_D_ and and it's about t two hundred Euros . user interface: Yeah , so  we gotta de project manager: So  user interface: We have to decide on that . That was this ? user interface:   industrial designer: Oh I got an email  And it says  the chip can be  simple , regular or advanced . So user interface: L_D_C_ doesn't require industrial designer: it's m the most expensive . industrial designer: I I haven't got anything about speech recognition , but user interface: I'll I'll give you my design . 'Cause remote con control , you can see it here , you have to bo reach both out both sides . project manager: Yeah , maybe the teletext tel user interface: Yeah , text button , maybe there and there . user interface: but it's marketing: No , I don't  I don't like it . And you can't use them now with your thumb , because the thing is not , it's not easy to control . industrial designer: Yeah okay , m maybe we cho should put that on top , and buttons we we don't use on , in the bottom . user interface: They're on top ? project manager: Yeah , just th th th other buttons like text T_V_ . industrial designer: But I I think w you'll use  the switch channels buttons  more often than the normal  channel buttons , like one two three . I dunno , but yeah we'll industrial designer: Like zapping is just switching one channel at a time . user interface: And  if you don't light 'em up , they don't  you don't see 'em very good . industrial designer: That's that's good , but user interface: I think it's modern to light this area up , and to light this area up . It's s We have to look  what's easy to use , and how it's easier to use . user interface: I dunno if it l will look good , if you put those on t on the bottom half . Yeah , maybe industrial designer: But  we we can switch those two , user interface: Those two , yeah . user interface: And  , yeah , you have to make sure it's easy to  Yes , it has to be big enough so you can hold it , right . And  well  if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something , we I don't think we should put it on top then . I think that , if we're gonna put in more technology , that you need to be able to  switch it open . project manager: We have to decide this this lecture , or this this this  fifty minutes , yeah , how it is gonna look . If you aim at a young public , you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green , blue , red . I don't know exactly what that means , but it should be , well yeah , popular kind of project manager: Yeah , we have to put our Real Reaction logo as well on the on the remote control . user interface:  Yeah , it's project manager: So we have ha to ma make it in black , black , yellow . industrial designer: Yeah ,  n Not that weird , because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy , to attract a young public . user interface: Yeah , but  I don't think the the colours black and yellow go well together . But project manager: We make i Maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front . That's a that's a sen That's just a matter of tastes , but user interface: Yeah , okay . user interface:  can't we use  different  fron  fronts , with all with the the logo on it ? Can we do that ? So project manager: Yeah , it's cool . industrial designer: S user interface: You can Just like a mobile phone , you can make  different fronts on it . user interface: A more Yeah , just  marketing:   project manager: That's better prob industrial designer: With the hard hard buttons . The the the new  new modern  remote controls ,  the buttons are part of the  the style , I think is part of the remote control itself .  it's n doesn't Is  a button   How do you say it ? industrial designer: Yeah , it's it's all on one level . marketing: It it didn't it i it don't come out of the on the background . project manager: basic remote control from normal plastic , marketing: project manager: and industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: But I think we have to make the case transparent , otherwise the back light won't work . industrial designer: So if you put project manager: Y i if you The numbers could be can be user interface:  you can just make them around the buttons  project manager: Yeah , that's right . user interface: Or it runs the whole industrial designer: Yeah , but we can still make it transparent . user interface: Yeah , you can halfs transparent , industrial designer: Or no user interface: or just that it's comes out a bit . user interface:  depends on the colour of the project manager: Yeah , but you can't choo You can't choose it when you buy it . Is marketing: but can you change it if you already bought the the remote control ? user interface: Yeah , it can . project manager: industrial designer: I don't know what it is , but it should be there I think . marketing: project manager: user interface: industrial designer:  this is the normal circuit board , like a chip board in in a lot of  things . project manager: Yeah , we have to hurry up a bit , so industrial designer: W So we d we just need this and this transistors and resonators . user interface: industrial designer:  they they basically said that that's almost the same on any  remote controls . project manager: We still want to have a recharger , don't we ? industrial designer: Yeah but project manager: Is that still the user interface: Yes . industrial designer: Yeah , but it i We don't wanna have a ar an How do you call it ? Accu . user interface: project manager: It's just batteries , industrial designer: so marketing: project manager: that's cheaper . So we need  the expensive , most expensive chip , if we use an L_C_D_ . industrial designer:  are are we using a a rubber case , or project manager: Oh just sk industrial designer: We haven't decided yet . It's user interface:  I don't think a rubber case looks industrial designer: L marketing:  but we have to do something about the trend . Or should we do it in the next meeting ? user interface:  I_D_ and U_I_D_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board . industrial designer: So we should did it here ? project manager: That's for th user interface: So we're staying here ? project manager:  that I think that's the next next meeting . user interface: Okay , so now we're ka thirty minutes alone again ? industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Just a bit cur Okay , I'll see if I can see any of those . You see what  ? industrial designer: What ? project manager: If I draw here It draws about four centimetres lower than industrial designer: Oh . industrial designer: I think  you'll get a a lot of  volume changing when it's not wanted . project manager: And industrial designer: Yeah , but maybe we can make a a plastic , so that you i if you like drop it , it won't change the volume . user interface: Yeah , maybe you just have to make it  That's not scrollable too easy . And  what's the channel choose ? Where do we  put that ? Still on the bottom industrial designer: I think in middle . project manager: or user interface:  wh what is the middle part ? project manager: That's the numbers . industrial designer:  I think th the numbers should be in the bottom , and and the switch channel in the middle . project manager: It doesn't make a difference , if you put the s  the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other . user interface: Use the dz project manager: Because you already have the volume here , so You can also put it here one butt and the other one there . project manager: So you can also can put it all on the top , and this , you keep this empty . industrial designer: Or you could do the switch channel up button above the the numbers and switch channel down button below . project manager: But that's not want to zap very quick , so user interface: Yeah , I think  zapping is the highest priority . project manager: Yeah ? Is this a opportunity , user interface: And then you use those  project manager: or you don't want a different user interface: Yeah , of course  . industrial designer:  but I think we we should bu  put 'em on top of each other , so project manager: Why ? industrial designer: Because then it's it's easy to know m if I push the the the up project manager: But still the next It's still the next one . Doesn't make industrial designer: Yeah , but the top the top button is is like you switch channel up , and down button is If you put them project manager: Yeah , but fo from left to right is exactly the same . industrial designer: But  but I I think  left to right is more often associated with volume , and top down is more with  channel changing . user interface: Yeah , I think industrial designer: So so if we use that , they will probably have a long learning  time . I You already have the volume on the side , user interface: No ,  I think project manager: so you can't make it you can't ma make a mistake . project manager: So it's  user interface: I think it's s so simple industrial designer: I dunno . user interface: you just project manager: So but that's for that's for you , industrial designer: Okay . project manager: 'cause it's user interface: Yeah , okay I'll d I'll take a look at it . user interface: Think we need to work  thirty minutes again ? marketing: Yeah , we have to care that it r  looks really new . marketing: 'Cause wha what I see the only difference i i i in fact is that we use a scroll-wheel on the outside . user interface: No , you have  It is industrial designer: Yeah , but i i it should be round in in shape . marketing: Some some kind of bling bling   can we have industrial designer: user interface: Where you can put a ve  we have If we do it like that we have below have we  a lot of room to put a nice logo . marketing:  and how many  fronts  fronts do we put on the market then ?  five or something ? project manager: Yeah , five . user interface: marketing: Or more or user interface: Maybe you can buy separate ones and  marketing: And    buy the product . industrial designer: No , tha that will be project manager: So y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger ? Is that is that a good good opportunity ? user interface: Yes . marketing: Yeah , we can b It c it could be just just a square , just a packet . industrial designer: But we have to make contacts on the on the remote control and the recharger as well . user interface: I think i marketing: user interface: Yeah okay , tho those are al already a bit cornered . industrial designer: Yeah , but we can we can do all kinds of  As long as it isn is in two D_ we can use all kind of round shapes . project manager: industrial designer: project manager: It's a bit annoying , isn't it ? marketing: Yeah . I know we can do a lot more , but marketing: Yeah , it project manager: industrial designer: Like in this kind of shape or marketing:  it's very annoying . project manager: So we have to make a decision , what kind of form it's gonna have t going to have . project manager: But why do we have to round it on the t bottom then ? Of Skip that one as well . user interface: and marketing: It's not not a lot of trends I  I found  project manager: Okay , so we have s still one minute left . So just marketing:  project manager: I think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square . Yeah , marketing: It The th th industrial designer: I d I don't know n something about ergonomic kind of fits-in-the-hand  stuff . It's only annoying if it if it's like that f formed like that , like f Whatever . Just you have a normal industrial designer: Yeah , but we're we're aiming at a young public . marketing: There is one There's just one overall important aspect is that we must make it fancy and it looks original , and I hope we can  make it look not like the iPod itself . But you're If you look at the way remote controls are now project manager: But i it is it is it is already fancy . user interface: And if you make it look like the iPod marketing: Yeah , they're all the same . So that's already a very big change project manager:  maybe maybe make the the  the wha what's it called  scroll wheel . Maybe we have to ask  to the the  to her if it has if it can work better than this . project manager: We just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition . Yeah , do we s keep that ? Yeah , I think project manager: Or keep that ? It's okay . But you'd definitely need a industrial designer: S user interface: Well  project manager: advanced chip . marketing:  industrial designer: And we we have to build in a microphone and user interface: Well that's very easy . We already have  the beeping of the home station , industrial designer: Yeah , and I do I don't know anything about that . user interface: so industrial designer: I d I didn't receive any information on speech recognition , marketing: No . Becau project manager: Can we just put it speech recognition in it as well , marketing: Yeah . But project manager: okay ? user interface: So marketing: Ma user interface: shall we it open then ? project manager: Yeah . user interface: Oh yeah , I marketing: But we don't have any f information about the cost . marketing: We started with information about the cost was now th user interface: I just I just received the industrial designer: Yeah ,  I have I have some some information about the cost . marketing: And how much is the chip ? The the the industrial designer: I don't know how much , but user interface: Yeah , our division has developed a new speech recognition feature , the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker u unit . industrial designer: Just in inexpensive or user interface: This is a very small electronic unit , will give a standard answer after it recognise a question . user interface: Yeah  th that's just It's a marketing: Does it say does it say something back ? project manager: Okay , we have to stop it now . Yeah , it Well that's integrated in the chip , so if you use the speech recognition , that's in it . project manager: Okay , that's a r That's that's a advanced industrial designer: But i it's a separate chip . user interface: I dunno , but if we use speech recognition , that will be in it as well . industrial designer: Yeah , I don't know anything about this , marketing:  project manager: Yeah , we just decide not to put it in , industrial designer: but Nah . project manager: Okay , just user interface: And there's a chip in it that will project manager: We have to stop it now "

        "Query": "Did the group find the remote control competitive in terms of evaluation criteria, battery design, and cover when discussing the functional design and prototype of the remote control?",
        "Summary": "The team had mixed opinions on the remote control design. While Marketing found the basic layout to be dull, they praised the brilliant voice recognition feature. User Interface acknowledged that the remote lacked digits but had all the necessary features. The Industrial Designer reminded everyone that they could only design within their capacity. The Project Manager agreed that the remote was of high quality but had low acceptance. \n\nIn terms of the battery design, the team wanted it to be long-lasting, original, and conventional to ensure innovation, versatility, and durability. They also wanted to avoid deviating too far from the usual performance to prevent issues for new users. \n\nUser Interface suggested using a rubber cover that could stretch over the remote, and the Project Manager agreed, asking the Industrial Designer to explore this idea further.",
        "Article": "industrial designer: Is there any time for a cup of coffee ? user interface: We have a slight problem . project manager: Sorry ? industrial designer: Can I get a cup of coffee ? project manager:  no . project manager:  then  the three of you  prepared a presentation , I think ? Sebastian ? industrial designer: I think so too . user interface: industrial designer: project manager: Then we'll do your one   as la  the last .  the top goal of this m user interface: But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe . project manager:  the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group  and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind .  the new project requirements , first of all ,  we didn't speak about it , but we should not  support teletext in the remote ,  because our b  board  feels that  teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext .  the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not  f  feasible , it's not  w user interface: Yeah . project manager:   we we cannot make it because of the time to market  that we have to deal with . project manager:  the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than  forty , which is important for you ,  Ruud , and as well for  Roo .  then for Roo , as well  important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product .  the individual presentations , I th  Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ? user interface: Yeah , I'll start .  the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . user interface: Then I found  two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function  remote control with many possibilities , but  the lack of the feeling I already mentioned  in the previous  discussion . user interface: And the ease-of-use remote control with  the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . My personal preferences were ease of  the easy to use remote control , because  the user-friendliness and  it can be more trendy in in user design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not  in our design . But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is  the best  possi possibility for us . project manager: Okay , so marketing: project manager: the important thing here is user interface: And it's also i indeed   Ruud's  insight in the in the topic . project manager: Yeah , okay , w we will s we all  user interface: Just for  for user desi  user  friendliness I  should choose for the the ease of use remote control .  well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . user interface: industrial designer:  basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by  sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to  implement a picture here , user interface: Energies and  industrial designer: but it's hardly readable . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using  infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . It's almost every piece of equipment  every piece of  every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . And I think that's what we w user interface: The glow in the dark  concept  we discussed . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . industrial designer: and I think we should  we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . industrial designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared , because  otherwise our device cannot  communicate with  almost every T_V_ set . And  if we want to use  a rechargeable design or  a energy-save design , we should really implement them .  for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost  circuit board ,  because most of the production cost are are in this  part of the equipment . industrial designer: And  the money we save on using this we can use  for elaborate fancy lighting  techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . user interface: And what's the  industrial designer: I think our  users will really  will really like that . user interface: if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or industrial designer: No , they're p f  power friendly LEDs also . user interface: For the same costs , it's can be  in our industrial designer:  no , they're  they're a little bit more expensive , but by    making user interface: Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's  industrial designer: We can we can make its I think . project manager: Yeah , but but the question is whether  two or four buttons makes  m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to  include fancy lightning techniques , I guess . user interface: Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , marketing: true . Well , it's not one light , it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . project manager: Okay well , industrial designer: project manager: we ar we are very curio curious to what the market  will feel about such a product . marketing: But  since  the other part is  forty percent of the market , I  thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . The buttons to zap are used the about  fifteen hundred times , when  the power button is only used one time . So user interface: Yeah , well it should just have a design The perfect design for those only those buttons . Just one thing I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? industrial designer: Well marketing: Yeah , that's  a problem . project manager: Well industrial designer: Usually project manager: maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , user interface: It should be   project manager: like  turning on and off the the the lights . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a  kind of weird sound , and your  remote controls then start to beep . project manager: But  th user interface: But but T_V_s don't have all   buttons . marketing: And you project manager: Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home  user interface: But I believe you will have an marketing: Yeah , and usually industrial designer: We do not control the T_V_ set so well . marketing: And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button ,  you would have to walk to your T_V_ , industrial designer: Yes , m yes . S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , marketing: and it's project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so we should think about project manager: So what about the clapping technique ?  because you se user interface: I'm convinced  Sebastian will  find  one solution for us . marketing: And b project manager: Well , you see it a lot in in light  lightning   industrial designer: Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics  the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , project manager: Yeah , a peak . industrial designer: But there are many other sounds  which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . industrial designer: Yes , user interface: But we can have just   a home stat  f a base station next to the T_V_ . user interface: Well if you lost th industrial designer: Well , project manager: Well  industrial designer: is there not something f something more easily user interface: I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . user interface:  that's just  industrial designer: No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and  b  perform a a some kind of  . You do not want another device , which can be  everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . project manager: Yeah , m maybe  w we  we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . project manager:  maybe Sebastian should have  a detailed look later on and  come up with a solution , industrial designer: But  before I do that I w I want to warn you that  by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated project manager: And there are some implepe imp user interface: And do we even  prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning  function ? industrial designer: Well , I I think so , because  when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . user interface: It's a unique item  project manager: Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . project manager: and  I think  it's worth   looking and and probably more i interesting than  than the lights . user interface: And just about  the user interface , I came up with  an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . marketing: Well , t  we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function . project manager: Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players  and all kind of stuff . user interface: So industrial designer: we should save costs  by not implementing a lot of functions and  the money that we can save from that we should use for  having a nice design and  thinking about the user interface project manager: Yeah . Okay , industrial designer: and project manager: Ruud , how do you feel about that ?  do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to  a simple marketing:  well if we  include other  innovative functions  then they  might , project manager: user interface:  just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated ,  because it has many functions . industrial designer: Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very  friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but  nevertheless project manager: But but are we not in in the in the manual   if you have few buttons , no display ,    I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and  one button can  industrial designer: Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . project manager: But but how does how does the remote  report  r  give back to the user w in what state it is ? user interface: Yeah , I don't know yet . There's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . project manager: I know , but but if we use  like a stick , for example ,  industrial designer: W When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe  a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just  pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t  turned up the volume . marketing: And if you use that stick for volume control and channel  selection , you have the m two most important functions in one  button . user interface: But does it  I then should n just use  i instead of the stick ,  like many cell phones , just a round m well , project manager: Yeah , draw draw it on the board . Oh user interface: It's just an easy  way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . user interface: A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down project manager: Yeah , it can break down . marketing: And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it  attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . project manager: Okay , but w we still we're still in the question of    putting in advanced options .  we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , I think . user interface: Yes ? project manager: We need to  have the  the user function  the functions decided and   our target audience . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ?  which  incorporates all function available on the device ? project manager:  well , I do not want a full  it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want  the kind of functions , for example  th the most important are volume and  programme selecting . l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but user interface: Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to  two channels , when you have  something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can  change industrial designer: project manager: Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last  Mielsen . industrial designer: but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . project manager: And and do we want  the ten digits ? user interface: The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so . industrial designer: Well , are are you sure ? marketing: Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . industrial designer: but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think but you should  shou you should know that . industrial designer: Okay , user interface:  and I think the most industrial designer: I can imagine when project manager: I agree actually . user interface: Just elder elder people would would buy it , industrial designer: I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . marketing: Well user interface: but industrial designer: But if you're  a regular T_V_ user , and you just want  to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can  you can use  about ten buttons . industrial designer: Well , marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: but how how often do you watch all these channels ? marketing: and if if we And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . Don't you think ? project manager: Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the industrial designer: The design . marketing: Well project manager: You c you can d make them very fancy marketing: And project manager: by   Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . industrial designer: Okay , so you can experiment by  with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .  it might be expensive and  hard to implement , but it would be a solution  for project manager: Okay , speech . industrial designer: So  when you add  speech recognition to your remote control ,  it's very easy to change  the channel . industrial designer: So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . project manager:  If if we would  drop the ten digits industrial designer: But maybe when we  project manager: but keep the programme and the volume , industrial designer: It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find  find the remote control button  remote control function . industrial designer: There are some  hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . industrial designer: So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . project manager: But But but can we manage it bu  for the costs ? industrial designer: You have to do nothing for it . marketing: And  if we if we could inc  include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be  a big problem . marketing: 'Cause when project manager: Is a cradle very cheap ? industrial designer: It's Oh , it's very cheap .  I would like to hear  maybe maybe you all have th  things not  spoken about , yeah , but that are important .  are there other things about the market we should know ? marketing:  I think we dealt with the most important information . project manager: Sebastian ? industrial designer:  I just want to make a summary of all all things  spoken and  the different possibilities . So on the outside it looks easy , but  we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by  implementing  speech techniques ,  voice recognition , that these kinds of things .  there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement  fancy techniques , which  I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about  the the costs and  the things like  battery lifetime , energy saving . industrial designer:  another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons . If we just add   a chip which does the voice recognition ,  our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another project manager: Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board industrial designer: well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . user interface: But the cheaper the ch  the the chip or th what was it ? industrial designer: project manager: No , it's th industrial designer: The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . user interface: Well it then we should just  take a look at the costs and  especially for the voice recognition . project manager: I'm not sure how how we'll f  determine the costs , I will have a look at it . project manager:  I'm not sure how how that industrial designer: Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will  have a lo  look at it . project manager:  I'm don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out . project manager:  then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work ,  and I'm sure your personal coaches will  assist you with it . project manager: User Interface Designer ,  Roo , I would like to see the user interface c  concept . project manager: And  user interface:  the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis  decisions Sebastian makes . industrial designer: Well project manager: Well , i it should be easy , user interface: Well project manager: that's w w what we concluded . industrial designer: So we drop the voice recognition ? project manager: No no no , we didn't industrial designer: Or project manager: but it shouldn't be integrated industrial designer: Oh . project manager: yeah , it's of course it's user interface , but  i I was talking about really the design of the industrial designer: Okay <doc-sep>And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly . industrial designer: project manager: user interface: industrial designer: Well , I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and  user interface:  . B did you send us an email about this ? project manager: not yet , user interface: industrial designer: project manager: but if you want user interface: Yeah , we we received an email about this  d designs . project manager: Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ? industrial designer: user interface: Ah it's Okay . marketing: I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . user interface: 'Kay , we can project manager: So there are so we have three user interface: So there are three kinds of designs , that's all . project manager: So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? Any any volunteer ? industrial designer: I think our  responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager . user interface: Are you using the you are doing the in industrial designer: Yeah I I'm I'm Well , maybe we have okay so I industrial design . It was a little confusion about my  project manager: user interface: Ah industrial designer: but it's alright . industrial designer: Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done project manager: industrial designer: and what are your ideas about the project manager: About the design or Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ? industrial designer: Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess . industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno I project manager: And of course it should not be very costly . industrial designer: Well I I think that Norman and I would think about  the technical points and  we should discuss it in the next meeting , or user interface: Need to collect information .  , what is most important in a in a remote control ? What is the most important function aspect ?  . project manager: You won't user interface: Or or you can say for example ,  I want  to list all the programme tonight . Y you know , instead of  remote control it's doing the some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . project manager: I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . user interface: No , because no , project manager: S user interface: it's not very a lot . industrial designer: I I think if you want t to choose  from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use  w  I dunno marketing: I'm a okay . marketing:  the main  function of remote control is to have something in the hand project manager: In the hand . marketing: If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog user interface: Yeah . marketing: if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . industrial designer: marketing:  we have some or something , different technology but project manager: This is it's user interface: Yeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that  there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea project manager: industrial designer: but I I think that technically it would be  a little bit   more tricky to to achieve this than just to user interface: No . They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . user interface: And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons . industrial designer: Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to  navigate  through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so project manager: This is good idea . Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? industrial designer: Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen user interface: Good idea . industrial designer: and just  with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f user interface: I think I think that will be revol revolutionary . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: Because all the T_V_  the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . So I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff user interface: Okay . project manager: So we have five minutes to user interface: Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . project manager: Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we industrial designer: user interface: Five minutes . marketing: And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of user interface: Okay . marketing: So , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark  some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . industrial designer: Oh right so user interface: Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: Be before before writing you can  sit and that says what we what we said user interface:  . So so the most functional des  the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . The user can choose w which one they want , right ? industrial designer: Yeah , by content or by channel , user interface: By content or by channel . user interface: Okay , so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content . industrial designer: I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so user interface: Okay . And  industrial designer: I think that's the the things to do user interface: The main thing . user interface: So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get  the funct this is the functional designer ? That's the first aspect . project manager: So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ? And we'll discuss the other other aspects <doc-sep>marketing: user interface: industrial designer: marketing: industrial designer: project manager: user interface:  project manager: industrial designer: user interface: No , no . Not all the small buttons , you don't know project manager: Is this positive or negative , that  big buttons ? industrial designer: Big buttons , positive . industrial designer: All all small buttons like when you have  like a hundred buttons on your remote control , you won't know what they're working for . What are your experiences ? user interface:  well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the T_V_ set . And  I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED   a LED on the corner of the of the remote . And that if you push the button the LED  gives a light , and  and you see that it's working .  project manager: So and do they always have that ? user interface: Yeah , but No no no . marketing:  at home we have a T_V_ , a video  recorder , a D_V_D_ player , and a satellite receiver . But  i it it had a lot of buttons on it , and you didn't know which one was what . So what ideas do you have for it , for the new remote control ? What what does it have to have ? industrial designer: The weight . industrial designer: When you push a but a button on the T_V_ , then you hear some  some sort of bleep . industrial designer: marketing: Yeah I think it  from a marketing point of view , it also has to look nice . So you don't won't have to change the batteries  once a week or  once every two weeks "

        "Query": "What are the potential difficulties for researcher collaborations and networks after Brexit? How does the loss of funds due to leaving the European Union impact these collaborations and what are the possible solutions?",
        "Summary": "The impact of the Brexit deal on collaborations is still uncertain, particularly in relation to playing a role in Horizon Europe. Maintaining quality, impact, and growth in capacity is crucial for Wales. Dr. David Blaney believes that these efforts have already yielded positive results, such as increased research funding and a stronger presence in the international research market. However, the main challenge lies in securing sufficient funding. While the government recently allocated an additional \u00a36.6 million for research, this is not sustainable or adequate. The Welsh government has also expressed its vision for research and innovation, emphasizing the need for more investment in the Welsh research base to enhance competitiveness in accessing funding at a UK level.",
        "Article": "We've received apologies for absence from Suzy Davies, and I'm very pleased to welcome Angela Burns, who is substituting for Suzy this morning. Can I also welcome Si\u00e2n Gwenllian to the meeting? Si\u00e2n is joining us from her constituency office via video-conference. I'm currently registered as an associate lecturer at Cardiff Metropolitan University, although I haven't done any work for them for some time. We'll move on, then, to item 2 this morning, which is our evidence session on the higher education new academic year allocations. I'm very pleased to welcome David Blaney, who is chief executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and Bethan Owen, who is deputy chief executive of HEFCW. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions from Members, and the first questions are from Angela Burns. I just wanted to talk about, really, the financial sustainability of the higher education sector because, as we know, there's been all sorts of things going on in the press. So, can I just start with, actually, quite a technical question and ask you what the financial indicators look like for the universities here in Wales, and are there particular indicators that are really flashing warning signals to you? dr david blaney: Well, shall I just start with a couple of contextualising comments and Bethan can come in then with some detail? It's undeniably the case there are financial challenges facing our universities. They result from three main causes: one is the impact of the demographic dip of 18-year-olds, which is deeper and longer in Wales than it is elsewhere in the UK. And, of course, we also have current uncertainty as a result of the Augar review in England, and whether that might play into Wales, and also Brexit. These challenges are not unique to Wales; the majority of the UK universities are actually taking out cost one way or another. Before the Diamond review of fees and funding in Wales, there was a pre-existing funding gap in resource between England and Wales, and even now, that's still the case. So, Welsh higher education institutions are approximately \u00a340 million worse off than they would be in the English system. That's a challenge, and that is a result from a political decision to invest in students, and that's fine. We're not seeing a crisis; we are seeing some real challenges, and there is a distinction, I think, between\u2014. We have to understand, though, that taking out cost to balance the books has a detrimental effect on the capacity. Obviously it impacts on the people who lose their jobs immediately, but there's a medium to longer term impact on the capacity of the system to deliver for Wales. They are taking out capacity; they're not cutting at fat now, they're cutting out core capacity. And so, the range of the curriculum, the range of research and innovation, the range of the contribution that universities can make will be diminished by that. And against that backdrop, the introduction of the Diamond reforms is hugely important\u2014delivery of that is going to be really important\u2014and we are really pleased to see the Minister able to meet her commitments in respect of that. This forthcoming year will be the first year we see an increase in the resource, through us, to higher education. There are some very tired staff in universities, and we've seen some stuff in the press recently about some of the impact of stress there as well. angela burns am: Can I bring you back to the financial element of that? Can I just ask a question: what are the university reserves\u00a0looking like at present? dr david blaney: Here, I refer to my learned friend. There's a difference between the distributable reserves\u2014I don't have those numbers before me, but looking at reserves, what is more important are those reserves that are available as cash or liquid cash. So, universities have reserves, but a large amount of that is tied up in their estates, so they're not immediately realisable. So, one of the key measures that we're looking at, which is even more important than surpluses and deficit, is the operating cash that our universities are generating at the moment. When we look at operating cash in 2017-18, they were generating, as a percentage of income, about 7.6 per cent, which contrasts with nearly 10 per cent for the same year for English institutions. And that represents their capacity to generate surplus cash to meet their costs, which now, increasingly, include the costs of servicing their borrowings. So, again, because capital funding has not been as available to universities as it was, they've invested in their estates and that's largely been funded by borrowings. The costs of those borrowings have to be met on an annual basis, so that's becoming an increasing proportion of the operating cash that universities have. angela burns am: I just asked that question because I know that about four years ago, the universities were sitting on substantial reserves and were less than keen to deploy them back into actually using them for the students\u2014it was more about building up the war chest, if you like, of the universities. And I just really wanted to have an understanding of how that picture might have changed over the last four years and are they actually skinnier cats now, rather than before. bethan owen: We can get you that analysis, but even four years ago, I think the definition of exactly what's meant by reserves, it's really important to look at what are distributable reserves as opposed to the assets that universities have. bethan owen: And, there are also differences in the way that universities have secured funding for investing in their estates. So, for example, Cardiff University have had a bond rather than borrowing, which you draw down as you're spending. So, in the short term, the reserves of Cardiff will appear as though they have significant cash balances, but all of those are restricted for investment in the estate and, over the next two or three years, will be utilised for that. angela burns am: So, overall, you're painting a picture of a sector that's under a significant degree of financial stress, and this is obviously using your key financial indicators. Do you monitor each and every university, or do you wait for them to come back and tell you what their situation is? bethan owen: We monitor, we receive forecasts, five-year forecasts, and we meet frequently with all our universities now. It varies, depending on the risks of the universities, as to how frequently we meet, but we're actually meeting with every university because even the forecast that we received last July, the changes, even in the 12-month period, are significant enough for us to need a better understanding of what the latest position is. Although it had a turnover and income of \u00a31.5 billion, which had increased, nonetheless it had a small deficit of 0.4 per cent of income in 2017-18, which was an improvement on the deficit the year before of 1.7 per cent, but notably, again, the sector in England were looking at surpluses of 3 per cent to 4 per cent in the same period. The forecasts that we had this time last year were indicating that, for 2018-19, we should have a sector that's roughly in a break-even position, but that has to be caveated with waiting for new forecasts in July, where there will have to be a reflection of the pension costs, and there have been significant changes in pension costs, both for the teachers' pension scheme\u00a0and the universities' superannuation scheme as well, and those will be significant costs\u00a0that universities have to build into their forecasts at a time when their income, certainly their fee income, is not increasing, and that is the challenge. angela burns am: Are we going to lose any universities in the next couple of years? dr david blaney: I don't think so. As I said earlier on, we're not seeing a crisis, we're seeing really challenging circumstances for institutions to manage. At the moment, our sense is they are managing them, so one of the things we try to do is to make sure that, insofar as we can see it, we are making sure that the institutions are alert to the challenges they're facing, and are actually engaging those challenges properly, and we are seeing that at the moment. So I think what we will see if the pressure continues unabated is more costs being taken out, so more jobs being lost, more capacity being lost, but that's not the same as falling over. There is always the possibility of structural change within the sector, and that might be one of the solutions that institutions think about, but it's not a policy position, and it's not always a good short-term response to crisis anyway, actually. But I think, as I say, we're in a managed situation, but the challenges are quite acute. angela burns am: When you talk about structural change, are you referring to the fact that certain offshoots or divisions might close? I bring this up because I'm the Assembly Member for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, and I have had multiple representations from students, and their parents, who are about to go to Lampeter and who've been told that courses are being restructured, there's a massive staff loss, and they have concerns about whether the three-year commitment they're about to make to a course is going to be able to be sustained. So I am trying to drill down a little bit, because I think it's only fair for the students to know what they're up against, and also it's a bit like in the great depression\u2014you can start a run on something, can't you? Because if enough people believe it, then suddenly enough people will stop going to what is an excellent little university, really top-quality in medieval literature, in archaeology. And I'm just talking about one, but I know there are problems in other universities around Wales, so I just wondered if you could comment on that and also what processes you as HEFCW might have in place to protect any student who does find themselves in a situation where their course appears to be disappearing before their eyes. So, if we look at the debate that happened in the Senedd last week, from my reading of the transcript, it was actually quite a balanced debate where pretty much every contributor made reference to the contribution that higher education is making. There was reference to the national student survey scores, and in many ways Wales is the best place in the UK to come and be a student, because you are looked after properly in Wales. But there was also a perfectly legitimate exploration of whether or not there's a crisis, and if you look at the way in which that was represented in the media, the crisis bit stuck and the rest of it didn't. At the point where the sector is trying very hard to recruit students, it's really quite unhelpful that you get that sort of representation. So we do need to make sure, I think, all of us, that we try to avoid a situation where there can be media amplification of a problem that's not actually as acute as the media are portraying it, and that is very harsh. I'm not being critical of the political process here, but it has ripples and we do need to be careful that we don't start a run on this. In terms of the specifics at Lampeter, we understand that there are no plans to close any of the departments, and there certainly will not be plans to pull the rug out from under continuing students. So there's an absolute obligation on them to meet their commitments, and that's a contractual obligation anyway, so it's a legal obligation. But we also have a quality machinery that we operate where we would expect institutions to be able to demonstrate that they've put in place appropriate arrangements to ensure that students can finish their programmes of study. So they're not going to be recruiting students to programmes that they're not planning to continue\u2014they just are not going to do that. And if you think about it in a market context, it would be suicidal for a university to treat their students like that. angela burns am: But I have to ask these questions because the auditor was very clear that there was a material uncertainty in Trinity Saint David's financial plans. dr david blaney: Yes, I understand that, so let\u2019s come back to the material uncertainty. What I'm hoping to try and express is that we have absolute confidence that the institutions will not do the dirty on their students. They will look after their students and if they're recruiting to programmes, they are recruiting to programmes that they are planning to run, and run through to completion. And the expectations that we place on them in terms of our quality assurance machinery is precisely that\u2014when they are engaged in portfolio change, they have to look after the interest of the students that they currently have. In terms of our oversight and monitoring, our primary consideration, again, is the interest of the students. They are the people who have, in many ways, least influence over what happens in terms of the way an institution is managed. Although, they do have a voice and, actually, the arrangements for the student voice in Wales are, again, better than elsewhere in the UK. But, nonetheless, we do not wish to see students becoming innocent victims of difficulties of management and financing. Our institutional risk review process is fundamentally designed to make sure that institutions are grappling with their problems before they become a crisis. So, we have machinery, which has 70/80 different factors and hundreds of questions that we ask twice a year, to interrogate the performance of the institutions and to make sure that we are seeing them managing the issues that they're facing. So, it's not the challenges you face, it's the way you face your challenges\u2014it's a clich\u00e9\u2014and, at the moment, they are managing them, but if we were in any way concerned that they weren't, the people who are most at risk in that context are the students and we will be intervening to make sure that they were cited, and we do intervene when we have to. angela burns am: Well, following on from what you said, I've just got two really specific technical questions, then, to ask, because you said that you look across the whole scope to make sure that they are meeting all of their correct liquidity ratios and so on. So, considering how much is invested in their estates, are you happy that each university's estates strategy and its financing is prudent and has appropriate governing-body oversight in place? dr david blaney: Yes, so the estates strategies that institutions operate are overseen by either the full governing body or relevant sub-committees in respect of every institution, so there is proper governance oversight. And in all of those instances, there is staff and student engagement as well in the strategic approach on estates. So, the machinery is in place\u2014 angela burns am: Because it's the big thing that drives most of university borrowing, isn't it? dr david blaney: Indeed, it is. angela burns am: So, if our universities are on a sticky wicket, we just need to know that the borrowing that they're undertaking is absolutely prudently assessed and is appropriate. So, as long as you're content, if I can hear you say that\u2014[Laughter.] dr david blaney: Okay. We're content on two fronts: one is that the governance machinery within the institutions is structured appropriately to look at that, but also that if the institutions are wanting to engage in anything other than relatively trivial borrowing, they have to get our consent as well. And what we don't do is second-guess everything, but what we do do is make sure that the governing body, or its relevant committees, have been asking the right questions. bethan owen: Can I just add to that, then? angela burns am: Yes, of course. bethan owen: In asking for the forecasts, we have reinforced this year the importance of universities looking at different scenarios. So, to be looking at the demographic and maybe in the past, where there's potentially been growth in the system and universities have built that into their forecast, we have explicitly asked this year that we are provided\u2014not just the governing body\u2014with the scenario where there is no growth in the income. That's not the core forecast, but a scenario, so that it's quite clear how reliant the forecasts are on that growth, and if that growth doesn't come through, what the contingency plans are for ensuring that all the cost commitments can be met. And we should probably just differentiate between\u2014we have a role before borrowings are entered into, but all the best forecasts in the world can never quite predict, certainly what's happened in the last two years, probably, in universities. So, there are significant borrowings that are now committed to and the key measures we are looking at are universities' capacity to meet their covenants and their repayments under those borrowings, because that's essential for maintaining their liquidity. angela burns am: Which actually, neatly, thank you, brings me to my last question, which is: have any universities broken those loan covenants or been close to breaking them, unable to pay their borrowings as and when they fall due? bethan owen: There was a significant change in accounting standards in 2015, financial reporting standard 102, so most universities had to renegotiate their covenants, but it was because the accounts were looking very different. The accounting standards brought about changes in how income was recognised and how some service concession arrangements, largely student accommodation arrangements, and pension costs, significantly, were recognised in the accounts. So, most universities have had to renegotiate covenants, but we're not aware of any who've had to renegotiate due to covenant breaches, other than one which the University of Wales Trinity Saint David disclosed in their financial statements\u2014that they did need to renegotiate their financing arrangements, which they have done earlier this year, and they have now negotiated new covenants. It's a core part of financial management in universities now that you manage your relationship with your lender as well as with us. Breaching covenants in themselves is different to doing that with your lender being unaware and the factors being within your control. So, again, from that perspective, we have the covenants built into our forecasts, we require the forecasts to show how the university are planning to be within their covenants. The nature of those covenants vary, but most of them require a measure of cash flow, a ratio between the cash generated and the cost of debt, so there is close monitoring that is required because of the borrowing in the system, as well as our ongoing monitoring as well. Just before we move on to Hefin David, can I just ask you what your view, then, is on the statement included by auditors in the accounts of Trinity Saint David that there is material uncertainty? bethan owen: Yes, I'll pick up on that. The material uncertainty largely relates\u2014there is a note in the accounts that explains the factors that are being taken into account, but it largely relates to some significant cash receipts that have been subject to timing delays and the fact that the timing of these is essentially outside the control of the institution. The main delay relates to the receipt of funding for the Egin project, which was due to be received from the Swansea city deal. That funding has been delayed, but the sums due to the university are still due to the university\u2014it's the issue of the timing of those receipts that is causing a cash pressure. Just in terms of cash flows, all universities have to ensure that they are maintaining enough cash in their system to meet their payments as they fall due. Most of their costs are incurred on a monthly basis, staff costs in particular, but the income flows into universities are now less regular. In days gone by, that funding would largely flow from us and that would also come on a monthly basis. A quarter of that money comes in in October, a quarter in February, and the majority of it, half of it, doesn't come into the university in cash until May. So, that's quite a different cash management scenario for universities to manage; it requires holding cash balances to do it. Just before I bring Hefin in, we're going to need to have a bit of agility, as Dai Lloyd would call it, in our questioning and our answers if we're going to cover the ground that we need to cover. hefin david am: How can we be assured that governance arrangements across the eight institutions are sufficiently rigorous but also consistent? dr david blaney: So, the first point to make, of course, is that universities are autonomous, as you know\u2014 hefin david am: I've just written 'independent and autonomous'. The university governing body obviously is an important part of the machinery, particularly in terms of generating constructive challenge for the executive within universities. The governing bodies all are expected to behave in a way that is consistent with the guidance produced by the Committee of University Chairs, the CUC guide, which identifies good practice. Just in terms of governing bodies, it's also important that governing bodies engage in a process of continual refreshing, because that gives you a greater variety of perspectives, which is important. But it\u2019s also important they have people who understand the higher education business as well as from other contexts. But I think our view would be that when you get an increase in the contextual pressures that we\u2019ve been discussing already this morning, the role of the governing body actually becomes even more significant. So, we have encouraged the sector, both the chairmen of the university councils, but also the vice-chancellors, to engage in a process of an independent review of governance in Wales. And it hasn\u2019t been hard for us to encourage that\u2014they have been keen to take this opportunity to take stock. The Welsh higher education system is part of a UK system\u2014they don\u2019t want to be a million miles away from the rest of the UK in terms of expectations, but there is scope in Wales, given the scale of the sector, to actually construct something that is more challenging, I think, in terms of expectations, than might be the common denominator across the UK, and maybe some more exemplification. It\u2019s going to be quite hard to do this, but I\u2019m very keen that we engage\u2014and the sector are up for this\u2014in governance culture, because, actually, you can do process checks and you\u2019ll have the right structure of committees and have the right sort of papers going, but, in the end, it\u2019s the dynamic within that room and who\u2019s asking which questions and how well informed they are, and whether it's an open culture or is it a defensive culture\u2014these are really what influences the quality of decision making. hefin david am: And how different are those cultures across institutions? dr david blaney: I think it\u2019s very hard to say. Typically, that\u2019s at a point where there are sufficient difficulties going on that we feel that we need to\u2014 hefin david am: Do you have the option to observe at any point? dr david blaney: We can't insist, I don't think. But in the main, actually, our presence would change the dynamic of that anyway, so I'm not sure that's necessarily helpful. But we are keen to see what we can achieve with the sector in addressing these issues of what constitutes constructive challenge. Is your aim to see consistency in the same approaches, then? dr david blaney: I think we\u2019d like to see a consistent minimum set of expectations. In the end, it\u2019s about personalities, it\u2019s about people\u2019s background and it\u2019s about their knowledge. And we have a role to play in this as well, so we have a toolkit that we produce for governors, which, essentially, is a set of information that locates their university in the context of the UK, across a number of factors. So, if they had been told something that is not perhaps as true as it might be by the executive, they can see that in the data. Whether that toolkit needs a refresh\u2014I\u2019m sure it probably does, it\u2019s been there for a while now\u2014. So, part of that is what information we can provide to help governing bodies be properly informed as well. This is quite distant from Government\u2014unlike other institutions, where you can prescribe some of these approaches. dr david blaney: Yes, and in the end I don't think there's any pushback from the sector in terms of wanting to operate in accordance with best practice. hefin david am: So, what about risk appetite? Do you feel that any governing bodies are exhibiting what might be considered to be an imprudent risk appetite? dr david blaney: I don't think so, and this manifests itself in two ways. So, we would see this coming through in forecasts, and we would see it coming through in requests for borrowings, predominantly. Our links into institutions are many and various, and we have our formal stuff, but we all have links into institutions that are informal and we\u2014. One of the beauties of the scale of the sector in Wales is we can see the institutions in a way that they can't hope to in England. But we have, in some instances, I think it's fair to say, helped institutions to think again about some of their aspirations. So, where we've seen things and we think, 'That just looks ridiculously optimistic,' we've just asked the questions. We don't say, 'No, you can't do that,' because they are autonomous, they make the decisions, but we try to make sure that they're asking the right questions. hefin david am: So, would you see that governing bodies are falling short in doing that themselves, in that, where they become strategic decisions that require due diligence, are the governing bodies themselves presenting that challenge? Or the fact you've just said that, does that suggest to us that, actually, they are falling short? dr david blaney: I think there's a mixture of things going on. We have a slightly different perspective and we have a perspective that is very intimately informed in terms of how the institution is performing. So, you have a governing body with a range of perspectives, and you will also have people who are very committed and very enthusiastic about the institution, and just occasionally it's helpful to get a slightly external perspective on these things. So, I don't think it's a shortfall as such, but I just think\u2014 hefin david am: The kind of honest broker role, kind of. dr david blaney: The machinery depends on having a body like HEFCW doing some of that role, and the people who lend money to institutions are absolutely clear about that. So, we have relationships with the banks; they come and see us every now and again\u2014typically not to talk about individual clients but just to talk about what we do and how we do it. Interestingly, for example, when Michael Barber got up before Christmas and said there will be no bail-outs of universities, we had banks on the phone to us within a couple of days, wanting just to talk about how it is in Wales and is it still how it used to be. So, it's not really a governance failure; it's just that the machinery includes us. And one of the things, from a distance\u2014, I've been involved in different ways in an institution, and looking at the institutions from a distance. Do you find that the relationships between executive teams and governors is effective, and are they sufficiently robust and challenging as well? Those executive permanent staff and the governors\u2014is there challenge there? dr david blaney: I would say, in the main, yes. Occasionally, we help the governors to ask the right questions, so occasionally that external perspective we've just discussed is helpful in that regard. Actually, there are times when there are tensions between the executive and governing bodies, inevitably\u2014that's not something that's remarkable\u2014and we can feel that as well. hefin david am: And that can become apparent from a public point of view as well\u2014you know, media reports and\u2014. dr david blaney: Yes, sometimes these things can spill, and the governing bodies also include student representation, staff representation, who are typically union reps, and so, you know, there are all sorts of\u2014. I'm not in any way saying that people are indiscreet, but there are all sorts of interests that are sitting around that table that have to be managed within a governance context. And these tensions are not all-out war, but there are sometimes differences of view and they have to be worked through, and that's governance working properly, I think. hefin david am: Okay, which is\u2014some of the work you've suggested will help towards that. hefin david am: And a last question: you've identified one university as high risk, five as medium, and two as low in the short to medium term. You're obviously not going to tell us which, but what I'm interested in is the direction of travel, and whether those that are 'medium'\u2014are they at any point at risk of becoming 'high' in the near future? dr david blaney: I think it's fair to say that the direction of travel is that we're seeing an increased risk profile in the sector in Wales, and it's about the financial pressures that we've already discussed this morning. And that is why the efforts that the Minister has gone to to secure the Diamond settlement, and, indeed, other bits of money now and again, are so important. So, she's doing what she can, and that's really good, but we always knew that, between the point of the Diamond recommendations being made and the full implementation, there was going to be a valley to cross. So, the amount of funding was always going to be under pressure; there's a demographic dip, and there are the other contextual factors we've discussed. And the institutions have been working very hard to try not to take cost out now that they really don't have to take out, because they don't want to reduce capacity, which they'll struggle to recover again when the financial position improves. So, they are seeing deficits, which are managed deficits, where they're spending more than their income in order just to keep the capacity in. hefin david am: And, if you're back in a year or two's time, the next few years, are we confident that there won't be more in the high-risk category? You said you don't see collapse, but are we confident there won't be more in the high-risk category? dr david blaney: Well, I think what I would always say about this process is that it doesn't guarantee 100 per cent accuracy. HEFCW is innately cautious as an organisation, so I'm not going to say we're confident, but that doesn't mean to say we're worried either. So, to answer my question: are we likely to see more in the high-risk category or not? dr david blaney: We might. bethan owen: And, just to add, I think the key bit of that is maintaining the attractiveness of Welsh universities to students, because a large proportion are coming not from just Wales, but from England and internationally\u2014so, that's a key part\u2014and also that our research portfolio is invested in, and that also brings economic benefits. So, I think those are the two that we are [correction: need to be] able to maintain: the institutions as attractive options for students, and that our research capacity is invested in. sian gwenllian am: Just in the interest of transparency, are you able to tell us which universities are in which categories of risk? dr david blaney: We don't publish that; we publish numbers. hefin david am: They didn't even try to\u2014[Inaudible.] [Laughter.] lynne neagle am: Okay. Can you explain your overall approach to the 2019-20 allocations and what your priority for allocations has been? bethan owen: We publish our funding allocations, and we published the 2019-20 allocations on 4 June. For 2019-20, we're allocating \u00a3149 million, and, as David said, this is the first year that we've been able to start putting funding, additional funding, in from the Diamond recommendations for investment in the sector. So, that means we've been able to increase our recurrent teaching funding by \u00a37 million\u2014not a significant amount, but it's a start. And we have maintained QR, which is our funding for research, quality research, and postgraduate research, at least at the same levels of \u00a376 million, as it's been that in previous years. We've increased part-time funding by \u00a31 million to \u00a326 million, and we've started to increase support for expensive subjects\u2014that's medicine, dentistry and conservatoire provision\u2014and higher cost subjects\u2014those are the sciences and the STEM. So, we made a start on that and increased that support by about \u00a36 million to \u00a320 million in total. And, in addition to that, we have strategic funding that we're maintaining for Reaching Wider projects and the S\u00ear Cymru project. And then, in addition to our recurrent funding, we have had strategic funding in our remit letters for the last two years. So, we're developing programmes for civic mission, community engagement, collaborations between higher education and further education, and, more recently, we had funding at the end of March to start to implement the recommendations of Graeme Reid's report for research investment, and also for developing mental health and well-being. That strategic funding is very welcome, but to be able to build those activities into our core funding, which we hope Diamond will bring, would be more sustainable for institutions. How do your allocations to the 2019-20 academic year support and incentivise collaboration between HE and FE? dr david blaney: So, there are probably two dimensions to this. First of all, we have provided \u00a33.5 million of separate funding specifically targeted to improve and increase collaboration between HE and FE. So, we put out a circular inviting proposals for that, and it was competitive, so we funded what was the best of the proposals, and we constrained it to be available only to pump-prime new activity or to add value to existing activity, but not just to keep things ticking over. We had seven bids submitted from across the three Welsh regions on a whole range of activities, which we probably haven't got time to go into now. I've got a long list here, but, for example, in south-east Wales, the University of South Wales is leading on a bid partnering with Cardiff University, Cardiff Met, with the Open University and all the FE players in the region. We tried to get it within regions, because that's how you get the biggest impact for learners in the area and also for smaller enterprises in terms of innovation work. And then we direct fund a couple of FE institutions for delivery of higher education for historical reasons, and we also have our funding going through to support franchise activity between HE and FE. There are about 5,000 students who are studying HE programmes under franchise in FE colleges in Wales, and our funding method has, historically for some time now, protected that money. So, we try to prevent universities from taking the money out of franchise and onto campus, because we think it's important to try to encourage local provision within particular localities. And, certainly in areas where public transport infrastructure is perhaps not what it might be, for people to move to universities can be quite a disincentive, so\u2014. Then, finally from me, the council's remit letter for the 2019-20 academic year from the Minister does ask you to consider how you'd increase openness and transparency around the use of fee income. So, what are the issues here, and how will you take this forward? bethan owen: The reporting of the income and expenditure is largely provided, probably more so in narrative form in the accounts and the financial statements and annual reports of institutions. A number of institutions also provide graphs and more easily accessible information to understand the income and expenditure of universities. There are examples of good practice across the sector in presenting as simply as possible what the income sources are for universities and how they spend their money. And we're going to be working with the Welsh universities and sector bodies to improve the accessibility of that information for Welsh institutions. More transparent reporting of income and expenditure, and not just fee income, is actually very important for understanding how income cross-flows work in universities. Some reasonably simplistic analyses can assume that all the student fee just covers the direct costs of academic provision, but there's much more to the student experience than that, so there are costs: there are the infrastructure costs, the student support costs, even the community engagement and all the research activities bring benefits to the teaching and fee provision. So, more transparency of all the universities' income sources and expenditure and a better understanding of the income cross-flows and why you can't look at universities in isolation of student provision and research, you have to look at the whole\u2014so, we'll be working with them to improve that information. We're going to go to Hefin David now for some questions on part-time student funding. hefin david am: Part-time student numbers are bucking the trend in Wales, as I understand it, and we are seeing a bigger increase in Wales of part-time numbers than elsewhere in the UK. How is that going to be sustainable within current arrangements? bethan owen: We've allocated \u00a326.5 million in 2019-20\u00a0to support part-time provision, and we have been able in 2019-20 to fund some growth. So, there is growth in that funding to allow those institutions and incentivise those institutions who have recruited more students than last year to continue to do so. That came at an overall additional cost of \u00a31.9 million, and, based on what we're hearing from student support, we're expecting to see that requirement increase. So, it's one of the areas where we'll need to look at how we prioritise Diamond funding. And at the moment, our intention\u2014but subject to knowing the quantum of it\u2014is to continue to support and fund growth in part-time provision. hefin david am: So, is it possible\u2014? With the Welsh Government's policy of developing lifelong learning, is it possible that will be ever spread more thinly? dr david blaney: That is the challenge, and there's a piece of work that we have in our sights to look again at part-time and what it is and what the various drivers are. There's a temptation, I think, at times, to see it solely in terms of skills for an economy, and it is important for reskilling and upskilling, but actually, it's important for other things as well. If we see higher education solely in terms of skilling an economy, we've missed an important part of the contribution that higher education makes. But part-time is really quite difficult, because there's part-time that is about upskilling, part time that's about reskilling, there's part-time for social purposes, there's employer-supported part-time, there's student\u2014. dr david blaney: Well, there is a sense that they are more price sensitive, yes, and so the support regime that the Government is putting in place is important, and that probably has made a difference to the numbers of part-timers entering the system this last year. But I think we need to stake stock of what is important about part-time, what the market will deliver, what the market won't deliver, what we should fund and so on. And there's a complexity around all that, as I've indicated, which we need to do a bit of work on with the sector, with the student body as well, just to take some stock of this over the next year or so. hefin david am: Could we end up seeing significant fee increases for part-time students? dr david blaney: My sense is we won't. The Government wishes us to monitor, so we monitor, and that in itself is not straightforward, actually. There's a limit to how much a fee increase would be acceptable to the part-time market. I don't think we'll see massive fee increases; we might see a bit, but we won't see masses, I don't think. We've got some questions now on funding for research and innovation, and also we'd like to talk a bit about a replacement for European Union funds. If I could turn specifically to research, we know, of course, that both the Diamond and Reid reviews called for QR funding to be maintained in real terms, but the allocation is exactly the same for 2019-20 as it has been for the past nine years. Have you carried out any kind of assessment of the impact of this level of research funding on universities and, indeed, on the Welsh economy? dr david blaney: I'm sorry; I missed the beginning of that because I couldn't hear this headset. I was talking about the Diamond and Reid reviews at the beginning of my question and the fact that they had recommended that QR funding should be maintained in real terms. The reason the sum hasn't increased is because we haven't had enough money to be able to increase it and still meet the obligations we have to other bits of the HE system. Both Ian Diamond and Graeme Reid were very clear about the importance of being able to invest in our QR research funding, for a number of reasons. The capacity of the sector to be able to respond to funding opportunities elsewhere in the UK and across the rest of the world is itself determined by the size and the strength of the research base, which is sustained by QR funding. If they go for UK-based competitive research funding, that is typically constructed on the absolute assumption that QR will be part of that mix. So, they tend to fund to 80 per cent of the actual cost of the research, with the expectation that QR will plug the gap. And we know that, although the Welsh research base is extraordinarily productive, and really is punching above its weight in many ways\u2014and I mentioned earlier the impact of the research base in the last research excellence framework\u2014we know that, actually, it could do so much more, if it just had more scale. So, we fully endorse the reports from both Ian Diamond and Graeme Reid that QR is important, and it's important also to be able to allow institutions to invest in research areas that emerge over time. It's almost impossible for a body like us, far less the Government, to know where these emerging strengths are going to come from, and QR provides the flexibility for institutions, which is absolutely fundamental to keeping the research base dynamic. sian gwenllian am: Therefore, you do have concerns that this isn't increasing\u2014you have that concern of a lack of increase in the level of investment. But has any particular assessment been made of the impact of not increasing that funding? dr david blaney: So, there is\u2014. Graeme Reid's report produced an assessment of the correlation between QR funding and capacity to generate funding from other sources, and there's a very close correlation\u2014 sian gwenllian am: Has HEFCW done any assessment to look at the effect of underfunding research, to all intents and purposes? dr david blaney: Not directly. sian gwenllian am: Your remit requires you to encourage universities to continue to develop one particular element of research, which is educational research. How does your allocation for 2019-20 contribute to that in terms of pedagogy and educational research specifically? dr david blaney: Bethan, did you want to say something on this? bethan owen: I was just going to add that, when we look at the funding that comes into our sector in Wales, compared with the rest of the UK, it's easy to see from the figures that our percentage of income that comes from research is smaller than in England, so the figures show that we receive less of the money that's available, which is a factor that results from us having less QR as a percentage, so we're in a situation where we get less of that UK funding that's available as well. sian gwenllian am: So, there's a knock-on to that; that's what you're trying to say. But from the point of view of my question on educational research\u2014? dr david blaney: So, we have provided funding in 2017-18 and 2018-19 to WISERD Education, which is a research collaboration between a number of the Welsh universities, specifically looking at educational issues, and we're providing additional funding to that to add value to the Welsh Government's existing evaluation of the progress of pioneer schools in developing the three-to-15 curriculum in Wales. I won't go into the full detail of it now, but it's a five-partner project feeding into this with researchers from Cardiff, Cardiff Met, Trinity Saint David, Aber, Bangor and the University of South Wales. So, it's a collaborative effort, and we have, in the past, also funded WISERD Education, so it's an important research facility and increasingly being used, I'm delighted to say, by Welsh Government in underpinning its own policy thinking. sian gwenllian am: And likewise, in 2019-20, there will be allocations specifically for this. Well, could you provide the remit letter from\u2014[Inaudible.]\u2014do that? You have to do everything in the remit letters. dr david blaney: We do what we can to pay due regard to the remit letters, as the wording goes. sian gwenllian am: And then turning to the impact of the loss of funds were we to leave the European Union. Of course, this is going to have a far-reaching impact on future research, and the Reid review has made recommendations to mitigate this impact. So, what assessment have you made of how allocations will be able to help universities to transition away from EU funding? dr david blaney: So, again, the Reid review has done a lot of the heavy lifting in terms of an impact assessment for us. There has been an additional \u00a36.6 million allocated for research very recently by the Government, which we have put out specifically in line with some of the recommendations from Reid. So, that's a start, but that's not sustainable funding, and it's not enough, really, but it is a good and welcome start. Reid was also not just talking about the money, but also talking about the way in which the Welsh research base both represents itself and also engages with UK-wide developments. And in response to that, we have recently issued our own vision for research and innovation, which was developed over a number of months, following the Reid report closely, working with stakeholders, including the Welsh Government, in order to try and set a vision for how we respond to the challenges facing research in the future, including the reduction, potentially, of access to EU funds. A lot of that requires investment in the Welsh research base in order to be able to go for competitive funding at a UK level. Since it seems possible at least, and possibly even likely, that any money retrieved from not having to invest in the EU will sit in London rather than necessarily being devolved to the devolved administrations\u2014we understand fully the Welsh Government's position on that, and we don't disagree with it. But either way, we need a research base that's able to compete, and that's why the investment recommendations of Reid are so important. I think Reid was saying that there may be pots of money out there that aren't being accessed at the moment by Welsh universities. Are you able to help then within that process? bethan owen: One aspect that we do intend to fund\u2014and this is from Diamond, as well as Reid\u2014is to place funding back into the system for innovation. We're consulting currently, with the intention, if the funding is available to us, clearly, in the year 2020-21, to provide \u00a315 million back into the sector in innovation funding. sian gwenllian am: Is that part of the UKRI funding? There is some \u00a37 billion in the hands of that organisation, as I understand it, and there may be some possibilities there too. bethan owen: That \u00a315 million will be money that comes from us, but the intention is that the money will go in in order to improve universities' ability to access that funding from UKRI. So, Innovate UK would be the part of UKRI\u2014and that we improve our ability to get funding from outside Wales. And, then, Graeme Reid says the same thing in terms of research\u2014that we need more funding to do the same thing there. dr david blaney: And, then, there's also the recommendation from Reid that Wales needs to be better embedded in the conversations that are going on on a UK-wide basis, so the Welsh Government has established a presence in London in respect of research, and we have a colleague in HEFCW who is fractionally embedded in the United Kingdom Research and Innovation specifically to respond to that recommendation. And that is actually paying dividends; we are strengthening our relationship with the UK machinery, which is essential if we're to understand where they're heading and what their funding bids are all about, and even to be able to influence those. lynne neagle am: Okay, Si\u00e2n? sian gwenllian am: So, as far as research is concerned, it's not all doom and gloom. There is money coming in and if the Government, as it is able to, can find money and can invest in this area, then that will help. Just a couple of questions from me, then, before you close: what is your recent work on the 'basket of goods' show regarding student accommodation costs? And have any institutions used their 2019-20 fee and access plans to make commitments to more affordable accommodation for under-represented groups? dr david blaney: First of all, on the basket of goods, the work we're doing now\u2014we're currently in train in terms of analysing the data in respect of the basket of goods, so this is slightly premature, but our early look at the data indicates that there are no increases in costs, accommodation or other, that would cause us concern. So, it doesn't look like institutions are succumbing to the temptation to up their income streams from other costs. In terms of the fee and access plans, the sector has committed over \u00a328 million of investment in student support-related activities from the fee and access plans, and that includes, in many instances, bursaries that are designed to help students cope with the costs of accommodation and the cost of living more generally. The support is provided for a range of purposes, but a couple of examples, just very quickly: Trinity Saint David, since we've talked about them a lot today, they offer \u00a31,000 bursary to care leavers, which is in addition to local authority support for care leavers. Bangor also offer targeted support for care leavers, and these are often also extended, so they apply not just in term time, but throughout the holiday time as well, because people still need to live during the holidays. And just one final question from me then, going back to Trinity Saint David: are you concerned that the governing body of Trinity Saint David has taken decisions that have led to that material uncertainty, and is that unprecedented in Wales? dr david blaney: My view is that the decisions that the governing body made were, in our view, perfectly rational decisions to have made, given the information they had at the time. So, what's happened is that a number of unforeseen events have arisen, which, actually, I don't think it's reasonable to expect them to have foreseen, and it's just a combination of these that has caused the cash pressure. So, I don't see this as a governance failure, and they are engaging with those challenges. We've come to the end of our time, so can I thank you both for attending and for answering all our questions this morning? You did say that you would give the committee a note on reserves for the last four years, so we'd be grateful if we could receive that. Paper to note 1 is a letter from me to the Deputy Minister requesting further information for our scrutiny of the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. Paper to note 2 is a letter from me to the Children's Commissioner for Wales also asking for further information to pursue our scrutiny of the Bill. And paper to note 3 is a letter to the Minister for Education asking for an update on the framework for young people educated other than at school. Item 4, then, is a motion under Standing Order 17.42 to propose that we resolve to meet in private for the remainder of this meeting and for the whole meeting on 10 July<doc-sep>gareth rogers: Good morning, and welcome to today's meeting of the Children, Young People and Education Committee. Unfortunately, the Chair is unable to attend today, so in accordance with Standing Order 17.22 I call for nominations for a temporary Chair for the duration of today's meeting. gareth rogers: As there's only one nomination, I declare that John Griffiths has been appointed as temporary Chair. Thank you all very much, and item 1 on our agenda today is introductions, apologies, substitutions and declarations of interest. We will move on then to item 2, and our inquiry into the impact of Brexit on higher and further education, and our first evidence session. I'm very pleased to welcome the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales here today, and Dr David Blaney as chief executive, and Bethan Owen, director of institutional engagement. I wondered if we could start off with you telling us what evidence you can see that the Brexit process has had any impact on Welsh higher education so far. dr david blaney: Can I preface the response by just reminding you that we are, by contract and by role, apolitical, and a lot of the judgments about the impact of Brexit essentially reflect where people sit politically in terms of whether they think it's a good thing or a bad thing? We're not going to go there, obviously, today, so we'll stick to the facts as we can see them, and hopefully we'll be able to help you, but there are areas where we are unable to help. But even in terms of your assessment of whether this is going to be a good thing or a bad thing, a good impact or a bad impact, some of that inevitably in the end becomes a matter of your politics on it, so we will be as careful as we can be on that. In terms of the impact of Brexit on higher education, clearly, the significance here is about the contribution that higher education can make to Wales. So, we fund provision; we don't fund providers, technically, although obviously there's not much provision without providers. So, we are interested in the sustainability of higher education providers, but fundamentally the issue is: what does the HE system in Wales do for Wales, and what impact might Brexit have on the capacity of the system to continue to deliver for Wales? So, we know that universities make annually about \u00a35 billion of impact; 50,000 jobs. Of course, in Wales, all of that economic impact is really very significant, and uncertainty about the relationships and the arrangements with Europe is one of the most significant issues confronting university management at the moment. We can identify at the moment the extent to which the HE sector in Wales is exposed to sources of income that are located from the EU, so EU students, structural funds, and EU research funding, and so on, from the EU. We can identify some of that, but, actually, what happens in the future is much harder to be clear about. We are beginning to see some impact in terms of applications from EU students and I'll ask Bethan to share some details on that in a moment. We're also beginning to pick up, only anecdotally, some signs that there are increasing difficulties in the UK sector, and the Welsh sector as part of that, in playing in some of the EU collaborative research activities. And that, I think, just reflects the extent to which EU partners consider that British partners might be a stable partner as we go through this transition period. We don't have data on that\u2014that's anecdotal\u2014but there are signs that some of those relationships are beginning to become a little bit more difficult. In terms of the financial impact of that, clearly, if it is accepted that the UK is a net contributor to the EU then, presumably, some of the money\u2014we're almost immediately straight into politics if you're not careful\u2014but some of the money will be available back to the UK, and the extent to which Wales benefits or not from that returned money is a function of the political relationship between the Welsh Government and Her Majesty's Government. It's not necessarily the case that Wales will always lose out in that relationship, but that will become a matter of politics. There's a broader dimension, which is about the economic impact of Brexit on the UK economy and how much tax revenue there is and all of that. I think it's very hard for us to be definitive about how that's going to play out. But we can certainly anticipate some turbulence and exactly how that plays for institutions remains to be seen.\u00a0We can touch later on on the extent to which they are sighted on\u00a0this and preparing for it. bethan owen: This is based on the UCAS\u00a0applications and the report that was published at the end of June, 30 June.\u00a0The European Union-domiciled applicants to Wales have decreased by 8\u00a0per cent, which contrasts with a 2\u00a0per cent increase for English institutions, and non-EU\u2014so international students, not from Europe\u2014have also decreased by 9\u00a0per cent to Welsh institutions, again contrasting with a 7\u00a0per cent increase in England. Could I then just ask you what you see as the main pressures on the Welsh higher education sector at the moment? bethan owen: The funding position would be the main pressure. The recommendations made by Sir Ian Diamond in his review of higher education funding and student finance are in the process of being implemented, and the changes to the student finance arrangements will take effect from this September. However, the recommendations for re-establishing funding at Welsh institutions are expected to take quite a bit longer. That funding, when it returns to institutions, is intended to re-establish funding for higher cost provision, both full time and part time; reinstate funding for innovation; and maintain, at the very least, the research funding in real terms. Universities, in the meantime,\u00a0are trying to minimise the cost reductions that they're making in order to maintain the infrastructure, so that when the funding comes they can get the best value out of it. For the research and teaching grant, though, we are still funding at a lower level\u2014\u00a312.5 million less\u2014then the starting point for the Diamond report, the 2015-16 starting report.\u00a0But we expect to be able to start introducing funding from 2019-20 to make a start on implementing Diamond. And it's probably important to note that the Diamond recommendations predated Brexit, therefore the challenges introduced by Brexit are in addition to those that the Diamond report was addressing. There is also the start of a reduction, both in Welsh-domiciled and English-domiciled applications to Wales. And the other pressures include pay and pension costs, not least the issues around the universities superannuation scheme pension fund, where there's potentially a significant increase in cost. Increased student expectations for modern facilities and infrastructure bring a requirement for capital expenditure and borrowing, which bring their own pressures. And finally, the uncertainty about potential consequences that could arise from the review in England of fees and funding\u2014the Augar review. john griffiths am: In terms of European Union students and enrolment, is Wales forecast to do less well than England and, if so, why might that be? bethan owen: They are not forecasting it. It's very difficult until the enrolments are made, and it's also very hard to see\u2014the data that we see is the UCAS\u00a0data. So, now, they have to find the full fee, whereas previously they were getting the grant in the same way as\u00a0Welsh students. So, I'm speculating that that might be having an impact as well on EU students' appetite to come. llyr gruffydd am: Well, that's straight into what I was going to ask, really, about what you think the factors are that led to this 8 per cent or 9 per cent drop in EU students applying to study in Wales, where we see a 2 per cent increase in England. Is that it, or are there other things that you've taken into account? What's your assessment of the reasons behind this? dr david blaney: It's very difficult to be definitive about the reasons, but I think there are probably two. The one that Bethan has already indicated, which is the change in student support arrangements for EU students, will have\u00a0an effect of perturbation.\u00a0That's probably relatively temporary\u2014let's hope it is\u2014as that settles down because, actually, the deal for EU students coming into Wales is no worse than that coming into England. Ours would be better because the fee level is slightly lower, but we do struggle in Wales in terms of the\u00a0Anglocentric nature of the media and so on. The other dimension is that when you're in a highly competitive recruitment market, you have to do what you can to look attractive. Part of that is about being able to invest in facilities, and\u00a0particularly buildings and kit, and the relative levels of investment between Wales and England over quite a long period of time now probably have an impact on that. Certainly, anecdotally I know, from my own family, that a lot of the choices have been made in terms of the state of repair of campuses and so on. There's something rational about that, isn't there? If you've got a system that is relatively better invested, then you're likely to have a better student experience because the resources are likely to be better. We saw a sort of similar but opposite effect when the \u00a39,000 fee maximum limit came in, and some institutions, mostly in England\u2014there was one in Wales\u2014chose to pitch their fee levels really quite low, relative to that \u00a39,000, and caught a cold in the student recruitment market because fee levels denote quality in the student mind.\u00a0So, the price sensitivities work quite differently. So, again, if you've got a relatively better invested part of the system, then that might well be one of the reasons why it looks more attractive. llyr gruffydd am: That latter factor would affect the whole of the cohort, not just the international recruitment, of course. The implementation of the Diamond recommendations is crucial to that because that's re-balancing where the policy of investment goes. mark reckless am: If I heard you correctly earlier, you said that the applications from non-EU students were also down by 8 per cent or 9 per cent. So, forgive me a certain scepticism\u00a0about the explanation of the fall in the EU students being that they did get the fee grant and now they do not. If that's the explanation, why are we seeing the same fall in non-EU applications? dr david blaney: Well, I think the Welsh domiciled are also now having to face the prospect of finding a loan for the whole of the fee. There's also a demographic dimension here with the downturn in the 18-year-old school-leaver profile, and that actually is happening in Wales at a slightly later point than in England. mark reckless am: But this is non-EU students, and I think you said, Bethan, an 8 per cent or 9 per cent fall in them as well. mark reckless am: All English or all Welsh? bethan owen: Well, I contrasted the Welsh position with the English position where they were seeing growth. If you look, then\u2014and we don't have the detailed information, but, again, what UCAS publish is some analysis by tariff. They analyse by type of institution\u2014in other words, the grades that you need to get into institutions\u2014and there is a trend for growth being in the higher tariff institutions. So, there's a mix effect in there as well, and I think there's undoubtedly an element of perception of how welcome overseas and international students are, and that's something that we know the sector are working on with Government. mark reckless am: Why would that affect Wales\u00a0more than England? Do you think there's been perhaps too great a negativity about Brexit in the sector? bethan owen: I think it's the mix of institutions that we have. When we look at the mix of institutions that we have, we will probably see a differential impact between Cardiff University and others. john griffiths am: Okay, Mark? Sorry, David, did you want to add anything? dr david blaney: I was just going to say that we would expect to see quite differential performance in the English sector, so the overall numbers are being brought up by substantial increased performance with some of that sector, and it's a question of how many of that type of institution you have in Wales. mark reckless am: So, performance is increasing amongst the English universities, but not amongst the Welsh, you think. dr david blaney: I think performance is increasing, but increasing substantially with some of the English sector, not all of it. So, you get an average for the sector that is increased performance, but actually the stronger players within that sector, with the stronger international profiles, are bringing that up, and we have fewer in Wales that have that sort of presence. darren millar am: Would it be fair to say, then, that the universities over the border in England are better at selling themselves internationally than our Welsh institutions? Or is it just this fact that we've got fewer very high tariff universities versus the English market? dr david blaney: I suspect, and this is speculation\u2014I suspect that it's a bit of both. I would then come back to the point I was making about the Anglocentric nature of the UK media. darren millar am: But, forgive me, don't international students just look at the UK as a whole? How are we comparing to Scotland, for example, or Northern Ireland, in terms of their universities? Do you have a comparative figure for Scottish universities? bethan owen: I haven't got that one with me for now, but there will be one in the data. bethan owen: Again, it's a combination of being part of the UK but differentiating, and the ability to differentiate the strengths of Wales, so attracting those students to Wales specifically, on top of the UK draw. dr david blaney: So, in terms of the efforts that have been made, there's a programme now that is being run by the sector in Wales\u2014it's 'Study in Wales'. But that is a determined collective effort to present Wales as a good place to study, with particular messages about what distinguishes studying in Wales from studying more broadly in the UK. In a sense, that is responding to the need to increase the presence of Wales in an international market. It will take a while to actually have an impact, but I think that's exactly the sort of work the sector need to be doing more of. mark reckless am: What are those messages on why prospective students should study in Wales? dr david blaney: One of them in particular is relative safety. We know that one of the considerations, particularly for parents of overseas students, is are they going to go to a safe environment, and we know that the perception of international students who study in Wales is that this is a comfortable and safe place to be. That's partly a function of the size of our larger cities\u2014quite a lot smaller than many of the cities in England. So, we've got a UK-quality system, a UK degree, and the strength of that brand is available in Wales, but it's available in a way that is safer and more supportive, I think is the messaging that's coming through. darren millar am: I just wonder to what extent you have been able to plan in your financial forecasts for the next few years ahead for the potential impacts of Brexit. What have you built in, if anything? bethan owen: In terms of our funding, we receive our funding annually, but the sector provides us with financial forecasts, and we use those for monitoring sustainability. We are due to receive a full forecast at the end of this month, and we obviously have updated information from institutions. darren millar am: And they're three-year forecasts that come through to you, aren't they? bethan owen: They are four plus the current year.\u00a0So, we've got numbers to 2019-20 at the moment, and expect to go to 2020-21. darren millar am: And what are the universities expecting? What do they anticipate? bethan owen: Well, for 2017-18, which is the year we're about to end now, they were expecting \u00a338 million income from European students, and approximately \u00a391 million from the various European programme funding sources, and that's about 8 per cent of the total income\u2014\u00a31.5 billion\u2014of the sector. The forecasts are assuming that that continues, albeit that institutions\u00a0have various scenarios that they have for all sorts of scenarios that we can all speculate on, and, as I mentioned earlier, the balancing act of maintaining infrastructure and\u00a0resources and staff in the short term is where we are at the moment, or where the sector is at the moment. And there are also signs that the banks and lending institutions are becoming a bit more risk-averse in providing borrowing to institutions, and of more differentiation between individual institutions being made than has possibly been the case in the past. The sector made an operating deficit, again looking at all Welsh institutions collectively last year, 2016-17, of \u00a317 million. And we're expecting a similar collective level of deficit for this financial year, if not slightly higher. Now, these are managed deficits and we are not currently seeing critical short-term cash availability issues in the\u00a0sector. However, the increase in funding from Diamond is a key part of enabling the sector to return to longer-term financial sustainability. You can manage in the short-term, but there comes a point when the big cost reductions and\u00a0infrastructure reductions have to be made. And, again, having mentioned the pressures on pay, pensions and other challenges, it is difficult to gauge whether, if those factors come into play as well, some of these cost reductions may have to be made before funding comes in to replace\u2014either Diamond\u00a0funding or the European replacement funding. darren millar am: So, would it be fair to say that, in terms of the funding arrangements, and, in terms of the student numbers, one reason why we've got this recruitment\u00a0problem is this lack of investment in the capital infrastructure that we've\u00a0seen in recent years because of the\u00a0financing arrangements from the Welsh Government, and the fee regime that we had previously, and\u00a0the student finance regime that we had previously, not getting more cash into our Welsh universities perhaps, and that, over the next few years, there's going to have to be much more significant investment in capital if we're to raise the game and be more competitive, yes? bethan owen: Yes, that would be fair to say. darren millar am: So, to what extent are they planning for more capital investment\u00a0in those financial strategies that they've been preparing and presenting to you? bethan owen: They are all planning for capital investment. This year, 2018-19, is the first time that we've had capital funding in our remit letter\u2014so, we've got \u00a310 million of capital funding, which is very welcome, with a prospect of a further \u00a320 million. That will make a difference, particularly\u00a0to those institutions who are not finding it as easy to borrow from financial institutions. However, there are internal governance processes that are putting tight restrictions and\u00a0expectations of what that money will be invested in. But they all have plans to do it and they\u00a0need the confidence that their forecasts and long-term future funding prospects are secure enough that they can get the confidence of borrowers then, and service the costs of those borrowers. What clarity is there from the Welsh Government at the moment in terms of how much they anticipate the Diamond dividend will be, and what proportion of that\u00a0is going to be released to HEIs in the future? bethan owen: I was very carefully not describing it as a dividend\u2014a re-establishing of funding that we had in the past for higher cost and innovation and maintaining research funding. The timescales are difficult, because we have an annual remit letter, and we can work with Welsh Government officials, and they can only give us a sense of when they think the funding will be released. But 2018-19 is\u00a0the start of the system, and because of cohort protection\u2014so, protecting those students who came in on a different deal to the deal from 2018-19\u2014in the early years there is an element of double cost; there's a cost of seeing out the old system and the different cost of implementing the new system. So, at the moment, we're certainly not in a position to tell the sector with any degree of certainty what funding would be beyond what we've allocated for 2018-19, with some sense of what 2019-20 numbers we're working with because we allocate our money over an academic year\u2014so, by definition, we've already made assumptions of four months of the 2019-20 funding, albeit that's not approved yet in the budgetary process. darren millar am: But you're not being given a steer at all as to what you expect the additional resource that you might have to make available to Welsh universities might be as a result of Diamond. dr david blaney: I think it's fair to say that officials have been as helpful as they can be with us, in terms of the planning assumptions we make and indications about whether or not we are being too ambitious or not ambitious enough. So, I think they're being very helpful; as Bethan said, they're constrained by the process\u2014they can't pre-empt a budget process. The other question I think you asked was how much of the money released by the new arrangements will come into higher education. At the moment, we are expecting all of it to come into higher education, as the product of the arrangement between the current Cabinet Secretary and the current First Minister. The extent to which any changes there cause that to come under threat is something I can't judge at the moment. But we have had in our remit letter from the Cabinet Secretary a clear indication that we can expect our resource to grow over the next few years, as the Diamond process unfolds. llyr gruffydd am: Bethan said in an earlier answer that, I think, the financial forecasting from universities forecast something pretty consistent in terms of what they're hoping to be\u00a0receiving in income, for example. So, does that tally, really, or are they going to be recruiting additional students from the UK market or\u2014? What's the plan? bethan owen: I was\u00a0reflecting on the last point when we had consistent information across the sector. bethan owen: I'm expecting that the forecast that we get at the end of this month will reflect the reduced applications we've seen, and an element of that will be reflected in reduced improvements\u00a0as well. So, we don't really know, then, whether\u2014it's unlikely that they are going to expect a consistent fee income, really. dr david blaney: I think it's fair to say we would expect them to respond to what they're seeing in the UCAS process. Even if they didn't, they would all, in any case, have sensitivities for what they would do if things don't come out in the way they hope. And if they didn't have that then we would be on their case, of course, because we want them to be properly sighted. darren millar am: Can I just ask, in terms of the impact of Brexit, have you done any assessment of what you think might happen, or have any of the institutions made available to you any assessments of what they think is likely to happen to their individual institutions, going forward? You've mentioned scenarios earlier on, David, so what scenarios have you set out? dr david blaney: There's a Welsh Government HE Brexit working group, which is chaired by one of the Government directors, and we sit on that. And we have provided that group with early summaries of the risks and the potential impact, in terms of the exposure of the sector to EU-sourced funding. We have, as part of that working group, explored those issues that it would be really very helpful for either the Welsh Government to try to put in place or for the Welsh Government to persuade UK Government to do.\u00a0And I think, in our submission,\u00a0we identified\u00a0a number of areas of what we would consider to be a helpful action, and that has been worked through that working group. We know that it has informed Welsh Government's position, in terms of what it does and also in terms of the conversations that they have with\u00a0Her Majesty's Government. Beyond that, what we haven't done in that working group is share the work that institutions are doing individually to look at how they would\u00a0respond to different scenarios. We are not able to do that here either because, inevitably, they would have varying\u00a0degrees of unpalatability and they would have to be managed very, very carefully. You take cost out, which is essentially the response, you actually take people's\u00a0jobs out, and all of that\u00a0has to be managed carefully. So, that's not really a matter for public consideration, but we do know\u00a0that the institutions\u00a0are looking at a range of scenarios on what they\u00a0would do. Bethan mentioned earlier\u00a0on that the\u00a0current deficit for the sector is a managed deficit\u2014it's not something that has taken\u00a0them by surprise. They are responding to what they\u00a0see as the dip between where Diamond was reporting and where the money starts flowing. Similarly, I think we're comfortable\u00a0that there is a managed approach\u00a0to the scenarios that they're testing within institutions. The bigger issue really, in a public policy context, is the potential damage for the sector to be able to deliver for Wales in terms of research and skills development\u00a0and all the other contributions. darren millar am: So, you're confident that they're taking a robust approach\u00a0to planning\u00a0for various scenarios, going forward, are you, as individual HEIs? dr david blaney: Yes, and as the deal becomes more clear politically, then they will obviously have greater\u00a0clarity in terms of which of these scenarios\u00a0they need to work up more fully, but they are sighted on it. Can I just ask about fee and access plans, and how Brexit might impact them? To what extent\u00a0do you think that they\u00a0could be impacted? dr david blaney: I think there are two dimensions to maybe touch upon there. So, we're just in the process now of finalising our consideration of fee and access plans for the 2019-20 academic year. We, as part of that process, go through similar\u2014we look at their financial sustainability, which is based on their forecasts\u2014data to the stuff we've just been discussing. And\u00a0also, of course, the fee plans themselves make assumptions about how many students of different types, from different domains, are going to be recruited. So, clearly, if there is a continuing downward pressure on EU student recruitment, then that will reduce the amount of fee income that's going to come in, unless they can find other students, and that will reduce the amount of investment in the various activities that are identified in the fee plans. If institutions are becoming aware that the basis upon which they've submitted a fee plan is fundamentally different from the reality, then they can come into us for a change to their fee plan. If it's not fundamentally different, but there are always differences between what you plan and what happens three years later\u2014. We also monitor after the event and, if there are differences, we would then obviously require institutions to explain those differences. Conversely, if they'd had more students, and potentially more investment, we'd want to know what they'd spent it on, and if they've done different things, we'd want to understand that as well. The only other thing that's perhaps worth saying is that, in the 2019-20 fee and access plans\u2014they're not published yet, so I can't give you the full detail\u2014five universities have made reference to Brexit and the Brexit impact, and things they want to do through their fee and access plan to try and address some of those issues, so they're in there as well. darren millar am: But we've already said, haven't we, that it may be nothing to do with Brexit, this dip in EU recruitment, because there are other factors like the attractiveness of the estates and the environment that young people might be educated in? But they're making assumptions that it's linked to Brexit, are they? dr david blaney: Not really. There are things they want to do to enhance and to protect\u00a0student mobility, and some of that will be funded through fee plan investment. So, the Brexit conversation between the EU and the UK Government might or might not sustain\u00a0Erasmus engagement, and if it doesn't, then they need to find other ways of trying to support that sort of thing. What else do you do to assure yourselves that Welsh higher education institutions are effectively planning\u00a0for Brexit? bethan owen: We've touched on contingency plans, but, in an environment\u00a0of uncertainty, I think it's difficult for any of us to know what the right scenario is. I think rather than looking at worst-case scenarios, what the sector is also focusing on is the promotion and looking for additional or increased sources of funding. So, we touched on strengthening the Global Wales engagement in order to sell Wales, so more focus on marketing Wales overseas, but also within the UK. The other area where the sector is working at a UK level very hard is making the arguments to UK Government for maintaining access to the successor to Horizon 2020, which is arguably a larger part of the whole funding infrastructure\u2014students is one part, but the whole funding infrastructure\u00a0for maintaining research capacity. So, working with UK universities to make arguments at UK Government level for maintaining access to those sources of funding is also a part of what the institutions\u00a0are doing. That group, which is the Welsh Government\u00a0group, is being advised by members on it, and that's informing Welsh Government officials when they engage with UK Government\u00a0as well. mark reckless am: Do universities seek your advice on what the risks and, indeed, opportunities of Brexit may be and what you think they should be doing to plan for them, or is your role more one of monitoring what they do as opposed to advising what they should do? bethan owen: They are autonomous institutions and ultimately\u00a0their governing bodies are responsible\u00a0for ensuring their sustainability. It's not a relationship\u00a0where we would advise and direct, but it is a relationship\u00a0where we would question the scenarios if we consider from our experience that we would have expected other scenarios to have been tested. mark reckless am: I understand you don't direct, of course, but my question was about advising. You're overseeing, or monitoring\u2014or whatever you like to describe the role as\u2014quite a number of institutions, and presumably you therefore have particular expertise within your organisation, and I just wondered whether higher education institutions are doing enough to draw on that. bethan owen: I think we can advise\u2014we can advise based on data and information that we can see. The big thing in this whole\u00a0Brexit scenario is the uncertainty and the extent to which our speculation is better informed than the governing bodies or the sector collectively is probably the issue. So, there's a relationship\u00a0with the sector and there's a relationship with individual institutions, and they are different. So, some of these conversations are happening in various ways, where we're all gaining intelligence about what might be a sensible set of planning assumptions. Then, if we see an institution that is manifestly giving signs of not being sighted on some of these risks, either through their forecast or through other assurance\u00a0activity, we will challenge. We have an annual cycle, with two points in the year where we reassess the overall risks of individual\u00a0institutions, and that's based on a whole range of hard data but also a range of soft data. We have lots of conversations and we take all of that in the round and form an assessment about the financial sustainability of the institutions but also the extent to which we think their governance and management arrangements are properly sighted and facing properly the challenges that they face. In some ways, we say it's not about the challenges they face; it's about how they face the challenges. Our alarm bells really ring when we get the sense that, actually, either an executive or a governing body hasn't really noticed. There are medium-term real challenges, both because of Brexit and because of other contextual factors, but at the moment the sector is a managed sector, which is good. It's not always like that, but we're in, I think, a good place at the moment. So, our role is definitely to challenge where we don't think they are making sensible assessments, but it's not to say that their assessment is wrong and ours is right; it's just to have a conversation\u00a0about, 'Why have you done this and what has informed your thinking?' It's slightly more one step back and slightly more subtle, but it is, as you imply, us using the intelligence we gain from all of those conversations when we talk to individual institutions as well. We had evidence last week from some of the higher education institutions, including Cardiff University, and it's very interesting, in relation to Erasmus+ and the mobility funding for students that, I think, only 40 per cent of the mobility funding in Cardiff is paid for by Erasmus+. I note that you've been consulting on national measures for higher education performance and that one possibility is using international mobility as a performance indicator. I was just wondering whether you might go further and expect universities to actually make commitments\u00a0to funding international mobility from their own fee incomes as part of that. bethan owen: Again, reflecting on the latest fee and access plans, seven of the universities are referring to mobility\u2014either they have targets in them or are explaining what their plans are\u2014so they are including an element of it from their own income and fee and access income. However, Erasmus is such a well-established and long-term plan\u2014if we were looking at a scenario where that infrastructure wasn't available, to implement anything similar to that would be much less efficient and much more costly. Ideally, you'd want something that all Welsh institutions could take part in, and that takes some investment and some co-ordinating. I think it's easy to underestimate the accumulation of time that has gone into establishing Erasmus. llyr gruffydd am: And the point was made clearly last week that the brand is internationally recognised. When you enter into Erasmus+, you know exactly what you're going to get, and all of that. But there have been criticisms as well about degrees of flexibility and this, that and the other, so I'm just wondering whether\u2014and there is presumably going to be some change on that front although I'm hoping we can buy into it, as others have done who aren't in the EU\u2014that emphasis on encouraging institutions to look more proactively at funding their own mobility efforts would be positive. dr david blaney: I think the\u2014 llyr gruffydd am: Sorry\u2014especially if it means that they do more of it. I think the Welsh sector is definitely committed to trying to find ways of promoting and resourcing that sort of mobility. There are signs that some of the restrictive elements of the Erasmus programme are going to change anyway, because that's under development and that's positive. There have been positive noises as part of the Brexit negotiations about wanting to carry on being able to access the Erasmus programme. Nothing is agreed until it's all agreed apparently, so we'll have to see on that one. That would be far better, I think, as Bethan indicates, than trying to replace it with a made-in-Wales only, but you could have a made-in-Wales on top. All of these challenges also create opportunities because they stimulate thinking, and so the fact that seven of the eight universities\u00a0are already now using their fee plans as a vehicle for thinking about this is positive, and I think we can take that on from there. llyr gruffydd am: Because that 40/60 split struck me as being the opposite to what I perceived\u00a0the situation to be. A key\u00a0part of your role is to work in partnership with students, so I'd just like to ask what work have you done with students, in terms of maybe protecting their interests as the Brexit scenario evolves? dr david blaney: Well, as you say, we do work with students. We were the first of the funding councils\u00a0in the UK to have a memorandum\u00a0of understanding\u00a0with the National Union of Students in Wales. So, we have close links with NUS Wales and we're very proud of that, and it's very productive. We we're, again, ahead of the rest of the UK in requiring all HE providers to have student charters and there are elements of student protection within the student charter. The UK-wide quality code also has elements in it where arrangements have to be specified about the protection of student interests. That is particularly, in essence, around circumstances where a provider gets into difficulties and they might wish to close a course or something more drastic and then what arrangements are in place to make sure that those students who are in train are protected. So, that is there and we've worked hard with the sector and with NUS Wales to get those measures in place. There's more development work in train at the moment, so we've asked Universities Wales to construct a protection that takes account of the approach to protecting the student\u00a0interests in higher education. We're also requiring\u00a0further education institutions\u00a0who are regulated and deliver higher education to do similar or the same, and that's very important. The students who are HE students in FE are absolutely not second-best, and they should have the same protections. llyr gruffydd am: But is all this a general piece of work? It's not Brexit-specific, although, no doubt, it may\u2014. The other dimension around Brexit is the immigration status of EU students, and that's, kind of, beyond our pay scale\u2014that's a UK Government issue. llyr gruffydd am: Is that something that you have a view on? dr david blaney: It's clearly in the interest of the enrichment of the curriculum\u00a0and the student experience for students in Welsh institutions to be able to have students from other EU countries\u00a0in the mix. Now, of course, you have a statutory duty as well to assess the academic quality of the work in our higher education institutions, and I'm\u00a0just wondering\u00a0what potential impacts you think that Brexit might have on that particular aspect. dr david blaney: I think there are possibly\u00a0a couple of things to say, and one, in a sense, echoes what I was just saying in the final part of my previous response, which is that part of the quality of the student experience\u00a0is the richness that you get from having students in your cohort who have different backgrounds and different perspectives. So, if there is a continuing\u00a0reduction in the number of EU students coming into Welsh institutions, then that richness deteriorates. That doesn't\u00a0mean to say that the base or the threshold standard of what's required for a degree will come under pressure, it's just about the richness on top\u00a0of that, which will be, in a sense, a quality-enhancement issue. That would be something that we would wish to try to protect against, but in the end you can't force EU students to come\u2014you have to try and look attractive, and we've touched on that. The baseline requirement assessment\u00a0of quality will not be affected by Brexit, except in so far as the machinery we use to discharge\u00a0our statutory responsibility, which is through the Quality Assurance Agency, which themselves\u00a0are accredited\u00a0with\u00a0European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education, the European machinery\u00a0for higher education quality. And there's a set of standards around that, and we would obviously wish not to be in a position where our ability to use and adhere to those standards is adversely\u00a0impacted upon. Those\u00a0standards will still exist, and it will be possible for the British system to adhere to them, even if they're not actually able to play in the same way. Then the only other thing I would\u00a0say is that one of the factors that can cause\u00a0the quality of the learning and teaching experience to be likely to become inadequate is when institutions come under financial pressure, just because their capacity to maintain the same sort of student experience can get under pressure. So, clearly, we will be looking for and making sure that institutions manage the financial pressures, if there are any\u2014and there are some at the moment, as we've described\u2014and manage those carefully. And in all of that, we will expect institutions to do their duty to make sure that the commitments they've already made to students are carried through. So, where students have already started on the course, they need to be able to finish that course\u2014you can't just pull the plug out. A lot of what you've told us in the last three quarters of an hour or so will have costs attached, depending on the impacts. Certainly, we're in choppy waters as a sector anyway, and the risk is that things will be even more choppy, if you'll excuse that level of political interpretation, over the years to come. I'm just wondering what advice you might have given the Welsh Government in terms of what level of transition funding, or Brexit transition funding, might be required by the sector, and if you have, what the Welsh Government might have told you. bethan owen: I mentioned earlier that, obviously, we've provided information in terms of the assumptions that the sector are making on income. I think the extent to which that needs to be replaced or supported with transition funding depends absolutely on what the final arrangements for Brexit are, but it's an appropriate point to refer to the report that Professor Graeme\u00a0Reid has produced, commissioned by Welsh Government. But, again, the Reid recommendations in that report build on the Diamond recommendations, and as soon as\u00a0Diamond is in place\u2014and Reid is providing recommendations in addition, to establish funding on the basis that the funding needs to be available in Wales to maintain and develop and strengthen the research and innovation infrastructure that we have. llyr gruffydd am: Are you not worried, though, that the clock is ticking and that we really don't know what the situation is at this point? dr david blaney: Do you mean the Brexit situation? llyr gruffydd am: The Brexit clock, yes. dr david blaney: Uncertainty is unhelpful, because as I've said several times, the sector is a managed sector at the moment. We're not seeing maverick stuff, but actually you can only manage, really, what you can see and what you can reasonably predict. So, the longer the uncertainty persists, the more difficult that is for institutional management and, indeed, for the rest of the machinery to support them. darren millar am: Chair, can I just ask a question? john griffiths am: Yes, Darren. darren millar am: In terms of uncertainty, though, we've still got this uncertainty over whether the extra cash that the Government's going to have to spend as a result of Diamond being implemented is coming to the HE sector. They've given a political commitment, but you've got absolutely no other assurance of the sums of money that are coming in. We've got the reform of tertiary education arrangements in Wales, which are also under way, so it's a bit of a perfect storm for you, isn't it, really, with all of these three things happening at the same time? dr david blaney: We're certainly kept busy. darren millar am: But two of those things are in the gift of the Welsh Government to sort out for you, aren't they? dr david blaney: Well, the policy on the reform of the post-compulsory sector absolutely is a Welsh Government policy. The extent to which they can pre-empt a budgetary process and give us clear sight of the amount of money in future years is\u2014. My understanding is that that's difficult for them to do, and I would repeat what I said earlier: officials have been as helpful as I think they can be in respect of that. , you're right, we've only got a political commitment between two people currently in post. darren millar am: that statement about the savings accrued from Diamond being reinvested wholly into the HE sector has not been repeated, frankly, has it, since the coalition deal was struck? dr david blaney: No, but it hasn't been rescinded either, so\u2014. darren millar am: No, but there have been opportunities\u2014repeated opportunities\u2014in the Chamber, where the Cabinet Secretary's been asked to repeat that commitment, and the First Minister's\u00a0been asked to repeat that commitment and has not given that commitment. That must concern you, and must concern your university sector even more than, perhaps, some of the elements of Brexit that we're discussing. dr david blaney: Bethan has outlined earlier on in this session the fact that institutions are currently running deficit budgets in order not to lose the infrastructure on the assumption that the Diamond money will come in. If anything were to cause significant perturbation, either to the timeline of that or to it coming in at all, then there would be much more of what Medwin Hughes calls 'houskeeping' that would be required, and that would be significant. So, at the moment\u2014I don't like the expression 'valley of death', but there is a valley to cross, and I think the sector is reasonably confident about how wide and how deep that valley is. So, there are several valleys that they're crossing\u2014the metaphor fails, doesn't it, really, but I think you get the drift? So, there are a number of challenges and they can see their way out of some of those challenges, but if any one of these starts to get significantly disrupted, then that would be a real issue for them. Could I go on to ask about other barriers to Welsh universities gaining more funding from UK research councils? What would you say those barriers are? dr david blaney: Well, I think there are a couple of things, really, to say. The first one\u2014and we'll sound like a stuck record if we're not careful\u2014is that there's an issue about investment and the Reid report makes this very clear. So, he has reaffirmed research that had been done previously that identifies that, actually, the quality of the research base in Welsh universities and the productivity of that Welsh research base are both good, there's just not enough of them, and that, in the end, is a product of investment decisions. They have particularly looked at the deficit\u00a0in science, technology, engineering and mathematics areas, and I always say that research is not just STEM. , STEM is important, and I'm not denying the deficit in that area, but we have to also remember that the research agenda for Wales is not just STEM\u2014it's arts, humanities, it's social sciences. The Welsh impact in its research is better than anywhere else in the UK, so that's good. So, they do very well, and we just really need to invest a little bit further\u2014so continue to do very well, but put it on a broader front. If you want to be able to play into the UK-wide research funding, then the investment has two dimensions to it. One is just having enough researchers to be able to play into those increasingly larger projects rather than small-scale projects. If you haven't got the critical mass, it's very hard to make the case that you can play. And the second thing is that UK-wide research pots nearly always fund at about 80 per cent of the total cost of the research, and the other 20 per cent is meant to be found from the core research funding for the university, and if you're in a situation where your core research funding is not competitive, then you're not going to be competitive at getting that money. I think it's fair to say that the Welsh sector has not been sufficiently focused on getting in on the conversations with the research councils, making sure they're in the various committees and so on. We are intending to do a bit of work to see if we can systematise that a bit better\u2014that engagement\u2014because there's no doubt about it: it's not to say that this system is in any way inappropriate, but the more you're in the conversations, the more likely you are to be better placed to respond to the research challenges that come up. One final question: in terms of the researcher collaborations and networks that exist, do you see potential difficulties after Brexit for the continuation and enhancement of those, and are there any particular lessons to learn from\u00a0S\u00ear Cymru II? dr david blaney: I think that there are two things to say here as well. First of all, the Brexit deal might or might not impact adversely\u00a0on the capacity of Welsh and, indeed, UK research infrastructure to play into broader collaborative activity across Europe, and, in a sense, that's a function of the deal whatever the deal looks like, and we'll have to wait and see. But we've mentioned playing into Horizon Europe, and being able to continue with that would be an important part of that capacity. It's not just the money, it's being in the club and it's the signalling that we're in the game. And then the other part of my response to this would be that, actually, Wales will need to continue to be good at the research it does, so maintaining the quality, maintaining the impact, and hopefully growing\u00a0the critical mass. The S\u00ear Cymru initiative has been quite important in doing that, because it's been very focused, capturing key research players, and the attractiveness that that has then to other researchers around them, and to industry collaboration, and they have been areas of real strength that we've invested in. And I think they are already showing dividends in terms of the capacity to win more research funding, and to establish an even stronger presence in the international research market. darren millar am: Just very briefly, one of the pieces of feedback that the committee members received at a stakeholder engagement event, which took place prior to this inquiry starting, to receive oral evidence, was about the research funding that is available from the charitable sector, and how poorly Wales does in attracting some of that research. I think we had some figures from the British Heart Foundation, which said they have \u00a3100 million a year available for research grants, or something like that, and we're getting 1 per cent of that coming into Wales, which is\u00a0obviously pretty low down. I appreciate that research into the type of activity that they want to put their money into, Wales may not be\u00a0particularly good at, and there may be other opportunities with other charities and partnerships. What work are you doing in order to build the capacity that Wales has to attract more of that charitable sector research funding into Wales? bethan owen: One of the issues is the capacity to engage with that funding,\u00a0because of the overhead issue that David mentioned. Again, that could be built in to our funding, if we had the capacity to increase our quality-related research funding. darren millar am: But that pressure's the same in other parts of the UK, is it not? So the overhead funding is still an issue in England, and in other places. bethan owen: There is an increased contribution, and I think it's an element that was increased this year to acknowledge that. I'm fairly certain that some of our institutions will be very strong with the cancer charities, possibly not the heart foundation. darren millar am: So, this gearing issue that you mentioned earlier on, for every \u00a31 that somebody else puts on the table, they can draw in another \u00a34 on top, because that \u00a31 will cover the overheads, whereas the rest of the research cash\u2014. You know, we sometimes get into a conversation about the unhypothecated nature of our research funding, but actually that creates a\u00a0flexibility and the infrastructure investment that allows institutions to be able to respond to these other opportunities. Without that, they can't do it, because if you're not careful, you've got\u00a0institutions engaging in UK-wide or charity-based research activities where they're actually having to pay for it themselves\u2014they're running at a loss. darren millar am: So that's the main problem; it's not that Welsh universities aren't doing their best to get this cash in. Or is it a bit of both? dr david blaney: I think, in the main, universities and researchers will get their cash from wherever they can, so I don't think it's a lack of appetite. Well, thank you, both, for coming in to give evidence to the committee this morning.\u00a0You will be sent a draft of the transcript, to check for accuracy. Okay then, the next item is item 3, papers to note, the first of which is a letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education\u00a0on the school organisation code. The second is a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care on the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill. Paper to note 3 is a letter from the Chair of the Finance Committee regarding scrutiny of the Welsh Government's draft budget\u00a0for the forthcoming financial year, which we will be discussing under item 6 on the agenda. Paper to note 4 is a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care on parental attitudes towards managing young children's behaviour. And\u00a0the final paper to note, paper to note 5, is a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care\u00a0on the children and family delivery grant, which we will discuss later on in private session, if Members are content. Item 4, then, is a motion under Standing Order 17.42 to exclude the public from the remainder of this meeting, and also for items 1 and 2 of the 20 September meeting<doc-sep>Item 2, then, this morning is a post-legislative scrutiny session on the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Minister for Education, and Huw Morris, who is director of the skills, higher education and lifelong learning group in Welsh Government. I will just start the questioning by asking whether you are planning to repeal the 2015 higher education Act, or will it be amended by the post-compulsory education and training Bill? kirsty williams am: Thank you very much, Chair. I'm very pleased to be with the committee again this morning, although it's in slightly unusual circumstances. As a piece of post-legislative scrutiny, this was a Bill that was taken forward by a different Minister in a different administration, but I think it is really valuable work in the context of the question you just set out: what can we learn from the implementation of this piece of legislation as we move forward with our reform journey and with this Government and my proposals to introduce a new commission for tertiary education? There is much, at the moment, that lies within the 2015 Act that we will look to bring forward into the new legislation, but there are certainly experiences\u2014and I'm sure we'll come on to some of the evidence that has been received about what's worked, what perhaps hasn't worked\u2014that we all want to reflect on and be mindful of as we take forward the new Bill, including the report of this committee as part of it. So, it is our intention that this Bill will be superceded by the new PCETR Bill. Do you believe that the Act has fulfilled all the Government's objectives? Where are the weaknesses? kirsty williams am: Diolch yn fawr, Si\u00e2n. As I've said, it's a bit difficult to place myself in the mind of the previous Minister when this legislation was first envisaged and then taken through. You'll be aware that there were four main reasons for the introduction of the Bill: around regulation of institutions in Wales; safeguarding the contribution made to public good arising from Welsh Government's financial support for the sector; maintaining a focus on fair access; and preserving and protecting the principle of institutional autonomy. I think the evidence that has been received by the committee to date shows that there are different views about the effectiveness of whether all four strategic aims have been achieved. I think those strategic aims are still really, really important and certainly will underpin our thought process going forward, but we have to recognise the higher education and research Bill across the border in England, the implementation of new student support measures in Wales, as well as the report that was done by Ellen Hazelkorn, I think, means it is appropriate that we move forward with different proposals, not just regulation of the HE sector but the post-compulsory sector as a whole. We will look to see what we can do to strengthen or whether there is more that we need to do to achieve those four objectives, because I think those four objectives are still very, very relevant. But we have to have legislation now that is fit for the circumstances we currently find ourselves in and, hopefully, futureproofs us for how we want to see the sector develop in the future. sian gwenllian am: Do you feel perhaps that the legislation itself hasn't been strong enough, and that you then have had to drive some of these objectives through the annual remit letter, rather than through legislation, and that's why the strengthening is required? kirsty williams am: Certainly, I see the remit letter as a really, really important way in which national priorities and the priorities of an elected Government can be clearly stated, communicated to the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and then HEFCW use their powers to ensure that that happens. So, certainly, I see the remit letter as being a very important mechanism for ensuring, as I said, that those national priorities are clearly articulated, and then change happens. sian gwenllian am: Has the current legislation been framed around institutional autonomy so that it's not possible for institutions to fulfil any national outcomes, and is that going to be an element of the new Bill? kirsty williams am: Well, certainly, the 2015 Act contains numerous provisions that protect universities' privileges and autonomy. And that's really important, and those are principles that I am committed to in any legislation that I bring forward. We'll certainly be looking to see how we can carry those protections into the forthcoming Bill, but, at the same time, we do have to ensure appropriate regulation and accountability of institutions for their public funding and the privileges that they enjoy. We have a very positive working relationship with the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and I am very fortunate to have a very positive working relationship with the sector. I don't think there's anything in the legislation per se that prevents those national priorities being articulated and being acted upon. sian gwenllian am: I don't think that's what HEFCW has said in their evidence. They've said that the Bill has been framed in a way where it's not possible for institutions to fulfil any requirements. You're talking about the remit letter; maybe you need to have that discussion there, but, in terms of the Bill itself, you can't make them fulfil any national outcomes. Shouldn't there be a discussion looking to move in a direction where there are national outcomes being set through legislation, because there is public money going into that? kirsty williams am: Well, I don't know whether we need national outcomes through legislation, because those national priorities, potentially, will change over time. What is really important, and what we will be seeking to do in the new legislation, is look to move to a system of outcome agreements. So, there is a very clear expectation that the commission will have, in regulating the sector, and co-ordinating and funding the sector, to create a system of outcome agreements, where those outputs will reflect national priorities, and that's one of the things that we've consulted on, and will look to take forward in the new legislation. What about private providers? The Act, or the Act as it stands, makes it a requirement for a regulated institution to be a charity, and that means it's not possible to regulate alternative private providers under the Act, even though they can provide higher education in Wales. What is your view on this, and will the new legislation continue with the requirement of being a charity? kirsty williams am: Okay. So, I think, first of all, it's important to make the distinction between the scale of private providers, and what could be termed as 'unregulated providers' in the Welsh system, as opposed to the English system. So, currently, under the current legislation, unregulated providers can only access Welsh Government student support if they're designated on a case-by-case basis. Only six organisations were designated on a case-by-case basis in the 2018-19 academic year, so the scale here is small. So, when we talk about a private provider, perhaps people would have a view of a private university, but, actually, three of those were FE colleges, which we would all be familiar with. And the three private providers were the Centre for Alternative Technology, the training arm of the Church in Wales and the Newport and District Group Training Association. So, in order for their courses to be specifically designated, the three crucial questions that those providers have to answer are: quality\u2014is what they\u2019re providing to students of a good quality; the financial viability of the institution, again, to try to protect the interests of the students who may find themselves embarking on a course in an institution that isn\u2019t viable; as well as their contribution to private\u2014sorry, not to private good\u2014public good. But, Huw, I don't know if there's anything else to add? huw morris: Well, just to say that there are a very small number of private providers, as the Minister has outlined, and, in comparison with England, where I think the last figures said that there were between 300 and 400 private providers in England, you get a sense of the differences that exist there. And, if you look at what happened over recent years, it has been those small private providers across the UK who have been most financially challenged and a number of them have stopped their operations, with consequences for the students. So, we\u2019ve been keen to put students at the front of things to make sure that the institutions that they\u2019re enrolling with are strong and have good quality. So, what you're saying is that you will continue with a charitable status, or not\u2014 kirsty williams am: At this stage\u2014 sian gwenllian am: \u2014or are you still thinking about it? kirsty williams am: Well, at this stage, I think the charitable status will continue to be an important part of what we will take forward. sian gwenllian am: Just turning finally to part-time fees and postgraduate fees, do you have an intention to regulate this part in the new legislation? kirsty williams am: I have to say that, at present, we've not identified an urgent reason to designate these courses as qualifying courses for the purposes of a fee limit. Actually, the current Act\u2014the 2015 Act\u2014does not permit the fee regulation of postgraduate courses, other than PGCE courses for IT purposes. In the case of part-time courses, I'm currently content that fee levels are not exceeding the amount of student support made available by the Welsh Government. So, I think we are, at this moment, relaxed about that, and there are some difficulties around deciding and introducing fee limits on postgraduate courses. I think what's really important to me is the success at the moment of attracting people to postgraduate and part-time study in Wales, as a result of our reforms to student finance. But, at this current moment, the Act precludes fee regulation in some areas and there's not a pressing policy need that we've identified to date. Okay, we're going to move on now to some questions about the level of ambition in the higher education Act and any lessons for the PCET Bill, from Janet Finch-Saunders. To what extent has the 2012 university funding system limited Welsh Government\u2019s policy leverage over the sector, and how has the HE Act addressed this beyond the levers offered by fee and access plans? kirsty williams am: Of course, the Act was introduced as a direct result of the changing scenario around finance and the different ways in which, because of the reduction in HEFCW's budget, the level of influence that HEFCW would be able to exert over institutions through the imposition of terms and conditions of funding\u2014. So, the Act was introduced in part to address that shift in influence and the Act also has provided HEFCW with a range of new powers of intervention and sanctions in the case of non-compliance by institutions. Personally,\u00a0I wholeheartedly believe that tertiary education providers should contribute to national goals and outcomes as part of what I'd describe as a civic mission. I'm determined that any legislation that I bring forward and any commission that I establish will be empowered to enable that to happen through its regulatory and funding powers. Of course, the funding situation has shifted again now because of the introduction of what is commonly known as the Diamond reforms, but our new system of student finance does again shift the parameters of influence that HEFCW or any new tertiary commission could have. But, as I said earlier, it's not to say that institutions have had a free reign. We have been able to use the remit letter and our relationship with HEFCW to progress agendas that we would want to see. So, for instance, you'll be aware, in my remit letter, I am concerned about issues around how people working in the sector are paid. We've been able to successfully see all institutions sign up to becoming living wage employers, all institutions sign up to the Welsh Government's code of ethical procurement. So, it's not to say that the Act has meant that we've had no influence, but there are opportunities now, because of the change in financial circumstances once again, to look at that in any forthcoming legislation. Do you share HEFCW's views on the benefits of having national targets to get institutions to address national priorities? Is this something you wish you could do? kirsty williams am: Well, it's not something I wish I could do; I think that we're doing it. Self-praise is no recommendation, but, because of the working relationship that we have, I think we're seeing some success in using the remit letter to influence national outcomes. So, I've just talked about living wage; we're also using our remit letter to drive transparency over senior leaders' pay, the gender pay gap within institutions. For instance, as part of this Government's commitment to improving mental health, we've been able to use the remit letter and some funding to be able to drive change and some improvements in mental health in the higher education sector. These are national priorities and we're acting upon them and we're using the multiple levers we have at the moment to engage in universities. And, I have to say, universities have risen to that challenge, and I'm very grateful to them for doing that. Are there plans to give the proposed new PCET funding body more effective policy levers to align the sector to the social, economic and civic needs of Wales? And, if so, how will this be done? kirsty williams am: Well, as I said in answer earlier, I'm determined that we ensure a sense of civic mission for the entirety of the sector, including our institutes of higher education. You'll be aware, Janet, that, in the consultation exercises that have been undertaken by the Government so far on PCET reform, we will be introducing more formal outcome agreements, whereby institutions might be given by the commission very clear expectations of how they're expected to contribute to national priorities. We've heard that the HE Act, by focusing on individual institutions, did not encourage collaboration, even for widening access activity. Was this a missed opportunity and how will this be taken forward in the PCET Bill? kirsty williams am: I think we can strengthen our sector by closer collaboration. I think what sets us apart in Wales is that this Government is determined to create a legislative regime and a regulation regime that encourages collaboration and co-operation, which is in stark contrast to the marketisation and the competition that we see being regulated for and legislated for across the border in England. That's one of the reasons why we are going to introduce the new PCET reforms\u2014to create collaboration, not just between different higher education institutes but actually across the sector. So, this is a prime opportunity where we can create a framework that demands and encourages collaboration, not just, as I said, in between individual institutions but across the entirety of the sector. We're doing that because that means we can avoid duplication, we can fill gaps that there currently are and we can create a system that allows for a seamless passage for students to move between the different parts of post-compulsory education that are currently available, where, sometimes, those students find barriers. lynne neagle am: Okay, Janet? janet finch-saunders am: Thank you\u2014that's great, thank you. lynne neagle am: We've got some questions now around HEFCW's powers of intervention from Dawn Bowden. We received substantial evidence from HEFCW suggesting that powers were inflexible and hard to use\u2014I think HEFCW called them 'threatening'\u2014saying that they make sanctions difficult to use and so on. Are you satisfied that HEFCW's powers are useful on a preventative day-to-day basis? kirsty williams am: If I may disagree slightly, I don't think their powers are frightening. It's very clear what powers are available to HEFCW, and they're certainly more than just the ability to, maybe, lean on an institution. Clearly, there is a system by which there is the ability to, you know, ramp up and escalate levels of intervention in the sector by HEFCW, but I certainly wouldn't describe them as inflexible or not having weight. dawn bowden am: I think they were saying it was difficult to use for swift interventions\u2014they found it a bit cumbersome. They explained to us that they often take informal measures or actions in their role as regulator, and they've explained that the small size of the sector enables good relationships to be developed. How can such measures work in the tertiary education body when there clearly will be many more than the 10 providers? kirsty williams am: Well, looking ahead to the new Bill, I would want to see and be very keen to ensure that there are sufficiently flexible\u2014did you use the word soft\u2014and soft regulatory powers that the commission could exercise. Those powers, for instance, could include the ability to offer advice and guidance, rather than, maybe, punitive interventions, and powers to undertake enhanced monitoring of institutions to ensure compliance with regulatory conditions. So, I would expect the commission to be able to have a series of abilities to intervene, from the soft, flexible type, which is non-punitive but actually allows people to go in and support institutions, through to something that would be, as I said, more punitive, if they felt that an institution was in danger of not providing quality or financial failure. hefin david am: Can I just come in there, on the point that was made? The issue that seemed to me to come from HEFCW and from the universities is that the dial seems to have only three steps. So, rather than having a graduated series of actions that they can take, it seems to step from\u2014what did he call it\u2014a 'meeting without coffee' to\u2014 kirsty williams am: That's a very HEFCW thing to say. hefin david am: \u2014potentially institutions going bankrupt, and there don't seem to be many steps in between that. kirsty williams am: I think, as I said at the beginning of the session, this is why this post-legislative scrutiny is useful, because we can reflect on that feedback. As I said, I would expect to be able to ensure that the commission had a range of powers that could address\u2014from that soft power and those early conversations to being able to, as I said, issue, perhaps, advice and guidance to an institution, so there would be a more graduated escalation. Huw, is there anything else that I've missed out? huw morris: Just to build on what the Minister has said, there's a range of ways in which we interact with all institutions that are going to be in the tertiary sector, and some of that is about providing information. So, HEFCW provides information\u2014it sends around circulars, it produces reports and it holds events. There's staff, management and leadership development activity, which can create a culture amongst the leaders of institutions, but also amongst their governing bodies, to help them move in a particular direction. We use those mechanisms and informal interactions with FE college principals, with the work-based learning provider network, with sixth forms and others, and we would want to see, I hope, in the tertiary sector some alignment of those things. I think what stands behind HEFCW's comments is that before we had a loan-based system of student finance, there was a system of block grant allocations and conditions could be attached to those grant allocations by HEFCW. I don't think we're going to be going back to that system in the foreseeable future because of the pressures on public finances\u2014 hefin david am: That wasn't how I understood it. I understood it to be the fact that you use these informal powers and then the next step up is quite a severe sanction and there's not much in between those. huw morris: In the Hazelkorn review, there's quite a lot of focus on that and looking to learn from other national systems where outcome agreements provide a broader measure of the range of things the institutions do and a mechanism for tracking how things are done through the provision of information back to the institution to help them know how they're doing. What we have to strike the balance of as well is at what point those powers seem to be\u2014and the ability to direct\u2014interfering with the principle of autonomy within an institution. So, there's that balance to be struck, isn't there, about creating a regulatory regime, which I'm very keen and the Act attempted to do, which was to enshrine institutional autonomy, and that's really, really important, but also a regulatory regime, the ability to influence and to develop and to deliver national outcomes and the power to intervene in that sector, which you know, better than probably anybody else in this room, guards that institutional autonomy very, very, very dear indeed. And that's the balance that we need to try and strike as we go forward with the new commission proposals. I think, in terms of the levels of measures\u2014and I understand what you're saying\u2014but I think what HEFCW were saying was that they try as far as possible to use informal measures and they are able to do that because of the size of the sector\u2014just 10 institutions to work with. The post-16 sector, however many we're talking\u201450 plus providers\u2014it's probably going to be less likely that they would be able to have that sort of relationship with the leaders in those institutions. kirsty williams am: Yes, but also, what's incumbent upon me as the Minister is to ensure that the commission is set up in a way where it can have that relationship with the sector, because what's really important to remember is that HEFCW will be replaced. We're not asking HEFCW suddenly to go from regulating a small number of institutions to suddenly regulating 50. We'll be creating a commission that will be structured in such a way that it can have those relationships. Because, of course, whilst HEFCW will face changes, our relationship with and how we manage the FE sector and the apprenticeship sector will also shift. So, the point is that we need to create a commission that will still be able to be close to the sector, close enough to be able to provide that soft regulation, those really important relationships in a way\u2014. So, it has to be created in such a way and resourced in such a way that it allows that to happen, and that's my intention. Well, then, of course, the University of Wales said to us that they felt that there was the potential for HEFCW to issue directions enforceable by injunction to remedy minor matters. So, I think, from what you're saying, you wouldn't be expecting that to happen. Just the fact that they've got the power doesn't necessarily mean that that's what they're going to do. kirsty williams am: Well, I think it's important to recognise when HEFCW can enforce its directions by way of an injunction. If they were to do that because a university was breaking fee limits or because there were real questions about the quality of the provision or whether a university was not complying with the financial management code\u2014personally, I wouldn't describe those as minor matters, as a Minister, if we had an institution that was significantly falling down on quality and HEFCW were using these powers to intervene. And, actually, on that point, we've had some recent high-profile issues in Swansea and Trinity St David, and HEFCW still haven't yet used their powers of intervention. Do you find that surprising? kirsty williams am: I think what they have done in these circumstances is, perhaps, used their ability to support those institutions through what, undoubtedly, have been challenging times. Given the fact that there are ongoing legal processes attached to Swansea University, I think it would not be appropriate for me to comment any further, because there are still matters in train with regard to that institution. But clearly, our expectation on HEFCW is to ensure that they are using their powers to support those universities, and I would expect them, if they felt necessary, to use the full remit of their powers if they felt that that was what they needed to do. Now, I have to trust their professional judgment that that has not been necessary to date, but our expectation is that they would do that if they felt it was necessary. hefin david am: Are you concerned that neither the regulator nor the sector seem to have any confidence in fee and access plans? kirsty williams am: I think the concept of a fee and access plan is an important concept. Whether we can do them better, whether we can reflect on what's happened to date and create a better system of what's included in a fee and access plan and how those fee and access plans can be monitored, there's an opportunity to do that in forthcoming legislation. hefin david am: So, have you been aware of specific issues yourself? Have they brought them to you? kirsty williams am: Well, no, not in the sense that they've brought them to me to talk about specifically. From my perspective, fee and access plans are focused very much on inputs, and, really, I'd like to think about outputs and outcomes, more importantly\u2014what are the outcomes of the fee and access plan, not necessarily just how much money has been spent on them. I think, certainly, to really understand the success of the fee and access plan, you have to question whether an annual basis is an appropriate timescale for a university to be working to, and whether we could have something that was focused over a longer period of time. Because, when you think about it, you write the plan and then you're into it, and then, the next thing you know, you're writing your next year's plan. So, do I see a place for fee and access plans going forward, as part of our outcome agreements? Yes, I do. hefin david am: So, why would introducing outcome agreements make them work any better? kirsty williams am: Well, I think they're going to be a part of an outcome agreement\u2014part of that wider expectation. So, fee and access plans are there to address an issue around, primarily, changing the nature of people who go to university and making sure that nobody is put off from pursuing that. So, that's part of a wider piece of work that I'd want to see as an outcome agreement. But, as I said, I think looking at outcomes for students and outcomes of that activity, rather than the inputs of the activity, over a longer period of time, is probably a more effective way of doing it. In a way, it's difficult to make a final judgment on whether fee and access plans in their current format have worked, because we need to know what'll happen to those students in the future. But undoubtedly, despite the limitations of them, I do think we're making progress in terms of access, but I don't think we can necessarily point to the fee and access plans as being the driver for some of those improvements. hefin david am: No, I appreciate that, and some of the things you're saying reflect some of the discussions we've had, but what was clear is that the process and bureaucratic nature of the way you present fee and access plans doesn't work, particularly given the fact that, four years on, early fee and access plans are still being evaluated. So, what you're saying\u2014can I just pin down what you're saying\u2014is that we may be moving away from yearly fee and access plans to something that's longer term and outcome focused. kirsty williams am: That's my preference.\u00a0So, I think the principle\u2014I'd like to think we can all agree around the principle of what a fee and access plan is hoping to achieve, but I think there are better ways of doing it, and I think we should take the opportunity of reform to look at how we can do it better. hefin david am: So, with that in mind, I think we're talking about the future of the Bill, the consultation on the PCET reforms closed in summer 2018\u2014with these important issues in mind and things that are currently ongoing, have you had further dialogue since then with key stakeholders like, for example, Universities Wales and others? kirsty williams am: On the Bill or on fee and access plans in particular? hefin david am: I'm thinking about fee and access plans as an issue that suggests that there is a need for deep consultation, so with that in mind, with things like that, have you had further discussion? kirsty williams am: Oh my goodness me, civil servants in the department are constantly in discussion with a range of stakeholders as we continue to develop legislative proposals. I meet on a regular basis with both HEFCW\u2014I meet separately with the vice-chancellors, and I've been very keen to develop a stronger working relationship with chairs, and perhaps we'll come on to issues of governance later. So, we are constantly discussing with stakeholders all options for change\u2014 hefin david am: I suppose the message I'm getting as chair of the cross-party group on higher education is that there could still be more direct consultation with stakeholders. Now, I've got no evidence to say it has or hasn't happened, but that's the message I've received. huw morris: If I could just chip in for a moment, the Minister's outlined that there is very extensive, ongoing communication both ways with the sector, but the challenge of preparing a Bill is the balancing act between gathering in information\u2014and there's been a general consultation process and a technical consultation process\u2014and wanting to make sure that the Bill that's laid next year hasn't been discussed with anybody else before it comes to be considered by the Senedd. So, the broad principles have been discussed, but specific details of what goes into a Bill or policy instructions that inform a Bill haven't been the subject of consultation\u2014 hefin david am: Because that happens at Stage 1. Sorry, can I move on to the next item? lynne neagle am: Oh, you're going on to the next section. hefin david am: Yes, unless there's anything specific\u2014 lynne neagle am: Yes, I just wanted to clarify, if we're moving to a longer term approach to this, how will the new body be able to establish that things are actually working, that the powers are working, if we're working on a five-year time frame? kirsty williams am: As we've heard, we can't really properly assess fee and access plans in the current arrangements, because it takes time for those cohorts of students to go through and activities to go through. Being able to move to a system where fee and access plans, for instance, could be over a three-year period I think allows universities to be more strategic in some of their investments and some of their activities around fee and access. In a single-year plan, it's almost knee-jerk, it's the need to demonstrate that you're doing something, and doing that within that period of time, rather than a more strategic view\u2014. Can I just say, I know it's not quite subject to this, but we're really moving forward in terms of access and broadening access into the HE sector. For me, student financial support is one aspect of it, but if we're really thinking about social mobility and attracting people into higher education that have never been part of higher education before, our early figures would suggest\u2014they're early figures, and they're subject to change, but in terms of our change to our student support regime, we have seen a 58 per cent increase in the number of postgraduates applying for student support in Wales. When you think about it, when many of us went to university, a degree was the thing that set you apart. Now that more and more students are going to university, it is that postgraduate qualification that sets you apart, but your ability to carry on studying is often limited by access to financial support, so a 58 per cent increase in postgraduate I think is great for those individuals, but it's also great for our economy. We've seen a 35 per cent increase in part-time undergraduates that have been supported by the Student Loans Company; the Open University have reported a 67 per cent increase in students from Wales's most economically disadvantaged areas registering with them; a 57 per cent increase in disabled students; and a 30 per cent increase in black, minority ethnic learners. So, I think that's a really, really positive basis for our sector to continue to work on broadening access. The feedback from Universities Wales suggests that, with the outcome of the 2015 Act, institutions with the strongest track records are more highly regulated than the riskier private alternative providers. Do you think that Act has struck the right balance? kirsty williams am: I think the Act has created a system where the level of regulation is proportional to the amount and the nature of public moneys received by institutions. Those were the words used by Universities Wales\u2014 kirsty williams am: No, no, I'm not disagreeing. When you look at public moneys going into institutions, I think that the Act is proportionate, myself. hefin david am: So, do you think it's in the interests of students, then, to be at private institutions\u2014? I've seen those private institutions and how they operate; I've seen them at first-hand\u2014they don't operate to the same rigour as public institutions, and they're less regulated. huw morris: Can I just chip in? I think that the category 'private' covers quite a wide range of things, and many private institutions are also charities. We don't have the presence of some of the large private charities that are present in other countries, but Stanford and Harvard would count as private universities. I think there has been attention drawn to some private providers, particularly in England, but I wouldn't tar them all with the same brush, necessarily. hefin david am: But they fall outwith\u2014if they're not charitable providers running validated courses, for example, they fall outwith the strength of regulation that is currently in place on the universities in Wales. kirsty williams am: So, we would regulate them on a course-by-course basis, so it's back to the issue of proportionality, isn't it? So, you are automatically regulated for all your courses, if you're one of our main universities, but there is a process that is run by HEFCW on a course-by-course basis to validate alternative providers. And as Huw said, I think we should recognise the nature of that is very, very, very small in Wales, and there is a process to ensure quality provision. hefin david am: And I'm aware that there are a small number of private institutions in Wales, but are you concerned that in the future the landscape may change, particularly with the opportunity to recruit more part-time students? Do you think the landscape may change in future and that the 2015 Act, as designed, wasn't equipped for that, and will the next Act, then, be equipped? kirsty williams am: I think it's right to say that maybe the previous legislation didn't futureproof for changes. I'm not anticipating a mass influx of alternative providers, in the sense that we've seen across the border, but we will need to ensure that the new commission has powers to regulate and to futureproof. We had some evidence from the University and College Union that were concerned about the governance of universities, actually, as being a bigger problem than the regulatory framework in many ways. Can you tell us, perhaps, how the HE Act addresses the issue of poor governance, or is it really just limited to responding to the symptoms rather than the poor governance itself? kirsty williams am: Well, I think it's true and fair to say that the Bill does not directly address issues around governance in the sector. HEFCW do have well-established assurance practices in relation to governance that would predate the 2015 legislation. But governance\u2014we've talked briefly about some recent history within the sector that I think has certainly brought the issue of governance to the fore once again, and I think there are two important things that we're trying to do about that in the current time, prior to any legislative changes. The first is, as I just said to Hefin, I have sought to have a more direct relationship with chairs of universities and have that one-to-one relationship with them, not in the presence of their vice-chancellors. I challenge them, they challenge me, and I think we've deliberately tried to establish a regular routine of that since I took office. And you'll be aware that, collaboratively\u2014and I'm glad that this has been done in this way because I think if you do it this way, we're more likely to get some success and change\u2014Universities Wales and HEFCW have worked together to undertake an independent review of governance. And I think it's really important that parties have come together to recognise the issues and to agree to take action, because I think if we'd have tried to impose something, we'd have more resistance. So, there is an independent review going on at the moment\u2014 dawn bowden am: Is that the risk review process in\u2014? kirsty williams am: That's the Gillian Camm review. This is a review that, as I said, Universities Wales and HEFCW have agreed to do together. It's chaired by Gillian Camm, who is the chair of the Leadership Foundation for Higher Education, and she is doing an independent review to advise on changes to governance. And I welcome that, I'm very supportive of that, and that's happening at the moment. As I said, I'm glad that there's been recognition from within the sector themselves that they need to make sure, and they need to give confidence, that governance arrangements are what they should be. dawn bowden am: So, is that something that you're going to be taking into the PCET Bill, do you think? kirsty williams am: Yes, absolutely. We're exploring how the Bill could introduce a regulatory condition in respect of good governance, and a commission would be able to set expectations with regard to good governance. I think one of the concerns for me\u2014and I know that this is a concern that is shared by the UCU\u2014is the diversity of governance and who finds themselves in these really important positions. HEFCW don't hold figures on it, but from an approximation that I've asked officials to do for me, currently in the universities that we have, I would say that men make up around 56 per cent of membership of universities' governing bodies; women\u201444 per cent; BME\u2014as low as 4 per cent. Of course, in individual institutions, it does vary, but I think there is some way to go to making sure that our governing bodies are diverse and that there's an opportunity to look at the student voice in governance going forward, the staff voice in governance going forward, and these are things that we hope to have discussions on whilst we bring the legislation forward. dawn bowden am: But also, I guess\u2014sorry, Chair\u2014a greater understanding, that anybody going in to become a governor of one of these institutions has a greater understanding of what is expected of them. Do you think that that's a gap that needs to be plugged? huw morris: One of the things that HEFCW have led on with AdvanceHE, the body that encompasses the leadership foundation, is a development programme for governing bodies, and that started earlier\u2014well, it's been going on for some time, but it was recommenced earlier this year, with a session for all of the chairs of universities in Wales. And I believe\u2014I'll need to check this\u2014that there are plans to engage with each of the governing bodies, because, as you rightly say, and this lies behind a lot of what we've been discussing, the activities of these institutions have become much more complex over recent years, and so there is a need for that training and development and understanding also of the fast-changing nature of that activity. lynne neagle am: Okay, just before we move on, can I ask whether it's your plan to legislate on that, as they've done in Scotland? kirsty williams am: As I said, I don't want to pre-empt scrutiny of the Bill, because we need to be able to come to the committee and do that in the entirety, rather than picking off individual bits of it, but we are absolutely exploring how the Bill could introduce a regulatory condition with regard to governance. We've heard evidence regarding the difficulties caused by HEFCW having a legal duty to quality-assure all the provision in two further education colleges. Could you clarify that and explain the situation in that instance? kirsty williams am: Thank you. My understanding\u2014and as I said, it's a bit difficult, because I can't put myself into the thought process of the Minister at the time and what his expectation was. But, certainly, my understanding is that it was not an unintended consequence, it was an expectation built into the Act that HEFCW and Estyn would work together on these matters. The Act built on what were the quality assessment arrangements in the 1992 Act, which required HEFCW to secure arrangements for the assessment of the quality of education provided by funding institutions. So, as a consequence of that approach, HEFCW's quality assessment duty currently encompasses all the education provided by or on behalf of a regulated institution. So, it is complicated, and Huw can help me out here if I get it wrong, but my understanding is that it was not an unintended consequence, that was the expectation of what would happen when the legislation was passed. That was a theme in the general and technical consultation exercises that we've engaged in over the last couple of years. sian gwenllian am: So, you're happy, therefore, that that partnership has worked. Are you happy with that? kirsty williams am: Certainly, in our consultation for the upcoming Act, we've generally heard, certainly from our further education colleges, that they've been quite content with the arrangements. huw morris: There are differences in the systems of quality assurance as they've historically applied to FE and HE, but I understand that that has meant that, as FE colleges become more interested in HE, they've had to learn new ways, and that's taken a little bit of time. sian gwenllian am: Okay, which moves us on to this idea of having one quality assurance body or one quality assurance framework. Is that your intention and how will that work in practice? kirsty williams am: I am aware, and we've listened to stakeholders' concerns regarding proposals to introduce a single quality assessment body. As I said, we recognise that stakeholders are broadly content with the current situation with regard to Estyn and QAA. So, we've been listening to that, following the technical consultation, and policy officials are working through options in regard to ensuring what quality assurance will look like in the commission. As I said, I don't want to pre-empt bringing forward the legislation, but the principles underlying any assurance regime would need to be coherent, need to be effective and need to be comprehensive. What we're also very clear about, and I think it is important to say, is that any quality framework covering higher education will be compatible with ENQA, which I think is really, really important going forward. sian gwenllian am: But, you have touched on this, there is substantial concern in the sector about this offer to move to one assurance body for the tertiary sector. One vice-chancellor has told us: kirsty williams am: Well, sometimes, I think it is necessary, maybe, to cause a stir. If we don't change things, it does beg the point of, 'Why are any of us here if we're not here to sometimes move things forward?' And change is challenging always, but I would like to reassure all of our vice-chancellors and our sector as a whole that we're not going to do anything in the quality assurance regime that would risk what is the very high reputation and standards that Welsh universities currently comply with or would set them apart from institutions across the border or in a European context. I think the fear is misplaced, but coming back to another theme in the conversation so far about futureproofing, what we're seeing in the figures that the Minister outlined to you earlier about the growth in postgraduate and the growth in part-time is the desire of a greater number of people at different ages to engage in higher and tertiary education, and quite often that will be in a workplace or it will be in a non-conventional institutional setting. Historically, the quality assurance regimes for work-based learning have tended to sit with Estyn; the assurance regimes for the universities have sat with the QAA. There's quite a lot of learning that all sides have got to engage in if we're going to be able to have continued high quality in these new areas that are being explored. The Augar report, which was published earlier this year in England, drew attention to this as being a major problem in the relationship over the border between Ofsted and the QAA. So, I think we're not looking to impose one institution on anybody, but we are looking to encourage greater synergy in the ways in which quality assurance and enhancement is undertaken in those different areas of activity. Will the new Bill address these issues? kirsty williams am: Well, certainly transnational education does present real opportunities for Welsh institutions, but if not managed appropriately and regulated appropriately can cause real risks to reputation to our sector. When I meet with vice-chancellors in universities in different parts of the world, and when I am visiting different countries, one of the great things that I'm able to say is that we have a sector that provides fantastic quality of teaching, excellence in research and a wonderful student experience, and that is undermined if institutions find themselves undertaking TNE activities that put that at risk. So, it's an important consideration for the health of the whole sector that any TNE undertaken by a Welsh institution has the appropriate quality guarantees built into that because it's a problem not just for an individual institution, but it could undermine the very strong reputation that the Welsh sector has as a whole. Huw, was there anything further about TNE? huw morris: Well, just to say that we are live to that, as I know HEFCW and the QAA are. When they visit institutions with their reviews they will look at a selection of those overseas activities and there are periodic thematic reviews of the activity in particular countries. I think we would hope and believe that HEFCW, in its conversations with the QAA, would be keeping that under review to minimise the risk and maximise the opportunities. sian gwenllian am: So, you're not actually looking to use the new legislation to strengthen the regulation around this. huw morris: The arrangements at the moment are that HEFCW uses the QAA to do the reviews and the inspections. The system at the moment works through co-operation between the institutions and the regulator to make sure the quality assurance system is improving and enhancing things. Well, can I thank you both for attending this morning and answering all our questions? As usual, you will be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you both for your attendance this morning. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Minister for Education regarding the revised additional learning needs implementation plan. Paper to note 2 is additional information from HEFCW, following the meeting on 18 July, in relation to our post-legislative scrutiny of the Higher Education (Wales) Act. And paper to note 3 is a letter from us to the Welsh Local Government Association on the Childcare Funding (Wales) Act 2019. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting and for item 1 on 2 October? Are Members content? Thank you."

        "Query": "Summarize the discussions on the responsibility for developing curriculum resources, the flaws in the government's pandemic relief program, the debate over the economic recovery plan, and the official acknowledgment of Taiwan's donation by the Minister of Foreign Affairs.",
        "Summary": "The responsibility for determining the curriculum was seen as a joint effort between Philip Blaker and the Welsh Government. The opposition party raised concerns about the wage subsidy program, stating that some companies were unable to access it due to unnecessary barriers. However, the Deputy Prime Minister argued that the program was designed to support as many companies as possible. The government was urged to provide a comprehensive overview of the economic situation and emergency measures, but the minister emphasized the importance of considering each phase of the recovery. The Minister of Foreign Affairs highlighted the significance of the One China agreement and expressed gratitude for global cooperation in combating the Covid-19 virus.",
        "Article": "<doc-sep>Item 2, then, this morning is an evidence session to scrutinise the Welsh Government's progress in developing the new curriculum for Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Minister for Education; Steve Davies, director of the education directorate; and Claire Bennett, who is deputy director for curriculum and assessment. Thank you all for attending this morning, and thank you for the paper that you provided in advance to the committee. We've got a lot of ground to cover, so if it's okay, we'll go straight into questions. If I can just start by asking you what the main messages are that you've received during the feedback period on the draft curriculum. If I may, I think it's important to understand what the level of that feedback has been. So, there was a concerted effort and a plan drawn up to try and ensure that there was as much engagement, knowledge and opportunity as possible. So, working through the regional consortia, approximately 120 separate events were organised, and we believe that in the region of 6,000 headteachers, teachers, governors and teaching assistants have actually had an opportunity to participate in those events. We also held a number of focus group sessions specifically for young people themselves, so that they could give us their feedback. We'll all be familiar, won't we, with the narrative of, 'Oh, we're sending people out into the world of business without the skills that we as an employer are looking for'. So we thought it was really important to engage business so that they can have their say and their input into the process. And obviously we work very hard on making it as easy as possible via new technology for people to have their say. So, Members, I'm sure, will have been aware of the specific pages on Hwb that outlined the draft curriculum, and we had 275,000 unique visits to the Hwb curriculum pages. It's really interesting to see the breakdown of the areas of learning and experience\u2014which particular AoLEs were the most popular and were being looked at the most\u2014with our creative and performing arts and the creativity and the expressive arts being the most popular. So that's really interesting that people really wanted to engage in the content of that particular AoLE. What, then, have people said to us? Well, I'm really pleased that there has been broad support for the curriculum changes that we are proposing. There's real support for the need for change, because that's the first question, actually; why are we doing this, and why do we need to change? So, support for the need for change, and lots of support for the principle of a purpose-led curriculum. Strong support for greater autonomy and agency for the profession\u2014so, the ability of the profession to take a framework and then truly let them adapt it to meet the needs of the children that they are working with in their communities. In terms of some of the things that people are asking us to look again at, some of that is around some of the language used. Can we clarify, can we simplify in some areas, are there things that are repeated in a variety of AoLEs? Can we use that as an overarching, rather than repeating ourselves? Can we simplify it and clarify some of the language? Also, in some areas\u2014. It's interesting; in some areas people want it simplified and cut down, but in other areas, people say, 'Well actually, in this bit of it, we need a bit more detail, and a bit more depth and clarity'. That process has already started, but considering that this is a massive change, I have been hugely encouraged, actually, by the high levels of engagement and support for the broad principles of what we're doing. Are you able to give the committee any early indication of what level of change you anticipate making to the guidance? kirsty williams am: I think what's really important and what has been the strength of the process to date is that we are not doing this to our profession, we are doing it with our profession. So, in the spirit of co-construction, the reflection on the feedback will continue to be primarily led by the existing infrastructure that we already had that got us to this stage at present.\u00a0So, Members will be aware that we've slightly changed the model. Pioneers were asked if they wanted to continue in that process and to put themselves forward, and we've narrowed that down now to a smaller group of innovative schools. But above and beyond the innovative schools, we looked at individuals who have specific expertise in subject areas, and they're the first part of that process. So, they met last week to begin looking at the feedback, and we'll continue to use the processes that we have to reflect and refine. Opportunities to do things better, explain things better, simplify where possible, where we've been told that that needs to happen, provide greater depth where we've been told that needs to happen\u2014absolutely. We're definitely very alive and very willing to engage in those, but in terms of the overall concept, then no, no significant changes. And what are the steps now before the final curriculum is published in January 2020? kirsty williams am: Okay. We call them\u2014it's not a very nice name\u2014quality improvement practitioners, the QI practitioners. In October, there will be a number of workshops lasting three days at a time where those practitioners will continue that process of feedback with our curriculum and assessment group and all those people involved. By November, we would expect the QI groups to have completed their work and would want them to be in a position to hand over the refinements to an editorial process, and that has to be done in both languages. I think it's really important that we don't do it in English and then we simply translate it into Welsh. It also, then, hands over to the publication team to do all the work on the publication, our website team will then be working on it, and then we would expect final publication in January\u2014am I right, Claire? claire bennett: Yes. sian gwenllian am: You've touched on the point that there's going to be some sort of change, and you've mentioned in your paper to us that further specific aspects of the framework of the curriculum are going to be included in the primary legislation. kirsty williams am: The original proposal that we began working on was, in the legislation, to provide for the four purposes\u2014so, the four purposes would be set out in the legislation\u2014as well as putting in law the areas of learning and experience that you'll all be familiar with. Then, below that, we were going to legislate for a number of the cross-curricular aspects\u2014so, the literacy, the numeracy and the digital competency\u2014as well as some elements where we had already said that we were going to make that statutory, so, for instance, above and beyond what Graham Donaldson would have put in his original reports. I've already made an announcement that I was going to put RSE on the face of the Bill. So, the two main new areas that we are now working on to include within the Bill are to ensure that there is breadth within the curriculum for everybody\u2014. Rather than simply, in law, leaving it at the AoLE level, we'll be bringing it down again to the 'what matters' statements within that, again, providing greater certainty and greater clarity about our expectations at a national level. We'll also be looking to include in the legislation provision for a statutory framework setting out our approach to progression in each of the AoLE areas. So, there has been in the Chamber\u2014I can see Suzy is writing this down\u2014Suzy has asked me questions about, 'How do you create a national expectation around progression?' We've reflected on that and our conversations with other people outside during this process, so we would look to have a statutory framework where our expectations of progression at a national level would be laid out. One of the consistent worries that some people have had, whilst being very supportive of the overall aims, is how do you get that balance between individual autonomy in the school, but also ensure that there is some national expectation and that the variation on these important things is not so great as to cause concern. I set up a process\u2014this was an open process, and we were open to listening to people. So, I think those will be the two main areas where we hadn't originally thought that we would legislate for, but that we will now legislate for. I haven't got the 'what matters'\u00a0statements in front of me\u2014 kirsty williams am: Well, if you remember, we have the four purposes, and then we have the areas of learning and experience, and then, below the areas of learning and experience are the broad concepts that we would expect to be delivered in each of those areas of learning and experience. Some of the feedback that we've had is that\u2014 sian gwenllian am: So, will you be adding to those? kirsty williams am: Adding is not necessarily\u2014no, not adding. But, for instance, the children have given us some interesting feedback about what they feel really matters in those areas of learning and experience. So, they'll be refined, but not added to, and then we will legislate for them, and that hadn't been the original intention. Will they include mental health and well-being? kirsty williams am: Well, the area of learning and experience for well-being is already there, and underneath that area of learning title, there are the broad concepts of what matters, what we believe matters, in that area of learning, and it is that that we will now actually put into the legislation. Sorry, I'm not helping, because I haven't got them with me either to read them out. lynne neagle am: They are in the annex to the paper, Si\u00e2n, and, obviously, mental health is in there. So, just to clarify, then, that would mean that every school would have to teach mental health by law. kirsty williams am: Yes, because the 'what matters' states very clearly the broad concepts in health and well-being. It refers to both physical and mental health, and we intend to legislate to ensure that the 'what matters' statements are a set given in the system. kirsty williams am: Claire, am I explaining it okay? claire bennett: Yes, the 'what matters' are the articulation of the big ideas. So, the idea is to make sure that those are consistent, and then that still leaves huge flexibility underneath as to how to approach those, which particular topics to select in how to actually teach them. But the concept that you might not do one 'what matters'\u2014it was never what was intended. They won't be literally in the Bill, because, obviously, you might want to change the emphasis, so that'll be provided for in subordinate legislation, but the provision will be there, and they will have the status of something that's not optional, basically, for a school. sian gwenllian am: Therefore, it's not going to be on the face of the Bill\u2014the mental health aspect, for example. You're saying that it's subordinate, but then you're saying\u2014 kirsty williams am: So, on the face of the Bill, we will make provision to say that the 'what matters' statements have to be delivered. So the actual wording of the 'what matters' statements will be in secondary legislation; the need to deliver and the requirement, the legal requirement to deliver the 'what matters' statement, will be on the face of the Bill. If I think, if we had sat here 20 years ago, we probably, in a 'what matters' statement on health and well-being, wouldn't have referred to mental health, 20 years ago, because our understanding as a society, our willingness as a society to engage in that\u2014. So, if we had drawn up a 'what matters' statement even a decade ago, I suspect we wouldn't have talked about mental health. So, the concept of having to deliver the 'what matters' statement will be in the primary legislation; the actual wording, because otherwise if you wanted to change it you'd have to go through the entire process\u2014. The actual need and the compulsion, the expectation that you have to do that, will be on the face of the Bill. The point you've made is one that Government has made with other legislation prior to this, but can I just ask you to consider the worthiness, if you like, or the good purpose of actually putting the wording of the 'what matters' statements, the first round of those, in the primary legislation on the basis that they can be amended through affirmative procedure secondary legislation when they need changing in due course? The reason I ask this is just to explain to the population of Wales that there is certainty at the first step, bearing in mind that it will change over the years\u2014I completely accept that. But when you're amending primary legislation, you don't have to go through the whole process again\u2014you can do it via secondary legislation provided the correct powers are put in the primary legislation to do that. kirsty williams am: Yes, as I said, I think we've demonstrated that we're listening to people, that there has been concern expressed about certainty and having a national approach on some of these issues, and we have taken steps to address that and we'll continue to reflect, but, crucially, we'll continue to reflect with our partners who are co-constructing this with us. And I think the important thing to remember is that it's not Ministers or civil servants that are necessarily drawing up these 'what matters' statements, it is practitioners themselves, guided by experts in the field that are not teachers, that have come up with these things. Obviously, the Bill will presumably come to this committee\u2014 kirsty williams am: We're assuming so. sian gwenllian am: Moving on, therefore, to the religious education and relationships and sexuality education, I understand that you've had numerous responses to the White Paper surrounding this particular area. What are the main points that were raised with you and how do you intend to respond to what's been said? kirsty williams am: Well, these two areas certainly have ensured that lots of people have responded. It's interesting that people are far more interested in what we may or may not do about these two subjects than maths, English, Welsh, science, but there we go; I guess it's the nature of the areas that we're talking about. With regard to religious education, we had a significant number of people that have expressed concerns about our approaches towards RE that were set out in the White Paper. There were very mixed views on the inclusion of a range of faiths and world religions included in that area of learning. Many people said that there needed to be a much clearer and stronger\u2014and in some cases exclusive\u2014focus on Christianity, as opposed to including other world religions and, indeed, non-religious views. There were people who thought that RE shouldn't be compulsory at all and therefore our proposals to ensure that RE was compulsory, people objected to that, on the other\u2014. Of those respondents that agreed that RE should be a compulsory part of the curriculum, or were neutral\u2014didn't express an opinion either way, but were neutral on the question\u2014the issues that they were bringing forward were: a need for learners, as they saw it, to be prepared to be part of a diverse and multicultural society. So, they wanted RE to be much more broad-based and encompassing of world views and world religions. They felt that that was an important part of preparing a young person to live in a world that is, as you say, diverse with people of different views living in it. There is certainly a need to modernise RE; some people perceived the current curriculum as a bit old-fashioned. And also there was much feedback on making sure that the profession was ready to deliver a renewed, modernised RE curriculum. So, those are the issues around religious education\u2014 sian gwenllian am: Can I just\u2014? Before you go on to the next section\u2014is there evidence that this was a co-ordinated lobby to present a particular view and what is your response going to be to this? Obviously, there are always going to be lobbies presenting particular viewpoints. Our role, as politicians, is to lead, obviously, isn't it? kirsty williams am: Yes. Claire, would you say that it was a co-ordinated response? claire bennett: It wasn't a campaign in the sense of it being completely consistent, but, certainly, I think people with a particular interest in this issues felt galvanised to respond to the White Paper on this issue\u2014on this one and on relationships and sex education. And your response? kirsty williams am: And my response: well, clearly, Si\u00e2n, I need to consider those responses, and both for RE and RSE, I shall be making a statement in the near future of our intentions on how to respond to these issues. With regard to RSE, the key messages, again, are focused on whether children should be taught RSE at all and that this should not be in the curriculum and it shouldn't be a compulsory part of the curriculum\u2014that this was not an area where the school system and the education system should be involved, and that it should be alone the preserve of parents to teach children about issues around relationships and sexuality education. There were some issues raised about potential challenges with staff in talking about issues that they perhaps personally did not agree with with regard to this curriculum. With regard to guaranteed access to a full curriculum, there were strong views that, again, it should be parents, and parents alone, that made decisions about whether their children should have access to the entirety of the curriculum rather than schools or the state setting those rules. I think if we are to achieve the four purposes, and that's how we have always got to think about it, and if we agree that those are the kind of people and individuals we want leaving our compulsory education system\u2014how do we achieve those purposes? How are they healthy, confident individuals? How are we to prepare our children to be ethical, informed citizens of Wales and the world? So, we will reflect on what has come back to us, but I do believe that these are important aspects of the curriculum, if we are to achieve the four purposes. You've also mentioned that there will be a final draft of the curriculum at the start of next year. What is the timetable for the Bill itself and for seeking Royal Assent for that? kirsty williams am: Okay, so, as I said earlier, the expectation is that we will publish a final version of the curriculum in January 2020, so schools will then have the opportunity to be really engaging in it. I have to say, I'm in schools most weeks, and many, many, many schools are already taking the opportunity, even on the draft, to begin to think about planning and, indeed, changing what they're doing in schools. I'm overwhelmed, actually, by the enthusiasm of the sector to embrace what is a massive change for them. sian gwenllian am: \u2014actually implemented in September\u2014 kirsty williams am: In 2022. kirsty williams am: And I think what's really important is that we get the actual curriculum out in January itself, because that's the bit that schools are really concerned about, and then we will have the process here to underpin it. We've got some questions now on potential unintended consequences, and other matters relating to that, from Hefin David. hefin david am: Can I ask what value you place on the work done by the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods and the presentation so far and the paper to be presented by Dr Nigel Newton? kirsty williams am: I always\u2014and Welsh Government are big supporters of WISERD and the work that they do, and, in fact, we need more research into Welsh education, not less. I think what's really important in perhaps this piece of work is to say that I hope that, in the time where I've had an influence to influence over Welsh education, either as a backbencher or now as a Minister, equality and principles of equity have always driven what I've tried to achieve. And I would never undertake a policy reform that I thought would lead to less equity in the Welsh education system. Closing the attainment gap is a core element of the national mission for education in Wales and we would not proceed with anything that we thought could lead to an exacerbation of an achievement gap. And how do you respond, then\u2014? , it's a balanced paper, it looks at pros and cons and there's a mixed picture from it. How do you respond to the specific statement that Dr Nigel Newton said that the curriculum could exacerbate segregation within schools between different groups of pupils? kirsty williams am: Well, I think what the paper acknowledges is that there is no evidence that that will happen. These are 'coulds' and 'maybes' and things that we need, as a Government, to take into consideration as we plan this journey. There can't be any empirical research done at the moment because the curriculum isn't being delivered, but I understand, and we need listen to\u2014. If there are concerns out there in the field that these are unintended consequences that we may fall into\u2014that is the value of that piece of research that helps inform us. I have to say, though, the curriculum in itself is neither going to necessarily on its own hugely enhance equity nor detract from equity, in the sense that the curriculum is what's taught in our schools. There is an opportunity, I believe, that empowering teachers to be able to be more flexible in what they teach their children actually gives us an opportunity to deliver lessons that could be much more engaging and much more relevant to some of our schoolchildren than what they have at the moment. What will make the curriculum a success for all of our children, and I believe will have a bigger impact on children who are in danger of being left behind, are the four enabling purposes of the curriculum. So, the curriculum on its own can play a part, but it will only be as good as the four enabling elements that surround it. And that is strong leadership of our schools that ensures that there is no segregation, that has high expectation of all of our children, and delivers a curriculum within that setting that meets the needs of the children there. In the end, no education system, whatever its curriculum, can exceed the quality of the people who stand in front of our children day in, day out. So, the curriculum can be the most exciting, wonderful\u2014and I think it is exciting and I think it's wonderful\u2014it can be the most exciting, wonderful thing in the world, but if teachers can't teach it effectively, if their pedagogy is not excellent, then the content itself\u2014it won't work. So, how do you assess how children are doing in your new curriculum? How do you understand how that pupil, who has, you know\u2014who could be vulnerable for a whole host of reasons, usually reasons outside of the school\u2014? That pupil is vulnerable. How can you assess how that pupil is and move their learning along in an appropriate fashion? And then, finally, the well-being of the child. But what we know is that we cannot expect children to learn unless we address issues around their well-being. There's been lots and lots of research done, not in a Welsh context but in other systems, where children are kept behind for a year. So, good achievement leads to good well-being, but good well-being also leads to good achievement, and you can't separate the two. It is the four enabling objectives that sit around it, and we have to be cognisant of the WISERD's research, of course we do, to ensure that, as we're doing our professional learning, as we're planning well-being for our children, as we think about assessment methods and how we develop a culture of strong leaders in our schools\u2014and we have some, we have many, but we need to do more to support them\u2014it is that that will make the biggest difference, not just the content of the curriculum on its own. Although I do believe the flexibility that we're allowing people will, I think, lead to a curriculum and more meaningful lessons for some children in schools who are in danger of disengaging because they don't understand why they're being asked to learn what they're learning, they don't see the relevance of what they're learning to what they may want to do or how their lives are, or they don't see themselves reflected. So, for some of our communities, they don't see themselves reflected in the curriculum that we're teaching at the moment. And, again, international research would suggest that, if you want a child to thrive, they have to see themselves and their community reflected in what they're learning in schools. hefin david am: What the WISERD research suggests is that the senior management teams\u2014the management teams\u2014would certainly buy into what you've just said, but the classroom teachers would be a little bit more sceptical. kirsty williams am: As I said, classroom teachers are absolutely crucial to this, which is why, first of all, we've taken the difficult step to delay the implementation of the curriculum to give us the time that we need to make sure that it's not just school leaders but it is individual classroom practitioners who have the skills that they need to make the most of the opportunity that the curriculum allows them. hefin david am: So, if we look at some of the statements that were in the presentation by WISERD at the seminar two comments jump out: 'We'll end up'\u2014this is from classroom teachers\u2014 'We'll end up with a different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.' and 'there will be no consistency'. And consistency is the one I'd particularly like to focus on: 'there will be no consistency across all schools in how the new curriculum is delivered which could affect outcomes'. kirsty williams am: Well, first of all, we've just talked, haven't we, about trying to ensure that there is greater consistency and that's why we're changing our approach to the legislation around the Bill. So, in terms of progression steps, there will be a statutory framework to ensure that progression is the same wherever you are in Wales. So, as I said, we're using this report, we're using this feedback, to inform decisions going forward. hefin david am: Yes: 'different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.' kirsty williams am: Okay. So, as always, in education, teachers\u2014understandably, because this is the regime that they have been a part of\u2014immediately don't think about their pedagogy, they think about, 'How are judgments going to be made upon me as an individual?' And what we're trying to do is ensure that we are developing another accountability regime that is indeed in line with the purposes of the curriculum and doesn't work against the purposes of the curriculum. They spend a lot of time thinking about accountability and how they're going to be held accountable for their practice, but, again, what we want to do is provide reassurance that we are devising an accountability regime for our system that is in line with the purposes of the curriculum and puts us in line with the mainstream thought and reform process across the world of progressive education systems. hefin david am: It was the segregation bit I was particularly interested in and the response with regard to disadvantaged pupils and pupils of lower attainment. I do not believe that any changes\u2014and I would not pursue any changes that\u2014would lead to a segregation. And with regard to the connection between Welsh Government and local government and the concerns that the Welsh Local Government Association and the Association of Directors of Education Wales raised, what progress\u00a0has been made on bridging the gap between\u2014? Whether it's a perception gap or a practice gap, what progress has been made on that? kirsty williams am: Well, I think the last time we had this conversation in the committee I said that I think the comments that the WLGA and ADEW had made were reflective of an old piece of work and were not current and up to date, and I think progress had been made in that time, and I'm pleased to report the significant progress that's been made\u2014 hefin david am: Bridges have been built. But we've got renewed, energetic engagement from the WLGA and ADEW in all the arrangements that we have for the development of the curriculum and my understanding is that they have said publicly and in writing that they're very supportive of what's going on. hefin david am: I'm sure they're watching and nodding vigorously now on Senedd.tv. kirsty williams am: And I will be with them tomorrow night and Friday morning and I'm sure if they've got any other views they'll let me know. hefin david am: And the final question: there is a process, a model for this, which is Scotland. What kind of lessons are being learned from the introduction of their curriculum? kirsty williams am: Okay. So, I think the first thing to realise is that our curriculum is not a copycat of the Scottish curriculum, but it is always useful to reflect on how other systems have undertaken curriculum reform in their nation and to learn from any issues that have arisen. So, I think it's fair to say\u2014and I spent time with some delegates from Scotland just this weekend at the Atlantic Rim Collaboratory conference that Wales hosted this year. Unfortunately, Minister Swinney was not able to attend at the very last minute because of Brexit preparedness work that he was involved in, but certainly their teaching union and their equivalent of the EWC in Scotland joined us as well as representatives from the Scottish Government, although not John himself, and they were very frank about some of the challenges that they had faced in introducing their curriculum. Professional learning, ensuring that the profession was properly prepared for the changes, I think they would agree that that wasn't necessarily\u2014. Well, they've got local authorities and regions, but whether they were truly engaged in what they were doing. Although our curriculum isn't a copycat, as I said, we have been able to learn from, and we've had people who have been deeply involved in the Scottish experience as part of some of our curriculum and assessment groups and some of the advice that we've had in terms of developing coherence. steve davies: As I said, they're very forthright in sharing their learning and I think one of the critical elements was the extent to which assessment was considered at the outset alongside the curriculum content. So, that was critical, but we've embraced experts who were involved in that process who were part of our curriculum assessment group. So, they feed in throughout\u2014not 'don't do this because Scotland has done it', but they feed some of that learning into the system. As the Minister said, we had seven other countries from across the world giving us feedback and input over four days as to where we can continue to look at what we're doing but also checks and balances against some of their experiences with this area of reform. kirsty williams am: The particular focus of this year's conference was on the issue of assessment and we were joined by colleagues from Scotland, from Ireland, from Iceland, from Finland, from Saskatchewan, from Nova Scotia and from Uruguay. hefin david am: When did that take place? kirsty williams am: Where? hefin david am: When. You've got a whole section on assessment, I don't know\u2014 suzy davies am: This isn't about assessment. suzy davies am: So, on the basis that this is not about assessment, you mentioned that one of the lessons learned from Scotland is that they said they spent too much time on curriculum content rather than assessment. Can you tell me a little bit about what you've learned about how they quality control the content, even though the content, of course, will be completely different in Wales? kirsty williams am: Yes, the content would be completely different. When I said they spent too much time, I said that the focus had been in their work about just talking about content and, actually, the assessment arrangements were bolted on at the end of the process. So, the curriculum was all designed and developed, it was sent out to schools, and then the question was raised: 'Oh, actually, what assessment methods\u2014? How are going to assess how children are getting on?' But, Steve, you would have more details of their exact experience of quality control of the content\u2014 suzy davies am: Of the content, because every school is going to be very different at this. steve davies: In terms of developing the guidance and the curriculum going out in January is concerned, I think\u2014again, I don't want to be overly critical, but one of the findings was that they encouraged schools to go forth and multiply in terms of the materials and ideas and concepts that were coming through. What we learnt was to actually\u2014the pioneer movement was to get a smaller group to develop those materials and look to engage through cluster groups. So, we had pioneers who worked with clusters to test the development of that concept before we were looking for schools to go away and develop a larger amount of content. So, in terms of the staging and measuring of bringing together the curriculum and the associated guidance, I think the time we've taken to actually get there and the strategy of using pioneer schools, external experts, back to pioneer schools, back to regions, or engaging regions in that, has been more measured and planned against a planned timescale, where everyone from the outset\u2014with the exception of the extension of the one year\u2014was clear on when we were going to be producing materials that would allow the profession to then take it and use it. Claire, do you want to add to that, or\u2014? claire bennett: I think, as we move forward, that kind of cluster approach remains really important. So, it's, as schools then think about, 'What am I going to do in my school?', that they're doing that in clusters together. When colleagues from the regional consortia were sharing their thinking with the curriculum assessment group last week, they were talking about the very specific and differentiated, I suppose, professional learning support that they would be offering to schools that have already done quite a lot of thinking and are quite far down this journey and then the kind of different sorts of approaches they would offer schools that are just starting out. Their emphasis was very much on this peer-to-peer sharing and support, so people aren't just going off in isolation. So, there'll continue to be a focus for each area of learning and experience, bringing together the professional learning and the ongoing curriculum development, bringing together practitioners and experts and colleagues across the middle tier to give a bit of strategic direction and to be able to identify if there are areas where more support is needed. So, I think that a huge amount of thinking, particularly in the regions, has gone on into the practical support that can be given to schools, not just in engaging with the curriculum now, but then how they take it and think about then developing it in their schools. You don't start in 2022\u2014people are already doing it and there's a lot of thought going into how to support continued sharing through the next two years. kirsty williams am: And I think that's another difference, you see\u2014that strong middle tier and the role that the middle tier is playing in Wales, which was absent in Scotland. So, this ability to work in networks to provide support to a network of schools, that wasn't available in the Scottish system and I think that makes\u2014I think that helps us in the way that they just simply didn't have a structure that allowed them to do that. It's not a criticism of them; it's just that we have got a structure that we can utilise to do that support so that schools are not completely left on their own and they can be working with other schools, with their regional consortia, going forward. suzy davies am: Can I just have a quick\u2014? lynne neagle am: Very quickly, because I want to move on to implementation. Was one of the things that Scotland did\u2014I don't want to use the word 'assess'\u2014to monitor the pupil response to the curriculum as one of the means of deciding whether curricula in particular schools were working well enough? kirsty williams am: I don't know if they\u2014. I don't know if they did, but one of the interesting things that we were reflecting on over the weekend is that, certainly some of the Canadian systems, in particular, which we were interested in, used pupil surveys as part of their accountability regime\u2014so, actually taking the time to ask students how they felt, not just about the content of the new curriculum, but actually how they felt their school was doing. And so we're interested in looking, as I said, at some of the practices that other countries use to include pupil voice to find out what's happening. They found that particular useful and successful, and we're keen to see if we could do something similar. You touched on this briefly in response to some questions from Hefin David earlier on, but I'm just interested to know how the money that you announced for supporting teachers for the preparation of the implementation, how that's actually been used. What specifically have teachers been doing to prepare for its implementation? I know you've set aside about \u00a324 million over two years. kirsty williams am: You're right, first of all, it's not an insignificant amount; it's the largest investment in professional learning since the history of devolution. So, you're right that it is not insignificant, and it was a hard-won resource, I can tell you, from my colleagues. Because, as I said earlier, the curriculum itself can be amazing, but if our teachers and our professionals are not equipped to deliver it, then all this change will be for nothing. That money is being made available to each and every school and has empowered headteachers to really think, 'What are the professional needs of my school and the practitioners in my school?' Because, as we've just heard from Claire, there are some schools that have been part of the pioneer process from the very beginning and therefore are further along that development chain. There are other schools that maybe are only beginning now, now that it's published, to be really engaging with the curriculum. kirsty williams am: There is a national element to it, but we've given the money to individual schools and individual headteachers because I have no way of knowing how each individual practitioner is ready or how much additional support they're going to need. But we have worked with the National Academy for Educational Leadership to put together a programme for headteachers, and that's national. The regional consortia are working together to provide consistency for classroom teachers and teaching assistants, and then the next stage of that development is for subject specifics. Claire referred to the AoLE networks, and there's an opportunity then for people to engage in that. So, this September is the start of our new ITE courses, taught for the first time, and that's great. So, we're looking at developing potentially a stronger set of support, again on a national basis, for those who are newly qualified, beginning their teaching career, because I don't think we've done that on a consistently good level across the country. We're also working with the regions to revisit and improve their coaching and mentoring schemes that they have across the system. We're also involved in\u2014and I'm sure the committee has heard about it, so forgive me if I'm going over old ground\u2014schools as learning organisations and the OECD work to support schools to develop that culture as a learning organisation. We know from very successful education systems in other parts of the world there is a strong, strong culture of self-evaluation as a first step in their school improvement system, and we've not been very good at that in Wales, we've not been strong at that, that's not the culture that we have had. We've kind of depended on a culture where a school does its thing and then somebody comes along and tells you whether you're good or bad, rather than the school really thinking itself deeply about, 'What are we doing well and what do we need to improve on?' So, the schools as learning organisations are an important part, again, so that money is being used for schools participating in that programme with support from the OECD. And the money that you announced for this\u00a0\u00a0professional development preparation, if you like, was for two years. So, there's going to clearly be an ongoing programme of preparation development and personal development, as well as anything else. But is there likely to be any more money allocated specifically beyond the two years that you've already allocated or is that going to be a question and negotiation with your colleagues? Or do you see what you've put in as being, 'This is what we need to develop or to prepare for the implementation. The rest would be what would be normal professional development beyond that'? kirsty williams am: The money that was agreed was for a two-year period and, clearly, I continue to have conversations with the Minister for Finance and the First Minister around future allocations for professional learning, and I'm sure this committee and, indeed, members of this committee could help me in that task. Can you tell us a bit about the innovation schools\u2014the 16 innovation schools\u2014and how you've made your decisions about who they might be, across which sectors, in primary, secondary and so on? So, basically, how they were selected and what you're expecting of them. So, all of our schools that had previously been pioneers were invited to apply to morph into the next phase, which is innovation schools, and they were asked to apply and there was a discussion held both internally within Welsh Government and with the consortia about which schools were best placed to be able to do that role and to continue to work with us, going forward. I think one of the lessons learned, and this was said in the committee, was that there was an upside to having pioneer schools, but there was a downside to having pioneer schools, and I think, at this stage of the game, we need to move away from that model and to really get the message to everybody that they all had to be pioneers now\u2014everybody had to be a pioneer\u2014because this is coming down the track and we don't want anybody just sitting there waiting until September 2022 and saying, 'Oh, gosh. So, the move away is partly to engender within the sector the fact that we've all got to engage in this now. The innovation schools have led to a very specific piece of work as we do the final refinement, and their main role is working with us on these final refinements to the content but also to the assessment issues and accountability issues. It was important that we engaged with the regions to get their view, and we've had evaluation being carried out\u2014 claire bennett: Yes. So, during the first term of work, we asked them to really look at the curriculum as a whole\u2014so, take the whole curriculum guidance and then think, 'How would I apply that in the school?, Does it make sense?, Can we work with it?, What are the issues?, What are the questions that arise for us for assessment?', and each of the schools produced a report setting out their reflections on, 'If I were putting this into practice\u2014'. So, it's slightly different to the feedback we've had from other people, which has been more, 'Maybe you should emphasise this or change that wording' and kind of quite practical, and really about how you would realise this curriculum in a school. That's been drawn together into an overall report, drawing out the themes, by Wavehill, who are a kind of research company. Having 16 headteachers in a room talking about how they see this curriculum and the way in which they would practically engage with it has been invaluable, in just making us think, even with all the practitioners that have been involved, 'How do we make this work for schools?', given that we've got schools and headteachers really engaging in the detail of how they would use it practically. So, it's been invaluable, and they're continuing on that work now this term to keep making sure that what we're doing is something that schools can actually realise practically. kirsty williams am: If you think of the pioneer model, pioneers were looking at specific aspects of the curriculum. So, you might have been a pioneer school because you had particular strengths in health and well-being, or you might have been a pioneer schools because you were particularly looking at professional learning needs to support the curriculum. This is about, at this stage, where we have a high degree of certainty about what it's going to look like, 'Actually, how do I as a school practically implement this in the round?', and the schools were chosen because of their ability to do that. But also we did need a mix of sector\u2014secondary, primary\u2014but also linguistically, to just try to make sure that this works in all the different types of schools we've got. So, just trying the practical implementation now, now that we know exactly\u2014not exactly\u2014 but we have a good idea what it's actually going to look like, so, 'How am I going to go about doing this?' lynne neagle am: Okay. If I could ask as well, maybe you could provide the committee with a list of the new innovation schools. sian gwenllian am: Are you confident that every school across Wales is participating in this process of change now, because the danger is, in getting these pioneer schools\u2014? I understand that they are discussing in clusters, and so on, but can you put your hand on your heart and say that every school is participating in this project now? steve davies: I can't tell you that, absolutely, 100 per cent are definitely, totally, absolutely equally involved. The structure we've got in place across the regions is working with schools on their readiness to actually\u2014not readiness to engage\u2014start to deliver as we move through to the future. And we don't have a roll-call against all schools, but we require them, or request of them that they keep us informed of the networks. Every school is part of a network that links to it, and they gauge (1) the level of activity in it, (2) the outcomes of that work, because each of the networks, each of the clusters, produces work that the region brings together. What I would say, and it touches on the point you raised earlier and in relation to Scotland, I think if we had 22 units of local authorities trying to do this, it would be incredibly complex and very difficult to deliver. dawn bowden am: I just wanted to clarify, because in your paper you talk about giving \u00a330,000 to each, or to the innovation schools. Was that \u00a330,000 each, or \u00a330,000 for the project? kirsty williams am: Each school that participates in the innovation schools programme gets \u00a330,000. My final question in this section is just about how we are going to deal with the issue of teachers who are not trained in Wales. So, teachers trained in England apply for jobs in Wales, but they obviously haven't been trained in the new curriculum. Well, you're right\u2014we will continue to have a system where teachers trained in Wales will teach in England and teachers trained in England or who have worked in England will come across the border, as well as teachers from other parts of the world coming to teach in our schools. Indeed, when I'm feeling at my most confident and bullish about these issues, I think Wales will be a really attractive place to be a teacher because of the autonomy that we will be giving to our professionals, as well as an exciting new curriculum. So, I think, actually, potentially, we will have people coming across the border to teach here because it'll be a great place to be a professional. So, our programmes of study are already different and that does not preclude anybody from coming across to teach in our system from a different system. Clearly, there may be pedagogical concepts in the new curriculum that perhaps somebody who had trained in a different system would not be completely au fait with, but that is the ongoing role of professional learning within our school system, because we've just talked about the two years' worth of money; in an ideal world, if I was able to make long-term plans, I think there will be an ongoing, and there should always be an ongoing, provision for professional learning in our classrooms. And this shouldn't just be about just getting people ready for the curriculum and then taking away professional learning budgets. One of the ways in which I think we can attract teachers to Wales is to send a very clear message\u2014 and actually attract people into the profession and keep them in the profession, wherever they train\u2014that you will have a career in teaching where you will be continually supported in your practice via professional learning. dawn bowden am: So, you'll still be recruiting on the basis of skills and adaptability and so on. We've got a lot of issues to cover, so I'm going to appeal for concise questions, concise answers. What was the feedback like with regard to the draft assessment proposals? lynne neagle am: Excellent, concise question. We received what I would describe as positive feedback regarding the emphasis placed on ongoing assessment that is there to support children's learning and progression. Key messages were perhaps to find a better way of expressing the purposes of assessment\u2014we refer to a formative and summative assessment\u2014and just being a bit clearer about what that actually means and being clear about definitions around it. suzy davies am: Obviously, we're all aware now of the distinction between assessment of pupils for their own progression and the evaluation of how a school does at certain points in its life cycle as well. Presumably, the way you're looking at this is to keep these items completely separate, and that evaluation and assessment proposals will be\u2014. They're out in a separate document; their results are going to be coming forward in a separate document\u2014is that right? There's a thick black line between these two concepts. I think some of the trouble that we've got ourselves in previously is because there has not been a clear distinction between assessment and accountability, and, when you start using assessment for accountability purposes, that's when, potentially, that assessment process gets corrupted and you have gaming. suzy davies am: Can I ask, with the assessments, though, which is about pupil progression, will those results be published internally? Will parents get to see those? kirsty williams am: Oh, yes. The primary purpose for assessment is for that professional to be able to know how to move that child's educational journey on, and you would absolutely expect professionals to have those conversations with parents, whether they're using formative methods of assessment or summative methods of assessment. So, absolutely, you would expect teachers to be sharing information around assessment methods, whichever type they use, with parents, to describe and to inform parents about what happens next for their child. Is it realistic, then, to expect parents, families, communities, not to think about that information when they're drawing conclusions about the school, notwithstanding that formal evaluation of those schools is going to be done completely separately? kirsty williams am: Well, of course, parents will always be interested in how the overall institution is doing. But the conversations I have with parents, and I certainly feel this myself as a parent\u2014I'm interested in how my child is doing, how my child is getting on in school, what are the issues that that child has, and, more importantly, what is the school going to do about it? So, if my child is struggling for whatever reason, what is the school going to do about that to help that child? If my child happens to be exceptionally able and talented, how are you as a school going to make the most of my child's talents and move them on to fulfil their potential? So, undoubtedly, I can't control assumptions that parents will make, but it is absolutely clear in this system, and my intention is, that teachers should share assessment methods and outcomes with parents to have that conversation about what happens next. But I am absolutely clear that we do have to make this distinction between assessment for learning and an accountability in the system, otherwise we drive\u2014inadvertently; people don't set out to do it, but we drive a set of behaviours that has negative unintended outcomes. So, how\u2014? Can you just briefly give us an indication of how you think the accountability, on both sides of that thick black line\u2014the methodology\u2014is likely to change with this? You mentioned that there's going to be an independent review of performance measurements coming shortly; we know that some of the existing ones have been ditched in fairly recent legislation. Without pre-empting the findings of such a review, have you got your top three likely expected changes? kirsty williams am: To accountability? suzy davies am: Yes. Well, we're moving to a system of schools as learning organisations, and a greater emphasis on self-evaluation, with external verification of that by Estyn, our inspectors. suzy davies am: And that will be reflected in the school categorisation system as well\u2014will those indicators change, do you think? kirsty williams am: Well, categorisation\u2014again, the purpose for categorisation is not to make a judgment on a school in the sense of a league table; it's a triage process, categorisation. kirsty williams am: Well, this is the issue, isn't it? This is the problem of designing a system where there are perfectly good reasons to introduce the system\u2014and in this case it's a triage system to identify levels of support for a school. And categorisation was never intended to be a way of expressing a league table of school performances; it's there to identify levels of support that a school can expect from its regional consortia. Now, we have, we have\u2014we will continue to keep categorisation, but, since coming into office, we have tried to adapt categorisation simply away from pure data to a more formative assessment process, and categorisation will continue to evolve. And the first level of accountability in that system has to be the professionalism of an individual member of staff\u2014the moral purpose that I bring to my classroom today to do right by the children that are in front of me. That's the first part of our accountability regime\u2014the moral purpose our professionals bring to their work. Well, just finally on that, there may be an argument, then, for scrapping categorisation, putting something else in place. But I suppose the core question is: how are the general public going to understand all those things that you've just mentioned about the teachers being able to teach, the leaders being able to lead, and how well a school is performing against KPIs on those measures? kirsty williams am: Well, because we will still\u2014. kirsty williams am: Yes, that's the ultimate, isn't it? So, the ultimate is\u2014. The ultimate system that we're going to get to and the ultimate arbiter and the part of the system that provides public assurance and public confidence ultimately ends in Estyn. Because I get the point of the end point being Estyn, and that's where the public assurance will be seen, but what about the public assurance at those early steps of the teaching standards and the leadership standards? Where will we see those demonstrated? kirsty williams am: Well, you would expect to see those demonstrated in the self-evaluation that a school will provide of itself, and then Estyn\u2014 suzy davies am: All right, so schools will be publishing self-evaluations annually, or something like that? kirsty williams am: Yes, schools\u2014 steve davies: The outcome of the self-evaluation is a school development plan. steve davies: We expect a series of priorities for a school to set itself as a result of prioritisation. What we're looking at, in terms of what's brought to that, is not a narrow set of measures\u2014just two measures, or one measure in a secondary school. The measures will still consider reflection on progress of children, but it'll also have reviews of mental health, well-being, how it approaches that and things that it wanted to do. The school is evaluating\u2014the outcome of that will be a development plan, annually published on the website. kirsty williams am: And the schools' ability\u2014whether they do that well or whether they don't do it well\u2014will be judged by Estyn. lynne neagle am: Okay, as my colleague Chair Dai Lloyd would say, 'Now we're into the needing serious agility territory'. Firstly from me: Qualifications Wales have told us that the curriculum must define qualifications rather than the other way around. What implications does that have for the amount of time that is needed to develop qualifications that are properly aligned with the new curriculum? kirsty williams am: Well, I'd absolutely agree with Qualifications Wales. The qualifications have to arise out of the curriculum, and the qualifications should not be dictating the curriculum. Qualifications Wales, which I met with yesterday, I think\u2014yes, yesterday; it seems a long time ago\u2014will begin their national conversation about reform of qualifications as a result of curriculum reform in November. How is awareness and understanding of human rights, including children\u2019s rights, being embedded in the new curriculum? kirsty williams am: Children's rights, human rights\u2014they've been key considerations throughout the design, and this is currently set out in overarching guidance and we continue to work with the children's commissioner's office to map the rights of the child across each area of learning and experience. And I'm delighted that the children's commissioner took the time to write to me during the feedback phase to say that they were very pleased that their initial assessment demonstrates that what we're proposing is a big step forward. And how do you respond to the concerns expressed in the children's commissioner\u2019s quarterly report of July 2019 that consultation materials for young people were not released until mid June, allowing just over a month for young people to engage? And they said it was disappointing that a plan was not in place at the start of the consultation period. kirsty williams am: Well, we undertook a specific programme of engagement with children and young people, as I said at the beginning. We had over 20 events where focus groups of young children were involved and we had a number of children who took the opportunity to feed back via different mechanisms. The output of that engagement and feedback has been drawn together into a report exploring learners' views about schools and learning. It's a powerful contribution and I think will actually effect change, especially in how the 'what matters' statements are worded. sian gwenllian am: Turning to the Welsh dimension in the new curriculum, the Learned Society of Wales has said that there needs to be a directory of resources to implement that Welsh dimension. Do you agree with that and will you be publishing such a resource? kirsty williams am: We have a separate programme of work that is looking at resources that are needed to support the curriculum. It's one of the conversations I had with Qualifications Wales yesterday to try to avoid the debacle that we've had previously, where we have new qualifications and the resources to support those qualifications aren't available. So, we're already having those conversations with Qualifications Wales and there is a piece of work that is ongoing to look at what are the resources that are necessary to support the curriculum. And, in terms of the single continuum of learning with regard to the Welsh language, how are progression steps and achievement outcomes in Welsh-medium schools going to work and how are they going to work in English-medium schools? kirsty williams am: Okay. Just on the Welsh dimension, I think it's really important that whatever resources we have to support the Welsh dimension are really, really, really broad and not confined to specific areas. I was in Swansea University just this week, looking at some of their Technocamp work that they're doing to help us with coding, and we had an amazing conversation about the Welsh contribution to the computing industry. And so my expectation is that that isn't taught in a history lesson\u2014that, actually, when children are learning about coding, they get to hear that Welsh people have been at the forefront of developing this technology. When I talk about a Welsh dimension,  right the way across the curriculum, and I think that's important. The continuum for language will have to be contextualised depending on the setting where a child is being taught. We have to recognise that, and there will be progression points on that continuum that will be there to show progression both in Welsh language and in the English language, and they have to be contextualised. We recognise that children learning Welsh in a Welsh-medium school, their progressional on that point would be more speedy and quicker, and by the end of primary school they would be in a very different position than a child that was learning Welsh in an English-medium school. Vice versa\u2014we've had this discussion before\u2014if a child is going into Welsh medium, their progression in English perhaps from age three to seven would be very different from a child that was in an English-medium school, although the expectation would be that by 11 they would be in the same position. So, we have to contextualise that learning continuum depending on the medium of tuition with the school, but recognising that it is a progression. sian gwenllian am: With regard to the creative thinking element of PISA, I take it that you are adhering to the fact that the Welsh Government is opting out of the creative thinking tests with regard to PISA 2020. I don't entirely understand that because the new curriculum does place great emphasis on creative thinking and independent thinking. So, why not participate in these tests? kirsty williams am: Because, for me, the key factor for making that decision, and I intend to stick to it, is in 2021 we will be expecting schools to be right in the middle of their preparation for the introduction of the new curriculum\u2014 sian gwenllian am: Okay, so it's the timing. sian gwenllian am: So, later on, maybe when this is embedded\u2014 kirsty williams am: I think there could well be a different decision at a later date, but at 2021 this is not the right time to do it. Can I just say? In terms of creativity, Wales is seen as an exemplar by the OECD, especially our partnership with the Arts Council of Wales and creative learning through the arts. That's why I don't understand why we're not actually going for it and showing how good we are through the PISA. kirsty williams am: There could well be a different decision, but for 2021 we're asking enough of people at the moment and this would be an unnecessary addition to cope with. I just don't think that that should be seen as us running away from it because we're worried about a lack of creativity in our education system. We are seen as exemplars by the OECD\u00a0and some of the work that's been going on with creative learning through the schools is now being shared internationally. sian gwenllian am: So, you'll think about it for the next round of PISA. kirsty williams am: Oh gosh, that shows that Si\u00e2n thinks that I'll be here to make that decision. Countries were offered if they wished to take the invite to come into it, and a number of countries across the world are yet to make their decision on this. janet finch-saunders am: Can you give a guarantee that all children and young people, where appropriate, will take part in physical activity under the new curriculum for Wales? Also, how much time per week will the Government expect children and young people to spend undertaking physical activity? kirsty williams am: Yes, all children will be given that opportunity, because if they are not then that school would be in breach of the expectations that will be set out in statute. janet finch-saunders am: How will you monitor it? kirsty williams am: Again, Janet, I don't go around monitoring schools now. As we've just said\u2014 janet finch-saunders am: How will you ensure that every child has that opportunity? kirsty williams am: Well, as we've just said, ultimately, we are not getting rid of our school improvement services and regional consortia, nor are we getting rid of Estyn. So, one would expect the quality of the curriculum to be a key consideration of any visit that Estyn would make to a school. To what extent will the new curriculum allow for the continuity of the way that the foundation phase is taught? Will there be any significant differences and have the early years professionals been involved in the development of the curriculum to date? kirsty williams am: Yes, early years professionals have been involved in the curriculum to date. One of the advantages, I think, of the new curriculum is to take the pedagogical principles that underpin our approach to early years education actually further into children's educational journey. We have a certain pedagogical approach until the age of seven, and then all of a sudden, at seven, it's like, 'Forget all of that now. Sit down, pick up your pen and do this.' That's been really uncomfortable for many practitioners in our primary sector. So, actually, yes, statutory and non-statutory provision have been involved in the development of the curriculum because, of course, some of this is going to be delivered in the non-statutory sector. I'm very welcoming and supportive of that, but those pedagogical principles will now be available throughout that child's educational journey, rather than the false divide we've got at the moment. suzy davies am: So, aside from the purposes and the AoLEs, the type of teaching is unlikely to change in the foundation phase settings. The other end of the scale now: you report that one of the themes of the feedback from further education has been the need to ensure that the transition to post-16 education is supported so that the systems don't just clash against each other. How are you working on the sector at the moment to make sure that there's a decent dovetail? kirsty williams am: Okay. We don't want to do anything in pre-16 that stops people going on to be successful in post-16, whichever route the child or young person decides to take. FE have been involved in every single AoLE and they're a part of the curriculum and assessment group. And then in the conversations we had yesterday with Qualifications Wales around what qualifications will look like, I was very keen to take the opportunity to emphasise that any changes to qualifications should be a gateway to further study in FE, whichever type of route the child took. suzy davies am: And you're confident they're geared up to accepting young people who have been educated in this way. sian gwenllian am: I think you actually answered this at the beginning, but just to confirm that you're carrying on with the same governance set-up, the different groups that you've got, and there's nothing being added there or taken away. And just finally from me, then, on pupil referral units: what arrangements will be in place to ensure that they can benefit from the new curriculum and how is that going to be reflected in the legislation? kirsty williams am: Okay. So, we've been taking advice from Brett Pugh, who chairs the education otherwise than at school improvement group, and this has been an area where we've had to think really, really, really, really, really hard. So, what we intend to do for EOTAS and PRU is to set a minimum of what we would expect a child to receive. So, that would be around the four purposes; that would be around the cross-cutting themes of literacy, numeracy and digital competency and health and well-being. After that, then there needs to be a discussion and a focus on what is in the best interests of that particular pupil. One of the things we know about sometimes in EOTAS is we have very able and talented students who don't get access to the range of qualifications and courses that they have the capability and the aptitude to do. We also have to consider, though, that for some children they may be out of school for reasons, and telling them that they've got to do a full curriculum may be hugely detrimental to their mental health and well-being. So, for instance, to give an example, you could have a child who's very ill, and saying to them, 'You have to carry the full load of a curriculum' could be inappropriate. So, we'll be setting a minimum standard, as I said, around the purposes, around the cross-cutting themes and health and well-being, and then there will be an expectation that in conjunction with the child and the family an appropriate addition would be put in place to meet the needs of that child, recognising that they could have very different needs. Is that clear? lynne neagle am: Well, yes, and it's something that we'll probably look to build on when we look at our inquiry on EOTAS, which is coming up. So, can I thank you for attending and thank your officials for coming today? As usual, we will send you a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you again, all of you, for your attendance this morning. As Members will see, there are a substantial number of papers to note\u201423 in total, which are in a supplementary pack. As there are so many, can I suggest that we note them all together and then we've got an opportunity to return to some of them in the private session afterwards? Is that okay with everybody? Okay. Can I propose in accordance with Standing Order 17.42 that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content?<doc-sep>I've received apologies for absence from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian, and I'm very pleased to welcome Helen Mary Jones, who is substituting for Si\u00e2n today. Can I ask whether Members want to declare any interests, please? Can I just, then, place on record that I have got a son who was about to do A-levels, so is affected by the exam decision? We'll move on, then, to our substantive item today, which is an evidence session with the Welsh Government around the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on education in Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams, Minister for Education; Steve Davies, who is director of the education directorate; Huw Morris, who is the group director, skills, higher education and lifelong learning; and Rob Orford, who is the chief scientific adviser for health. We know that this is a really difficult and pressurised time for everyone, and we appreciate your attendance. As you know, it's not usually my practice to do that, but I think it is important today. COVID-19 coronavirus is one of the most significant issues that the Welsh Government and the people of Wales have dealt with in recent times. But I would like to assure you that our aim, and my aim, and my main concern as the education Minister is to protect all staff and pupils in our schools and other educational settings. Public health is clearly the priority here, but that does not change our belief that no child should miss out on any education, unless absolutely necessary. So, the decision to close all schools from tomorrow for statutory education provision was not taken lightly, but I believe it was necessary, given the advice and recommendations that we had received from a public health perspective and the situation that was developing on the ground. They will help support those most in need, including people involved in the immediate response to the coronavirus outbreak, and I'm working with my colleagues in the Cabinet, with Government officials and our partners in local government to develop and finalise these plans. The key areas that we're looking at are supporting and safeguarding the vulnerable and ensuring continuity of learning. I can confirm that all maintained schools in Wales already have access to a range of digital tools that can support distance learning through the world-class Hwb\u00a0digital learning platform, including virtual classrooms and video-conferencing facilities. A guide on what tools are available and how schools can use them has been developed and is being promoted widely. Yesterday, I announced that, whilst there are no easy choices, we have agreed that the best way forward is not to proceed with the summer exam series. Learners due to sit these exams will be awarded a fair grade to recognise their work, drawing on a range of information that is available, and I will announce further details shortly, but I felt it necessary to give early certainty to students and to staff. I would like to put on record my thanks to everyone working in education settings for the hard work that they have put in over the last few months in dealing with the virus and ensuring that pupils have been able to continue to learn. We need to continue to do this work together, as we face the continuing challenges posed by the coronavirus. We'll go to questions from Members now, and I've got some questions from Dawn Bowden. Can I thank you, Kirsty, for your statement and the really difficult decisions that you've been having to make? You've already indicated in your statement this morning that these decisions are not taken lightly, and we understand that that is the case across Government. You've outlined a little bit further there in your statement to us this morning about the new purpose. I take from what you're saying that you haven't really developed that yet in terms of exactly what that is going to look like. Is there anything else you can tell us about that at the moment and how you might staff the schools in those particular areas? kirsty williams am: Thank you, Dawn. So, you're\u00a0absolutely right, our priority now is to operationalise, with colleagues in local government and schools, a practical response. And I have to say, we're working to timescales that I would have hoped to have avoided, but given the fact that we're having to make these decisions quite quickly, I hope that you will understand that perhaps where we start on Monday might change when we have more time and more opportunities to develop programmes going forward. Steve will be able to give you more details of the practical work that has already been going on, but our expectation will be that schools will be playing an important part in providing safe and secure places for children of those on the front-line response to dealing with the coronavirus to attend, and work is already under way with local authorities and individual schools on what that will look like for the emergency situation on Monday. Our other priority is indeed free school meals, and, again, where we eventually end up might be a different place to where we are on Monday. Again, we're responding to the emergency situation that there will be families that were expecting a free school meal on Monday, and, again, individual schools and local authorities are developing those plans at pace to be able to provide an emergency response as we work out a longer term plan to deal with the situation. The same thing also goes for additional learning needs, and attending to the needs of that particular group of learners. I had the opportunity to meet with the First Minister and Andrew Morgan, the leader of the Welsh Local Government Association, yesterday to talk about what local government could do, and what they were already doing. Those plans in some places are already quite developed, and are now working at pace, but I hope you will understand that where we start on Monday is the emergency response, and that work will develop as we go forward. But, Steve, perhaps you could\u2014? Because Steve was the one making all those phone calls and doing the practical operational stuff, rather than me. steve davies: In short, the new purpose is to meet the needs of particular groups of children and young people. In some cases, some of the response to supporting free school meals, in the short term in particular, we may use the schools as part of that, and I'm certain that will happen in some cases. Now, there is still work to be done on identifying exactly the categories of key workers, but I think it's really encouraging that in my discussions yesterday\u2014I spoke with all 22 directors of education, and the examples we're picking up in their work with schools is they're already ahead of the curve in working with schools. They're vulnerable sometimes in terms of education other than at school, vulnerable in terms of mental health, and for those children, as well as having an experience that we want to be planned, some have compared it to a snow day, particularly on Monday, when you're putting something together in the short term, but it will not be a formal curriculum that those children would normally go through. So, the range of activities\u2014some will be focused on educational activities, some will be cultural, some will be sporting, and that plan will be developed on the basis of the age range of children, which in some cases may go from extremely young children up to those at the age of 16 in our all-through schools, but there will be a planned set of activities to cater for those children. What we are doing currently\u2014I have staff back at Cathays Park who are in touch and working with directors of education to ensure that schools over the next two days will have been able to identify, at least at the earlier stage, in terms of health workers, the type and numbers of people. There are already schools who have informed us, and local authorities, of their plans for these activities to be starting next week, which is quite amazing, actually, given where we are. But we are expecting, and we're writing to schools today, that during the course of next week, headteachers to be in schools, and with their staff, taking into consideration the health guidance as to which staff should or should not be in, and in that period from next Monday through the two-week period, to Easter, we expect staff to be both planning for delivery post Easter, but also, as I said, building on and reflecting the good practice that's already in place for schools that have engaged in activities, and I'm sure a number of them will be inviting and enabling those children to come in on Monday. So, Monday will be a challenge for some, and not all will be delivering it, but we will be working so that we can get as much as possible delivered for those groups over the next two weeks, and particularly to have resilient programmes post Easter for the groups of children in those three categories that I said. Can I just clarify one thing? One of the identified vulnerable groups would clearly be children on the at-risk register. kirsty williams am: In our discussions, we have asked local government to be working with the social services departments and individual schools to identify those children who may be in that situation. We know that, for some children, being at school is part of their safeguarding arrangements, and obviously we will need to be able to respond to those needs. steve davies: I wrote specifically yesterday to all directors of education to be assured that, for those children, the register is up to date and the plans are in place. I'm working with Albert Heaney my colleague, the director for social services, who is meeting with the 22 directors of social services today to look to ensure that we are joined up in ensuring none of these children fall through the gap. hefin david am: A very quick and simple question: how are you going to communicate this to parents? There's a bigger picture and it's changing all the time, as you said. The most helpful thing I've seen is that Public Health Wales have a single website with information regarding the wider issue of the virus. How will this then be cascaded to schools, because there's obviously a time lag? So, have you considered how this is going to be communicated directly to parents? kirsty williams am: We're using all of our platforms of communication to get these messages across. So, we're using the more informal methods of communication, but are relying on a systematic approach via individual directors and through to individual schools. We're looking, as quickly as we can, to have a frequently asked education questions page that we can update. It is impossible for the communications team here to be able to respond individually to every single person that is sending Facebook messages and sending tweets, so the best way we can do that is to collate the types of questions people are asking and then to be able to have a frequently updated question and answer page to try to respond to that. With regard to parents, for instance, we're aware of schools that have already sent a questionnaire out last night to parents saying, 'Do you consider yourself to be a key worker? Do you work in the NHS? Please let us know by tomorrow so we can put arrangements in place for your children.' So, schools are already taking the initiative and having those conversations with parents about what their needs will be. It won't be perfect by Monday, because we're working to such constrained timescales. We also have to think about systems that look at what might the epidemic do and have systems of resilience that may work next week, given the situation we find ourselves in with public health advice at the moment. Therefore, have we got a system that will be resilient in those circumstances? These are some of the challenges that we're having to grapple with. So, as I said, what happens on Monday might look very different to where we are if schools are still off in May. suzy davies am: Yes, just on this question of vulnerable children, I'm just wondering how much discretion teachers are going to have in including individual children who may not be obviously under social services' care or on a risk register or whatever. Teachers know their pupils and, very sensitively, they could include people who may not be obviously in need. kirsty williams am: We would absolutely respect the professional judgment of individual headteachers to be able to have those conversations with their directors. As you said, quite rightly, they are the individuals who know their children best and know which children, perhaps, will need this extra support. The second part of my question is: there were going to be Easter holidays anyway, weren't there? What was going to happen about free-school-meal children during that period? Has that gone out of the window now, the normal holiday provision for children? Because that's not there normally, is it, except in separate\u2014 kirsty williams am: We do find ourselves in a strange situation. My understanding is what we're trying to work to is that we would have ongoing provision and not to make some strange, 'You get this for two weeks, then you don't get it for two weeks, and then you're back in.' My understanding is, in England, that is what they're going to do. We're trying to create a system where it will be seamless and it will not necessarily matter that two of those weeks were formally holidays. It won't matter to those nurses and doctors who will need to be in work during those weeks. helen mary jones am: Just briefly, building on Suzy's question, one particular group of children and young people that I hope will be eligible to be included in the potentially vulnerable category is young carers. For some of them, they may not be able to come into school because the people they're caring for may have to be excluded because of their conditions. But I think that, for other young carers, coming to school is an absolute lifeline, because they're working at home. So, I don't know if it's appropriate for you to specifically mention those in discussions with local authorities, but it's a group of young people who, again, may not be vulnerable in other ways, but because of their caring responsibilities they may need school. And the other group\u2014and this, I suppose, goes back to Suzy's point about teachers knowing their young people\u2014is the children who may be living in situations where they're at risk of witnessing domestic abuse. Again, these may very well not be children who are in any formal contact with social services, but being at home may be really not a good place for them to be. So, again, I'd put in an appeal for that to be something that perhaps can be raised with schools. If a teacher is worried about what a child's circumstances are like at home, whether they can be, as you said, Kirsty, included as one of the\u2014. They may not be formally identified, but if the teacher knows that they're at risk, or there is an instinct that they're at risk, they might be able to be included in children who are allowed to take advantage of this special provision you're making at this difficult time. We have to do that in the context of what is deliverable, and we also have to do that in the context of the public health advice that we are receiving as well. We know that the ability for school closures to make a contribution to that diminishes if we have significant children in school still. So, we will take these issues into consideration, but remembering this is part of an epidemic mitigation plan. This is a rapidly-evolving problem and the scale is something that we haven't seen in 100 years, and so we're having to evolve and iterate things as we go. We've all got a role to play, and schools certainly have a significant role to play in breaking those chains of transmission. We need to send a really clear message that you're all part of the solution, and the things that you do by distancing yourselves from your friends and your family are really important for us to get on top of this outbreak. helen mary jones am: I'm sure that that's true, but I'm sure that we wouldn't be wanting a child who's in a very pressured environment with perhaps a very difficult relationship between mum and dad\u2014. janet finch-saunders am: Thank you, Chair, and good morning, Minister, and your team. Can I just put on record my thanks for all that you're having to endure at this moment? I think it's fair to say you have the support of Assembly Members and, indeed, our communities. Now, the question I have: if Cylch Meithrin have to close, where will they get money from to pay their staff? Because, currently, thankfully, there's support for businesses. lynne neagle am: Janet, we're not doing Cylch Meithrin at the moment; we are sticking with schools, as we discussed in advance. dawn bowden am: Can I just get some clarity, Steve, around what you were saying in terms of next week? Because I think the practical applications of this\u2014and I understand that you don't know all of this yet, I understand that\u2014the practical applications are what is coming to us, obviously, with constituents saying, 'Well, what's going to happen to that?' Just so that I can be clear, are you saying that, at this stage, every headteacher will be in school on Monday, as will all their staff? steve davies: Within the scope of the guidance in terms of their health, the expectation\u2014and this will be conveyed in letters by the Minister today, to be made clear\u2014is that they are closing for the majority of pupils, but our expectation within the guidance is that the headteacher with their staff will be coming in; for some to start the delivery of what we just described, but that will probably be small numbers, but more importantly to plan to ensure that, after the formal Easter period, which is school holidays, the schools are geared to cater for the range of pupils that we've been discussing. dawn bowden am: So, would you anticipate\u2014again, I know this is all a bit 'if and when', and it depends on the changing nature of the advice, but from what you're saying, I think we can probably anticipate that, as we go forward, there will probably be fewer schools opening and operable\u2014that we may be moving those children on to fewer sites. So, we already know that one of our local authorities already has identified a strategic pattern of schools that they will want to operate in this way. That local authority has already chosen those locations, and is already having communications with how they will then staff those centres. That, I expect, in the longer term, will be the nature of the provision that we will get to. The local authorities are best placed to understand what is the best, pragmatic use of the resources that they have available; and of course those resources, primarily, are human beings. So, we've talked a lot this morning in the context of teaching staff, teaching assistants, but we're also having discussions with local authorities, and I met with the Council for Wales of Voluntary Youth Services this week, to look at deploying youth workers, to look to be deploying other staff that the local authority may employ, like sports development officers. Welsh Government will be talking with a range of our partners who perhaps their normal activities can't continue at the moment, but actually have personnel who want to add to this effort, who want to be able to be part of a provision going forward in the longer term, to be able to provide a great place for children to be. Let's think about it, in these worst of times, we're asking parents to leave their children so that they can go and do essential work, and some of that essential work is putting themselves at risk, potentially. And we want to give those parents confidence that, when they leave their child with us, that child will receive something really worthwhile, and they can direct all of their attention to doing their job. Janet, have you got a supplementary on schools now, not on early years settings? janet finch-saunders am: I lost the signal before, so it's a little bit confusing at this end, so bear with me. Just in terms of the closure of schools, I have been asked by teachers what does new purpose\u2014you may have covered it, but bear in mind [Inaudible.]\u2014mean in practice. And also, they're already asking what will next\u2014? I know you said earlier that next week could look and probably will look significantly different than this week, but what can they expect to be happening next week in terms of this new purpose work? lynne neagle am: We've covered that, Janet. kirsty williams am: First of all, Janet, I just want to say thank you very much for your kind comments. lynne neagle am: I think you're having trouble hearing us, aren't you, so I think\u2014? janet finch-saunders am: No, I heard that loud and clear. lynne neagle am: But I think you missed the earlier comments, when we went into some detail on the new purpose of schools. dawn bowden am: Just in relation to special schools and how they will fit into this new purpose arrangement. We know, again, that some of these children are our most vulnerable and they are some of our most pressurised families. We'll be having discussions about what arrangements can be made for those children within their own usual settings. Can I give a shout out to the work of Rhondda Cynon Taf in this regard, who are already doing some excellent work with regard to how they can keep in touch with their children who usually would attend their special schools. steve davies: I think special schools have already been hit by this challenge, because a significant proportion of their children, because of their conditions, have not been coming to school, they've been isolated. But the principle we've used there is, actually, even if it's a minority of children who go to those schools and are vulnerable, they deserve and need that support through the school. But similarly, even in special schools, there will be children whose parents will be key workers, so we would expect them to apply that same principle. Just quickly in response to the earlier question, while we may bring some groups of children into separate schools, we\u2019ll have to continue with the principle of keeping social distance and any provision for a child in a special school in a different setting would be unlikely, given the nature of the special school, so we would look to cater for that within the original school. It\u2019s likely, because I know it has already happened, that some schools might actually close before Monday. Are you quite happy that headteachers still have the discretion to do that, if they feel that\u2019s the right thing to do? kirsty williams am: In this situation, the discretion of the head still remains. As I said, we will be communicating with all schools today about our expectations, if at all possible, to have schools open for staff to do some of this planning and to be able to respond to these priority needs that we've just talked about. steve davies: The rationale of headteachers for closing schools up to now has been that they can't cope with the safety of the children. I think, moving forward, it's unlikely that that would be a rationale that headteachers would want to use for not engaging and planning for the future. dawn bowden am: We're only talking about one more day, now, anyway, aren't we? So, just in terms of confirmed cases in schools, is your view at this stage that, if there is a confirmed case in a school, once that school has been deep-cleaned, it can reopen again? kirsty williams am: If we had a confirmed case in a school, then all the usual mechanisms arranged by Public Health Wales would kick in at that point. I know that kind of crosses over into somebody else's portfolio as well, but I think we know that. Certainly what I've seen, and I'm sure this is true elsewhere as well, we've seen nurseries closing down because the parents are actually taking the children out of those nurseries. I've got one in particular, there are kids from the ages of 6 to 12 years in there, and the parents are taking them out. They've got 30 staff there, catering for 200 children and no children to care for and the organisation, at this stage, is unable to claim on their insurance for the ongoing payment of those staff wages. Is there any advice that we can give to people in that situation at this stage? kirsty williams am: Sure. As you say, many of these settings are businesses\u2014people's businesses and they play a hugely important role and it's a very worrying time for them. We have said that we will continue to pay for childcare, delivered under the childcare offer even when a child is unable, or a parent is unwilling, to take up that place. So, if that setting is receiving a childcare payment from the Welsh Government as part of our childcare offer, that will be paid, regardless of whether that child attends or not. And I know that we're also working with local authorities to ensure a similar position on Flying Start childcare and early education. It's also important that childcare settings will be able to apply for the various packages of support that are being made available by my colleague, Ken Skates. hefin david am: Yes, I'd just like to turn that around from the parents' point of view. With schools closing, there are a lot of parents then losing 10 hours of free childcare, but from a settings point of view, they'll continue to be able to receive, for the time being, the nursery care. kirsty williams am: Yes, so the decision that has been taken by my colleague, Julie Morgan, is that settings should stay open at the moment unless public health changes. Again, the issue is that we know that that childcare is vital to many families, especially\u2014and we're particularly concerned about those individuals who are trying to help us overcome and solve these problems. If you have any specific questions about that, we'll be happy to take them back to Julie Morgan. janet finch-saunders am: Is this the Cylch question? lynne neagle am: Yes, please. Yes, just basically, Cylch Meithrin, there are concerns\u2014[Interruption.] lynne neagle am: We've lost Janet. kirsty williams am: I think if the issue is about funding for Cylch Meithrin, these are not normal circumstances. As a Welsh Government, we will take every step to provide continuity of funding, if at all possible. We will overcome this, and when we overcome this situation we find ourselves in, we will need those childcare settings, we will need those private businesses and we will need our Cylch Meithrin to be there to respond and to be able to go on doing the job that they usually do for us. And if there is any way that we can, as a Government, ensure that that happens by carrying on funding things, even if they are not able to run, all usual\u2014[Inaudible.]\u2014 around service-level agreements are off. [Laughter.] But, you know, we will not undermine businesses and voluntary provision like Cylch by withdrawing Welsh Government funding. lynne neagle am: If we can move on to talk about exams, obviously you made the announcement yesterday. I completely understand that everything is a very fast-moving situation, but, as you know, there are a lot of questions that people have about young people who've put a lot of work in. Are you able to tell us any more today? In particular, have you got any idea about timescales now for setting out what the approach will be to handling the lack of summer exams? kirsty williams am: Yes, it is a devastating decision to have to have been taken, but I have done so on the very, very clear and unambiguous advice from Qualifications Wales. What was most important to them was that I made an early decision and I did not equivocate on what would happen for the exams. I was able to make an informal decision at that meeting, and then, of course, there is a formal process that we have to go through. That, now, allows Qualifications Wales and the exam board to operationalise that decision, and they will be communicating with schools as quickly as possible about what schools will need to do to ensure that the systems that they will now put in place can work. We are trying, as far as we can, as I understand it, to be able to mirror as closely as possible the usual results day, for instance. It might not be possible, because, of course, we're dealing with a situation that requires human beings to be involved in it, and those human beings could find themselves unwell. So, our best attempts will be to maintain the normal rhythm of an exams day in August, but that has to be caveated by the fact that we're dealing with difficult circumstances. But, the WJEC and Qualifications Wales will be making urgent communications to exam centres to explain what will need to happen next. janet finch-saunders am: Yes, I think I raised it yesterday, Kirsty, but you were receiving loads of questions. I'd just ask for some further clarification about coursework, because only 30 per cent of that is done. Years 11 and 13, typically, in my case they're what's been raised with me\u2014do you have any advice for them? kirsty williams am: Okay, so, all exams are cancelled, but year 11 and year 13 will be given a grade\u2014I think that's a distinction that people need to be aware of. That is because those years and those grades are gateway qualifications, and they are points of movement in the education system. So, it's really important for those students that they are not disadvantaged in any way by not being able to receive a grade that helps them to make a decision as a qualifying step into what they will do next, whether that be university, whether that be a degree apprenticeship or whether that be going into sixth form, into a college, into an apprenticeship or into some work-based learning opportunities. That's why we have to focus on those children, because for them, it is absolutely critical that we do. We are at an advantage in Wales, can I say? Because of the nature of our examination system, those students already have a lot of externally assessed work that we can use as a basis to move forward on. Our year 11s, if they're doing triple science, they've already done 40 per cent of their paper, so we're very fortunate. Because of the structures that we have got in our qualification system, there is already lots and lots of externally-verified work that we can use, alongside, potentially, teacher evaluation of students as well. What will also be important is that these children have confidence in those qualifications, and so we will be looking at a modulated arrangement within Wales, and I know that Qualifications Wales are discussing with their counterparts across the UK a modulated system across the UK. So, actually, we can make sure that our standards are maintained by actually having that modulation across the UK. So, we know that those children never have to worry about the rigour that has gone into determining that grade. You'll know that the National Union of Students has suggested that black and minority ethnic children and children from the working class, on the whole, don't do as well, in terms of their assessment by their own teachers. We also know, of course, that boys tend to do better in exams, and girls tend to do better at coursework, for whatever reason\u00a0that is. So, just to ask you at this early stage to build in those considerations around potential unconscious bias into that overall system that you're talking about. And, of course, you are right to say that, because we have got some elements of external moderation here, those factors may be less for us in Wales than they might for colleagues in England. kirsty williams am: Yes, I think we are starting at a different base, thank goodness. As I said, students will have done unit 1 papers last year if they're GCSE students. I have every confidence that they and the WJEC will come up with a very comprehensive way of establishing those grades, but I have to say, in some ways, I have to step back now, because you would not expect me, in normal circumstances, to dictate to the WJEC how much percentage goes for that, and how much percentage is allocated for that; that would not be appropriate for a Minister. My job is to make the decision on the examinations on the basis of having confidence that what can be put in place is fair and is equitable, and I have confidence that that will be the case. One is, obviously, pupils are being asked to work at home as well now, some of whom will be doing GCSE and A-level courses. So, there's just a question, generally, from me\u2014 because we're encouraging these kids to carry on working\u2014how that will be accommodated by Qualifications Wales, I guess, in this modulation process. It may be that your at-home work will be of a higher standard or a lower standard than a teacher would be expecting. Secondly, you mentioned the AS-levels, of course, as being of value at the moment, but we've got people in Year 12 who now won't be doing their ASs. Is there any steer at this stage about what they will be expected to do? Will they be doing two sets of exams next year, for example? Or is AS just off the table? In which case, how are the A2s going to be calculated in due course? And then, finally from me, we do have some vocational qualifications that are up for examination as well\u2014your BTECs, and I think it's the Association of Accounting Technicians, which is a lot of computer-based learning\u2014which is due to be examined within three weeks. I appreciate that you may not have the answer just at the moment, but are they off as well is the question, I guess? kirsty williams am: With regard to\u00a0AS-levels\u2014no final decision has been made for exactly how those students will be treated. There are a range of options that could be used, but again, we will want to be thinking about student well-being, fairness and equity in that regard, and I will update Members as soon as I have received definitive advice from Qualifications Wales around that, and that hasn't happened yet. With regard to other types of qualifications, as you will be aware, the vast majority of BTECs is a modular, continually-assessed piece of work, and we would have every expectation that BTECs will be able to be awarded, but clearly, those conversations are with awarding bodies\u2014they tend to be UK awarding bodies, rather then necessarily our WJEC exam board\u2014and those conversations are ongoing. But I have every expectation that those qualifications will be awarded and, of course, because of their nature there's even more evidence of continued assessment. Huw, I don't know if there's anything else that you would like to add about those types of qualifications. I don't have a definitive answer for the ATT qualification, but we can look into that and come back to you. suzy davies am: Well, I've just had a constituent ask, so that would be very helpful. suzy davies am: \u2014is that going to count towards the assessments, overall assessments? kirsty williams am: Well, potentially, as I said. What will be absolutely necessary is that Qualifications Wales and the WJEC will be able to give absolute clarity and simplicity around how those grades will be arrived at, because parents, teachers and students will want to know that, and my expectation is on them to be able to clearly communicate what elements will and will not be taken into consideration when awarding those grades. lynne neagle am: And, just before we move on, have the universities across the UK indicated that they are content with this approach going forward\u2014content to accept students on this basis? kirsty williams am: Certainly. There have been discussions with universities and UCAS, of course, that this also has a bearing on. And the views of university and how university terms might be impacted is one of the ways and one of the reasons that we've factored in to making these decisions. Those discussions with universities are ongoing, aren't they, Huw? huw morris: Yes. So, we've been in regular conversation with Universities Wales and through them with Universities UK and we've received every indication that the approach that's been adopted here has been welcomed by the institutions. Those conversations will continue as we work through the practicalities of how the gradings that are awarded are going to feed through into university admissions decisions and enrolment. Well, we've got some questions now from Suzy on the potential closures of colleges and universities. I appreciate you've already indicated there are lots of ongoing conversations, but my understanding is whether colleges or universities close is pretty much still at their own discretion. We're going to be asking some questions on emergency legislation shortly, which may impact on the answer you can give today, but what sort of conversations are you having with FE and HE at the moment about how they decide? kirsty williams am: Well, you're absolutely right. As we often say in this committee, universities are autonomous institutions\u2014a status that they guard jealously and we would never want to question. Universities have been making the decision to move as much of their learning online as they possibly can and we continue to have conversations with them. Colleges are in a similar position, looking to do as much as they can to be able to provide continuity of learning via distance learning methods, and the Bill, potentially, does give us more powers of intervention in both the FE and the HE sector. suzy davies am: I might ask you about that in a minute, because I don't even know what the Bill says yet. kirsty williams am: Huw, I don't know if there's anything you want to add. huw morris: No\u2014just to confirm what's been said and also to add in that independent training providers, similarly autonomous, like colleges and universities, have been moving in the same direction. We've been very impressed with the maturity and forward-planning that's been adopted by all of those institutions and their representative bodies. We've got consistency in the approach and a common desire, and investment in moving towards online support for students. Certainly, colleges have indicated, as with schools, that, for the most vulnerable learners, they'll have something in place that might permit attendance on an individual basis. huw morris: That's my understanding, yes, and, again, we've been in regular conversation with them about that. My understanding is that they're going to spend the next week working through the detail of how that will work for the institutions. You indicated that any Welsh Government support's going to stay, whatever the circumstances are\u2014in your portfolio. helen mary jones am: Just further to EMA, of course, at the moment, that has an attendance qualification, doesn't it? And you don't get your EMA if you don't turn up. Should we take from your last answer that that attendance qualification doesn't apply anymore? kirsty williams am: Yes. They can't turn up if the institution is not open, and that's not their fault. helen mary jones am: No, but that is something that's been a worry, so that's really encouraging to hear. Thinking about students in higher education, can you give an assurance that student maintenance payments will continue as normal? Is that the intention? kirsty williams am: Yes. And have you given any special ministerial instruction to Student Finance Wales on processing applications for support or changes of circumstances, or is that something that's kind of ongoing at the moment? kirsty williams am: Those conversations are ongoing with the Student Loans Company. Individual student circumstances could well change and our expectation would be that the Student Loans Company would respond to that. All I would say is, just to remind people: people who work for the Student Loans Company are no more able to resist this disease than anybody else. There will undoubtedly in some cases be really practical challenges to service delivery, simply because organisations could be losing staff because of illness or the need to self-isolate or because they are reacting to social-distancing messages from the Government. So, I think we just need to bear that in mind: that these organisations are doing their best, but, if they are badly affected by staff numbers being off because of the virus, then I hope people will give them due consideration. helen mary jones am: Yes, that makes sense, of course, because we've been told that universities won't be able to entirely close, because there will be students who can't go home\u2014 kirsty williams am: It is their home. What discussions have you been having with the sector to make sure that those students' basic needs are met, that there's still food, shelter, whatever they need? kirsty williams am: Well, obviously, universities have a duty of care to those students that find themselves in those circumstances, and every conversation that Huw's been having would suggest that universities are well aware of their need to do that. huw morris: We instituted a monitoring process very early on in the onset of the disease, not least because a number of institutions have campuses and activities in China and other parts of south-east Asia. And so, as the disease has progressed, we've seen lessons being learned from the support for students who are in isolation coming from there to the UK, and I am assured that the universities here in Wales have got processes in place that support those learners. And on this specifically\u2014last question from me\u2014 have you considered whether students might need to be refunded some of their tuition fees, should the academic year not be completed? huw morris: So, as the institutions move more and more of their material and some of their assessment online, clearly, there are lessons that will need to be taken on board. There are established quality assurance and enhancement procedures in institutions to enable the tutors and other supporters to make sure that that material meets their needs. There are appeals mechanisms and feedback mechanisms through the students union and through course committees and other things within institutions to make sure that any concerns or incomplete work are addressed. Failing those institutional mechanisms, there is a UK-wide system through the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for students to take forward any concerns that they have. So, we're confident that that system will be robust and will make sure that the students are getting a course of learning that meets their needs. But thinking just a little bit more broadly about the mental health and well-being of staff and learners across a range of educational settings, or, indeed, young people who can't access educational settings, what considerations are you giving to how that mental health and well-being might be supported through what is an incredibly difficult time for everyone? kirsty williams am: Yes, that is correct. So, our expectation would be that during a prolonged period of closure\u2014which I think, if we're honest, we have to acknowledge is what we're looking at\u2014we would expect school staff\u2014well-being staff, for instance in school\u2014to be doing check-ins\u2014phone check-ins, potentially, or FaceTime check-ins, with students, just to keep in touch with them as we go forward. We'll be looking to promote amongst young people\u00a0a range of online facilities that are available\u2014so, for instance, Meic website\u2014so, looking to use a variety of platforms. I'm concerned, of course, that for some children their access to their counsellor is\u00a0via their school. We know that, and we're just double checking the capacity of online counselling that already exists\u2014online counselling tools that children already use because they don't want to go to the counsellor in the school and be seen in the school corridor going to the counsellor. They're already using those online methods and we expect to be able to continue, as far as possible, those kinds of mechanisms where children can have their mental health needs and their questions answered, and their worries. One of the reasons, again, that we wanted to keep schools going as long as possible\u2014and teachers have been working so hard to do that\u2014is because that routine of going into school and that normality is one that we've needed and wanted to maintain. Children will have worries about their own health; they'll have worries about the health of their parents and their grandparents; they will be consuming potentially media and news stories that have empty supermarket shelves. So, we need to understand, and I think we will also have to recognise, that this support will have to be ongoing once we're back to normal, and we will have to continue to look to support children in the longer term who will have lived through this experience. They are incredibly resilient, and they have been the champions of some of our public health messages. They are so much better and so much more compliant on the whole 'washing your hands' and things like that than even adults have been. So, they are incredibly resilient, but we also have to recognise that it can be a really worrying time for them. helen mary jones am: Can I just\u2014? Just a supplementary to that\u2014you've mentioned already, Kirsty, the importance of youth services, and, particularly thinking voluntarily youth services, you've given the commitment, when were talking about Mudiad Ysgolion Meithrin earlier, that services that are part-funded by grants through the Welsh Government, for example, thinking of the national youth voluntary service\u2014will those be able to be maintained even if settings have had to be shut as well? Obviously, local authorities will have to make their own decisions about whether youth settings are kept open, but, in terms of the direct support from Welsh Government, can organisations that receive it rely on that through this time? kirsty williams am: No formal decision has been made, but if people are in receipt of a Government grant from my department to run a service and that service can no longer run because of the public\u2014 helen mary jones am: Because it's not safe. kirsty williams am: \u2014because it's not safe to do so, I do not foresee that we will be turning around and saying, 'We'll have our money back, thank you very much.' lynne neagle am: Okay, thank you. The normal rules of engagement have to change and, those organisations, we'll need them to be providing youth services for children when we are back to normal, and we wouldn't want to do anything that would undermine their ability to do that. When we're trying to maintain services for vulnerable children and for front-line staff children, they have a valuable role to play and I know that local government and the Council for Wales of Voluntary Youth Services are already in discussion about how youth services\u2014. Those traditional youth clubs, because of austerity, are not necessarily there anymore, so they are well used to being out and about and doing outreach work, and they will have an important part to play in the services that we talked about earlier. Hefin, briefly, and then we're going to take one final question from Suzy on emergency legislation. I'll declare an interest as a parent of a child with additional learning needs, although the question I'm about to ask doesn't reflect her interests. Additional learning needs pupils who are waiting outcomes of referrals\u2014if they're currently waiting an outcome of a referral, will that process will be suspended or will it continue as normal? And, if it is suspended, will it pick up where it left off from this point? kirsty williams am: I think we have to recognise that the ability to deliver business as usual has been massively compromised. I'm sure people will try and continue to do their normal activities and their normal jobs, but that might not be possible. I don't want to give you any false assurance if, actually, the intelligence on the ground is that that simply will not be able to happen. But we don't\u2014 hefin david am: Can we have a clear line on that? kirsty williams am: We don't want to jeopardise anybody, but as I said, some of the normal services are simply not available as everybody turns their attention to trying to respond to the pandemic. Final question\u2014because I know that the Minister's got a lot of things that she needs to get on with\u2014from Suzy on emergency legislation. suzy davies am: I'm not going to ask you if you'll use any powers you get under the emergency legislation, but are you able to give us some indication of what they might be? kirsty williams am: Sure. For instance, the Bill will provide Welsh Ministers with powers to temporarily close schools or other educational institutions, childcare premises; powers to give temporary continuity direction\u2014so, actually, the other way around, force things to be open\u2014and to be able to direct resources. So, that includes, as I said, I could direct something to stay open if that institution was trying to close down. The powers also give flexibility to maybe be able to direct staff to other institutions that they would not normally work in, if that was part of our resilience needs. We'd also be looking at, for instance, relaxing requirements around ratios in childcare settings, or we might be wanting to do things around food. If there is a continuing role for schools in providing food, we might have to be a bit more flexible about what that might look like. So, those kinds of flexibilities\u2014to be able to suspend things, direct things\u2014that we would not normally have in normal circumstances. And just to finish this one off\u2014you may not be able to answer this one, in all fairness\u2014in those situations where it's the Government who says 'no' to various things, does that then help people in the situation of Dawn's nursery, and insurance claims suddenly become more likely? kirsty williams am: I'm not an expert on insurance, and I don't know if anybody here can help me. But what my understanding is, is that even where Government has given a direction that does not necessarily mean that you will be covered by your insurance. What we're finding in the private sector is that insurance companies are not paying out, because even when a Government has directed it, they do not regard this as a disruption to business. kirsty williams am: It's not my area of expertise, but from what I understand from discussions around the Cabinet table, this is particularly problematic. Let me give you an example about how we've been trying to overcome some of this\u2014it feels like an awfully long time ago now\u2014 you'll be aware that we gave directions earlier around cancellation of school trips abroad. Trying to make sure that that direction came from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, rather than the Department for Education was a real battle, because again there were fears that, unless that advice came from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, insurance would not kick in, and that was a two-day discussion. kirsty williams am: So, these are the kinds of things that we're grappling with. But, as I said, thinking about it, that was only last week, but it feels like an aeon ago. suzy davies am: I'm not holding you to that, but it helps us manage the questions we get asked. kirsty williams am: Yes, but as I said, insurance is not my area of expertise. Can I thank you for attending this morning, and your officials? We do recognise what an incredibly challenging time this is, and we'd like to place on record our thanks to all of you for the work that you're doing to try and see us through this crisis. Item 3, then, is a motion under Standing Order 17.42 to resolve to exclude the public for the remainder of the meeting"

        "Query": "What were Dr. Frank Atherton's thoughts on having a target, investment, data, addressing gaps in data, and legislation to build a healthy environment?",
        "Summary": "Dr Frank Atherton emphasizes the importance of having a target that is both achievable and challenging. He believes that a target is not only a tool, but also an evaluation to assess progress. However, there is still much work to be done. In terms of investment, Dr Frank Atherton mentions that they currently invest in various areas related to child health, including obesity. The estimated investment needed for their plan is around \u00a38 million to \u00a310 million per year. Additionally, Dr Frank Atherton suggests considering diverting some of the \u00a37 billion spent on health and social care towards prevention initiatives and tackling obesity. The latest data presented by Dr Frank Atherton shows that less than a third of children aged four or five are overweight or obese, but the situation is not improving. The data also reveals that about 12% of children are severely obese. Dr Frank Atherton highlights the importance of having a longitudinal view of children's health over time, which would require significant resources. He also supports the implementation of legislation to create a healthy environment, citing examples of food takeaways. Overall, Dr Frank Atherton's goal is to address the challenges of child health and obesity through targeted strategies and investments.",
        "Article": "We've received apologies for absence from Michelle Brown and Jack Sargeant; there are no substitutions. We'll move on, then, to item 2, which is our scrutiny of the 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' draft strategy, and I'm very pleased to welcome Dr Frank Atherton, the Chief Medical Officer for Wales, and Nathan Cook, who is the head of the healthy and active branch at Welsh Government. If I can just start by asking about the fact that 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' is an all-age strategy, really, and how confident you are that it will deliver for children and young people. We have high prevalence of overweight and obesity among adults\u2014we know that, and we can't walk away from that because that's translating into demand on health services. But we have to take a focus, a future generation's focus, almost, on the next generation. I don't write off the current generation, we can't afford to do that, but we do need to think about what can we do that would be different for the next generation so that they don't get into the sorts of problems that we're currently seeing with overweight and obesity. We know that the consequences of that for our young people are going to be enormous if we don't do something and something quite soon. We know that overweight children go on to become overweight adults, unfortunately, and that brings all the consequences of multiple disease issues\u2014diabetes is often cited\u2014cancer risk et cetera. So, we have to focus on children, and, in fact, during the consultation, we've been very clear that we need to engage with children and young people as well. Perhaps we'll get into that at some point, Chair, but, yes, I can give you that assurance. What my follow-up question, really, is: can you just tell us what kind of engagement you've had with children and young people to inform the draft strategy? dr frank atherton: Well, Nathan may be able to influence some of the detail, but in broad terms, we have discussed with young people in a number of fora. In fact, I was delighted that we had a young person, Evie Morgan, a schoolgirl from mid Wales, who came to the joint launch on the consultation. She met the Minister there and gave a very good personal account of her views on obesity and overweight. I'm visiting a school, either this week or next week, at Treorchy, to talk with teachers and young people there. nathan cook: I was going to say, we've also had a session with youth ambassadors as well, and what we've actually produced for the consultation is not just the children and young people's version, but also a toolkit in terms of getting schools really engaged and involved in terms of the work that we want them to do to feed into this as well. So, we've already had some really good responses from a lot of youth group and schools already. lynne neagle am: And you've got a structured programme, have you, to roll that out? Okay. We've got some questions now on leadership, and the first questions are from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian. The Minister for health said yesterday, in answering a question from me on the Chamber floor, that you gave him advice not to have a target in terms of reducing obesity among children. Could you confirm that that's what your advice was and tell us why you don't think that a target is needed? dr frank atherton: My advice was not that we don't need a target\u2014we may well need a target, and that's one of the issues we need to consult on\u2014but that the target that had been adopted in England and in Scotland to halve the prevalence of obesity in children was more aspirational than deliverable, and that if we are to choose a target in Wales, then we need to balance deliverability with challenge. So, there is something about performance management, because I would be looking to not just the health system but the health and care system and to public services boards to think about how they're delivering on this, and I think we can use targets to that. But they are one tool in the box that I would think we could use, and part of the consultation is to ask that question\u2014'If we are to go down a route in Wales of choosing a target, what might that look like?' sian gwenllian am: Okay. dr frank atherton: It's certainly something that we could consider in terms of the final strategy. Well, that is contrary to what I was told yesterday on the floor of the Chamber by the Minister, but there we go. I'm glad to hear that you're not ruling out having a target, because without a target, without something to aim for, how do we know that we're getting there? dr frank atherton: I think your point about evaluation is really important. Whatever we produce at the end of this process\u2014and we're looking to produce a final strategy towards the autumn\u2014we do need to have a strong evaluation. So, some metrics in there, it would seem, would be appropriate, but what those are, what the nature of those are, do we frame them as targets or ambitions\u2014that's the point we need to consult on. If the Government is going to be successful in terms of the aim of reducing childhood obesity, then it needs to fund and support the actions. Have you made an assessment of the level of investment needed to implement this plan? dr frank atherton: Resourcing will be important. We currently do make investments in a number of areas that relate to child health generally, and, of course, obesity and overweight in particular. Now, we can't quantify an absolute amount of resource that will be needed to deliver until we know exactly what's going to come out of the consultation and what actions we might want to deliver to a greater degree in Wales. A figure of \u00a38 million to \u00a310 million a year has been banded around as a broad kind of area of what we might need to invest, but that would need to be drawn from existing programmes. Can we make them more effective? Can we get better value from them? And there may well be a case for new investment, and that's a question, of course, that would need to be discussed with Ministers when we're producing the final strategy. nathan cook: But I think a key consideration as well is we already know there is investment across health boards in some kind of obesity-related services. So, I think what we really need to think about across Wales is how we can drive greater scale, how we can look at current programmes in terms of making sure that they're better evaluated, and how we can make sure that we're also drawing up on the existing resources and capacity out there as well. sian gwenllian am: And does the level of investment depend on what the target is\u2014what the goal is? dr frank atherton: I don't think you can necessarily just link the two. The issue of resourcing is one that's there irrespective of whether we choose to put a target in place. sian gwenllian am: But how would we know that it's being used effectively if there isn't something to aim for? dr frank atherton: Which brings you back to the question about evaluation. sian gwenllian am: Yes, but without a target, how can you properly evaluate? If you don't know what you're trying to do, how can you properly evaluate? Anyway, you're open to suggestions about having a target, which is great. Would you agree that Government could use the revenue that's being produced through the levy on soft drinks towards some of these efforts to\u2014? dr frank atherton: Well, of course, there are some consequentials that are coming to the Welsh Government as part of the levy on sugary soft drinks. That funding, of course, is less than we had anticipated, and that reflects, actually, a success story because industry is reformulating, and so the amount of sugar in soft drinks is already starting to decrease, which is a good thing. I'm not personally in favour of hypothecation, I think I'm more interested in the totality of resource that goes into public health programmes than into marginal resource. And when I think about obesity, I don't just think about the relatively small marginal amounts of money that come in through whatever source, but I think about the totality of the \u00a37 billion we spend in health and social care and how we can divert and channel some of that towards broad prevention initiatives in general, and towards tackling being overweight and obesity in particular. Could you give us any kind of figure? dr frank atherton: I'm sorry, could you repeat the question? sian gwenllian am: You say that there is less money that's come in through these consequentials from the levy, can you mention some sort of figure? dr frank atherton: The figure that I have in mind is about \u00a356 million that's coming in in terms of revenue over a two-year period. When the sugar levy was first brought in, there was some modelling at UK level about what level of revenue that would bring, but it was based on the amount of sugar that was currently then in drinks and the fact that the sugar has reduced in drinks, the total amount available to the UK is less and hence our consequentials are less. nathan cook: Yes, I was going to say, there was a mid-year report done where the levy has raised \u00a3150 million to date since coming into force in April, and the original forecast was \u00a3520 million a year. So, I think that shows the amount of work that's been done by industry around reformulation. sian gwenllian am: And the consequentials of that? That is the consequential\u2014\u00a3150 million. sian gwenllian am: Yes, so what's the Welsh consequential? lynne neagle am: Fifty-six. Anyway, it's a good sum of money and you're talking about investing \u00a38 million to \u00a310 million. So, obviously, you know, we can be more ambitious because there is money in that pot if that money was ring-fenced for this particular scheme. dr frank atherton: Well, the resource is going to be a real issue that we need to address, and I think as Nathan has said, there is funding of various initiatives currently in the system, and we need to look at that and make that as effective as possible. Will there be a need for some additional resource? There may well be, and that's a question that we'll have to look at in terms of the strategy when we develop it and have a discussion with Ministers about the level of resourcing. lynne neagle am: Can I just ask on that before Si\u00e2n moves on? What assessment have you made of how that money is being spent in other UK nations? Because my understanding is that the money is being used in other UK nations to directly impact on obesity. Have you given any consideration to\u2014? As I understand it, that money now is being dispersed around a plethora of programmes, including the transformation programme, and what I found very odd, really, was vaccination, which is surely the core business of the NHS. Have you got any view on that? dr frank atherton: I'm not sure I understand your point, Chair, in terms of the link between the consequentials from\u2014. Are you talking about the consequentials from the sugar levy or are you talking about\u2014? lynne neagle am: Yes, because in other nations, it is being used to directly impact on initiatives to tackle obesity, whereas, we've kind of put it here in Wales into the general pot and it's being used to fund a plethora of different things. My preference\u2014it's a personal view\u2014is that hypothecation doesn't really help us too much. , what we need to look at is whether the programmes, the sorts of programmes that are being funded in England, or indeed in Scotland, are working effectively, and if they are, are they being delivered here in Wales? We have looked very carefully at the plans that England and Scotland have for tackling obesity and overweight, and we've made a comparison with what we're doing in Wales, and our ambition in Wales is to go further than those nations, in many ways. But I come back to the point that just linking the hypothecation of a relatively small amount of resource is likely to be less impactful than asking a question of public services boards and of the health system, indeed, about how much money, overall, are we putting into prevention. lynne neagle am: No, I recognise that, and I think we're talking about additional resource. suzy davies am: I was just wondering whether you thought that there was a useful psychological link on the part of the public between saying, 'Here's a sugar levy', and 'It's going to be used to help children and adults stay healthier.' Going into a pot, it actually makes it quite difficult to explain the purpose of the tax in the first place. So, I take your overall point, but in terms of the people who we're trying to help in all this, actually creating a direct link might be quite helpful. You're putting an emphasis on the whole-system approach in implementing the plan, how are you going to create a system that co-ordinates action and drives change across relevant partners, avoiding a situation where it's everyone's role, but nobody's responsibility? How are you going to avoid that? dr frank atherton: It's a very important question, and one of the four strands in the consultation is exactly related to that, around leadership and drive nationally. You may notice, by the way, that we've chosen not to talk about an obesity strategy but a healthy weight strategy, because I think having a positive construct is really quite important to us here in Wales. But leadership will be really important, and we will need some sort of structure to lead this, to provide oversight. I'm not a great believer in creating new structures, so we do need something that will give that drive, but the leadership comes from the top down. And then we need to make sure that the public sector generally is engaged in this, but it goes way beyond the public sector, of course, because we have to work with industry, and we have to work with communities, and we have to work with the public on this. Interestingly, we had quite a large discussion two days ago between health and social care, but also involving the third sector and some members of the public, around how can we drive prevention more generally. It wasn't specifically on obesity, but of course obesity came up because it's such a pressing issue. This question of governance was discussed quite extensively, and we do have governance systems, of course, in Wales. We have public services boards, we have regional partnership boards, and how we can get those aligned behind this common agenda is really important. But I'd like to see\u2014and I know I'm a public health professional, so I know that only maybe 10 per cent, 15 per cent, possibly 20 per cent of what makes and keeps us healthy as individuals and as communities can be driven through the health system; but I would like the system to step up and take these kinds of issues more seriously as well. So I'd be looking for local leadership through directors of public health and indeed through chief executives to work with their public services boards on this. So, we'll need some sort of national oversight, absolutely, but we need local ownership and local leadership, too. Which Minister do you believe it should be accountable to, or, given the complexity of obesity, should the board be directly accountable to the First Minister? dr frank atherton: Ultimately, the First Minister will be responsible for this and will want to have a strong oversight of this. It is often framed as a health issue, and the Minister, Vaughan Gething, has a strong personal commitment to this, I know. We've talked extensively with him and with sports and recreation colleagues about that, so there's a link there. It does cut across all portfolios, and so this is an issue that I have discussed with Cabinet, and that collective ownership is really important, and will be, because it can't just sit in one domain. I think what you do need to have is you do need to have a lead organisation or a lead ministry, and I would see health as\u2014I work within health, so I'm perhaps biased, but I would see health as leading this, but it needs broad ownership across Government. janet finch-saunders am: I know my colleague Si\u00e2n Gwenllian mentioned earlier targets and things, but I know in Wales we're not too good at collecting data. What data is currently available on childhood obesity and what metrics will be used to measure progress against the plan's objectives? dr frank atherton: Well, of course, our main data source is the child measurement programme, which collects information on children entering school aged four or five. Well, I'm sure you're familiar with the statistics, but it'll be just under a third of children at that age who are overweight or obese\u2014 janet finch-saunders am: Could I just ask\u2014sorry to interrupt\u2014how up to date is that? dr frank atherton: The last survey was just last year. dr frank atherton: So, it's pretty up to date, and what it shows\u2014. It's not getting radically worse\u2014there's always statistical variation in these things\u2014but it's not getting any better. And, for the first time last year, we did look at the question not just of children who were overweight or obese, but we actually singled out the proportion who are obese, severely obese. So we have a figure for that for the first time, which is about 12 per cent, which is quite shocking, in a way. Does that answer your question? janet finch-saunders am: Yes, but how will any gaps in your data be addressed? dr frank atherton: Well, one of the questions that are often asked is: could we measure more on a longitudinal basis? By that  in England, for example, children are measured at school entry and then again at year 11\u2014at age 11 or 12., that kind of age group. I think that would be helpful to us in Wales, and it's one of the questions in the consultation about whether we should expand that. Obviously, that would have significant resource implications, not just for the funding, but also for schools and for the system to deliver it. But it's something that maybe would help us in terms of better understanding and better evaluation\u2014the point that was made earlier. nathan cook: And the other data we do have is the millennium cohort study, which has been released, for 14 and 15-year-olds. We're starting to think about how we can utilise some of that data, looking at that longitudinal picture around children as well, which will be really helpful. lynne neagle am: Can I just ask about the child measurement programme? The strategy commits to looking at whether we can have a second measurement taking place in Wales. Can you just tell us a bit more about your thinking on that and when you would see a second measurement taking place and how you would use that data? dr frank atherton: I touched on that just now, but personally I do think it would be helpful to have more information. It's always the case, There's always a trade-off between the cost of getting that information and the value of the information. We know an awful lot about obesity and being overweight and the causes of it, but we don't really have a very clear understanding, in Wales at least, of the point at which children start to become overweight. Although we know that overweight children tend to go on to become overweight adults, we don't know what proportion of them between school entry and later teenage years\u2014what those changes are. So, it would help us to have some better understanding, which would help to direct some of our initiatives. We'll wait and see what comes out in the consultation, and it's something that we need to give thought to,\u00a0 but we do have to trade off the additionality of what the information would give us with the cost of doing that, of course. In the draft plan, some of the measures in there suggest legislating for restricting price promotions and banning energy drinks, and that sort of thing. Do you think that, if we go down that road, there's going to be time within this Assembly to introduce such legislation? And, if not, what do you think might be the timescale for such legislation? dr frank atherton: It may well be that there are things in Wales that we might wish to legislate on, and you've mentioned two of them, and they're good examples. We would, obviously, need to undertake quite detailed consultation on those and, in a way, we need to mirror what's happening in England and in Scotland\u00a0to some degree around the consultations they're having on energy drinks. We also need to influence the issues that are not devolved to us and we seek to do that. The timing of that will have to be subject to other pressures, and I come back to the point that legislation, of course, is one of the tools that we've got\u2014we need to deploy them all. We've heard from the Government, on other calls for legislation, that the programme's very tight, certainly for this term, so I was just wondering whether we might get that in, but okay. If I turn now to the planning system\u2014and this might not be something that you have great deal of knowledge of; I'd just welcome your view on this, because, when we discussed with stakeholders, we talked about whether the planning system, for instance, could be used to, as an example, restrict hot food takeaways around schools and so on. Would that be a measure that you would support, something like that? dr frank atherton: I think it's definitely something we want to look at and, of course, that question is asked in the consultation, so we would like to know people's views on that. I think there is a question\u2014a really important question\u2014about how we can use the planning system more effectively. I've discussed with Nathan on a number of occasions, with planning colleagues in Welsh Government and in local authorities, about the art of the possible, let's say. I was very interested to see, up in the north-east, some time ago, that one of the local authorities up there did put a moratorium on the opening of new fast-food venues near to schools, or indeed in areas where levels of obesity and overweight were particularly high. So, that gave me comfort, because maybe there are powers within local authorities that can be used more effectively.\u00a0I think my view at the moment is that the jury's kind of out on whether those are effective and how effective they're going to be. But the fact that we have some initiatives around the UK does give us an opportunity to study that and to learn from experience perhaps and then, if it is shown to be beneficial, to think about that here in Wales, yes. Of itself, it wouldn't address the problem, but, added to other initiatives, I guess it would. Can I just ask you briefly, then, about community sport infrastructure and, in particular, of new schools? So, Welsh Government, as you know, has ploughed a huge amount of money into the twenty-first century schools programme. What we heard when we spoke to stakeholders recently, particularly headteachers, was that, in some of the new schools that have been built, we haven't had changing rooms and toilet facilities, for instance, built into the new buildings. So, if we're going to try and utilise these buildings for general community activity to get kids and the wider public, actually, more active, do you think that's something that we ought to be building in? Again, not your particular direct area of responsibility, but something that you might have an input into, is that, when we're developing schools, we should be making sure that they have those kinds of facilities so that they become accessible to the wider public. Is that something that you would be prepared to make a recommendation around? dr frank atherton: Well, it's certainly a fascinating area and one that I think has a lot of potential. You're right to raise it in the context of schools, and I can understand why this committee would, but I think it goes beyond that, actually, into all developments in the public sector and how they're developed and whether we're building health into our environment, which perhaps is your starting point. One of the things that I was really pleased to see in terms of the Public Health (Wales) Act 2017 that was passed a couple of years ago was the use of health impact assessment as a tool, and we're still working on how that will inform policy and how that will be applied in issues such as policy decisions through Government, but also in more downstream issues about how we create the public infrastructure that the public can and should be using. And so I would like to see the use of health impact assessments to a much greater degree to inform those kinds of decisions. If you apply that kind of lens and you take the point, which is inherent in your question, I think, that schools are not just for kids, they're for communities, then you would\u2014it would lead you to a conclusion that you would perhaps design and build them in a different way. So, on a personal basis, I would certainly support your view that we should be looking to use the sports environment in schools in the same way as we use leisure centres. There are all kinds of barriers in there, and I understand all of that, and it's not really my field, exactly as you say, but, as a matter of principle, I think it's a good one to pursue. Yes, perhaps if we could just stay in this area of education just for a moment, I think we all agree that healthy habits acquired early on probably tend to last quite well, so I wonder if you can tell us a little bit about the healthy and sustainable preschool scheme and whether you think some timescales should be made public about what you expect the achievements from that scheme to be. But, in particular, I was struck with what you said about local leadership, and I just want you to bear that in mind in answering the next question, which is about the foundation phase. You're probably aware that this committee has heard from various school leaders that they're struggling in some cases to meet the ratio of staffing for the foundation phase, which potentially compromises the purpose of it in terms of physical activity.\u00a0I'm just wondering how the strategy development board is considering that at the moment. Is it something that's come on the radar for the board? Is it something you're thinking about? And, if so, who do you think should be responsible for pinning that down a little bit? Because this is education, not health, and\u2014. dr frank atherton: Well, look, I've got to confess to you, I'm not an educationist, and so the question on staffing numbers in schools is not one that I have been asked to give a deal of consideration to, and it hasn't really been discussed, I don't believe, in the context of development of the strategy. If there is a specific point around that that the committee would like to make in terms of a response into the consultation, which I presume you'll be making, then we'd be happy to consider that. We have standards and we perhaps need to think about how we tighten those standards and how we\u2014enforce isn't the right word, but how we implement and make sure that those standards are properly implemented, because you're absolutely right to say that habits are developed early in life. That's in the preschool; it's also in the home of course, and then later in the school. So, we do need to look at all of those as settings and are there more things we can do within those settings to drive healthier behaviours\u2014that's exactly why we need the consultation. nathan cook: But I would say, through that scheme as well, we've really got a really good bank of preschools that are actually doing some really great work in this area as well. So, I think the more we can understand the successes that some of those environments are having\u2014you know, how we can roll those out and work across other settings to create that wider impact as well is going to be really important. What I'm thinking about is expectations at that level will be expectations at a slightly older level, which will be contained within the foundation phase. And while you're quite right\u2014obviously, parents have a role in this, or families\u2014there will be, particularly with the introduction of the new curriculum, certain expectations on schools to provide not just healthy environments but to actively work towards well-being and healthy weight in children and things. And that's why I asked you about local leadership, because, if it fails for reasons that have nothing to do with the plan at foundation phase, it's going to fail further up the school years as well. I think it might be something that the board might want to consider here, because at some point there'll be an accountability question and we will want to know how 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' fits in with the new plans for the new curriculum, and whether it's merely persuasive and influential or whether it has the weight to place some obligations on school leaders about what they do in their schools. So, this connection, I think, is quite an important one, and, if the strategy development board could consider that, I think it would be very helpful, because this doesn't exist in a vacuum. dr frank atherton: Well, I'd certainly be delighted to\u00a0take that back and we can look at it in terms of how we move from the consultation into the final strategy. suzy davies am: Because we will want to know who to ask: 'you're the accountable person\u2014why has something worked, or not worked?' We will need to know that at some point. dr frank atherton: Just building on Nathan's point, some of the schools\u2014I know it's schools rather than the preschools, and I take your point, but some of the schools we've been working with have absolutely brilliant models of good practice and good local leadership. I remember the Minister actually at the launch, and one of the schools was represented there, and they presented\u2014the school came and some of the children came and presented\u2014to the whole audience about the activities that they were undertaking in their school around physical activity and on healthy eating, and it was such a model of good behaviour the question was, 'Well, why not everywhere?', so that probably speaks to your question. lynne neagle am: And have you had any discussions, then, with education officials around things like teacher training and CPD, because you'll be aware the Health and Social Care Committee has made a number of recommendations in this area? It's crucial that we skill up the staff to develop these things in an appropriate way, isn't it? dr frank atherton: Well, we certainly discuss with education colleagues in Welsh Government. There's more we need to do in terms of that, because you're absolutely right: there's something about building the whole of the workforce\u2014education is really important, but elsewhere as well; it's about how do we really make every contact count, you know, that construct. So, everybody who's working in the health and social care system should have a role in this; everybody who works in education, whether it's the old\u2014. Do we still have dinner ladies? Or teachers, you know, they have a role to play in supporting children to be as healthy as they possibly can. And, actually, I see them, Chair, as a really essential part of the public health workforce. Suzy, are you going to do your curriculum one? suzy davies am: Well, I've bound it in together, but that final point you make about teachers being part of the answer to this, they're already under a range of pressures: is it fair to make them accountable for whether this works or not? Or should that local leadership lie somewhere else? I don't expect you to pin down a person today. dr frank atherton: I wouldn't like to blame a teacher or performance manage them on the proportion of their children in their class who are overweight. That would clearly be nonsense, wouldn't it? But they are part of the solution, and so the accountability lies further up the chain, doesn't it? The question I think we would have, and public services boards might well ask, and the local education authorities may well ask, is: how effective is any particular school at driving forwards these healthy behaviours? suzy davies am: Okay, thank you. hefin david am: Is that all right, Chair? lynne neagle am: You've got the floor, Hefin. What would that look like? dr frank atherton: Just in terms of the physical activity, I have to say it's a really important dimension and we need to move further on. We know not enough of our children are physically active and they're not meeting the various guidelines, so it's really important. It does have an impact on healthy weight, but it has a huge impact in terms of socialisation, in terms of mental health issues, et cetera, you know. nathan cook: I'd just say that one thing we have got in train is, obviously, Sport Wales, Public Health Wales and Natural Resources Wales\u2014we have them working together as a collaborative at the moment to look at how their joint delivery on physical activity can be taken forward more efficiently. So, one of the things they are looking at is obviously the schools programmes they do through eco-schools, the Welsh network of healthy schools and the sports programme to really think about that physical activity and how we can have better join up in terms of the programmes that we're already delivering as well. hefin david am: With that in mind, I'm going to confess to you, chief medical officer, I did anything in school I could to avoid physical education lessons. Yet, two weeks ago, I played for the Assembly rugby team\u2014I wanted to get that in. How can we get children more engaged with physical education in ways that\u2014? I felt completely alienated in school. dr frank atherton: Well, you're right, and many people go through that same journey and come to physical activity later in life, and that's great if they do that. The sad reality is that many people don't, and we also know that there are issues around the dropping off, particularly for girls, of physical activity towards the teenage years. , at the heart of it, it's about making sports and physical activity enjoyable and attractive to people. Sometimes that's easier, I sense, for boys than for girls, but we need to tailor things to different audiences. hefin david am: Yes, that's the trick, isn't it? It's about finding out what children enjoy doing. It's not just about elite sports; it's about getting everybody engaged and active in sports, and that partnership with Public Health Wales that Nathan talked about is really important, because we need a population approach to driving physical activity. hefin david am: So, do you think, with that in mind, we need statutory guidance for schools on physical education? dr frank atherton: Again, I'd look to the consultation as to whether there was an appetite for any kind of guidance. And finally, with regard to free school meals to all pupils in primary and secondary schools, do you think that extending that to all pupils would be beneficial in providing a more varied diet for pupils? dr frank atherton: I don't have a personal view on that. I think it's the quality of the food that kids are getting, whether that comes from home or through school, and whether it's free or whether it's paid for. The question of children being hungry at school is a really important one and needs to be addressed at a national level. I think that's a\u2014 hefin david am: So, you think that's more about the provision of food for those who might not have access to it than providing a varied diet. dr frank atherton: I think it's important that children have access to food, absolutely, if that's your question, but we also need to look at the quality of the food and what's in that food offer. I've been around some amazing schools in my own constituency, where they've got proper canteen facilities for pupils and really, really good produce in the meals. And, to be honest, I've been very surprised and shocked at what I've seen of the quality of the food in the packed lunches. Nobody can really police, and I wouldn't want to see parents being policed over what goes in a packed lunch, so if there is data out there to suggest that there's a larger percentage of parents providing packed lunched that are really not good at all, then there is some merit to be said for what Hefin is\u2014. Would you be willing to carry out any research? dr frank atherton: So, your point about food that's brought in in the packed lunches is a really important one, and I've talked to some headteachers as well about this. We could go down a route of guidance and prohibition, but that gets you into the role of nanny in chief and I don't really see that as my role or Government's role, and I don't think it's effective either. Do you remember\u2014? You must have seen on tv\u2014I think it was in Scotland; I don't know if it's happened in Wales\u2014parents pushing the fish and chip packets through the school railings. What I have seen, though, is some really good innovative practice in schools where, for example, they reward children for bringing the healthy options. Schools can give guidance to parents about what would be a healthy lunch and what sort of things might be expected to be seen in the lunch box. So, I've seen some of those approaches that have transformed, actually, the offer of what comes in school boxes. So, my point to the question was: isn't there some merit, perhaps, about all children being equal and eating similar good-quality food in schools? dr frank atherton: Yes. The draft plan commits, doesn't it, to updating the healthy eating in schools regulations\u2014the 2013 regulations? I appreciate this is a consultation, but what is it that needs changing in those regulations at the moment, just to give us a bit of steer? nathan cook: It's mainly on sugar content, so, obviously, they don't adhere to current Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition guidelines around sugar levels. So, what we'd want to consider is, you know, what we need to be careful of is unintended consequences of changing that, as well, if you see a shift to more kids bringing in school packed lunches as well. So, I think we want to consider the best way of doing that and consider through the consultation how we can go about it. janet finch-saunders am: The 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' plan commits to a review of the clinical obesity pathway. What are the time frames for this review, and what do you think are the basic essentials of a clinical obesity pathway for children and young people? dr frank atherton: We do have a pathway for managing overweight, and that's been in place since about 2010, I believe, and we do need to bring that up to date in terms of current knowledge and experiences. We've challenged Public Health Wales; we've asked Public Health Wales to undertake a review of that pathway, and they are going through that process now. nathan cook: We were asking them to review the pathway before we launch the final strategy in October because, obviously, what we want is for that to inform what that final strategy looks like. dr frank atherton: The second point of your question about what are the essential elements, they are already there; we need to tweak them and we need to make sure that they're properly delivered. But it's a tiered approach, so, having access to information through schools and through communities and into families is part of the first step of that. And then, if children are overweight, it's a question about how they're identified. There are questions about the ability of the public to recognise large children, so there may be an issue there. But when children are running into issues around weight, what kind of interventions can be put in, either through primary care or through communities through health visitors, et cetera? And then of course we do have\u2014and we've started to shine a light on this, haven't we\u2014the very overweight children. I don't think we have enough in the way of targeted support to be able to support those. So, I think there's something about looking at our whole pathway, mapping out what the current evidence now shows us is needed, and then thinking about what is our provision in Wales and what do we need to do to bring that up to the level of the places that are the best. The draft plan recognises the importance of the first 1,000 days, but it doesn't appear to include any new proposals to help parents to enable lifestyle changes. Are you satisfied that the draft plan does enough to address the influence that family and parents have on children's healthy weight behaviours, particularly in the first 1,000 days? dr frank atherton: Well, the first 1,000 days are really critically in shaping lives, as I'm sure you'd agree. We are absolutely open to any other suggestions that the public or this committee have as to what more we can and should do. There are a number of things, the sorts of programmes you've mentioned, that I think could be more effective. We know that children who are breastfed are less likely to suffer from obesity in childhood and, indeed, to go on to be obese adults. If there are other interventions in other areas that we need to take, then we'd be delighted to hear what they are, but those are the ones that have jumped out so far. nathan cook: Can I just say\u2014? One of the proposals we're looking for is, obviously, we know that during pregnancy it's a really critical time when we can actually look to work with mothers. We know from looking at some of the behaviour change that it's actually a really critical point when new mothers really start thinking about their lives, wanting the best for their child and their families. So, what we are thinking about is how we could develop some kind of approaches to that going forward. But we know our Healthy Start scheme is also a good lever for us, just in terms of how we can look to improve that kind of dietary offer at the earliest stage as well. Finally, we know that for some families day-to-day challenges can make it difficult for them to make healthy choices, particularly for those on lower incomes and/or maybe using food banks. Could the Welsh Government take bolder action to better support low-income families to eat healthily? dr frank atherton: Well, you've touched on a really important point about inequalities because overweight and obesity is not evenly distributed across our population. It absolutely is more prevalent in more socioeconomically deprived communities, and that's something that should really concern us all. So, it gets you to questions of availability of fresh food and produce; it gets you to questions of formulation of products and whether value brands are less healthy than more premium brands. So, it cuts across all of those issues that we talked about in terms of settings and in terms of environment earlier. We do need to think in broad terms\u2014broader terms than just obesity, but we do need to think in broad terms\u2014about how we create a society where families have the wherewithal to lead healthy lives, and that gets you to really important questions about the minimum wage and income poverty. There's no doubt in my mind\u2014I'm a public health professional\u2014and there's no doubt in my mind that economic success and health success go hand in hand. In terms of what we can do through this particular consultation, there are some things in there about providing better access, but without tackling some of those deeper determinants of health, their impact will necessarily be limited. lynne neagle am: Just finally from me, then, you referred earlier to the importance of making every contact count, but some stakeholders have told the committee that they struggle to do that because of difficulties in availability of people to refer to. Is that a situation that you recognise and what, really, can we do to improve that situation? dr frank atherton: Well, it depends what you mean as to where to refer to. What we're seeing across the NHS is a gradual transformation in primary care so that primary care is no longer about going to see your GP, it's about going to see a practice where you have a range of health professionals. Would I like to see more dietetic support, for example, in that setting? Absolutely I would. I think we need to think in terms of that pathway that we were talking about earlier, about access to that kind of advice and support, which can head off people getting into problems and kids getting into problems with weight issues. So, that question of redesign of the pathway really speaks to, I think, your point about, 'Well, where do people go when they have problems with their weight?' That's true for adults and it's true for children as well. Well, can I thank you both very much for your attendance? It's been a really productive session. Thank you, Chair, and thank you to the committee, because getting some input into the consultation from children's perspectives, this would be one of the routes we would absolutely welcome.

Item 4, then, is a motion under Standing Order 17.42 to resolve to exclude the public from the remainder of the meeting<doc-sep>Item 3 this morning then is a scrutiny session on early childhood education and care, and I'm very pleased to welcome Julie Morgan AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services; Jo-anne Daniels, director of communities and tackling poverty at Welsh Government; and Nicola Edwards, deputy director of the childcare, play and early years division in Welsh Government. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions, and the first ones are from Hefin David. What are your primary objectives? Is it supporting the development of children or getting parents into work? julie morgan am: Well, I think you'll be aware from the range of programmes that we've got that we do feel it\u2019s important to support both children and parents. There's obviously lots of evidence to show how important the early years are for children, how important they are for their development, and so, that is one of our primary objectives. But we also know how important it is for parents to have stable jobs, reasonably paid, so that can also help with the development of the children. So, we really see it that our plans are for both parents and children, and we believe that a high-quality, early-childhood education and care system can provide that. And, of course, in terms of when we talk about jobs as well, I think it\u2019s really important to remember that the childcare system is a big employer as well and a very important employer. hefin david am: So, the evidence we've seen suggests that, historically, Governments in the UK and devolved have focused on primarily getting parents into work. So, are you suggesting then that your focus is to change that and move towards early child development? julie morgan am: No, what I'm saying is that we want to give parents the opportunity to work. We don't want childcare to be a barrier to parents working because we think that working is one the best routes out of poverty, but we do also want to make sure that children have the greatest experience that they can have in the early years. julie morgan am: The situation as it is is complex, and I think it needs simplifying. It is a challenge, but it\u2019s probably one of the most important challenges we've got in Government, because what we offer to families with young children is one of the most important things we do. hefin david am: And in your evidence to the committee, you said that the Welsh Government\u2019s approach 'will build on a wide variety of programmes that are continually developing in order to support parents, families and children during the early years.' And you've just said you want to simplify that. How do you simplify that, particularly with regard to the provision of funding and the way these things connect from the birth of a child into school? How will simplification look, and what will happen? julie morgan am: Well, we're not at the stage of being able to say what it will look like at the moment, but we're looking at ways of simplifying, because I think it\u2019s absolutely right, it is a very complex system, because it\u2019s grown up from all different routes. We have got pathway projects in, I think it\u2019s eight local authorities, who are looking at ways of joining up the whole system. So, we are looking at that, and I absolutely except that it is very complex and we want to find ways of making it simpler and easier to understand. So, we are working with local authorities and health boards to see how we can actually work together and simplify things. Can I just come back to the first thing you said: 'We can't say yet what we're going to do'? julie morgan am: No. hefin david am: So, when will we have a policy plan and something that we can interrogate in more detail? julie morgan am: Well, I think we are near getting to an announcement where we will be able to say what direction we're going in, and because we have had\u2014. Some of this work has been going on for a year or so, and we're getting the results of those pathfinder projects coming in. So, when we do have all those results, we will be able to say the direction that we want to go in, and I hope we'll be able to do that very soon. And finally from me\u2014 julie morgan am: I'm sorry I can't say too much about that because we haven't actually\u2014. And if that's as far as you're willing to go, then I'll stop asking. sian gwenllian am: I just want to understand a little about the pilot, the pathfinders in eight local authority areas. Is the focus there on the child or is it on parents returning to work? julie morgan am: The focus is on an early years system, but we've worked both locally and nationally. , actually, I think, perhaps, Nicola, would you like to or one of you like to describe one of the programmes? sian gwenllian am: And can you just explain the vision? Is it a child-centred early years provision that we're thinking of in these pathfinder\u2014? jo-anne daniels: So, in 'Prosperity for All', we set out that early years was one of the key priority areas, and within that we said that we wanted to create a more joined-up and more responsive system. So, when we talk about a system, we're talking about the services that are provided by health boards, so health visiting, midwifery, speech and language support, other kinds of therapeutic services, as well as all the important services that local authorities are providing, such as support for parenting, advice and guidance, employment support and childcare, obviously. So, Flintshire, Newport, Blaenau Gwent, Neath Port Talbot, Swansea, Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire\u2014and then I've missed one, I think, because I've only got to seven\u2014who have been working with us to look at how all of those services are currently delivered in their local area and whether and how they can reorganise those services to improve accessibility, to improve take-up, but essentially to improve the efficacy of those programmes in terms of supporting children, but often, obviously, in supporting children you have to support parents too and support the home. sian gwenllian am: So, would you say it's a child-centred approach? jo-anne daniels: Absolutely, because it's about making sure that we deliver the best start in life for children in Wales, but obviously parents are a critical element of that, so can't be excluded. lynne neagle am: And how long have they been going for? jo-anne daniels: So, those eight pathfinders started their work in\u2014I think it was\u2014February this year. And they're still in the very early stages in terms of actually unpicking and mapping the current provision of services across their areas and then moving on to the stage where they'll develop proposals for how they might change the delivery of early years. julie morgan am: Just to say also, the one in Flintshire is also testing the impact of consistent funding rates for education and childcare. So, that's another important area because there's an evaluation of that project under way at the moment. jo-anne daniels: Sorry, but Caerphilly was the one that I forgot to mention. hefin david am: In your report, the 'Alignment of the Childcare Offer for Wales to the Foundation Phase', one of the recommendations was that 'The Welsh Government, local authority education and childcare policy and delivery teams could merge'. So, looking behind the scenes, those disparate parts of policy, delivering the foundation phase and childcare offer should merge. Is that the case? Has that been put under way and should we be looking at this structure in more depth? julie morgan am: Well, probably not at the structure at this time because the report that you're referring to was looking at the first year of the delivery of the childcare offer and it did make a number of points, which we have taken on board. For example, we issued guidance last year regarding the delivery of the foundation phase, which supports widening the number of non-maintained settings that are able to deliver early education and we're also supporting co-location and partnership working between education and childcare providers through our capital investment programme. I think it's about \u00a381 million that we put into the capital investment where we are developing\u00a0childcare facilities co-located with the education facilities, because that was one of the things that came out from this report you're referring to. And, obviously, early years is one of the key priorities within 'Prosperity for All' and, obviously, education sits within one portfolio with the Minister for Education, and childcare is with me. But we're doing what we can to work together to try to bring those together, and that was one of the proposals in that report. hefin david am: And I remember when you were on the committee here with me, sitting next to me, we had those discussions about co-location. I know the problem with not having co-location is that you could end up seeing a child travelling between three or more locations during the course of a day. Are you suggesting now that the actions you're taking will resolve that issue universally, or will it lead to a piecemeal resolution? And, if so, to what extent, what percentage of children will see that resolved as an issue? julie morgan am: Certainly, the co-location is not going to solve it universally because although we've been able to develop a lot of new facilities, or build on old facilities, there will be a lot of areas that we won't have covered. So, I can't say that there's going to be a situation where everything is going to be co-located because I don't think that would be feasible, and,for some of the providers, they wouldn't be in a position to move to a school. But ideally it's a good situation, but, certainly, I think the discussions that there were on the committee, it's not ideal to take children for long distances between different providers, let alone the effect it has on the climate change issue. So, I can't say that they will ever be co-located, but as I said in response to your earlier question, we are encouraging the development of the foundation phase in non-maintained settings, which, obviously, is quite significant. What is the Welsh Government doing to address the big differences in the amount of early childhood education and care provision available in different parts of Wales? julie morgan am: Right. , obviously, it would be good to see a greater degree of consistency, but I think it's important to acknowledge that there are reasons for that variation. Now, early education, of course, is the responsibility of the Minister for Education, and we are aware that different local authorities have adopted different patterns of providing early education. For example, local authorities are funded to provide 10 hours minimum of the foundation phase for three and four-year-olds across Wales, but there's quite a variance in how much is actually provided, with some local authorities providing a lot more historically. So, it does mean that there is a different pattern across Wales, according to what local authorities do. But what I could say is, of course, the quality is very good, as the Estyn reports have shown; that the quality provided, the delivery of the foundation phase, is very good. But it does vary in terms of what is offered throughout Wales, and that is the decision of the local authorities, and it is a historical thing. I refer to this pilot in Flint, which is trying to test paying the same rate for foundation phase and childcare. We're going to have an independent evaluation on that soon, in November this year, so that will help us. Obviously, I think local authorities' role in all this is absolutely crucial because they are the local, nearest people to decide how things develop in their own areas. And then, of course, we've got Flying Start, which is geographically targeted, which uses the data from income benefit to decide which are the areas where that is being delivered. And that is delivered where the highest proportion of children aged nought to three are living in income-dependent households. With Flying Start being geographically targeted, with the education being determined by the local authorities about how much there is, we know that there is a variance throughout Wales. We'd like to see facilities developed in each local authority throughout Wales that would answer the needs of the families and the children in those areas. lynne neagle am: Before you move on, Janet, Si\u00e2n's got a supplementary. sian gwenllian am: Just in terms of the foundation phase, there have been cuts, of course, in expenditure in that phase. How concerned are you about that and the impact that that will have on the way in which the foundation phase is taught in our schools? The foundation phase is now part of the education improvement grant, which has seen a reduction of 10 per cent, and it has to compete against other expenditure streams within that greater pot of funding. So, are you concerned that money is being lost and that that will have an impact on standards in the foundation phase? julie morgan am: I haven't seen any evidence. Obviously, I must reiterate the foundation phase does come under the Minister for Education, but I haven't seen any evidence of any standards being lowered, and the reports from Estyn are very good. In fact, I think the foundation phase is one of our great joys, that we absolutely celebrate it, and so I'd be very concerned if I thought there was any drop in standards in the foundation phase, and I certainly haven't had any evidence of that. sian gwenllian am: Exactly, but if there are fewer teaching assistants in the system because of the cuts, it's going to impact on standards, at the end of the day. julie morgan am: I think we have to be very careful to see that lower standards are not implemented, because it was groundbreaking when we brought it in, and it has proved to be a great success, so we want to make sure that's guarded. janet finch-saunders am: Going back to my original question about the big differences in amounts of early childhood education and care provision in different parts of Wales, the Welsh and UK Governments have followed a demand-driven approach to the childcare market, with subsidies mainly given to working parents. Is that a mistake? Should it be more universally available? julie morgan am: Well, some of our provision is universally available in certain areas. For example, the Flying Start provision is universally available in geographically defined areas, and I think that's very important, because that does mean that there isn't stigma, and so,in those areas, everybody can take advantage of it, and yet it is reaching those who are most in need because it's reaching those areas. In terms of when you say demand led, could you elaborate on that? janet finch-saunders am: I know that\u2014we've just had a useful briefing from\u00a0David Dallimore, and, basically, there is this theory that there are too many resources\u2014the demand-driven approach is based more on certain factors: geographic spread in terms of it being more universal, and whether that's the right way. How do children then mix with peers from different backgrounds, in their own peer or age group? julie morgan am: It is demand\u2014 nicola edwards: [Inaudible.]\u2014because the offer is targeted at working parents\u2014 janet finch-saunders am: Yes, yes. nicola edwards: \u2014obviously, then the amount of availability is based on how many parents apply for it and take it up. julie morgan am: It is universally available to all parents who meet the eligibility criteria of working, and I think what you're saying is that it should be available to everybody. lynne neagle am: I think the point that Janet's making is that some areas have traditionally got more childcare anyway because they have traditionally had more demand in those areas, so there's not a level playing field to start from. julie morgan am: I think that, historically, that is definitely true, and when you look at the take-up of the childcare offer, it's certainly taken up in some areas with a very high take-up rate. I think Ynys M\u00f4n was nearly 90 per cent or something\u2014 sian gwenllian am: They need more money, because they haven't got enough funding. julie morgan am: In other areas, it's much, much lower\u2014in some of the cities, I know. So, there is a big range in take-up\u2014 janet finch-saunders am: So, do you intend to bring something forward to address that? julie morgan am: We are planning to extend it. Obviously, we have to wait for the evaluation\u00a0of that.\u00a0It would be great to be able to offer it to absolutely everybody, but obviously we have got the finance to look at in terms of how we do that. janet finch-saunders am: Does the Welsh Government intend to develop an integrated approach, then, against all settings? If so, given the current inconsistencies, how can quality be assured? julie morgan am: We are developing a more integrated approach towards the early years. As I've said, we're trying to have the foundation phase operating in more non-maintained settings, and we're already developing that. But Estyn and CIW will continue to inspect and regulate the early years sector to ensure standards, and, since January 2019, CIW and Estyn have moved to joint inspections for the non-maintained settings that are offering the foundation phase. So, that is a very positive move, I think, and is absolutely making sure that standards are maintained, because if we are having the foundation phase in non-maintained settings, that is a challenge where we want to be sure that the standards and the philosophy of the foundation phase are maintained. janet finch-saunders am: And finally from me, what specific steps have been put in place to take forward the commitments from the Welsh Government's 2017 childcare/play early years workforce plan to build a better understanding of the workforce's Welsh language skills to enable support for the sector to be targeted and to identify where capacity needs to be built for the future to meet the needs of the early years sector in a bilingual Wales? julie morgan am: We think this is very important, and we're pleased that 29 per cent of children taking up the childcare offer are in Welsh or bilingual settings, so we think that's very good. We have established a specific programme to develop Welsh language skills in the childcare and play workforce with the National Centre for Learning Welsh, to develop workplace Welsh language skills across the sector. So, we're actually working with that, and I think you've done something with those recently, haven't you? I don't know if you want to\u2014 nicola edwards: Yes. So, we have a stakeholder group where we've brought together a variety of people with an interest in the early years, childcare and play sectors, and we had a presentation just last month from the national language centre about the education programmes that they're rolling out, and how this is all coming together, which is quite interesting. We've been working quite carefully to make sure that the variety of work-based learning programmes that we provide and offer are also available in Welsh and bilingually. Recruiting and retaining staff with really good Welsh language skills adds an extra dimension to it, and\u00a0that it's a point that Mudiad Meithrin makes to us quite regularly, that they do struggle to find staff with the right skills. So, upskilling the existing workforce is a key part of it, but also doing more to attract people in with Welsh language skills in the first place in terms of the training courses that we're taking forward, and thinking about that in the context of the targets within Cymraeg 2050 and the aim to get to one million Welsh speakers. So, as the Deputy Minister said, we've got quite a number of children accessing the offer in Welsh-medium or bilingual settings at the moment. We're going to be doing some baselining work against that in terms of local authorities' Welsh in education strategic plans and education places, and what we can then do to increase the number of childcare places in parallel with that so that you can make sure that you start that pathway through learning Welsh, interacting with education and childcare through Welsh at a much earlier stage. suzy davies am: Just on this early point, anybody who's been through the Welsh education system, which is 20 years now, will have some Welsh language skills, obviously to differing degrees. For the entrants that are coming into childcare training now, there are going to be very few of them, realistically, with no Welsh at all, so what's actually being incorporated into the early years care training to make sure, at that stage, that the Welsh language skills are being developed, as opposed to an add-on later on? nicola edwards: You're quite right. Most people coming through the education system will have some awareness of Welsh although I think it's probably important to remember we do also employ people from outside of wales. It's not necessarily appropriate for then teaching that language to children, who may be coming from families who don't use Welsh at home. So, there's a lot of that in terms of child development and how you develop children bilingually, particularly if they're coming from English-medium homes, and reinforcing the language in language choices. There will also be some people who are, perhaps\u2014we see this quite a lot in the office\u2014quite confident in terms of speaking Welsh but less so in terms of some of the paperwork, the reporting, the writing and the interacting with parents more officially, which we need to think about as well. But it is mainly about getting people to a point where they can transmit that language onwards in a confident and meaningful way. lynne neagle am: Just before we move on, you said that 29 per cent of the take-up of the childcare offer is either through Welsh or is bilingual. Have you got any figures about how many children are accessing it in Welsh only? nicola edwards: We will have. With the way we do it, it's because of the way that the setting defines their language category, and that's how we collect it. We do go down to individual child level, although it's anonymised, data collection on a termly basis. lynne neagle am: Maybe if the committee could have a note, that would be really useful. lynne neagle am: We've got some questions now on childcare from Dawn Bowden. Deputy Minister, the evaluation of the childcare offer, when it was published last year, said that there was very little evidence currently available to determine what its impact was. You're going to be producing a second evaluation in November this year; do you expect to see some indications now of the impact? julie morgan am: Well, the evaluation of the first year of the childcare offer was very limited, because the childcare offer wasn't available throughout the whole of Wales. And the evaluation for year 2, I think, will also show a limited impact for the same reasons. And the parental survey was released to parents in June 2019, therefore any impact on parents in the authorities coming on board in the second year will also be negligible. So, it's from the next one, however, we hope that we will get more information. dawn bowden am: So you think, by the time we get to November 2020, you might have a better picture. What the first year's evaluation did show, however, was that 94 per cent of respondents said that they were already using formal childcare before the offer came into place. A couple of things, really: are you surprised at that, and is that likely to inform the way that you develop the offer in the future? julie morgan am: No, I'm not surprised at all. In terms of how the families found out that it was available, they found it out through the childcare providers, where they already had their children there. But, of course, we were not able to fully advertise the childcare offer until it was available in all the local authorities, which was last April. So we are planning, this autumn, quite a big push now to try to make it available to everybody\u2014so everybody knows about it. So, no, this is the pattern we would have expected, and I think anybody who's involved in starting up something in childcare will know you have to wait a number of years before you actually see it being fully taken up. dawn bowden am: I guess the question that it raises in my mind is: does this mean that, actually, it hasn't been an incentive to get somebody back into work, because they were already in work and already had childcare provision? What you've done is you've directed money to people who were already spending that money anyway. So it hasn't been a move towards getting people into work because they couldn't afford childcare. julie morgan am: Well I think that that is something that we are moving towards, because the take-up of the offer is actually increasing each month, which is why I call it a great success. At the end of July, we hit almost 16,000 children accessing the offer, which obviously means that there are 16,000 families benefiting from this, and the feedback that we have had from parents is that they have been able to\u2014. They've got more money available, which is obvious, which is great, because obviously more money is available to plunge into the economy and carry out that sort of thing, and we've got examples of parents who've been supported into work through programmes like Parents, Childcare and Employment to begin with, and then have gone on to access the offer. So, I think we are seeing signs that people are moving on, have got more ability to be flexible in the work that they're doing, but I hope that when we look at it again, we will be able to see people actually moving into work because of having the access to childcare. Before\u2014 lynne neagle am: Are you going to move on? Si\u00e2n's got a supplementary. If you foresee that there's going to be more people going to be taking up that offer through the fact that you're marketing it more, what if the same situation arises that has happened on Anglesey? The take-up has been very good there, but the money that the Welsh Government has been allocating to Anglesey doesn't match that. What if it happens in every local authority right across Wales? Are you confident there's going to be plenty of money available to respond to that demand? julie morgan am: Based on the current levels of take-up and looking at the rates of increase each month, we expect to spend in the region of \u00a350 million to \u00a355 million in this financial year. Our published plans already include the provision of \u00a340 million, and we're absolutely committed to making available the total funding that is needed to deliver on the offer. It is fantastic to see the offer being so well received on Ynys M\u00f4n, recognising, as Janet said earlier, it is demand led. It's this year now that the big increase has happened; the previous two years\u2014 sian gwenllian am: So, local authorities won't have to find the extra money out of their own pots. You've already alluded to this in answer to Janet earlier on, about extending the childcare offer to those in training and education. So, I'm not quite sure what 'on the cusp' of returning to work is, but from the committee's point of view, we're very pleased that you've reached that conclusion, because it was one of the recommendations that we had following the scrutiny of the Bill. So, can you say a little more about that, bearing in mind that I'm also conscious that you've told Hefin you're going to be making an announcement shortly? So you may not be able to say too much. But a little bit more about the inclusion of parents in training and education, what 'on the cusp of returning to work' is\u2014what that means from your perspective\u2014and how you've arrived at that decision now, six months into the programme. What is it that's made you move towards that conclusion? julie morgan am: Well, obviously, the children and young persons committee made a very good case for education and training, in particular; I think that was one of the things that was at the top of the list. What we've committed to do is to review the programme, particularly looking at how we could bring in education and training, and that review will report early next year. But the other thing that's also happened is that, obviously, with the new First Minister, that was one of his manifesto commitments\u2014that he would bring education and training in. So, we're obviously following the\u2014 dawn bowden am: Because that was one of the key drivers for that as well. julie morgan am: Yes, so that is another of the key drivers, as you said\u2014the committee and what the First Minister said. There are a wealth of programmes supporting parents into education, training or work, and many of those do provide support with childcare costs. But we have, by rolling out this programme, the childcare programme, highlighted some gaps where people have felt that they, particularly people who are in full-time education\u2014and I can think of a number of people who are actually doing PhD studies\u2014who are\u2014the letters may have come in from some of your constituents\u2014not able to access the offer as things stand. We're using the definition by the Office for National Statistics, aren't we, in terms of education and training. And on 'on the cusp of work', maybe that will have to be something we have to look at differently\u2014those people who are actually maybe undertaking very short training programmes, preparation for work, maybe actually having interviews, where they need help with childcare, that they're sort of almost there. So, they may have to be dealt with in a different way, but I think we do want to look at those. This is expanding the offer; it's not making it universal, but it's moving on. dawn bowden am: So, what are the\u2014? Overall, then, what are the factors that you're having to take into account? Is it going to be what is needed in order to encourage people back into work? Is it going to be cost? Is it going to be a combination of all of those things? What are going to be the key factors that you're going to be looking at? julie morgan am: Well, the position now is that anybody who fulfills the criteria in terms of the number of hours they work, we would look at that in terms of education and training, and then, this expression 'on the cusp of work' we may have to look at differently, because they may not fulfil those numbers in terms of number of hours training. So, we'll get a criteria, and then they will have access to the childcare offer. But I just have to emphasise that there are ways of getting help with childcare already, and we wanted to make sure we don't duplicate. That's why this field is so complex, shall we say, because there's so many different ways that you can actually get help, and we want to be sure that we don't duplicate\u2014 dawn bowden am: Sorry, Julie. So, all of this is going to be incorporated in this announcement that you're going to be making shortly\u2014 julie morgan am: No, this review will report early next year. My final question\u2014 lynne neagle am: Before you move on, sorry, I've got a couple of supplementaries. suzy davies am: Just on the cost element, because if you do roll out this programme, obviously, on the back of evidence through a review, it is going to cost extra money. There are fairly generous Barnett consequentials coming from the comprehensive spending review and announcements on schools from the UK Government, and while I accept that you've only got annual commitments there, they're still substantial. How much money have you managed to secure for early years from the most recent announcement, and when have you planned to actually use that, maybe for some of this work? julie morgan am: Have you got some information on that? nicola edwards: The budget process is ongoing internally, so I think 'secured' is probably a slightly premature phrase. suzy davies am: Am I allowed to ask instead how much you've asked for, then? All I'm after is some reassurance that you will be getting some of this money, and as it is one of the eight priorities, certainly we would expect to see you getting a substantial amount of money for early years. julie morgan am: As one of the Government's priorities, we would expect to get any money that came as a result of any Barnett consequentials. julie morgan am: It's all in the process\u2014 lynne neagle am: And the committee will want to look very carefully at that, obviously. sian gwenllian am: How much would it cost to move to a child-centred approach, which means that every child would be able to access the childcare offer, rather than doing it from parents? julie morgan am: We are looking at that. We're having a longer-term review, in terms of what it would mean if every child had access to the childcare offer. That should report early next year, and then we've got another longer-term review, looking at what a universal offer would mean. sian gwenllian am: Do we know how many children we're talking about? nicola edwards: Yes. So, there are approximately, at any given time, around 73,000 three and four-year-olds in Wales. There's some slight rounding in the numbers there, but approximately 73,000 at any given time. Based on the current eligibility criteria for the offer, it's about 34,000 children, we believe, are eligible. This does, of course, vary, depending on a whole range of different factors, and we certainly know from what we're seeing from the offer that, even where people are entitled to something, they don't necessarily take it up. And even if they do take it up, they don't necessarily take up their full entitlement, which is also something that we'd have to think about in terms of any modelling on costings. nicola edwards: It's because of the requirement that, in a two-parent household, both parents must be in work. lynne neagle am: One of the points that the committee made very strongly in our report on the Bill was that we wanted to see a much more child-centred focus, and one of the issues that came out in scrutiny was whether, actually, three and four-year-olds were the right age to be actually targeting if we're looking at things like child development. Have you given any consideration to the actual age group that's covered when we know that, for many children, it's the first 1,000 days that makes that fundamental difference? julie morgan am: We are aware that there is a case that says that two years old is a very important time. dawn bowden am: Yes, my final question, Chair, thank you, is about the parent, childcare and employment programme, which is jointly funded by the European social fund and Welsh Government. It has been quite successful, in terms of its numbers anyway, in getting economically inactive parents into work. What are the plans for this programme, if and when we leave the EU and we lose the ESF funding for that? julie morgan am: Well, the programme has recently been extended, with delivery continuing until June 2022, with additional ESF funding of \u00a35.6 million. That's recently happened, and obviously this programme provides intensive employment to parents who are not in education, employment or training or economically inactive and where the childcare is the main barrier, and it has been a very, very successful programme. So, the UK has guaranteed funding for all EU projects approved by December 2020, and this includes the PaCE programme. I heard some other guarantees on the radio recently from the UK Treasury about guaranteeing some of these funds. But the Welsh Government can only draw on the UK Government guarantee for claims that aren't paid by the European Commission, and so the current arrangements are staying in place. To do that it would have to be part of Government planning in terms of\u2014 julie morgan am: Well, we don't know what's happening with that\u2014 dawn bowden am: \u2014what would happen beyond that. julie morgan am: \u2014funding, but there have been some promises from the UK Government recently, but nothing definite. sian gwenllian am: As we know, of course, the work with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs has ended, and I know you weren't the Minister who initiated this process, but what exactly has gone wrong? What are these issues that have come to light that have made you suspend that? It's very frustrating for us, as a committee, who scrutinised that extensively and raised a lot of concerns about that. And a lot of time has been spent talking about this funding Bill, and money\u2014\u00a31 million, I understand\u2014has been wasted, if you like, unnecessarily. So, what exactly has gone wrong? Why aren't you discussing these things with HMRC? julie morgan am:  sian gwenllian am: Yes. sian gwenllian am: Yes, but for your transparency around your particular\u00a0view that it needs to be more flexible and expanded upon and, therefore, going down the HMRC route was\u2014 julie morgan am: It would have restricted us a lot. So, it was a principle decision rather than any sort of technical matters to do with the Welsh language standards. But I'm really understanding more now that, really, what it's about is that you want to have a more flexible, and expand on the offer and that this would curtail\u2014going through HMRC would put limits on that. julie morgan am: That is one of the reasons, but there were issues about the Welsh language, which we can go into in detail, if you'd like. They would be able to process things bilingually, and I think that was probably told to the committee when we looked at the HMRC. But, in terms of the Welsh language standards that the Minister has to use, there would be some difficulties in them doing it. sian gwenllian am: But would you say that your main change came about because you wanted to be more flexible rather than any difficulties\u2014 julie morgan am: One of the major reasons, I think\u2014 sian gwenllian am: Okay. Those technical reasons probably do end up being quite important\u2014 sian gwenllian am: But the committee was told by the previous Minister that HMRC wouldn't have any problem at all with delivering according to the Welsh language standards. julie morgan am: Do you want to add something to this? nicola edwards: So, in terms of some of the technical issues we had, if you want to start with the bilingual provision and the Welsh language standards, HMRC do provide a bilingual service at the moment for their customers in line with their Welsh language scheme, and I think we can all appreciate that schemes are quite different from the requirements of the standards. And there were some issues when we got into the detail of the standards that the Welsh Ministers are required to deliver to that caused some concerns in terms of how HMRC were going to do it, particularly in terms of the multiple IT systems that go into building up the childcare services. So, for example, there are a number of what are called 'special characters' in the Welsh alphabet, such as the to bach, for example. sian gwenllian am: Yes, well, with due respect, the to bach has always been there\u2014 nicola edwards: Oh, yes, I completely agree. Unfortunately, however\u2014 sian gwenllian am: \u2014and HMRC would have been able to tell you, really early on, you would have thought, that it was\u2014. I don't really want to go into it, because I think we've got to the crux of why HMRC was dropped. I think it's been dropped because Julie feels that the offer needs to be more flexible, and I can understand why you would say that. julie morgan am: If we bring in training and education, for example, we wouldn't be able to do that via the HMRC, it would have to be done by the local authorities. Any people of immigration status of no resource from public funds, that would have to be done via the local authorities. , there are other things with using HMRC\u2014if any changes were made with the English offer, for example, because this would be delivered via HMRC with the English offer, that would cause difficulties for the Welsh offer. jo-anne daniels: The only thing I'd add is that\u2014and, again, I think the Minister has referred to this\u2014the costs that HMRC presented us with at the end of the discovery phase were significantly higher than the costs that had initially been outlined and that we outlined to the committee in the regulatory impact assessment. So, our conclusion is that we can deliver a cheaper system and a system that has the flexibility that the Deputy Minister has referred to by working with local authorities rather than HMRC. So, there is an important issue around value for money as well and making sure that the investment that we're making into developing the national system is one that\u2014that, in a sense, that investment stays in Wales. So, obviously, the money that we're paying over to HMRC to run the system would be supporting HMRC and their employees wherever they may be based, many of them not based in Wales; investment in local authorities to administer the system means that we're retaining more of that investment here. sian gwenllian am: Well, I congratulate you on persuading local government and WLGA to change their minds, because they actually told this committee that they favoured the HMRC option\u2014and this is only going back a few months\u2014because it will remove\u2014and this is quoting them\u2014 'it will remove the administrative burden of receiving applications and checking eligibility from local authorities'\u2014 blah, blah, blah, blah.\u00a0So, they've obviously changed their minds as well, which is, you know\u2014. I congratulate you on that, but it does present us as a committee with a little bit of a problem, really, because, if we're told one thing a few months ago and then we're told something completely different today, you know, evidence\u2014we have to go on evidence that we've heard, and the evidence has changed now. julie morgan am: I think, during the period since it was discussed on the committee, the work with the HMRC has helped highlight to us where we needed to go. So, I think we did learn a lot and it certainly has helped show to us where we think is the best place to go. I would like to pay tribute to the local authorities, because they've been great partners in this and they're very positive about moving forward keeping the work. And there's also a feeling that, because they are so much closer to the local public than HMRC is, they're able to build up links with families and help with some of these difficult issues. Because I'm sure many of you may have had individual cases\u2014I certainly have\u2014where there's been quite a lot of complexity about helping people fill in the forms and look at their eligibility. And thanks to the HMRC, because we've had nothing but a very positive relationship with them. How much is it actually going to cost to change this system from being a temporary arrangement with local authorities to a permanent one? And how much more is it going to cost for the more flexible system that you have in mind? They're not going to do this for nothing. How much extra are you giving them, and will they use it for this? How are you ensuring it's used for this? jo-anne daniels: So, at the moment, local\u2014. jo-anne daniels: So, part of the reason for using 10 is to try to ensure that we build economies of scale and that we have a more efficient operation.\u00a0Those authorities that undertake that function are given a specific grant in order to do that. suzy davies am: Could you give us an idea of the price tag? jo-anne daniels: At the moment, it's about \u00a32.5 million. jo-anne daniels: So that, as I said, is a ring-fenced sum that they use to administer the offer. We are now starting the detailed work to define the new system requirements so that we will have a single application process across Wales, moving forward. As part of that work, we'll need to consider the detailed costings, but our initial estimate suggests that it would be less than the cost proposed by HMRC. suzy davies am: Okay, when those costings are worked up, perhaps we could have a note comparing the two figures. sian gwenllian am: If it became a universal offer, would those costs reduce? Would there be so much bureaucracy involved in checking eligibility and stuff if every child was open to the offer? jo-anne daniels: So, clearly, if every child is eligible, then a large part of the process falls away in terms of the need to verify income and so on. For example, with the foundation phase, which is universally available, there is an application process and there is an administrative function that sits alongside that. At this point in time, I couldn't give you any indication of\u2014 sian gwenllian am: But it would be substantially less, wouldn't it, because they wouldn't have to do all these eligibility checks and all those things? nicola edwards: They wouldn't have to do the eligibility checks, but they would still have to make payments to the childcare providers and make sure they were paying for the right number of hours in respect of each child. So, parents would still need to tell them where their child was going, and there would still need to be some work alongside that. Si\u00e2n, do you want to ask about the Welsh language? sian gwenllian am: I think we've\u2014. lynne neagle am: Really\u2014? sian gwenllian am: I don't think that that was the real reason why the change happened. lynne neagle am: Nevertheless, the committee was given very concrete assurances that the Welsh language side of this was going to be covered off. Have you got anything that you want to add on that? Obviously, for us as a committee, we believe what we're told when we are given assurances. So, that's quite concerning for us, really, that that suddenly then became an issue, when both HMRC and the Minister at the time told us that this wasn't going to be a problem. There's a difference between a bilingual service in the context of what HMRC understood that to be, in the context of their scheme, and the very detail of the standards when they got into their IT systems. lynne neagle am: Shouldn't that have been something that was worked out at the beginning? nicola edwards: Possibly, but they did need to do quite detailed work, not just into their own IT systems, but the feed-in systems from the Home Office, the Department for Work and Pensions and the Post Office as well, to understand the full complexity of how the standards would comply across all of that. It was just some of the specific details of the requirements placed on the Welsh Ministers, because it is the Welsh Ministers' standards that they would need to deliver against that they were struggling with. lynne neagle am: I think that the committee would feel that that should have been bottomed out at the beginning, really. lynne neagle am: Okay, just before we move on to Flying Start, can I just ask: the Minister mentioned a longer term review of the childcare offer. Are you able to give us any indication of when that will report, please? julie morgan am: Would we have any idea? nicola edwards: We haven't set out a definitive timescale on that as of yet because we've been focusing very much on getting the review in terms of training, education and on the cusp of returning to work up and running. Can I just begin by asking you how you respond to the assertion that children from the most disadvantaged backgrounds do better in a mixed socioeconomic environment than in a targeted environment? julie morgan am: I think that's what Flying Start does, isn't it? Yes, I would have thought that was likely. suzy davies am: Well, the reason I'm asking you that, of course, is because this committee has suggested, perhaps, changes to the outreach system to target more disadvantaged children, and not necessarily capture people who happen to be in a geographic area. julie morgan am: So, you're saying that you feel that a universal offer in certain areas is not advantageous to\u2014 suzy davies am: Well, I'm asking you, really. If it's the case that we're only going after disadvantaged children, which would take very precise targeting\u2014 julie morgan am: I'm not only going after disadvantaged children. The reason we've targeted Flying Start is because it would be great if we had enough money to have Flying Start throughout the whole of Wales, but we just don't have that sort of money. Because just in response to this committee's 2018 report, you did say that: 'defined geographical targeting of Flying Start support will be considered as part of the Welsh Government\u2019s work on the Early Years system.' That suggests you still have geographic targeting in mind. So, if you're looking at a very mixed source of economic experience for children, what are the geographic boundaries you're considering? julie morgan am: At the moment, Flying Start can go beyond the geographical boundaries, with the extension\u2014 suzy davies am: With limits, yes. I think they can use 10 per cent of their income to go beyond the geographical boundaries, and many of them have done that. But, obviously, there are four elements to Flying Start, and only those geographical areas have got the four elements, but there could be the opportunity of extending some of that beyond the Flying Start geographical areas. suzy davies am: I accept what you say about the current system\u2014 julie morgan am: I believe it's much more\u2014. But, obviously, there are huge cost implications for that\u2014unless you're giving us some insight into what you're going to say next week, I don't know. But actually, defining anything geographically, which now seems to be fairly arbitrary, because it's not targeted purely at disadvantaged children\u2014on what basis are we choosing the geographic areas we are choosing at the moment? julie morgan am: Well, they're chosen then because of the benefit take-up in those particular areas. So, it's reaching some of the poorest children, but not all of the poorest children, but it's reaching the poorest children in a way that is not stigmatising, and where the services are open to everybody, and I think that's very important. Well, having established that, we have fairly recent research here that a third of children living in poverty in Wales are already falling behind at the age of five\u2014that suggests that two thirds of them aren't, but it's still a very worrying statistic. Not all children live in Flying Start areas; how are you going to reach that third who, even at such an early age, are already falling behind? How many of them are in Flying Start areas? julie morgan am: I think the actual number of children in poverty, the most disadvantaged that we reach through the Flying Start areas\u2014I think it's about 46 per cent. Is that\u2014? Do you know the actual percentage? suzy davies am: It's about a quarter of total children are in there, but\u2014 jo-anne daniels: So, just to give you a few of the numbers, there are just over 36,000 children benefiting from Flying Start services. And because of the nature of the benefit take-up data, and because we don't assess eligibility within a Flying Start area, we can't be absolutely certain how many children within a Flying Start area are actually in poverty. So, it's an estimate, and it's a range, and the range is that around 45 per cent of children in Flying Start areas would be in poverty.FootnoteLink suzy davies am: Well, that's interesting. I would have expected it to be much higher than that, particularly if the geographic areas had been targeted on benefit claims, effectively. Are you disappointed that the proportion is\u2014basically, 55 per cent of those children aren't living in poverty. That's what you're saying, isn't it? jo-anne daniels: Well, I'd offer two observations. One: the nature of poverty in Wales is actually, generally, more dispersed than perhaps sometimes is appreciated. Yes, we have very concentrated areas of\u2014 suzy davies am: Well, actually, we do appreciate it, which is why we're asking this question. Sorry, I've lost my train of thought now, in terms of the second\u2014oh, sorry: whether you're in or out of poverty is, in one sense, very black/white. But in reality of course\u2014in terms of the income definition, it's very black/white. But, of course, there will be a large number of people who are just above, but also families who move in and out, so it's quite a transient population in some senses, in terms of people having incomes that aren't stable, people having jobs that go with that that aren't stable. So, at any one point in time, you're only sort of capturing a snapshot of what's happening. I mentioned a third of children living in poverty had fallen behind at five; by the age of 14, half that number is still falling behind, so something has happened between that third and that half to improve the life chances of those individual children or young people. Is that attributable to Flying Start? Can you say that candidly? Or is it a happy coincidence, where there could be some causation, but we can\u2019t prove it? jo-anne daniels: We certainly think that Flying Start is making a positive impact, both on the point at which children go to school, and then subsequently. And I think as the committee knows, we\u2019ve been working with the SAIL\u2014secure anonymised information linkage\u2014and the databank there to look at how we can do longitudinal studies to track children\u2019s progress, to look at the extent to which outcomes are effected by Flying Start interventions. suzy davies am: We probably don't have time for this level of detail today, but half of those children are still behind at the age of 14. So, I'd be curious to know if there's any immediate plans to help them catch up or make sure that their successors don't fall into the same position, the same trap. Have you got anything high level that you can mention at this stage? julie morgan am: Just in terms of what we\u2019re thinking of doing with Flying Start\u2014. The key thing about Flying Start is the collaborative way that it works with the health visitors and all the speech and language therapists and childcare, and we\u2019re looking at ways of trying to get some of those elements to reach a wider group. And as I said, we talked about earlier the eight earlier years transformation pathfinders that we talked about in the local authorities\u2014we talked about that earlier\u2014so, that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to look at Flying Start and how we can try to make it more accessible to more children. We do want to make it available to more children, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at. And you'll have to wait to see what we come up with\u2014 suzy davies am: No, no\u2014we'll ask you more about that in due course. Actually, that job would be an awful lot easier if you knew how many children within Flying Start areas were taking up all four elements. Why don't you know that? Why is that data not collected? julie morgan am: Do we know why? jo-anne daniels: So, the approach that we\u2019ve taken to evaluation in Flying Start\u2014. The committee will have seen the various evaluation reports that have been published, and I know that you\u2019re familiar with the work that, as I say, we\u2019ve been doing with SAIL. We\u2019re currently focusing on individual data collection, and through that we want to be able to report on levels of engagement, but also outcomes for children. We hope to be able to extend that, and we hope to be able to provide more evidence about the interventions and the impact that they then achieve. Because, to be honest, I would want to know if a child\u2019s chances have improved primarily because they\u2019re getting good-quality childcare or primarily because their parents are taking up parenting courses. There\u2019s got to be some indication somewhere in here about which of these four elements is making the greatest difference. It will always be quite difficult to definitively provide answers to that, because many parents will be taking these things up in combination. So, disentangling which has had the effect is, obviously, quite tricky\u2014in particular, all parents will be getting the enhanced health visiting. Not every parent will take up parenting support, not every child will need speech and language help, so\u2014 suzy davies am: And that's why we need to know who is. jo-anne daniels: Disentangling what's helped and what hasn't I think will always be quite a difficult thing to do. Just on the final point from me\u2014yes, 88 per cent of Flying Start's childcare offers were taken up, but we've had some local authorities where the take-up has dropped dramatically. I think Denbighshire was down a fair bit, wasn't it, and Ceredigion, I think, had had a poor take-up. Have you got any indication why? I'm thinking of Denbighshire particularly, where there is a tradition\u2014taking up third-party childcare is cultural there, whereas in Ceredigion,\u00a0for example, there are far fewer places available in the first place and less of a tradition of children taking up childcare. But what's happened in Denbighshire? julie morgan am: I think there are a number of different reasons why parents do decide not to use a facility, and, obviously, that always exists, but each local authority has a Flying Start account manager in place to support them in the delivery of the programme and the account management activities, and there are formal account meetings that look at this sort of thing once a year\u2014 suzy davies am: So, what have they told you? julie morgan am: \u2014and these meetings will take place in November 2019. That's when the specific delivery issues will be discussed in depth, so that's when we'll find out what has happened and why there may have been a drop. suzy davies am: Can I just ask about the timing of that? Because if you already know that there's a 6 per cent drop, why will it take the best part of a year to\u2014well, November's only next month, to be fair, now, but why will it take that length of time to establish why there's a drop? You'd have thought if you'd seen a trend like that\u2014 julie morgan am: Obviously, they meet at certain times and they will assess what's happened. suzy davies am: Okay, but we'll get a note on that, is it? It's just that they knew this six months ago. julie morgan am: In November, we'll have more information about this, so we can let you have information about that. And then finally from me, Chair, if I may, Flying Start beneficiaries\u2014it's got a specific explanation of what a Flying Start beneficiary is, but I think, particularly in view of the evidence we've heard on this committee about parental support in connection with the removal of the defence of reasonable chastisement, for example, this committee is very concerned about what's out there in terms of parental support. Eighteen per cent of Flying Start beneficiaries have parents attending the informal parenting courses; that's 18 per cent, that's not very high. Any idea about what you might be able to do to encourage take-up or is that very locally decided? lynne neagle am: If I can add to that, obviously, somebody only has to attend one course\u2014we've got no way of knowing whether parents are completing the whole of a course, really. julie morgan am: Obviously, the offer is there for parents to take up the parenting courses, and there are four elements to Flying Start, and maybe some of the parents don't feel that they want to or need to. I don't think we've got any more evidence on that for take-up\u2014 suzy davies am: Well, the reach of this is going to be important, because we need the reassurance on the back of the legislation that is going through at the moment. jo-anne daniels: Parenting courses are, of course, one aspect of parenting support, but not the only one, and they'll be appropriate for a lot of parents, but for some not. What all parents do get at an enhanced level in Flying Start is the support of the health visitor, so the health visitor is, in effect, providing a significant amount of support for parenting. Now, that can be practical things like weaning or potty training et cetera, but, actually, it's also about managing a child's behaviour, managing how a parent develops that bonding and that attachment with their child. So, the role of the health visitor in supporting a parent to be a parent is absolutely critical, and every parent in Flying Start areas will be getting that enhanced level of support. Of course, it's not just in Flying Start areas now, because with the Healthy Child Wales programme, the universal programme of health visiting visits, we have a much more consistent and standardised set of visits and engagements with parents that cover a lot of these areas. In addition, I'd also add that when parents use the childcare in Flying Start, or childcare generally outside of Flying Start areas, there is often a lot of working between the childcare setting and the parent over parenting\u2014again, managing a child's behaviour, managing any issues that the childcare worker thinks are emerging in terms of whether it's eating or, again, toileting. So, parenting courses are important, but it's really essential that we see those in the broader context of the different ways in which lots of professionals interact with parents, providing them with advice, guidance and support, and actually what works for parents in terms of how they take on board some of that advice and that help. Sometimes a formal course is quite off-putting for parents, but the sort of quiet word, the top tips, the advice that a friendly professional gives can be very, very impactful. It does raise, unfortunately, another question about whether a health visitor in those circumstances might find themselves in a difficult position if they're dealing with a parent who has smacked a child, but we'll leave that for Stage 3. Well, can I thank the Minister and the officials for attending this morning? As usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you again for your attendance. There's just one today: the letter from the WLGA regarding the Childcare Funding (Wales) Act 2019 in response to our letter asking about the change in approach. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you.<doc-sep>lynne neagle am: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the\u00a0Children, Young People and Education committee this morning. We've received apologies for absence from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian and there is no substitute this morning. Can I ask if Members have got any declarations of interest they'd like to make, please? No? Okay. Item 2 this morning, then, is a further session on our follow-up on our 'Mind over matter' report. I'm very pleased to welcome Carol Shillabeer, who is chief executive of Powys Teaching Health Board, and who manages the Together for Children and Young People programme. Thank you very much for attending, and thank you for the written update that you provided in advance to the committee. We've got a lot of ground that we want to cover this morning, so if it's okay we'll go straight into questions. If I can just start and ask you if you're satisfied with the progress that's been made since the programme was established in 2015. So, the key focus of the programme in the early stages was about improving access to specialist child and adolescent mental health services. Other models that are very similar have been talked about as well, and our big focus was on ensuring that we could make immediate progress around access to specialist CAMHS. It's some years ago now since this committee did the original report, and obviously Healthcare Inspectorate Wales and the Wales Audit Office had\u00a0done reports in the past, and I think there was a need for a programme that could focus on action. You'll see in the written update that we covered quite a large number of areas, and so therefore had to make a prioritisation. We have provided the committee with a red, amber or green rating of where we feel that we were, and that was just before submission of the evidence. Certainly over the last nine months or so, we've seen a real momentum around the whole-school approach work, which we're not actually leading now as a programme, although we facilitated the workshop held in September. But that's got a real momentum, and the absolute priority now is the early help and enhanced support part of the work moving forward, and I'm sure we will come on to that in more detail. But we know there is more community workforce in specialist CAMHS, we know we're seeing children in a shorter time frame, and we know we're accepting more referrals, so our indicators are telling us we are making progress. And you referred to the work on the whole-school approach, which is very welcome, and I recognise that the programme has been involved in driving that as well. But I'm sure you'll also recognise the emphasis that the committee has placed on this being a whole-system approach to children and young people's mental health, and we feel very strongly that if any of the areas get out of balance, then it will jeopardise the progress in other parts of the programme. Are there any particular areas where you feel you haven't made enough progress that you'd like to draw the committee's attention to? carol shillabeer: This is maybe about what the programme's done, but really around the broader sense as well. I'm going to be very straight and say we should have made more progress on psychological therapies. I'm assured that we've got capacity in place now and the drive in place to get the Matrics Cymru framework developed for children and young people. I've had discussions with the national psychological therapies committee, who have owned this, and we're working together more on this area. That's not to say for one minute that health boards and local areas haven't been working on psychological therapy service provision and changing the models, but that is an area we should have made, I think, earlier progress on. There's been a general reflection from myself and the Together for Children and Young People programme board over the phase of the programme. I think we started very strongly; I think we probably had a bit of a lull in the middle, if I'm truthful about that\u2014we had a change of personnel, and we really gathered a momentum over the last year or 18 months, and that has helped to push us from a focus on specialist CAMHS into that whole-school approach. But, if I could just agree with your comments about the whole system, it has to be the whole system and that's why the real focus now on early help and enhanced support is critical. If I can just say, in case I don't get a chance to say this later, I was delighted to see the focus on youth work yesterday, because what is clear is for that part, the early help and enhanced support, this isn't just about the NHS and it's not just about education, it's about every part of the system, really, which does make it more complex. But I just wanted to say that I think that youth work has perhaps not have the recognition that it's needed and yesterday was a positive step. In terms of local primary mental health support services, what is your understanding of the issues leading to some health boards not meeting the Mental Health (Wales) Measure 2010 targets for assessment and therapy for children and young people, and how much of this is due to an increase in demand? carol shillabeer: Yes, thanks very much. So, it's important to say, I think, at the outset, just by way of reminder, that the target, quite rightly, changed for children and young people. The target changed some years ago for adults, so it was only right that there was an equalisation around children. So, the services were working, a couple of years ago, with significant demand and then a change in the standard. I think you're absolutely right; your question alludes to the fact that some health boards are struggling to maintain the full performance around seeing children, particularly within the 28 days. And we've had some discussion about whether the impact of the mental health Measure has actually drawn perhaps some of the workforce, the staff, who would have been working at that earlier stage in local primary mental health, into a bit more of the secondary element, which is why the review being undertaken by the NHS delivery unit into primary care CAMHS is so critical, because, actually, if we don't have\u2014and I believe we don't have\u2014enough capacity in that part of the system, then referrals will move towards the more specialist end of this. So, I think we will have seen, by the evidence submission, that demand has increased, not just in Wales but in the UK, and it has increased significantly. We are doing reasonably well at meeting that demand\u2014so, we have more contacts, more staff, shorter access times, so that is a good news story. We've not got it completely sustained at this stage, and therefore the focus of the delivery unit's primary care CAMHS report is what more can we do in that part of the system to help to see children and young people or provide consultation and liaison to others and support people at that level of intervention. I know, from my own experience as a constituency AM, I have families who tell me that they can't get into the early interventions and eventually things just become so\u2014they end up in the more specialist ones and believe that that's\u2014. And I don't like to put it in resource terms, but it's false economy in terms of the impact on the child and the family, but, obviously, in terms of cost as well. Do you find that that's a common theme across Wales? carol shillabeer: Yes. So, we absolutely need to see children and families at the earliest intervention and that's why this is a whole system, not compartmentalised. I think there have been really good attempts in a couple of areas of that greater reach out and that earlier help\u2014hot clinics and those sorts of initiatives that help people not to get in a long queue for specialist CAMHS, but can be supported, often by telephone, at that earlier stage. My sense of where we go next, in terms of, you know, you talk about early help and enhanced support for all the 'missing middle', as you referred to it in your report, is to make sure we've got a fully joined-up, multi-agency team approach to that. But yesterday's announcement about youth work, the Government's commitment to primary care, CAMHS, et cetera\u2014that's all going to be very helpful to prevent those young people having to go into specialist CAMHS. And just a final note on that, if I may\u2014at the beginning of the programme, we had a report from Hafal called 'Making Sense' and there were 10 key asks, if you like, of the system and the service from young people who had experience of the service. They said, 'Please don't medicalise it'\u2014I'm paraphrasing now, of course\u2014'Please don't medicalise it; please focus on supporting teachers and others who can support us at an earlier stage and then, when we really need help, please ensure that it is there at that more specialist level.' That's been a bit of a guiding principle for the programme. What are the outcomes of the stakeholder workshop held last week on early help and enhanced support? And how are the actions going to be taken forward and implemented? And also, given that the Together for Children and Young People programme comes to an end in October of this year, who, in your view, is best placed to forward this work stream, and what will be the biggest challenges? It's a bit of a long question, so, break it up however you like. janet finch-saunders am: And what will be the biggest challenges that they will face? carol shillabeer: Yes, I think that's helpfully laid out in three stages. So, you're absolutely right, there was a highly successful workshop last week really focusing on early help and enhanced support. It brought all of the agencies together, which was\u2014and actually had a bit of a waiting list, apparently, for places. In relation to the next steps, there is a planning group reflection in early July, in terms of the outcomes of the workshop or the outputs of the workshop, and there are three commitments that have been made to this stage. One is that we develop those values-led approaches that will bring multiple agencies together to have that common purpose. The second one is to develop the ingredients for successful working in this area, and then, thirdly, to determine or propose priorities and sequencing of next steps. I'm pretty sure we'll come on shortly\u2014or hopefully\u2014to the potential of the regional partnership boards. There is some work that we are doing as a programme with the children's commissioner in terms of working more with the regional partnership boards in taking forward this work. But during the summer, then, we will be developing that framework approach, and we will be participating in the Association of Directors of Social Services conference in September, and then a follow-up workshop in October on this matter. On your question of 'Well, what happens after the programme?' we are currently working on legacy arrangements for the programme. That will move, most likely, to the CAMHS network, which is part of the NHS mental health network. The whole-school approach element is already settled in Government and we've got a connection in to that. The question that's outstanding is where the early help and enhanced support and the neurodevelopmental will go. I can be very clear of my own view that there needs to be a confident and clear legacy arrangement for this work. I don't see there would be any obstacles\u2014I hope\u2014in getting that commitment translated into a strong approach, as we move forward. So, I'm not in a position to say, 'And the legacy arrangements will be\u2014', but I am in a position to say that I'm having those discussions with Welsh Government officials. They know my view that we've got to put something in place that is strong and secure as we move forward, and I believe that they are supportive of that. lynne neagle am: Janet, I think those two questions have been touched on, the remaining questions. We are going to discuss in more detail the legacy arrangements, but if I could just ask on psychological therapies: you referred to the fact that you were a bit disappointed with progress in this area, and the area hasn't been directly led on by the Together for Children and Young People programme. Do you think that means now that there is more of a threat to progress in this area, because, you know, we've got different compartmentalising of actions, and this is absolutely key, isn't it, really? carol shillabeer: Yes. There is some refinement to be done, I think, in making sure the connections are there. So, I think, as we move to programme end, we'll want to be absolutely assured that there are no strands left hanging, so to speak. I am confident\u2014I mentioned the mental health network board that I chair\u2014that we have those strands nailed down, but recognising that the early help and enhanced support and the provision of psychological support is beyond the NHS. So, this will be an area that needs to be very much seen as a key part of that. So, in the evidence that I've provided, you'll see the First 1000 days, all the adverse childhood experiences work, the Cymru Well Wales partnership, et cetera, et cetera. So, there is a bit of what I would call tidying up of the landscape to be done, and this is the ideal opportunity to do that. We've got some questions now on specialist CAMHS\u2014if I can just ask about the impact of the specialist CAMHS framework, and how effective you feel that has been in promoting a consistent delivery of care for young people. Without wanting to go back too far in history, I remember coming into this area back in 2014 as I was asked to establish a CAMHS network. When we spin forward five years, I can confidently say that there is a strong and well-connected clinical community around specialist CAMHS. The programme has helped; the emphasis and the focus of the programme has helped to bring people together with that more common endeavour\u00a0to understand, actually, there is a good case for consistency in the main, with local variation. If I just give you an example\u2014you'll know that the community intensive service teams were put in place in 2015-ish. We do have inconsistency in that, but the consistent part is there is a service now right the way across Wales for more intensive support to children and young people and their families in their own homes, which helps to prevent admissions and then, where there are admissions, helps to support people to be at home. The key thrust of this is that there is a backbone, if you like, of a consistent approach with that local variation. So, things like frameworks for improvement\u2014there is a coming together of the clinicians and the professionals to agree what that framework for improvement is. So, if I just refer to the previous question that I had, and I talked about hot clinics and different ways of reaching out; that's been tried in one area, been evaluated\u2014let's see the spread of that. So, you'll know my view on internet counselling, for example; I feel that is quite a strong offer for children\u2014not necessarily in the specialist end.\u00a0If that works in one area, why aren't we rolling that out to other areas? So, I think the framework for improvement has provided a vehicle for those clinicians and professionals to come together. You've referred to there being some inconsistencies in terms of crisis care, but are you able to assure the committee that all young people are now getting at least a consistent service, especially in terms of interventions in the instances of young people self-harming. Wherever you live in Wales, is that help there for you now? carol shillabeer: Well, in your work to produce the 'Mind over matter' report, I clearly listened to the views from the police and the recommendations in relation to the police. We've taken that as a further piece of work under the specialist CAMHS umbrella, to truly understand what the experiences of the police are and what some of the root issues may be in relation to that. For example, is it that because the CIT, CAT, COT, CITE\u2014the community intensive service\u2014closes at 10 o'clock in a certain area, that actually it's after that that the network of support isn't as strong, and, if that is the case, what are we going to do about that? There's certainly potential in working more regionally or even working between adults' and children's in terms of the crisis resolution services that work beyond those hours. So, we are taking an extra look at this, because I could not be 100 per cent confident that, throughout the 24-hour period, we've got this fully settled. I continue to hear some stories from the police that they are picking up young people and feeling that they've not got that solid place to go, and we're following those through. hefin david am: I think, Chair, I should have declared an interest here, as my daughter has been diagnosed with autism and is currently going through the process of receiving neurodevelopmental speech and language support particularly. We're seeing an increase in neurodevelopmental referrals, and that will increase further in the future. Can you give us an explanation as to why this demand is growing and how we're going to meet capacity to deliver and for support for those children? carol shillabeer: Thank you. I'm not sure that anyone really knows why, if I'm honest, although there is a lot of academic research going on. What we do know is that we are starting to see the scale of those referrals coming through. So, in the information provided, I refer to the NHS digital prevalence report in England, which indicates that about 5.5 per cent of two to four-year-olds have a mental disorder. Now, that sounds a bit shocking when we say that, but that's in the international classification scaling, and, of that, certainly, 2.5 per cent is around autism. So, if I just take my own health board for a moment, we usually have about 75 referrals per year. If I can just give you a sense of what we've done so far and then what I think is next, I want to recognise the work of Dr Cath Norton and the steering group that's been established on neurodevelopmental issues under the programme. We now have a community-of-practice-type environment, and we're really getting into this. One is that most referrals that come through, the clinicians tell me, are seeking support to move through what they perceive to be a gateway for educational support. Now, that is obviously going to be linked to\u00a0the whole-school approach and how we can support that. So, if I just take my own example of 300 in the last year, we're looking to try and put some additional capacity in to support seeing those families, but also then to understand what the long-term trajectory is going to be. Because we've put these teams in, because we've got the new pathway, has that opened a gate and we've got a lot of backlog or is that the pattern? hefin david am: Can I just ask a question there? carol shillabeer: Yes. hefin david am: So, with regard to the 75 to 300 increase\u2014in the space of a year was that? carol shillabeer: In a year, yes. hefin david am: Did you anticipate that or was that something that just came totally unexpected? carol shillabeer: I think we anticipated a few more, and just to say that in my\u2014 hefin david am: But not on that scale. And in my own health board\u2014I'm just referring to my own, and I'm happy to share the information on this\u2014we already had a service in place. We had a NICE-compliant service already in place, but we knew we needed to expand that, which we have done, but we didn't anticipate 300. So, this is happening not just across Wales, actually, but across the UK\u2014so, this greater recognition, the desire for families coming forward to access that support and them seeing this as a route, which is really important. What I would also say, and this is part of the bigger picture that we need to consider going forward, is that only about 40 per cent to 50 per cent of those families that come forward have what I would call or the clinicians would call a diagnosis\u2014so, a threshold or whatever term you want to use that takes people through to that educational support. So, we've got a lot of people who are under that threshold, but that's a lot of people who still need help and support. I'm trying to very fairly and, I hope, appropriately represent the very strong views coming from the group\u2014the workstream under the programme. It's not going to be good enough for us just to focus our attention on those children and young people and their families who reach a threshold, because there are needs elsewhere as well, and some of that will overlap with the early help and enhanced support. Can I just mention a few more things, as I'm on roll on neurodevelopmental? hefin david am: It's up to the Chair. carol shillabeer: Is that all right? Sorry, I know it's a very long answer. There is a concern from the neurodevelopmental group to get across that whilst there has been a lot of focus on autism\u2014and we recognise the private Member's Bill\u2014there are other neurodevelopmental presentations and there's a real\u2014. Having the broadest view would be advised by them, and I think they're particularly keen to understand what a future vision and what we call, say, a 'perfect world' would look like. In terms of giving advice at the end of the programme and into legacy arrangements, about what the big, big things are, we are still needing to tackle. hefin david am: I personally took a very personal decision when it came to the Member's Bill on autism you were talking about\u2014and that was the advice I received. Because I didn't vote for that Bill, and I'm glad you said that because it gives me some personal reassurance there. But what I do have concerns about is if the increase wasn't anticipated to the extent that it was and that the Together for Children and Young People programme has a duty to review capacity, after October who's going to make sure that that capacity's reviewed on a strategic basis? carol shillabeer: So, I should have probably added in that we've got a piece of work under way at the moment\u2014Welsh Government commissioned it\u2014by a person called Patrick Holton, and he is specifically looking at the demands on capacity in relation to neurodevelopmental. I think getting that slightly more independent view of what we think the trends are going to be over the long term will mean we can plan for the long term. We know that money's been put into this and it has had an important impact, but we now need to be planning for the next three, five, 10 and many years beyond that. I think there are some conversations, when I talk about the landscape being quite busy, about the sense of where this links as we support people through their lives with a neurodevelopmental issue. So, it's not just about a childhood thing; as people move through, we've got to get much better at that long-term planning. We will get the report of that over the next couple of months in order for this sort of perfect-world picture that we want to try to describe to be informed by that. It also connects to the early help and enhanced support, because recognising if we just say half of the people who come for an assessment don't meet a threshold for a certain category, that's a lot of people who will need help and support to manage and cope with their condition and their situation. If we can just move on now to in-patient care, and if I can just ask you what the programme has been doing to address some of the challenges and opportunities we face in terms of CAMHS in-patient care, particularly in light of the restrictions that are in place in Abergele and T\u0177 Llidiard. Again, quite a lot of progress has been made in the early part of the programme around in-patients, and you are very well aware of the challenges over the last year or 18 months in relation to both units. I think, certainly, there is some recovery in the position in north Wales, and the programme did a peer review visit to north Wales, which I think was very helpful. In terms of where the programme has been on this issue, there is some work under way, at quite an advanced stage, around the art of the possible around enhancing the scope of the services. This was quite a tricky thing to start off when you're in a position where, actually, there've been some restrictions, to then ask the service to think about going even further, but we really wanted to see what the art of the possible would be if we could attract the right workforce, get the right environment, et cetera, et cetera\u2014so, that piece of work, the review of the specification about what could be possible. Clearly, we work very closely with Welsh Health Specialised Services Committee as the commissioner, so we don't commission that. But, if I can just say, probably the most important part of moving forward now is the longer term work between health and social care in terms of having a much more integrated and joined up approach for children. We haven't got that mature approach in terms of these being joined-up teams; we've got social care and we've got healthcare. I've previously had conversations with the chief inspector of Care Inspectorate Wales, for example, and we have now got, I think, a consensus growing that we need to do something very different for children and young people who are in this sort of need for the future. It has been largely successful, the work that has taken place over recent years, but not without its key challenges. And, just briefly on the new specification that WHSSC are developing, that will enable admissions at weekends and out of hours. How concerned should we be about that being a challenge, particularly in Abergele, where staffing has been a major issue? carol shillabeer: Yes. I think we need to be very mindful of ensuring that the right workforce are in place before that gets implemented. The peer review highlighted the challenge of the physical environment, where the unit is, the challenge across north Wales of the workforce. These are issues well known by the health board, by the way, so it wasn't a surprise to them.\u00a0But that dialogue about how do we ensure that we've got the right workforce, because that unit, potentially, could\u2014you know, it's an isolated unit, and they\u2019ve been risk-managing. They've been managing the types of young people that they can take bearing in mind the workforce that they've got available, and that's been entirely the right thing to do. With regard to the increased CAMHS posts that have been made available between 2016 and 2018\u2014a 62 per cent increase in CAMHS posts\u2014we know that there's likely to be labour market demand, high labour market demand, in those instances, so are the vacancy rates higher in Wales than elsewhere, given the increase in those posts to be filled? carol shillabeer: So, you're absolutely right. There's been quite a lot of investment, and there have been quite a lot of new recruits coming to the service. We had in the early days a situation where we were largely robbing Peter to pay Paul, to be quite frank. So, as new services were being developed, people would move from one part of the system to the other. That has improved slightly, but we're in a national context, particularly around nursing and around some specialties in medicine, of a national shortage, so this is not a quick fix. So, if I can mention psychology assistants, for example, my own health board is employing more psychology assistants as part of a skill mix team, rather than going to where we might have been more traditionally based. We're perhaps a little bit\u2014 hefin david am: More of what? carol shillabeer: They have more skill mix in their workforce. hefin david am: Just to clarify there, what you're referring to\u2014there are more nursing and medical staff in the Wales system and more psychological staff, experts, in the UK picture. So, England had a programme called IAPT, which is about psychological therapies, and had therefore looked at the skill mix. We've chatted to colleagues in England, trying to learn\u2014we're all trying to make improvements in this area, of course; it's a UK and international issue\u2014what were their experiences of this psychological therapies approach. Because of their vacancies they had to skill mix, and because of the money that they had available\u2014they didn't have as much of a cash injection as perhaps we've been able to secure. And if I can just make a plea, really, around recognising the input of the third sector\u2014so, it doesn't always have to be an NHS-employed person to work in service provision, direct front-line service provision, and the third sector are offering a significant contribution in a number of areas of our services. And that is one that we will need to cultivate, because, to be quite frank, our recruitment challenges won't be solved overnight. We've recognised that the commissioning numbers for nursing and other professionals have gone up over recent times, but, with the training time, it's not a quick fix. hefin david am: Does the workforce profile remain different, or are they starting to\u2014? carol shillabeer: They're starting to come together. Each year we do the NHS benchmarking, and we can see where we are compared to others, and I would expect over the next year or two that we see a bit more narrowing. hefin david am: So, if you compare a child in Wales with a child in England in the last two years who's been through this, would they have had a different experience as a result, and different clinical advice as a result, or is there consistency despite the difference in workforce profile? carol shillabeer: That's quite a big question. Hand on heart, could I tell you I absolutely know the detail of that? No, I couldn't.\u00a0The practice in this area is guided by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance, so it's pretty much guided. When you skill mix a team, you enable the right referrals to go to the right person, so you wouldn't necessarily have a child or young person with particularly complex needs\u2014well, you would match them to the right practitioner for their needs. And we've seen some of that; if I just make reference to the panel approach in Gwent that's been developed, a multi-agency panel come together, a referral comes in, it's then about matching the right service and the right person to the needs that are being presented. So, we can be much more flexible in relation to that, and we have to be careful to use the right resource for the right person, because, if we've got a resource that is highly specialist, we want them to be dealing with those children and young people. hefin david am: And one of the things you're able to do\u2014because there's a lot about the labour market you can't control, but one of the things you can control is workforce development and ongoing workforce development. What other things are being done in addition, and how do the communities of practice work might be a good question, but what else is being done in order to upskill and develop and grow the existing workforce that is presented to you? carol shillabeer: Thank you for that. I think there's a huge focus on staff retention now, not just in Wales but across the UK. What are the factors that affect retention? Actually, well-being, well-being at work\u2014and you'll know that within 'A Healthier Wales' the focus on staff engagement, staff well-being, has been laid out\u2014the ability to work well in teams and the culture of organisations and services, and, then, as you rightly say, training and development and career opportunities. I think the community of practice\u2014it's something that has become a bit of a standard now across these areas\u2014actually brings people together doing collective audit, doing collective reflection on service improvement, and being very clear about learning from one another. And, if you're a clinician, that gives you a lot of motivation to keep driving forward. So, I think we have the fundamental building blocks in place, but there is more to do around the environment in which our practitioners and our staff operate. hefin david am: What about the Welsh language in the health board? carol shillabeer: Thank you very much. In your report of last year you highlighted the need to do further work on the use of the Welsh language, and have we got enough Welsh language practitioners where we need them. I'm pleased to say that, over the last few years, I think all health boards have really stepped up in terms of being able to understand the levels of Welsh speaking amongst employed staff and where their Welsh-speaking communities are. We're particularly looking at it in terms of in-patient CAMHS and community intensive services, because, particularly when people are feeling at their most vulnerable, they would choose the language they wish to choose. So, we will be in a position to, by the end of this programme, provide that position statement on what happens next. I would also say, of course, we've got the Welsh language standards that we are all working on at the moment, and we've got a very clear programme of when we have to be compliant with those standards. Obviously, everything you've been speaking about already, particularly about workforce development, applies to children in care as well, where there's other work also going on in terms of support. Can you give us some indication about how the programme intersects, then, with the outcomes for the children in care work programme? carol shillabeer: Thanks very much for that. So, we have one of our members of the programme board also sitting on the outcomes for children ministerial group, which is good. We also have a director of social services on our programme board and, obviously, they're very clearly linked in to the outcomes for children. I just made reference to, under the question on specialist CAMHS in-patients, the need to bring those services together, and that, really, is the need for much stronger working between the outcomes for children group and the Together for Children and Young People programme and the constituent parts. We've got a way forward and there is a consensus that we need to do things together on that. suzy davies am: Can you just perhaps give us an example of how that then looks on the ground? Because it's great that people are talking together, but how would that affect, I don't know, individual members of the workforce, or, indeed, the children we're talking about? carol shillabeer: Yes. So, if I just give an example of a unit in south Wales that is a social care unit, we've been having discussions about, 'Well, actually, shouldn't you have a psychologist and good access to psychological therapies, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera?' So, we haven't yet got an agreed position on how we're going to do this, but the position is that something needs to be done, and there is an appetite for and an understanding of the case for change, I believe. But what it will mean, I think, in practice, is that you get much more fluid roles moving across sectors, or we could be designing services that are fully integrated. Now, there may be challenges in that, but, you know, let's get them out on the table. So, in terms of this seamless health and social care system for Wales, this is one of the tests of that, I would say: can we, within the next five years, 10 years, really bring that together? That will take quite a lot of work and commitment.  On the looked-after children specifically, we have picked that up, particularly following your previous report, looking specifically at the assessment of young people who are care experienced who are in the system. We are questioning whether that needs to be a greater part and what the level of support needs to be, particularly because of the backgrounds of children that have led them to be in those circumstances. That's a core piece of work under the early help and enhanced support work stream, and we'll be ensuring that that is complete by the end of the programme. And you're confident that that will reach children who are being fostered and perhaps don't have very frequent looked-after children reviews, because, from all other perspectives, things are going fairly well. And, of course, there's the edge-of-care work that the Government have been supporting, and, certainly in my own area, under the regional partnership board, we have a Start Well programme, which is the old Children and Young People's Partnership programme, where there's a significant investment in supporting children and young people, families, on the edge of care, which does pick up fostering. We've heard, not necessarily just in the context of this report, because we've heard similar evidence around transition arrangements in another committee report when we did the suicide prevention, and I've in fact only recently\u2014well, just this week, actually\u2014met with community mental health teams in my constituency, and there is still some concern about transitional arrangements from children into adult services. The transition guidance was published a couple of years ago now, and the programme was involved in developing that guidance. But what's your assessment of the impact that it's had? Because we clearly are still seeing people falling through the gaps, aren't we? carol shillabeer: Yes, thank you for that. You're absolutely right; we developed that guidance and we are currently in the process of the evaluation of that. And, in particular, I know that the children's commissioner is very focused on transition, not just around children in receipt of emotional mental health support, but children in paediatric wards, and there is a working group with Welsh Government looking at this.  The children's commissioner has used our guidance to put that on the table to say, 'Well, if this works, this needs to be considered as a model for using elsewhere'. If I were just to give an estimate of where I think this will land, I think it will have made improvements, but there may well be some further work to do in enhancing, supporting, auditing that every child is supported in line with that guidance. So, I talked about community practice and clinical audit: is this something that we make, then, a mandatory audit, each year, that we do that double check?\u00a0Because it's one of those things where we know when a child is 14, 15, 16, 17, so what's stopping us? If indeed the evaluation says it's not happening everywhere, it's not happening early enough, what is stopping us? We really need to get underneath that. So, my sense will be it will show us, it will be better, but there's some further work to do, and following that up in terms of audit and making sure that we've got a systematic approach to dealing with those who haven't had the guidance fully implemented, because it can make a real difference. dawn bowden am: Yes, and it seems to me\u2014you've just talked about having a systematic approach, and it does seem to me that it is a systematic process, isn't it? So, it shouldn't be difficult. I know we're talking about in the health service things shouldn't be difficult and they are, and one of the gripes\u2014I had a meeting with the community health team\u2014was the problems of the new IT systems and so on\u2014let's not go there at the moment. But, really, this is just about referring children and having a smooth transition from the service being provided to them as a child and then just shifting it over to the adult services. It's really difficult to get my head around why that is such a problem and why that needs to be so difficult. carol shillabeer: Can I add one other dimension in, which I think is going to be quite interesting? We talk about transitions being an issue\u2014and we know it's not just in mental health, but it's elsewhere\u2014then you start to think, 'What if we could reduce transitions?', so you reduce the number of transitions and you manage them better. We are doing a piece of work with Government on the potential to explore what a 0-25-type service would be. There are probably some pros and cons, but should we be moving to a 0-25. That is moving the transition at the age of 25, but at least it's not at the eighteenth birthday. What's the argument around what adolescent, young people and young adults services are, for example? That piece of research and understanding\u2014 dawn bowden am: You could probably have a gradual transition, then, couldn't you? carol shillabeer: Quite potentially. I've got some people who have joined my own health board who've worked in that 0-25-type service, and we're catching up\u2014'Tell me what was good about it? Tell me what was not so good about it? What did the young people themselves think about that?'. Because if we can manage down the numbers of transitions, there really should be no excuse not to get transitions right, then. We've got some really important questions now about legacy, because throughout the session this morning you've referred to ongoing work, really, and that is a major concern for the committee. suzy davies am: Yes, thank you, Chair, we are a little bit worried that this programme is coming to an end in a matter of months when perhaps its work's not been completed. Obviously, we've got the Welsh Government's strategy for mental health running until 2022, which is a few years longer. Can you tell me whether you think your programme needs to continue, perhaps even if it's just for the same length of time as Together for Mental Health, or is its work done and it needs to be picked up now by a different system? carol shillabeer: Thank you for that. Can I just say, I've given this so much thought over the time, because I think you might have asked me this question when I came previously? There are two ways to look at this. I'm absolutely sure that the issue of children's emotional and mental health will be one that will be with us for a very long time. We have made a lot of progress, I think, as a society, in talking about this now. I talk to my own children and say, 'What's going on in your lives at school?', and they talk about this. This is not an issue, if you like, that I believe you can pick up and solve literally in five years. So, on the one hand, I think my view last year was that, when you have a programme of work, you should have a start, a middle and end, really\u2014otherwise it's not a programme of work, it's almost forever\u2014and there is a moment to refresh and reflect on whether that mechanism has done all it should and it should move into a different mechanism. So, my position last year was, 'This will have been running for five years\u2014we've done a lot of work and made progress on specialist CAMHS, we have made progress on the whole-school approach and there is a different mechanism for this' et cetera. My position now is I want to just be really sure and secure that there is a strong arrangement going forward that takes this work, if this programme is going to close. So, I think, in an earlier question I indicated dialogue going on between myself and Welsh Government officials. I don't think there's a barrier\u2014people aren't saying, 'No, it all needs to just stop; we've solved the issue', but the exact nature of the legacy arrangements, particularly for early help and enhanced support, are not yet fully determined, or for neurodevelopmental. If it was a choice between nothing being there and continuing this programme, I would be supporting continuing the programme. suzy davies am: Well, I don't think any of us would disagree with that, but I suppose there might be a level of concern that the Welsh Government's preferred route from now on would be through the regional partnership boards and public services boards. You mentioned that you've done that work in Gwent, down in the south-east of your patch there. It's quite difficult for us to try and get a picture of how that will work successfully for the whole of Wales. I know you've got your experience in Gwent, but have you thought a bit more about how it might look elsewhere, if that's the route that Government decides to pursue? carol shillabeer: Yes. I think the key question in my own mind is: are the regional partnership boards yet ready and mature enough to take this forward? I'm the chair of the Powys regional partnership board, so I should declare that. There's a lot being asked of the regional partnership boards at the moment\u2014 suzy davies am: Well, we'll be asking them to go with the 'Mind over matter' report, to make sure that that's delivered upon. carol shillabeer: There's a lot, you know, 'A Healthier Wales'\u2014. Everyone does feel that the regional partnership boards are a route to really secure multi-agency working, so there is quite a high expectation. My understanding\u2014and this is a rather informal understanding\u2014is that different RPBs are in different places. So, some have retained what used to be the old children and young people partnerships, and perhaps where they have been retained, they may be in a more progressed position. So, my sense of this is that, I think, possibly the RPBs aren't yet in that position to be ready. Our piece of work on early help and enhanced support, in terms of your earlier question about what's the commitment\u2014that feels that that may well be another year or 18 months of development work, alongside the RPB development work, to get that ready, before we can then more confidently say where we can hand over. suzy davies am: You may not feel able to say it, then, but would be wrong in saying that, actually, it would be quite a good idea to extend the current programme, just to make sure that anyone else who might be able to run on with component parts of it is in the position to do that to our satisfaction? carol shillabeer: I'm happy to respond to it. My sense is that, whether it's the programme or whether it's something else, something needs to be there. The next stage is really multi-agency, so it may well be that the programme currently has been NHS-led\u2014maybe it needs to be led elsewhere, maybe not. It may be seen as a convenient mechanism\u2014it's already established, we've got a programme team et cetera, so it may be seen as a ready sort of solution. What I feel strongly about is that we've got to have the right mechanism to take it forward. suzy davies am: Can I just push you on one thing there? You mentioned, perhaps, the NHS could lead on the work, for example. Is there a risk of fragmentation if we start looking\u2014? I'm just thinking\u2014, we've got the elements here: we've got the NHS, there's the whole-school approach, early help and enhanced support and intervention, as you mentioned earlier. If that goes to one of the players in that multi-agency approach, is there a risk that they might become too dominant, inadvertently\u2014? carol shillabeer: If I can just clarify\u2014apologies if I wasn't clear. Anything else you want me to pursue on that\u2014? lynne neagle am: Can I just clarify for the record, Carol\u2014because we put this to the Minister last week\u2014are you looking at asking the regional partnership boards to take this work over from October 2019? Are you saying clearly to the committee that you do not feel that all regional partnership boards are ready for that challenge at this point? carol shillabeer: I'm saying that on a more, if you like it, uniformed and informal basis, we're doing some work with the children's commissioner now in terms of\u2014. I know the children's commissioner's very interested in how RPBs are managing, developing and dealing with the issues of children and young people's concerns. We're working with her to understand and to mirror alongside her the understanding of the RPBs. So, for example, in the integrated care fund guidance last year, there was a specific reference to child and adolescent emotional mental health, which I welcomed. I've also welcomed, literally last week, a letter to all RPB chairs giving an allocation of \u00a3200,000 per RPB to support this further work in terms of child and adolescent emotional and mental health and the early help and support element. My sense, and I need to stress it's a sense because we haven't done that piece of work, is different RPBs are in different places. So, how confident can we be at the October date that we could hand over? My sense is, just to safeguard, having a mechanism in place for the next 12 to 18 months to guide this through might be advisable, and that's what I'm talking to officials about. lynne neagle am: And that would either be an extension of the Together for Children and Young People programme or something else. Because I think there is a question, isn't there, about whether the RPBs will make this enough of a priority? I'm a bit nervous that it might get lost in that huge amount of work you said they might have. Just a final question from me: how are you establishing what the young people themselves think about the end of the programme? Are they bothered about the structure of this at all or are they just concerned that they're getting help? How's the stakeholder group feeding into this? carol shillabeer: I've not been blown over in the rush of people saying, 'Don't go anywhere.' [Laughter.] It's a really important matter for young people. I know that later on you're meeting with the Youth Parliament, you're having a joint session, which is fantastic. We've had contact with the Youth Parliament because we know it's one of their top three issues. So, it runs in the vein of that this is going to be a long-term matter for young people, I think. But I'm pretty sure they will be vocal in saying, 'We have to have these developments continue.'\u00a0It is a major issue, we're not there yet\u2014maybe some progress has been made but there's still a lot to do\u2014and I think we'll need to be able to respond to that. suzy davies am: Anything particularly you want in addition to that? lynne neagle am: No, I think that's fine. And if I can just say that it was really great last week at the early help and enhanced day to see young people so central to the day all the way through. We might need to drop you a line about a couple of things that we haven't covered, but can I thank you for your attendance this morning? As usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you very much for your time. Paper to note 2 is a letter from the Minister for Education clarifying some issues around the Welsh network of healthy schools scheme, following the task and finish group. Paper to note 3: letter from the Minister for Education on the implementation of the Diamond reforms, and that's ahead of our session on 4 July. Papers to note 4 and 5 are a letter from me to the children's commissioner and the Minister for Education seeking the update we agreed on the issue of elective home education. And then paper to note 6, paper to note 7 and paper to note 8 are all letters regarding the concerns that we discussed about the expectation of a target being set for looked-after children, to the First Minister, Children's Commissioner for Wales and the Association of Directors of Social Services. Item 4, then, is a motion under Standing Order 17.42 to resolve to exclude the public for the remainder of the meeting"

        "Summary": "The two groups, the young and trendy and the old and rich, had different preferences for their clothing and products. The young and trendy group preferred a fruit and vegetable theme with a spongy material, while the old and rich group preferred dark colors, simple shapes, and familiar materials like wood. Interestingly, the marketing team found that the trend of incorporating fruit and vegetable themes was widespread across various areas, from clothing to furniture. People seemed to prefer natural and round designs over futuristic ones with sharp angles and titanium.",

So ,   did we  do that ? Well ,  if we go to  this fashion , I We still have caused  a lot of  buttons for the numbers . So , but can it get lost if it's such a thing ? user interface: Yeah , but  Yeah . marketing: If we looked at the latest trends for the  younger people , and they ate  fruit and vegetables , well it has a  a nice colour ,  well compared to food but we didn't  We did not paint any  fruit and vegetable on it for something like that . industrial designer: project manager: So industrial designer: marketing: project manager: Then we have plastic , wood , rubber .

Well What do you think of it ?  marketing: industrial designer: About the project manager: About the project . I I espe I especially  liked the the means , the the SMARTboard and  Yeah , it  It brings up new ideas when you work with  with it . marketing: Yeah , I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal  normal project without laptops  and without these devices . I think  Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation . And maybe is then  the task of the the project manager to also  ask more to the people  less talking <doc-sep>Then  I've I will also take notes during this meeting and I will send you  a summary then as usual . We will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by  our two colleagues that make good work . industrial designer: marketing: project manager: And  then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product . And  end with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits with it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not . project manager: d let's start with the cost aspect so so I look at the aspect discussed last time , that is to say  to have a standard battery , to have a yellow banana shaped  case with  a rubber material around it industrial designer: project manager: to be  to feel spongy , user interface: Like a banana . project manager: So for the financial aspect it's okay , we can  we can continue with this product  as if , marketing: project manager: and we are now going to see the project evaluation with  our marketing expert . marketing: So I made an evaluation and the the evaluation criteria is made according to the users' requirements and the market trends we talked about  during the previous  meetings . marketing: So we we want to have a product fancy look and feel , technologically innovative , easy to use , fashion , easy to find in a room , and robust , project manager: Yeah . marketing: and  according to what you think about the this project you can   make a one point , two point or seven point . marketing: The okay ?  so  fancy look and feel , what do you think ? project manager: Okay . user interface: Do you vote  Christine ? marketing: eh ? user interface: Do you also vote ? marketing: No , I just want to see something project manager: Maybe we all have to agree on a common user interface: Well , we can very easily . So user interface: marketing: Need to project manager: this is your marketing:  I don't know if you we ha we have to put  one  f If it's better or project manager: One is most . project manager: How much would you give on the fancy aspect , on the fashionable aspect ? marketing: Six  s you can how much what ? project manager: How much would you you don't answer to this  questionnaire ? marketing: Oh yes I  I dunno  , I think six , it's a good  user interface: So it will have five point five average . project manager: Four ? industrial designer: A four also , because , except for the wheel , we don't have so much innovation . I I user interface: D are we including the voice are you glu are we including the voice in the end or not ? Huh ? project manager: No . project manager: Four ? So we have four , four f and five ? marketing: We can put four ? user interface: Yeah . Is it fashion ? project manager: Oh yeah , user interface: project manager: its its f its fruit fruit shape . marketing: Yeah it's fashion , because it's a fruit , user interface: Yeah , we can we can put a seven here . marketing: We have the lightning , or project manager: Yeah , we have the marketing: The lighting . project manager: we don't sesh especially have the lightning user interface: So you'll make the material transparent project manager: but marketing: user interface: so that it  lights up completely , or project manager: So it's yellow . project manager: I think it's very easy to marketing: Seven ? project manager: I would say seven . marketing: Is it is it robust ? project manager: Yeah , it's rubber , made of rubber , industrial designer:  f yeah , it's ru it's rubber . user interface: Yeah the only problem there might be which know , i if it's very sensitive , project manager: Yeah . user interface: I don't know project manager: But it is  it is surrounded by rubber material .  if we say that seven it's  it's the better , project manager: Yeah , the be . industrial designer: user interface: Yeah , the top marketing: and when  s six sit six are good it's a good  p product , I think . user interface: Because I saw  some phones that were banana shaped ,  wireless phones not mobile ones , wireless for the house , marketing: project manager: Yeah . user interface:  quite big also , marketing: user interface: and they were selling something like a hundred Euros , two hundred Euros . project manager: I think the industrial designer: But almo also the complexity between a phone and a remote control is not cannot compare . user interface: it's much more complex , but project manager: So , I think , we can summarise . We we have the cost below  our threshold and so we could sell at twenty five Euros and make i make profit . marketing: project manager: So the cost is in the budget , the evaluation is okay , so I th I think we can now  open champagne and make a huge party . user interface: project manager: I don't know if it's provided by  by the meeting staff . user interface: So what does the management say ? project manager: Sorry ? user interface: What does the management say ? project manager: I think we will have  much bigger project next time and a much bigger salary as well <doc-sep>project manager:  and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that are particularly bothering you ? N user interface:   .  in this meeting I I'm going to discuss about the trend watching ,  how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this . The met methodology to find out the trend was incl  was done in a way We have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey , but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market , because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit . So what are our findings ? In our  in our findings we have seen that when we did our remote control market survey we found that  people l  people do have preference for tho fancy mobi  f remote controls which look and feel very good , rather than having a functional look and feel  good . So we should take into  we should consider this factor as the most important factor , because this factor is twice as important , the second factor which is further ti twice the as important as the sec as  the third factor . So this factor becomes the most important factor in our surv   in our mark  means in take in designing our rem  remote controls . user interface: The last one is the most important one , is it ? marketing: No the first one is the user interface: Oh , sorry . marketing:  the outlook of the mobile , the it should have a fancy outlook , project manager: user interface: Okay . marketing: the fancy design  rather than just having a functional look and feel good , it should have a fancy look and foo feel good . We must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo  remote controls are . So it  should be technologically innovative like glow-in-the-dark or speech recognition , something like that . And the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use , user interface: marketing: there shouldn't be too many buttons on this mobi  remote control , it shouldn't be too complicated  like this way . And it should be  and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language , something . marketing: Y yeah  yeah , we have to , because  d you can see how people have related their clothes , shoes , and everything with fruits and vegetables , project manager: user interface: marketing: because the g world is now changing it's trend towards organic , becoming more and more organic , user interface: Okay . industrial designer: We should make a big sponge lemon , marketing: becoming industrial designer: and then it'd be it would be yellow . marketing: And people  the f feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look , hard look . marketing: So user interface: Okay , the spongy , not real spongy , you can marketing: No it ca y a user interface: Do you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel kind of stuff ? marketing: The rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable that we can take into co user interface: Okay . 'Cause we It shouldn't be have any harm to the environment also , user interface: Okay . marketing: because our company is very well for taking all these concerns into consideration , project manager: Alright , okay . marketing: so we don't want to have any harm to the society , user interface: -huh . marketing: user interface: And were there any factors that weren't important in the survey , that they said we don't want ? marketing: S  we didn't find out any such point . marketing:  yes , there could be , but we couldn't find out any , so project manager: --  so the method , we looked at existing designs , what are the what's good about them , what's bad about them ,  I looked at their flaws , so we're going to look at their flaws , everything . Okay , so most remote controls use graphical interface , where you  have got s buttons and you point it rather than having the output as a a stream of text or something . So I think for our remote control There is some inconsistency already in ec existing in between remote controls , but I think standard kind of  shape and  play and those kind of but buttons like the the top right for on and off or something , project manager: Right , okay . user interface: I think , people find that important,'cause then it's easy to use . project manager: user interface: And we've got some pictures of some  new remote controls to show you . user interface: Do I press Escape F_ five ? Or just project manager:  no just escape should  user interface: Escape , okay . user interface: There's  an L_C_D_ thing , which we thought could I thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us . user interface: This one is got a kind of scroll like a mouse , project manager: - , like the middle button . user interface:  and But I'm not exactly sure how you'd use that , industrial designer: project manager: Ah it's kinda like scrolling user interface: like would the computer come project manager:  right , well , if I s if I'm thinking of the right one , I've got the same thing in front of my monitor , you scroll it and the when you reach the sort of  menu item that you require , you press the middle of the scroll . user interface: -huh , that's like the L_C_D_ one , project manager: Right , okay . user interface: is it ? But the one below that has got like a little scroll function on the side . Again that's just quite boring shape , grey , looks quite space-agey , but too many buttons , I think on that one . industrial designer: user interface: You can put it in there , it's for your kids , and it's quite an organic shape and the little circle around there is pretty cool . user interface: And that's really easy to use , bright , so I like this one lot for our design . project manager: Yeah , I m  the one thing I think about about these ones is  these kl  secured areas  , I've seen a lot of them with the the cover missing .  so maybe that could be built into one of the things and it comes up on the T_V_ or something . And this one , the over-sized one , I don't know about you , but I think it's a bit too gimmicky . project manager:  is that not sort of to assist the blind or something , is it ? user interface: I guess so . I like some of these things  the the raised symbols and everything , but pointing out  that this one the volume it is kind of pressing down , but it would actually go up , because of the shape .  but the buttons on this I think are it's just showing you how you can have different different  buttons . project manager: 'Kay but people tend to recognise certain shapes to do certain things anyway , don't they ? user interface: Yeah , exactly . So we need to combine those ones  industrial designer: user interface: and I've just got an e-mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in . user interface: It's you program it like you say , record ,  and then , play , and then , record , play machine , and stuff like that , so that's And it's much Yeah .  personal preferences just some imagination , the raised symbols I thought were good , the L_C_D_ , it does look smart , but I think maybe for our budget , do you think that would be a bit too expensive to have the industrial designer: The L_C_D_ user interface: Yeah . user interface: And the speech recognition , 'cause I think we're definitely going for the speech recognition , marketing: But in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more , user interface: are we ? marketing: but they want the quality , they want f fancy look , they want some new design , something new . But our budget , we've project manager: It's still it's still got to get within our twelve fifty , you know . marketing: So even if we increase our cost little bit , within  some limits , and we give something new technological advancement as well as new design with fancy outlook , I think we will meet the requirements and we will be able to have a good sales in the market . user interface: I'm not sure if the if for twenty five Euros  per  twelve Euros fifty m manufacturing cost , . I can't see tha Although , th  to be to be sure they have got  they are going crazy with the L_C_D_ technology now , industrial designer: user interface: The L_C_D_ . project manager: so that you've got your L_C_D_ T_V_s and everything so maybe the small industrial designer: project manager: But  like I I the black and white , I guess , it just doesn't look funky enough . industrial designer: project manager:  but , like even mobile phones or whatever have now have colour L_C_D_ screens , user interface: No . industrial designer: But  price price not withstanding  , is it too complicated , is it gonna be too much just overload ? marketing: And the project manager: Twelve fifty . marketing:  i it will be easy because there will be , on L_C_D_ s screen , there will be different frent icons , they can just click ok okay , whatever they wa project manager: Possibly . user interface: Yeah , that's the thing , because industrial designer: But but the thing is when you use a remote control , you never look at it , right ? You're looking at the T_V_ project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: It just seems kind of like a a needless th user interface: And one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use , so I think I'm not sure about the L_C_D_ . user interface: It's a it's great , it's a good idea , but for our budget and for the thing we're trying to go for eas easy to use , it's not the thing we should go for , I think . Child-friendly , I thought this was good , as you pointed out the  the bit , it often goes missing especially with children , but it's a good shape and the organic is kind of we could make a vegetabley kind of round shape , I think . industrial designer: So which vegetable ? project manager: Well  we could make a user interface: Yeah , I know , carrot . project manager: Well , si since we're going for the  the k the sort of company colours , I think your lemon wasn't that far s industrial designer: The the lemon . project manager: And if it doesn't work you know , we've just made a lemon . And the mouse one , I thought it was a good idea , because people use mo mice mouses now with the scrolling thing . So they'd be able to use that  , as I said I think i I'd presume it would come up on the screen . project manager: And that means tha that means you get to bump that bit to the T_V_ maker , so user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: I guess there are a lot of options that we're gonna have to choose from among , project manager: Yeah , looks like it . industrial designer: and I'll I'll give you the  , I guess , technical considerations for those . project manager:  user interface: industrial designer: And I'm gonna use the whiteboard , just 'cause we haven't used it . So , the way I'm gonna do this is  we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls , see how they work ,  reuse the the vital kind of  essential pieces of it , project manager: industrial designer: and then we'll throw in our new innovations  and keep it all within budget . project manager: industrial designer:  you open it up , there's a circuit board inside , project manager: industrial designer:  and there's a a chip , a processor , the T_A_ one one eight three five , which  receives input from the buttons , and ch project manager: So this is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip , is it ? industrial designer: Right , it's very they're very cheap remote .  so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier , which is made of some transistors and amplifiers , op-amps , and then that gets sent to the  to the L_E_D_ light , which I can kinda see is that little red light bulb at the end , user interface:  so this is kind of the the bear essentials that we need to have in our remote control , because it it defines the  project manager: Okay . So can we make them to pretty much any size we like or is there a minimum or ? industrial designer: R  no ,  this is a very old one , so now with the new technology this is a a minimally small and cheap thing to make . So you know , as we said , we got the outer casing , which we have to decide , you know , what's it gonna be ,  the board we have to use basically  the same set-up , processor ,  we'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had , amplifier and transmitter are all standard .  so for the casing ,  this an e-mail I got from our manufacturing team  , you know , we have a bunch of options from wood , titanium , rubber , plastic , whatnot ,  latex , double-curved , curved . industrial designer: what do we think ?  or sponge , I guess , isn't on there , right . project manager: Well ,  like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it , doesn't it . industrial designer: Yeah so project manager:  so maybe s  a sort of  plastic initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath ? industrial designer: Okay so , here are a a plastic ,  latex user interface: I like the rubber , the stress balls , I think , project manager: Oh right , okay . user interface: you know , that could be a bit of a gimmick like it's good to hold and industrial designer: Oh right . industrial designer: and the colour is yellow , right ? user interface: Yeah , project manager: Or at least incorporating , yeah . project manager:  I forgot i we're sort of  I don't know what other standard silver kind of user interface: I think project manager: Other parts or  user interface:  . Yeah , the buttons w like , 'cause there's gonna be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours project manager: user interface: or i if we're having buttons actually , industrial designer: So yellow for the body , user interface: I don project manager:  . industrial designer: and then what colour for the buttons ? project manager:  I quite like the multi-coloured buttons myself . user interface: You do have ones like  play could be green or on and off is red , and stuff like that , yeah . industrial designer: project manager: Yeah or yeah a limit  maybe even just a limited multi-colour so it it doesn't look too childish , perhaps .  if we are gonna make it a novel  double-curved sounds good to me if we're talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use , industrial designer: Okay . industrial designer:  'kay so the shape we wanna go  how exactly ? Maybe double user interface: Like  an hour glass kind of figure , is that what you're thinking of , project manager: Yeah it's  , yeah , that that'd be that's sort of comfortable to hold , easy to hold so you don't drop it . user interface: or just like a It's not industrial designer: What about a banana ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah ? Okay , like we could have a big banana shaped remote control , project manager: Well , yeah ,  like industrial designer: 'cause it's yellow fruit , user interface: industrial designer: right ? project manager: Yeah , yeah . user interface: How would you point it ? industrial designer: Oh i it doesn't matter which end you point , I guess . user interface: What industrial designer: We could have a little L_E_D_s on each end . user interface: industrial designer: marketing: because then this this will help us in our advertisement also project manager: marketing: and we can relate with fruits and vegetables , the people's choices . project manager: Huh ? user interface: y I'm I'm not sure about the banana idea . industrial designer: So a spongy banana re marketing: project manager:  that that th user interface: Rubber banana . And what else did you say about fashions ? What was trendy ? marketing:  the fashion trend shows that fruits and vegetables , project manager: S industrial designer: See marketing: like people  now project manager: And sponginess . industrial designer: So maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable user interface: And spongy , yeah . user interface: Like what's what's that , I don't even know the name of it , some kind of , you know where it's like looks like a little snowman kind of thing . industrial designer: Like a gourd almost , or a squash of some sort ? project manager:  . project manager: user interface: 'Cause that you can hold it in like the bottom bit industrial designer: Yeah , user interface: and industrial designer: and it has a a clear top and bottom so y so you could say , you know , it transmits from this end . Well , I guess it's kind of dra  you don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape , user interface: No . industrial designer: Okay , so double-curved , single-curved , what do we feel ? project manager: Yeah . marketing: Or we can do something , we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey , let the public choose what they want . And buttons would , did we say ?  different shapes of buttons ? industrial designer: project manager:  I l I su  for the specific functions , you know , up and down ,  play , stop . industrial designer: Okay , so project manager: They've got , they've got standard sort of intuitive  industrial designer: so buttons . industrial designer: With the scroll-wheel or no ? user interface: Yeah , what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition ? project manager:  speech recognition , I think , so we need a microphone presumably . industrial designer: Where should I put the microphone ? project manager:  ho h h wel are we sure that scroll wheel does give ease of use ? user interface: Yeah , I'm not sure . industrial designer: Okay , well we can do some user test with scroll-wheels , right ? user interface: I couldn Yeah . project manager: And  I think if this this new software for the sound recognition is the microphone industrial designer: Okay . industrial designer: So should the microphone be just anywhere on it or project manager: I would put it sort of sub-centrally , so it's Yeah . industrial designer: project manager: We really need really gonna need to hold it , if it's gonna be voice recognition . user interface: And  so what else was there ?  the industrial designer: project manager: user interface: What about the glow-in-the-dark thing , the strip around it ? project manager: I s I still like it . project manager: 'Cause  like  if we  how good is the speech recognition thing ? Do we want to go for buttons at all , do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit ? user interface: Then you put it in the fruit bowl ? industrial designer: They can work from a project manager: Yeah , you know , and then you just tal industrial designer: You don't have to hold it . project manager:   some  I user interface: Yeah , do we need buttons ? project manager: l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like  , I dunno , an apple . I quite like the design of that ,  'cause that could sit on its own and it's quite got a quite steady base . user interface:  project manager: user interface: and as we say we n we don't wanna be too ridiculous with the fruit things you know . industrial designer: But yeah , about the speech thing , it doesn't have to be hand held or close . marketing: we can do one thing , we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes , different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece . marketing: So whatever people want , like if somebody want it in banana shape , we will put that casing onto that mobile phone , okay , user interface: In that w project manager: It kind of fi it fits with f fits with marketing  user interface: Yeah , 'cause you said about disposable , marketing: S s sorry ? user interface: didn't you ? You said about disposable earli people want disposable things marketing:  like if this is a like if this is a mobile phone  we will design casing in such a way like half of , we need not to have a full cover , we will just have a half of cover , project manager: user interface: so we could do that , like have a choice . marketing: okay ? If somebody wants it i in banana shape , we will fit banana shape casing onto that , so it will give a banana shape look . marketing: If somebody wanted in apple shape we will design that , we will put we will put apple shape casing on that . user interface: We still need the buttons in the same places thought , marketing: Yeah , button will be on the upper side , buttons will be the on the upper side . user interface: marketing: Yeah , buttons will be on the upper side , lower side we will just put the casing , user interface: Oh , that's the other side . So from lower you can , it means while you are holding of from this side you c you can have banana look or apple look , whatever . marketing: So in that way we need not to d have different different shape mobiles everything , we will just design casings fruit shape . marketing: And project manager: I think tho I think if you're gonna have a facia then you'd want to have it so that it does go over the buttons , user interface: Okay . project manager: 'cause when if you think about it if they're wanting it , 'cause they want to look at it , if they're using it , and what they want to look at is facing away from them . project manager: You know 'cause that'd be in the palm of their hand and they wouldn't be able to see it , user interface: Yeah . project manager: unless you have sort of you got the buttons options on one side , and you get the facia on the other side with a microphone so that you can place it face down . And you've got the facia , and you can just talk at the user interface: industrial designer: Okay ,  so marketing: project manager: So you've narrowed it down to half a dozen options . industrial designer: Yeah , marketing: industrial designer: s I guess we decided on material , right ? So that that spongy latex rubber everything feel , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and the shape , maybe we'll just make it kinda mix and match type of shape or project manager: Yeah . Well ,  because Well , I I'm not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing , because I think we should maybe just take the inspiration from the fruit and  because what project manager: Okay , so we stick with what we've got there . user interface: Yeah , w I think wh wha would we're trying to get to twenty five , thirty five year olds who want it quite trendy as well they said . They wanted something that looks fancy and I think maybe fruit could be a bit of a too much of a gimmick , but something ergonomically shaped and organic , like good to hold , based on fruits and natural things like that , project manager:  'kay . user interface: because al already we're going a bit gaudy with the yellow , you know . project manager: So again  like we could have , we could quite easily have the the main body be a different user interface: Okay . project manager: colour , but have user interface: Maybe we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow with , you said , the logan the slogan . project manager:   e even if user interface: Because project manager:  not necessarily that the  the whole body has to be of the company colour , so you know  blue and yellow tend to go to we well together . project manager: So you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing .  as for the energy source  , you know , almost every remote control uses just batteries , but we don't have to be limited by that .  I don't know what that means , we crank it ? project manager:  It's I think it's basically the more you move i it , it's got a wee thing inside that just kinda powers it . industrial designer: So , this might be an idea for something that people really wanna grab , you can shake it if it's out of power . So if it if it's not working , I guess people's natural reaction anyway is to just shake the thing . marketing: But but do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo , tha these type of cells ? project manager: Yeah . marketing: Because then people have to , well like if the cell is out of bat project manager: It does leave them with an obligation to marketing: Yeah , to mo Yeah . marketing: because most of the people project manager: Then if it's just sitting on the user interface: Yeah , then they have to pick it up and then activate it and then Yeah . marketing: solar power will w also not be a good idea , because then they have to keep m their mobiles outside in solar energy , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: and the days when there is no sola sunlight project manager: I'm I'm with  Raj on that , industrial designer: Okay , so probably just marketing: Yeah . project manager: I think , you know , marketing: What we w project manager: I've got I've got no I've got a north facing house , there's not really ever sun coming in my window . project manager:  I w I w  user interface: project manager: that idea that I thought  just on the basis of like ridding them of batteries and that kind of bother industrial designer:  . project manager: is having a , user interface: And we're a very environmentally friendly company , aren't we as well ? project manager: yeah , marketing: Yeah . project manager: having a rechargeable stand , so that not only it doubles as a stand , but  for using it as  recharging it , but also for using it as sound recognition . What's chip on print ? What's industrial designer:  ? project manager: Sorry , never mind . So the more features we add the fancier chips we need to buy and put in , user interface: So  yes , so the speech thing you said our our techno our research and development department came up with some break-through . project manager: Yeah , and if we if we're just having buttons and the speech then we're getting our cheapest option of chipping . project manager: Okay , we're we're kind of  we're kind of  Excuse m I've just deleted that whole thing . Was that you ? industrial designer: Huh ? project manager:  that was your bit's covered , industrial designer: Oh yeah that was that was it . project manager: and what I would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in clay . project manager:  yeah , I hope I can recover this , 'cause I've accidentally deleted it . project manager: Yeah , can you save that  send that last one again , please , Raj , marketing: Yeah . project manager: as I still can't find it on the marketing:  it was under a different name . project manager: that's that's the that it goes there automatically if you put it in Project Documents . But I cou can't open that , because it w asks  for some username or password . project manager: Yeah , I don't know if y it it just ca it just came up on my  on my agenda .  okay , still didn't manage to get down all the last bits so we had rechargeable and  .  no , I think that's us our discussion over unless anybody's got questions or confusions , marketing: user interface: No I'm good . project manager:   we'll probably get questionnaire in a minute , it's a user interface:  "

        "Query": "What is the problem related to feasibility?",
        "Summary": "The Project Manager proposed the idea of adding an LCD display screen to the remote control, allowing for different pages for different devices. However, due to budget constraints of twenty-five per unit, they decided to be realistic and stick to the budget.",
        "Article": " and I  like to show you the agenda for the meeting , I don't know if it was sent round to all of you . project manager: this is the the plan for today's meeting is  firstly just to introduce the project briefly ,  although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already . project manager:  then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings ,  specifically the whiteboard over there .  then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan  and discuss come up with some preliminary ideas about it .  we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product . The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . We're going the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that .  similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together . industrial designer: I'm a bit confused about  what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ?  i is it just  more detail ,  as I understand it ? project manager: I think it th w we're talking the the functional design is more your  area of things where you'll be we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control industrial designer: Right . project manager: and what what specific things it it has to do industrial designer: project manager: but the conceptual design is  perhaps bigger than that and includes the how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing . So whe where do we identify the components of our  product ?  I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ? project manager:  I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then industrial designer: Okay .  what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for for the project , specifically the whiteboard . project manager: So each person in turn , I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project . industrial designer: marketing: Why are you looking at me ? user interface: marketing: project manager: Would you like to go first ? marketing: Do I have a choice ? industrial designer: marketing: Okay . marketing: So , my name's Cat and I'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey industrial designer: project manager: marketing: so  user interface: marketing: Okay . industrial designer: project manager: marketing: Yeah , I don't think it's furry enough , so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit . industrial designer: marketing:  okay and I like it because it's small and it's fluffy . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: And one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink . project manager: Excellent , and what's your what's your role within the team ? marketing: I am the  I need my notebook ,  ooh industrial designer: marketing: top banana . Okay , cool , I am the Marketing Expert  so like I'm gonna be doing the apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything the user g requirements specification of the functional design ,  trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design project manager: industrial designer: project manager: And more about yourself , you're from ? marketing:  I'm from Leicester , project manager:  what else do you want to know ? industrial designer: marketing: I like sports  yeah , aerobics , kickboxing , spinning project manager: marketing:  and  project manager: But not with rabbits . project manager: There's a an if you have not enough room there's an eraser there and you can rub it off .  so   I'm the Interface Designer in this project and my favourite animal , I m  I'm not so sure because I'm not so so very  familiar with all kinds of animals , but I do like dogs . project manager: user interface: Oh , sorry , maybe I should have shouldn't have said it beforehand but industrial designer:  . project manager: industrial designer: marketing: user interface:  well , there are different kinds of dogs , but okay  . user interface:  yeah and I do like dogs because they are good friends to people and they are loyal . project manager: user interface:  yeah maybe maybe the fact that they protect their home as well , yeah . project manager: user interface:  I hope to be loyal to the project industrial designer: marketing: user interface: and not to n not to  let people doing similar projects know the details of our project or something , yeah . industrial designer: project manager: And where where are you from ? user interface: I'm from Estonia project manager: Estonia .  so is there anything else you'd like to know ? Oh , right , my roles , industrial designer: . user interface:  so  in the different  stages of the design , so at first I will be responsible for  for yeah , designing the technical functions of the   of the remote control  then in the in the conceptual design stage I need to  come up with  interface concept and then in the last  stage I will be responsible for the int infa for the user interface design . Okay  I'll do some I'll rub the features project manager: industrial designer: and let the drawing stay . user interface: industrial designer:  this is going to be marketing: They're not just like a big round body and then some really skinny legs industrial designer: Yeah , that'll do . industrial designer: Big , round body , really skinny legs marketing: project manager: industrial designer: and they've got a long tail marketing: industrial designer: and a long face . industrial designer: So this is what I like about cows marketing: Horns , project manager: user interface: industrial designer: that they just keeps sitting there eating grass , marketing: draw some horns . industrial designer: they do not disturb anybody  marketing: project manager: industrial designer: they're kind of Buddhist in a way .  my my role in the project is   the industrial designer , so I'm supposed to design all the details of of the product  ho how it works and whatever it'll  take during the functional role , what are the various functions that have to be performed by it  during the  conceptual design , what are the various components of it and  finally , I'm not too sure what was the last part .  the detailed design , I I guess it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other .  I'm doing my P_H_D_ in Psycholinguistics , I sit at the Department of Psychology . industrial designer: That doesn't look like a cow , does it ? project manager: Okay , here's a space . project manager:  I like dogs too , but I can't do that already because I can't draw a dog as well as you can . marketing: Is there a difference ? user interface: Is a ar are they also like lizards or are they project manager: They're Yeah , they're l it's a kind of lizard . user interface: yeah , they are project manager: And I I like geckos user interface: project manager: and , and where I was living in Cambodia they used to live in my house user interface: Ah . marketing: project manager: and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening . industrial designer: user interface: I hope you don't like snakes , do you ? project manager: I don't like snakes . project manager: I'm from Melbourne and I'm your Project Manager for today industrial designer:  . project manager: and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way , so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product . So , I've just thought marketing: If you right click on it you can project manager: yeah I've just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally as marketing: industrial designer: We've got  we're planning to sell these remote controls for let's make that go away , that means we've got five minutes .  so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target . Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about  what we're thinking of this remote control ? user interface: Yep . I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones . I think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us , industrial designer: project manager: but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be  included in this remote control that that are out of the ordinary . industrial designer: I think  i in the beginning  one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be  trendy , user friendly and original so  I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this . marketing: and the other things that they've made and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures . marketing: and  so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , you know ? project manager: marketing: So I'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that . marketing: You know , so something heading towards that , so it's not overly  I don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so I figure how many do you need , you know ? project manager: project manager: So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or industrial designer: marketing: Something that's a little less crowded than this , like  you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ? project manager: marketing: They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again . industrial designer: There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time , marketing: Sometimes they play a movie . marketing: there's no need to have buttons on it to do that , project manager: So , no . project manager: It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that . marketing: So , if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that's fine project manager: industrial designer:  . marketing: and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . marketing: 'Cause like if you look at the train , it's just very like , there's no extra bits on it , the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing project manager: Oh I haven't had a look yet , yep . marketing:  but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people , but it looks really pretty too .  we can aim for  we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although I don't think that  it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life , project manager: user interface: Yeah but   e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't  go like too far away from from the usual ones , because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems industrial designer: Yeah . So , i it should kind of fit in as well , and the stereotype of a project manager: It's like those fancy websites that you can't access industrial designer: yeah . project manager: because you have no idea how to get in , but the designers thought they were great . Okay , so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this .  we've got another meeting in thirty minutes , so you're you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im basically you're looking at the working design , industrial designer: Alright . project manager: you're looking at the technical functions design , and for you it's the user requirements specification , marketing: - <doc-sep>And  I want to introduce myself ,  my name is  Shrida Daseri and  I'm a project manager for this new project which we are going to discuss now . And what you're  drawing ? user interface:  sure my name is Agnes and I'm an user usability user interface designer . So thanks for coming for the meeting first of all , and  we have a long time , just twenty-five minutes to discuss about  this project and the the project initiation . First of all I want to ask  Mister Ed about your  marketing plan and your product plan and  marketing: Well I think that we'll see that throughout the day in how we're going to put this together as a marketing to to market the product . We'll have to see on a through discussion on where we're gonna go from here and from with this . project manager: - but  do you already have like a functional design or a technical design or marketing:  for the moment not yet . project manager: Oh for the moment not yet , okay , but  what's what's your  do you have some project plan , something with you or marketing: Good question . No , this is like I said that we have to be discussed between all of us and we'll go from there . Okay , so  by when you think you can  give me some kind of  project plan , okay , a discussion with  marketing: Certainly by the next meeting .  Okay , so there's any questions or  first of all about  this project ? industrial designer: What is the goal of the project ? project manager:  the goal of the project I think maybe I'll  hand out to the Ed , okay , so to explain  what is the project because he's in the sales and the accounting . marketing: industrial designer: marketing: I'm in the sales I'm supposed to explain them what to do . We have to define exactly what our product is , from  project manager: Yes , so can you explain  what exactly the product is ? marketing: From what I had in mind we're supposed to be marketing coffee , is that right ? project manager: Oh I think  , if I'm not wrong , we're making the remote control . I had a first part of mine was to make a remote control for a new f remote control for television , and afterward I had a discussion about coffee so project manager: Yes . marketing: Something  visual that has something that will will draw people to buy the product , project manager: marketing: because I think everybody's experienced with  remote controls , and some remote controls are are worth  throwing out the window .  th most of them ar I don't know we're have to come up with a new idea on how to make it a lot easier to use , project manager: marketing: 'cause a lot of times  spend  half a day through the instruction book trying to figure out how to use it . project manager: And  what abo  Christine , what about your  the industrial design plan ? Are you have a design already on this product or  you're still working on the design ? industrial designer:  no , I I have not begun working on the design , project manager: industrial designer: and  I  I actually didn't know we were designing a remote control , I thought we were designing a new monitor .  the website I went to look at had some announcements about an introduction of a   some sort of a seven inch  monitor , and  I understood that that was the project goal . So  I'm glad I didn't d do any work  ahead of time because  I clearly didn't understand the project goal . industrial designer:  I just did s see that we were starting a new project together and there was going to be a four member team composed of these people , and  that's about  that's project manager: industrial designer: and I I read through the different steps , and what my responsibilities were relative to the steps . project manager: So  you'll be leading the team for your design team or how many members is working in the team , for the design ? industrial designer:  for the industrial design ? project manager: Yes . marketing: project manager: That's industrial designer:  because  , you know , you can  you can make it  you have different choices with different financial models . project manager: Yeah , but  before we talk about  the finance , okay ,  do you have some idea how we can  sell this product or project in the market and how much is going to benefit to the company and  of course it's to the individual also . industrial designer: Well , you know  , I kind of think that in general you have to do   y you have to have something that's very fashionable , that's  very attractive that  people see and recognize  its goal , and  they immediately wanna have it  have one of their own . So it would really would need to  something like the iPod would be good , seems to have caught on fairly well , project manager: industrial designer: so  d  you know , I don't care what it does , just so it looks cool . project manager: Okay , but   when you think you can give me like a kind of design on the functional design or the technical design ? industrial designer: Well ,  I've got a lot of other projects I'm doing right now  and so I'll have to wait and see how those  how those go . project manager: Yeah , but  I need something in the writing , so like  what's your functional design , what's your technical design , and  how many people you need for this project , and what's the time frame you're looking , okay , and what is the budget , maybe  initial budget you're looking , okay , and  how is going to the market , okay , industrial designer: project manager: so you've you've had to meet with the marketing team and how they're going to market and what are the marketing strategic plan , okay , when are you going to introduce , okay , and by the time you introduce the product and  you know there there would be a competition , okay , so I need some kind of   the plan in the writing from you . Okay , and it's po industrial designer: And when would you like that ? project manager: B as soon as possible . industrial designer:  well if  if we have enough time  then d do you think  two weeks is a is close enough ? project manager: Yes I think  that would be good , because I need to go to the management and  tell them what we are going to do , and  what cost is , okay , and what's the time frame and what's the project plan , because  without any  documentations , I cannot go to the management and say , so we are going to do this and we need this much money , okay , so then it's it's difficult for me to say , okay , that's the reason I need  some kind of plan from you , initially , okay , then we can have the further discussion again . industrial designer:  are there other people who will be contributing to the plan ? project manager: Yes , of course , if you need some help ,  so let me know . So , who are the people you need  from the marketing or  the technical side or  the administration point of view , okay , to add in any documentation , or some technical point of view , industrial designer: project manager: so just let me know so I can  coordinate all the teams . And  Ed  so what's what do you think about  this  project for the remote control and d do you have some already planned something for your marketing strategy or  the sales strategy ? marketing: Well not yet other than  doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do  , what they're building , their designs , their ideas , project manager:  . marketing: It should be a fairly large market because  the number of people that  the competition , project manager: marketing:  th I agree it has to be something it has to be something new , it has to be something that that draws people saying eh , I like this . Whether it works or not , they have to first say I like this , I like the design , and then it's gotta be simple to use . project manager: Yes , so what I  prefer maybe  you need to interact  more with the Christine , okay , because you know what she is going to do it , okay , and you know how to sell it . Okay , because  she is doing the design , but you are the core because you are in the marketing , okay , marketing: Yeah . project manager: so because you need to sell and you're the responsible for the all the money , the finance , okay , tomorrow . project manager: So , what I prefer , okay , so you need to interact with the Christine more and  within her team , okay , who is using the functional design or technical design , okay , marketing: project manager: and  you need to come up with some kind of plan , okay , how we are going to do the your sales plan , okay , th marketing: Do we already have a cost limit on this , th an idea of how much  we want to market this for , how much it's gonna sell for , project manager: Th That that's marketing: that's up that's up to us to decide , eh ? project manager: Yes , that's you have to decide , okay , so the best thing is you  both of  the Christine and you discuss with yourself , okay , and come up with the cost , and how we are going to compete in the market , okay , in the the technically , or in the sales wise , okay , the commercial wise , okay . Then  we have to design , okay , how long it will take the whole project , okay , how much is going to cost us , and how much we are going to benefit for the company . Okay , so I think it's  maybe if we can  give me some kind of your  the sales plan , okay , including the technical what  she's going to talk to you within the team , okay , then it will help me to discuss with the management for further , okay , and put it in the the proper project plan . Okay , and if you need  any coordination in between  compared to the maybe the some technical vendors or commercial vendors , okay , depends if you want to have some   marketing plan or technical plan , okay , so you let me know .  my job from what I understood was to look at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable , it's acceptable to the people who are gonna use it and look at the best ways to do that . user interface: So I think I'll have to interact with Christine and discuss with her , so that she's not designing something that my studies will show right off the bat that it's not going to work , project manager: Th Christine , yeah . Which is user interface: and so it's sort of it's a loop that feeds in , but I don't think necessarily that I'm in a coordinating position for it . Yeah , so basically you need to interact with Christine more , okay , for the user acceptability , okay , and the testing , okay , user interface: Yeah . project manager: then you will user interface: Which will also feed into the marketing , project manager: Yes . user interface: because depending on what users want , depends on how you sell it , what tag lines you attach to it , how you try to make it more attractive to users .  , and then I guess build the plan based on all of that , because I think you need to take all the factors into account . But what I request , okay , keep Ed in the loop , okay , in between your  meeting and Christine meeting , because  he should know what's happening . Okay and please please copy all the mails , okay , all the discussions to me , okay , so I need to submit to the management . user interface: So , the immediate next step is to start determining the functional design , or project manager: Yes . To come up with the functional design and  to discuss with Ed , okay , and how it's going to be work , and  first of all with your user acceptance , okay , how it looks like and how it's going to be work in the market , okay , user interface: industrial designer: Would you mind  at the conclusion of our meeting could could you send us a copy of your slides ? project manager: Yes , I will . project manager: I'll copy ,  le let us keep all the emails and all the copies , okay , share each other , okay , so you know everybody what's happening , okay ? user interface: Sure . project manager: And if anything you need anytime so please either you can call me , or just send me email , or  just come and  knock my door , okay , so I'm available here <doc-sep>project manager:  for the aim of this meeting now is to to make presentation about  the work for each one . user interface: project manager: And take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote control . project manager: and I think we don't need lighting adaptive , so the remote control should be only used for the the television . industrial designer: So  Well I have a PowerPoint pr presentation stored in my in my personal folder project manager: Here . project manager: industrial designer: Right , so  I will talk about the the w working design and user interface: F_ five . industrial designer: And  well I I will present my my first idea on how to build the our new remote control for television . So I think the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve  what we want to do . user interface: industrial designer: So   I'm thin  I think  I I'll do a survey about what is  what is available on the market and what what is the the cheapest possible things we hav we can use . Then  I will try with the technical team to to build a prototype and to see  with  h how this little box would  look look like . user interface: industrial designer: And how an and we can  start troubleshooting first  com communication problems or things like that . user interface: industrial designer: And when we are ready with this first prototype I I think we can add some software functionalities on a programmable chip like browsing by content or  things like that . Okay so can you go down  So , wha what I think for now is we don't want to have a remote control w which is wired user interface: project manager: industrial designer: so  I think we u we can use a battery for the . And the communication with the T_V_ set is  made through  infrared communication So  this is the the schema of the o of the future  remote controls user interface: Did you draw it ? marketing: project manager: Wow . industrial designer: so  you can you can see the components ,  battery and  the two chips goes to the infrared  connection to the T_V_ set . industrial designer: The one on top is for the  well the functionali the functionalities user interface: marketing: One is a communication . industrial designer: and the the th red  sorry the green one is is to well , putting things together ,  f transform the data into  qu into the format to to  to communicate with the T_V_ set . I think we should use a F_P_G_A_ for for the functionalities which is easy to to t user interface:  . What is F_P_G_A_ ? industrial designer: It's field programmable  something array . user interface: So why's it how is it different from the Bluetooth ? industrial designer: Well ,  a F_P_G_A_ is just a chip you can  you can pr programme it  wi with wh whatever you want . industrial designer: And  well the Bluetooth chip is just responsible to  make the communication  between  the two devices .  So this are the they have to work together ? Or ? Do they have to work together or two separate choice industrial designer: No . marketing: Or it's something like isn't hardware the first one ? And the second one is for the software . marketing: Okay , and how about the battery power ?  you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared ? industrial designer:  no no no no , I think  we have  to to  have  embedded  b batteries in in the project manager: . user interface: industrial designer: And  I I don't think it will need  very  much power to make it run , so user interface:  . user interface: Because you are using because you are using Bluetooth , if some people have P_D_A_ they can use their P_D_A_ to control the T_V_ if they want to , right ? industrial designer: That's a good idea . marketing: project manager: Ma industrial designer: Also , but but I I I think  the the goal is to sell our remote control . So the the purpose is to to find  the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have . user interface: and  and I found that  the function of remote control is to send messages to television set . user interface: For example switch on , switch off , switch the next channel and so on and so on . marketing: G user interface: So I found two very good prototypes for for this interface from our competitors industrial designer: user interface: so can you industrial designer: project manager: This are usual functionality . industrial designer: user interface: But then  loo but then I found if you look at you see on the left one there are too many buttons industrial designer: project manager: And they are small . O on the right I tried to play with the problem is that  if I have hundred channels I have  I have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and I have to compose the number industrial designer: Yeah . And then I I look at the user manual they are a hundred pages thick , so we don't want that . You can navigate on T_V_ screen and we can the user's preference and we need to have the T_V_ connected to internet so we end in order to access the T_V_ programmes by X_M_L_ and we need some to do some preprocessing . From the technical aspect , the processing should be done on the T_V_ set than on the on the remote controller , right ? industrial designer: user interface: And then we the speech recognition as  Harry says we may just put in we may K_I_V_ . project manager: What do you mean by the pa pa processing will be done on the T_V_ user interface: Yeah , all the processing is done the T_V_ is a compu has some processing power the project manager: than the industrial designer: So we have to t project manager: So we should have specific T_V_ ? Or ? We can use this . project manager: Yeah , we don't marketing: user interface: Yeah because are you just wondering what controller okay . industrial designer: I think there there is there is al there there is a a technology like show view who is already available on most of the T_V_ set on recorders or thing like that user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and we can try t to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because user interface: Okay . user interface: So i the processing on on the remote controller project manager: Yeah , user interface: so it can u be used in any T_V_ , any conventional T_V_ sets ? project manager: we . project manager: Keep the navigation industrial designer: We d we don't we we don't need really much buttons to i if we have a screen to navigate on on the T_V_ so  project manager: but user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: It's easy to build , user interface: industrial designer: it does not consume much power . marketing: Oh , but you have a catch there ,  assume that  if you want to go to if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine , then . user interface: industrial designer: Well , then y you you go to the main menu and  you have  go to channel user interface:  . No , because you choose by channel , so you choose by T_V_ program industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: but  I I think i i if you if you want to to make  well a a big jump but  well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could marketing: But project manager: So you are user interface: Ah . user interface: A mouse or industrial designer: Well , not a mouse but  something that that says more clearly that  right , left , up , down , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: well , the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator , maybe directly , or marketing:    . So it'll beep if you wanna find it marketing: too small that it goes under the sofa and we can't find it . project manager: user interface: you just  shout y h just it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device . user interface: And responds to you , and industrial designer: marketing: Yeah , that's right . marketing: Okay , after having the inputs from industrial design and user interface , I think most of the points which I want to are already covered here . user interface: marketing: And to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested , then what we have done is we have put a feedback forms in all the magazines , and the users send the feedbacks , and based on that These are the findings which we got and yeah adding of a speech interface is always good for a T_V_ remote but the technology We already know that as discussed earlier industrial designer: Well I I think it will be a , yes , a bit complicated to  make a speech recognisers runs on the small  ts user interface: project manager: marketing: An it does how feasible it is . I if you just recognise  numbers is a limited you have limited vocabulary marketing: Oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones . industrial designer: And this can allow to choose the the program , for instance without  adding  buttons user interface: Yeah . And of course most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive , project manager: marketing: so this is an important criteria here is user interface: But project manager: But do you think what they sug suggested s possibility . user interface: I no I I think that  i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with  reasonable cost . marketing: user interface: Maybe not less , but they may be willing to pay little bit more for comfort , marketing: Little bit more if it's with extra features . industrial designer: Well ,  project manager: There is in the marketing: for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes . industrial designer: marketing: Or they say movie name or I don't go for movie names but only for the numbers on the channel , or volume up , volume down , brightness , contrast . industrial designer: we we just have to find a mean how to to add a m a a a microphone or  well yes a microphone into the the remote control , so marketing: I think user interface: industrial designer: I well project manager: I think i industrial designer: it will be alright . project manager: What about lighting adaptive options ? marketing: Yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting , but I think  not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required . user interface: So you need s special T_V_ sets to do that ? Or it's it's done via this remote controller ? It's very complex . marketing:  industrial designer: Yeah , I think it's a bit complex too user interface: marketing:  yeah , it's for the  industrial design and users interface designers to decide if it's going to be working or not . industrial designer: For our next product , our new T_V_ set with  automatical  sound adjustment light marketing: I think project manager: user interface: Yeah , then we can conclude that . So any things to to discuss ? Or any suggestions ? user interface: marketing: I think as I discussed th that four points would be good for  marketing . And regarding the teletext  these are the subtitl these are the text information which you got on the televisions . marketing: And  if you are a French guy watching an English movie you would like to have it in French . industrial designer: marketing: So , the remote it should have some it should give me some flexibility of choosing the ch languages . industrial designer: Yeah , but well what about the the new project's requirement ? I I I think we should give up with teletext , no ? project manager: I think we we can we is the . Well , so maybe we we can j we can already think  about a way to to access the internet via the television . industrial designer: Because if user interface: Using the T_V_ to access the internet ? Or what ? I didn't quite understand industrial designer: Yeah , but  we can think that in a few years there will be T_V_ set that can access the internet . industrial designer: So it's a good idea if i i if we i if if we  think about how to to to build up our remote  control w with this functionality in a w which will c which will come in a few years . industrial designer: So if we already have it in our remote control project manager: So you have to anticipate the the future ? industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: well , not not to implement it , but to well , to find a way to to add to add this functionality in a yeah , in an in an easy manner , if is possible "

        "Query": "Summarize the discussion on spectral subtraction and the opinions of the professor and PhD F.",
        "Summary": "The team explored different approaches for spectral subtraction, including both scaling and GGT bins. Each approach had its pros and cons. The professor suggested a simple spectral subtraction followed by a KL transformation. Additionally, he recommended using JRASTRA's technique, which involved adding noise to eliminate noise. The team also discussed VTS techniques. Initially, the professor did not see the advantage of combining the Wiener filter and the subspace, but later realized that a simple spectral subtraction, followed by a KL transform and a Wiener filter, would suffice. The log magnitude spectral subtraction utilized twelve seconds from the past and future to calculate the mean. The use of a short window did not significantly impact the model's performance, which was desirable. The team also removed silence to enhance the model's effectiveness, drawing a parallel to caching utterances. PhD F shared that the preliminary results from spectral subtraction were unsatisfactory, but mean normalization helped reduce noise. However, mean and variance normalization only improved speech, not noise variance.",
        "Article": "phd e: So it 's well , it 's spectral subtraction or Wiener filtering , depending on if we put if we square the transfer function or not . phd e: And then with over - estimation of the noise , depending on the ,  the SNR , with smoothing along time , smoothing along frequency . phd e: And , the best result is when we apply this procedure on FFT bins , with a Wiener filter . phd e: So it 's good because it 's difficult when we have to add noise to to to find the right level . It 's the same , idea but it 's working on mel bands , and it 's a spectral subtraction instead of Wiener filter , and there is also a noise addition after , cleaning up the mel bins . professor b: if you look at databases , the , one that has the smallest smaller overall number is actually better on the Finnish and Spanish , but it is , worse on the , Aurora phd e: It 's worse on professor b:  on the , TI - TI - digits , phd e: on the multi - condition in TI - digits . But , when you say u  , unified do you mean , it 's one piece of software now , or ? phd e: So now we are , yeah , setting up the software .  , and we phd a: So what 's what 's happened ? I think I 've missed something . So a week ago maybe you weren't around when when when Hynek and Guenther and I ? phd c: Hynek was here .  And then if I summarize somebody can tell me if I 'm wrong , which will also be possibly helpful . phd e: p - p - p professor b: We ,  we looked at ,  anyway we after coming back from QualComm we had , you know , very strong feedback and , I think it was Hynek and Guenter 's and my opinion also that , you know , we sort of spread out to look at a number of different ways of doing noise suppression . professor b: we had a long discussion about how they were the same and how they were d  , completely different . professor b: And , fundamentally they 're the same sort of thing but the math is a little different so that there 's a a there 's an exponent difference in the index you know , what 's the ideal filtering , and depending on how you construct the problem . professor b: And , I guess it 's sort you know , after after that meeting it sort of made more sense to me because  , if you 're dealing with power spectra then how are you gonna choose your error ? And typically you 'll do choose something like a variance . Whereas when you 're when you 're doing the the , looking at it the other way , you 're gonna be dealing with signals phd c:   professor b: and you 're gonna end up looking at power  , noise power that you 're trying to reduce . And so , eh so there should be a difference of you know , conceptually of of , a factor of two in the exponent . professor b: But there 're so many different little factors that you adjust in terms of of , over - subtraction and and and and and so forth , that arguably , you 're c and and and the choice of do you do you operate on the mel bands or do you operate on the FFT beforehand . There 're so many other choices to make that are are almost well , if not independent , certainly in addition to the choice of whether you , do spectral subtraction or Wiener filtering , that , @ @ again we sort of felt the gang should just sort of figure out which it is they wanna do and then let 's pick it , go forward with it . And and , we said , take a week , go arm wrestle , you know , grad d: Oh . professor b: And and so they so instead they went to Yosemite and bonded , and and they came out with a single single piece of software . phd a: So so you guys have combined or you 're going to be combining the software ? professor b:  . phd c: Well , the piece of software has , like , plenty of options , phd e: Oh boy . professor b: Well , that 's fine , but the thing is the important thing is that there is a piece of software that you that we all will be using now . phd e: Well , if we want to , like , optimize different parameters of phd c: Parameters . But , still so , there will be a piece of software with , will give this system , the fifty - three point sixty - six , by default and professor b:   phd a: I I I don't have a sense of phd e: It 's just one percent off of the best proposal . professor b: So it so , it 's it it 's not using our full bal bag of tricks , if you will . professor b: And , and it it is , very close in performance to the best thing that was there before .  , but , you know , looking at it another way , maybe more importantly , we didn't have any explicit noise , handling stationary dealing with e e we didn't explicitly have anything to deal with stationary noise . phd a: So will the neural net operate on the output from either the Wiener filtering or the spectral subtraction ? Or will it operate on the original ? professor b: Well , so so so argu arguably , what we should do  , I gather you have it sounds like you have a few more days of of nailing things down with the software and so on . But and then but , arguably what we should do is , even though the software can do many things , we should for now pick a set of things , th these things I would guess , and not change that . And I think , you know , that our goal should be by next week , when Hynek comes back , to  , really just to have a firm path , for the you know , for the time he 's gone , of of , what things will be attacked . But I would I would I would thought think that what we would wanna do is not futz with this stuff for a while because what 'll happen is we 'll change many other things in the system , phd a:   professor b: and then we 'll probably wanna come back to this and possibly make some other choices . phd a: But just conceptually , where does the neural net go ? Do do you wanna h run it on the output of the spectrally subtracted ? phd e: Mmm . professor b: Well , depending on its size Well , one question is , is it on the , server side or is it on the terminal side ?  , if it 's on the server side , it you probably don't have to worry too much about size . So the issue is is , for instance , could we have a neural net that only looked at the past ? phd a: Right . professor b: what we 've done in  in the past is to use the neural net , to transform , all of the features that we use . This is essentially ,  I guess it 's it 's more or less like a spee a speech enhancement technique here phd a:   professor b: right ? where we 're just kind of creating new if not new speech at least new new FFT 's that that have you know , which could be turned into speech  , that that have some of the noise removed . professor b: after that we still do a mess of other things to to produce a bunch of features . And then the the way that we had it in our proposal - two before , we had the neural net transformed features and we had the untransformed features , which I guess you you actually did linearly transform with the KLT , phd e: Yeah . professor b: but but but  , to orthogonalize them but but they were not , processed through a neural net . And Stephane 's idea with that , as I recall , was that you 'd have one part of the feature vector that was very discriminant and another part that wasn't , phd a:   professor b: which would smooth things a bit for those occasions when , the testing set was quite different than what you 'd trained your discriminant features for .  , y you know , that 's still being debated by the by people in Europe but , no matter how they end up there , it 's not going to be unlimited amounts , phd a: Yeah . And I think those that we last time we agreed that those are the three things that have to get , focused on . phd a: What was the issue with the VAD ? professor b: Well , better ones are good . phd a: And so the w the default , boundaries that they provide are they 're OK , but they 're not all that great ? professor b: I guess they still allow two hundred milliseconds on either side or some ? Is that what the deal is ? phd e:   phd e: And all the speech pauses , which is Sometimes on the SpeechDat - Car you have pauses that are more than one or two seconds . And , yeah , it seems to us that this way of just dropping the beginning and end is not We cou we can do better , I think , phd a:   phd e: because , with this way of dropping the frames they improve over the baseline by fourteen percent and Sunil already showed that with our current VAD we can improve by more than twenty percent . phd e: So , our current VAD is is more than twenty percent , while their is fourteen . And another thing that we did also is that we have all this training data for let 's say , for SpeechDat - Car . And if we just take only the , VAD probabilities computed on the clean signal and apply them on the far - field , test utterances , then results are much better . phd e: So it means that there are stim still phd a: How how much latency does the ,  does our VAD add ? phd e: If if we can have a good VAD , well , it would be great . phd a: Is it significant , phd e: right now it 's , a neural net with nine frames . phd a: or ? phd e: So it 's forty milliseconds plus , the rank ordering , which , should be phd c: Like another ten frames . professor b: So what 's the ? If you ignore  , the VAD is sort of in in parallel , isn't i isn't it , with with the ?  , it isn't additive with the the , LDA and the Wiener filtering , and so forth . phd c: So we  , if so if we if so which is like if we reduce the delay of VA So , the f the final delay 's now ba is f determined by the delay of the VAD , because the LDA doesn't have any delay . So if we re if we reduce the delay of the VAD , it 's like effectively reducing the delay . phd a: How how much , delay was there on the LDA ? phd c: So the LDA and the VAD both had a hundred millisecond delay . So and they were in parallel , so which means you pick either one of them phd a: Mmm . professor b: And there didn't seem to be any , penalty for that ? There didn't seem to be any penalty for making it causal ? phd c: Pardon ? Oh , no . phd c: Or something like that professor b: And he says Wiener filter is is forty milliseconds delay . phd a: What amount of latency are you thinking about when you say that ? professor b:  . professor b: You know , they 're saying ,  one group is saying a hundred and thirty milliseconds and another group is saying two hundred and fifty milliseconds . phd a: Were you thinking of the two - fifty or the one - thirty when you said we should have enough for the neural net ? professor b: Well , it just it when we find that out it might change exactly how we do it , is all . professor b: how much effort do we put into making it causal ?  , I think the neural net will probably do better if it looks at a little bit of the future . And , you know , how how much time should we put into into that ? So it 'd be helpful if we find out from the the standards folks whether , you know , they 're gonna restrict that or not . But I think , you know , at this point our major concern is making the performance better and and , if , something has to take a little longer in latency in order to do it that 's you know , a secondary issue . professor b: But if we get told otherwise then , you know , we may have to c clamp down a bit more . phd c: So , the one one one difference is that was there is like we tried computing the delta and then doing the frame - dropping . phd c: The earlier system was do the frame - dropping and then compute the delta on the professor b:  - huh . So , yeah , what we do is we compute the silence probability , convert it to that binary flag , professor b:  - huh . phd c: and then in the end you c up upsample it to match the final features number of phd e:   phd a: Did that help then ? phd c: It seems to be helping on the well - matched condition . And it actually r reduced a little bit on the high mismatch , so in the final weightage it 's b b better because the well - matched is still weighted more than professor b: So , @ @  , you were doing a lot of changes . Did you happen to notice how much , the change was due to just this frame - dropping problem ? What about this ? phd c: y you had something on it . Sometime we we change two two things together and But it 's around maybe it 's less than one percent . But like we 're saying , if there 's four or five things like that then pretty sho soon you 're talking real improvement . Well , we can do the frame - dropping on the server side or we can just be careful at the terminal side to send a couple of more frames before and after , and So . phd a: You have ,  So when you  , maybe I don't quite understand how this works , but , couldn't you just send all of the frames , but mark the ones that are supposed to be dropped ? Cuz you have a bunch more bandwidth .  , it it always seemed to us that it would be kind of nice to in addition to , reducing insertions , actually use up less bandwidth . phd a: If the net 's on the server side then it could use all of the frames . It 's , like , you mean you just transferred everything and then finally drop the frames after the neural net . Right now we are  , ri Right now what wha what we did is , like , we just mark we just have this additional bit which goes around the features , saying it 's currently a it 's a speech or a nonspeech . phd c: So there is no frame - dropping till the final features , like , including the deltas are computed . phd c: And after the deltas are computed , you just pick up the ones that are marked silence and then drop them . professor b: So it would be more or less the same thing with the neural net , I guess , actually . Yeah , that 's what that 's what that 's what , this is doing right now . So , what 's ,  ? That 's that 's a good set of work that that ,  phd c: Just one more thing . Like , should we do something f more for the noise estimation , because we still ? professor b: Yeah . I tried just plugging the , Guenter noise estimation on this system , and it  , it got worse . professor b: it does seem like , you know , i i i i some compromise between always depending on the first fifteen frames and a a always depending on a a pause is is is a good idea .  , maybe you have to weight the estimate from the first - teen fifteen frames more heavily than than was done in your first attempt . No , do you have any way of assessing how well or how poorly the noise estimation is currently doing ? phd e: Mmm . phd e: We don't have nothing that phd c: Is there was there any experiment with ? Well , I I did The only experiment where I tried was I used the channel zero VAD for the noise estimation and frame - dropping . So I don't have a I don't have a split , like which one helped more . phd c: So , that 's the professor b: So that 's something you could do with , this final system . professor b: If it 's , you know , essentially not better , then it 's probably not worth phd e: Yeah . It 's , like , ev even even if I use a channel zero VAD , I 'm just averaging the the s power spectrum . But the Guenter 's argument is , like , if it is a non - stationary segment , then he doesn't update the noise spectrum . So , th the Guenter was arguing that , even if you have a very good VAD , averaging it , like , over the whole thing is not a good idea . phd c: Because you 're averaging the stationary and the non - stationary , and finally you end up getting something which is not really the s because , you anyway , you can't remove the stationary part fr  , non - stationary part from the signal . So , that 's so that 's still a slight difference from what Guenter is trying  professor b: Well , yeah . And and also there 's just the fact that , eh , although we 're trying to do very well on this evaluation , we actually would like to have something that worked well in general . And , relying on having fifteen frames at the front or something is is pretty phd c: Yeah , yeah .  , it 'd certainly be more robust to different kinds of input if you had at least some updates . What what do you ,  what do you guys see as as being what you would be doing in the next week , given wha what 's happened ? phd c: Cure the VAD ? phd e: Yeah . phd e: So , should we keep the same ? I think we might try to keep the same idea of having a neural network , but training it on more data and adding better features , I think , but because the current network is just PLP features . phd e: There 's no RASTA , no phd a: So , I I don't remember what you said the answer to my , question earlier . Will you will you train the net on after you 've done the spectral subtraction or the Wiener filtering ? professor b: This is a different net . phd c: So we have a VAD which is like neur that 's a neural net . phd c: So , right now we have , like ,  we have the cleaned - up features , so we can have a better VAD by training the net on the cleaned - up speech . So it 's , like , where do we want to put the VAD ?  , it 's like phd a: Can you use the same net to do both , or ? phd c: For phd a: Can you use the same net that you that I was talking about to do the VAD ? phd c:   phd c: So the net the final net  , which is the feature net so that actually comes after a chain of , like , LDA plus everything . And and you can actually do it for final frame - dropping , but not for the VA - f noise estimation . professor b: You see , the idea is that the , initial decision to that that you 're in silence or speech happens pretty quickly . phd a: Cuz that 's used by some of these other ? professor b: And that Yeah . And that 's sort of fed forward , and and you say \" well , flush everything , it 's not speech anymore \" . professor b: it is used ,  Yeah , it 's only used f Well , it 's used for frame - dropping . professor b: because , you know , there 's if you have more than five hundred milliseconds of of of nonspeech then you figure it 's end of utterance or something like that .  , keeping the same method but but , seeing if you cou but ,  noise estimation could be improved . And then , later on in the month I think we wanna start including the neural net at the end . phd a: So , Hynek is coming back next week , you said ? professor b: Yeah , that 's the plan . professor b: I guess the week after he 'll be , going back to Europe , and so we wanna phd a: Is he in Europe right now or is he up at ? professor b: No , no .  , the idea was that , we 'd we 'd sort out where we were going next with this with this work before he , left on this next trip .  , Barry , you just got through your quals , so I don't know if you have much to say . No , just , looking into some some of the things that , John Ohala and Hynek , gave as feedback , as as a starting point for the project . In in my proposal , I I was thinking about starting from a set of , phonological features , or a subset of them . grad d: He said , these these phonological features are are sort of figments of imagination also . grad d: Ye professor b: But we don't have too much trouble recognizing synthetic speech since we create it in the first place . grad d: just looking at the data and seeing what 's similar and what 's not similar . grad d: So , I 'm I 'm , taking a look at some of , Sangita 's work on on TRAPS . She did something where ,  w where the TRAPS learn She clustered the the temporal patterns of , certain certain phonemes in in m averaged over many , many contexts . grad d: And , so , those are interesting things to phd a: So you 're now you 're sort of looking to try to gather a set of these types of features ? grad d: Right . grad d: you know ? A a a set of small features and continue to iterate and find , a better set <doc-sep>grad e: Hello ? professor a: So everybody everybody 's on ? phd d: Today 's professor a: Yeah . professor a: eh e and  I guess Chuck you weren't there either , so the  phd b: I was there . professor a: Oh you were there ? phd b: With Hynek ? professor a: Yeah . professor a: What was the w what was the downsampling problem again ? phd c: So we had professor a: I forget . phd c: So the fact that there there is no  low - pass filtering before the downsampling . phd c: There is because there is LDA filtering but that 's perhaps not  the best w m professor a: Depends what it 's frequency characteristic is , yeah . So we discussed about this , about the  professor a: Was there any conclusion about that ? phd c:  \" try it \" . So again this is th this is the downsampling  of the  the feature vector stream phd c:  . professor a: and  Yeah I guess the the  LDA filters they were doing do have   let 's see , so the the the feature vectors are calculated every ten milliseconds so  the question is how far down they are at fifty fifty hertz . Does anybody know what the frequency characteristic is ? phd c: We don't have yet professor a: Oh OK . And the third point  was the  , yeah , the on - line normalization where , well , the recursion f recursion for the mean estimation is a filter with some kind of delay professor a: Yeah . For this , the conclusion of Hynek was , well , \" we can try it but \" professor a:  - huh . professor a: Try try what ? phd c: So try to   take into account the delay of the recursion for the mean estimation . And so while discussing about these these LDA filters , some i issues appeared , like well , the fact that if we look at the frequency response of these filters it 's  , well , we don't know really what 's the important part in the frequency response and there is the fact that in the very low frequency , these filters don't don't really remove a lot .  and that 's probably a reason why , yeah , on - line normalization helps because it it , professor a: Right . Yeah , but perhaps everything could should be could be in the filter ,  the the mean normalization and Yeah . phd c: And this was this LDA  tuning perhaps and Hynek proposed again to his  TRAPS , so . phd c: Yeah , professor a:  I g I guess the key thing for me is is figuring out how to better coordinate between the two sides phd c:  . professor a:  I was talking with Hynek about it later and the the sort of had the sense sort of that that neither group of people wanted to to bother the other group too much . And and I don't think anybody is , you know , closed in in their thinking or are unwilling to talk about things but I think that you were sort of waiting for them to tell you that they had something for you and and that and expected that they would do certain things and they were sor they didn't wanna bother you phd c:   professor a: and they were sort of waiting for you and and and  we ended up with this thing where they they were filling up all of the possible latency themselves , and they just had hadn't thought of that .  it 's true that maybe maybe no one really thought about that that this latency thing would be such a a strict issue phd c: Yeah . Well professor a: in in  the other phd c: Yeah I don't know what happened really , but professor a: Yeah . Because , well , we discussed about that about this problem and they told us \" well , we will do all that 's possible to have enough space for a network \" but then , yeah , perhaps they were too short with the time and professor a: Then they couldn't . Well maybe we should just   you 're you 're bus other than that you folks are busy doing all the all the things that you 're trying that we talked about before right ? And this machines are busy and you 're busy phd c: Yeah . professor a: Let 's let 's , I think that as as we said before that one of the things that we 're imagining is that  there there will be  in the system we end up with there 'll be something to explicitly   do something about noise phd c:   professor a: in addition to the  other things that we 're talking about and that 's probably the best thing to do . And there was that one email that said that it sounded like   things looked very promising up there in terms of  I think they were using Ericsson 's approach or something and in addition to They 're doing some noise removal thing , right ? phd c: Yeah , yeah . phd c: And phd d: Yeah , I modified it well , modifying I studied Barry 's sim code , more or less . and we have some the feature for Italian database and we will try with this feature with the filter to find the result . phd d: and maybe try another type of spectral subtraction , I don't professor a: When you say you don't have a result yet you mean it 's it 's just that it 's in process or that you it finished and it didn't get a good result ? phd d: No . No , no n we have n we have do the experiment only have the feature the feature but the experiment have phd c: Yeah . So  I suggest actually now we we we sorta move on and and hear what 's what 's what 's happening in in other areas like what 's what 's happening with your investigations about echos and so on . grad f: Oh  Well  I haven't started writing the test yet , I 'm meeting with Adam today professor a:   grad f:  and he 's going t show me the scripts he has for  running recognition on mee Meeting Recorder digits . grad f:  I also  haven't got the code yet , I haven't asked Hynek for for the for his code yet . Cuz I looked at  Avendano 's thesis and I don't really understand what he 's doing yet but it it it sounded like  the channel normalization part  of his thesis  was done in a a bit of I don't know what the word is , a a bit of a rough way  it sounded like he  he he it it wasn't really fleshed out and maybe he did something that was interesting for the test situation but I I 'm not sure if it 's what I 'd wanna use so I have to I have to read it more , I don't really understand what he 's doing yet . Yeah I haven't read it in a while so I 'm not gonna be too much help unless I read it again , phd d: It 's my phd c: Oh yeah ? phd d: I know this is mine here . The  so you , and then you 're also gonna be doing this echo cancelling between the the close mounted and the and the the the what we 're calling a cheating experiment  of sorts between the distant grad f:  I I 'm ho Right . grad f: I I think he 's at least planning to do it for the cl close - mike cross - talk and so maybe I can just take whatever setup he has and use it . Yeah actually  he should  I wonder who else is I think maybe it 's Dan Ellis is going to be doing  a different cancellation . One of the things that people working in the meeting task wanna get at is they would like to have cleaner close - miked recordings . So  this is especially true for the lapel but even for the close close - miked  cases  we 'd like to be able to have  other sounds from other people and so forth removed from So when someone isn't speaking you 'd like the part where they 're not speaking to actually be So what they 're talking about doing is using ec  echo cancellation - like techniques . It 's not really echo but  just   taking the input from other mikes and using   a  an adaptive filtering approach to remove the effect of that  other speech .  what was it , there was there was some some some point where eh  Eric or somebody was was speaking and he had lots of silence in his channel and I was saying something to somebody else  which was in the background and it was not it was recognizing my words , which were the background speech on the close close mike . phd b: Yeah that was actually my I was wearing the I was wearing the lapel and you were sitting next to me , professor a: Oh you it was you I was Yeah . phd b: and I only said one thing but you were talking and it was picking up all your words . So I think I think Dan Ellis or somebody who was working with him was going to  work on that . And  I don't know if we 've talked lately about the the plans you 're developing that we talked about this morning  I don't remember if we talked about that last week or not , but maybe just a quick reprise of of what we were saying this morning . So continuing to  extend phd b: What about the stuff that  Mirjam has been doing ? And and S Shawn , yeah . professor a: But that 's   all that 's is a a certainly relevant  study and , you know , what are the features that they 're finding . professor a:  what are the variables , what we 're calling this one , what are the variables that they 're found finding useful phd c:  . professor a:  for phd b: And their their targets are based on canonical mappings of phones to acoustic f features . And that 's certainly one thing to do and we 're gonna try and do something more f more fine than that but   so  So I guess you know what , I was trying to remember some of the things we were saying , do you ha still have that ? Yeah . professor a: There 's those that  yeah , some of some of the issues we were talking about was in j just getting a good handle on on  what \" good features \" are and phd b: What does what did  Larry Saul use for it was the sonorant  detector , right ? How did he H how did he do that ? Wh - what was his detector ?   professor a: And the other thing you were talking about is is is where we get the targets from . So  , there 's these issues of what are the what are the variables that you use and do you combine them using the soft \" AND - OR \" or you do something , you know , more complicated  and then the other thing was so where do you get the targets from ? The initial thing is just the obvious that we 're discussing is starting up with phone labels from somewhere and then  doing the transformation . But then the other thing is to do something better and eh w why don't you tell us again about this this database ? This is the phd b:  ! professor a: And then tell them to talk naturally ? Yeah , yeah . professor a: Maybe you could go to these parlors and and you could , you know you know have have , you know , reduced rates if you if you can do the measurements . You could what you could do is you could sell little rings and stuff with embedded you know , transmitters in them and things professor a: Yeah . phd b:  ! There 's a bunch of data that l around , that people have done studies like that w way way back right ?  I can't remember where  Wisconsin or someplace that used to have a big database of Yeah . I remember there was this guy at A T - andT , Randolph ? or r What was his name ? Do you remember that guy ?  , researcher at A T - andT a while back that was studying , trying to do speech recognition from these kinds of features . professor a: Do you mean eh but you  Mar phd c: Well he was the guy the guy that was using professor a: you mean when was was Mark Randolph there , or ? phd b: Mark Randolph . phd c: Is it the guy that was using the pattern of pressure on the tongue or ? phd b: I can't remember exactly what he was using , now . But I know I just remember it had to do with you know  positional parameters phd c: What Yeah . So the only the only  hesitation I had about it since ,  I haven't see the data is it sounds like it 's it 's continuous variables and a bunch of them . professor a: I don't know how complicated it is to go from there What you really want are these binary labels , and just a few of them . And maybe there 's a trivial mapping if you wanna do it and it 's e but it I I I worry a little bit that this is a research project in itself , whereas  if you did something instead that like  having some manual annotation by  you know , linguistics students , this would there 'd be a limited s set of things that you could do a as per our discussions with with John before phd b:   professor a: but the things that you could do , like nasality and voicing and a couple other things you probably could do reasonably well .  the other thing you could do is boot trying to to  get those binary variables and take the continuous variables from  the   the data itself there , but I I 'm not sure phd b: Could you cluster the just do some kind of clustering ? professor a: Guess you could , yeah . So anyway that 's that 's  that 's another whole direction that cou could be looked at .  in general it 's gonna be for new data that you look at , it 's gonna be hidden variable because we 're not gonna get everybody sitting in these meetings to wear the pellets and  . phd b: So you 're talking about using that data to get  instead of using canonical mappings of phones . phd b: So you 'd use that data to give you sort of what the the true mappings are for each phone ? grad e:   So wh yeah , where this fits into the rest in in my mind , I guess , is that  we 're looking at different ways that we can combine  different kinds of of rep front - end representations  in order to get robustness under difficult or even , you know , typical conditions . And part of it , this robustness , seems to come from  multi - stream or multi - band sorts of things and Saul seems to have a reasonable way of looking at it , at least for one one  articulatory feature . The question is is can we learn from that to change some of the other methods we have , since  , one of the things that 's nice about what he had I thought was that that it it  the decision about how strongly to train the different pieces is based on  a a reasonable criterion with hidden variables rather than  just assuming that you should train e e every detector  with equal strength towards  it being this phone or that phone . It 's a soft \" AND \" , I guess but in in principle you you wanna get a strong concurrence of all the different things that indicate something and then he \" OR 's \" across the different soft \" OR 's \" across the different  multi - band channels . And  the weight yeah , the target for the training of the \" AND \" \" AND ' ed \" things is something that 's kept  as a hidden variable , and is learned with EM . Whereas what we were doing is is  taking the phone target and then just back propagating from that phd b: So he doesn't have professor a: which means that it 's it 's  i It could be for instance that for a particular point in the data you don't want to   train a particular band train the detectors for a particular band . You you wanna ignore that band , cuz that 's a Ban - band is a noisy noisy measure . professor a: And we don't We 're we 're still gonna try to train it up . In our scheme we 're gonna try to train it up to do as well well as it can at predicting . phd b: So he doesn't have to have truth marks or Ho grad e: F right , and  he doesn't have to have hard labels . professor a: Well at the at the tail end , yeah , he has to know what 's where it 's sonorant . But he 's but what he 's - but what he 's not training up  what he doesn't depend on as truth is grad e: Right . professor a:  I guess one way of describing would be if if a sound is sonorant is it sonorant in this band ? Is it sonorant in that band ? grad e: Right . professor a: Is it sonorant in that band ? i It 's hard to even answer that what you really mean is that the whole sound is sonorant . professor a: then it comes down to , you know , to what extent should you make use of information from particular band towards making your decision . And   we 're making in a sense sort of this hard decision that you should you should use everything  with with  equal strength . professor a: And  because in the ideal case we would be going for posterior probabilities , if we had  enough data to really get posterior probabilities and if the if we also had enough data so that it was representative of the test data then we would in fact be doing the right thing to train everything as hard as we can . But  this is something that 's more built up along an idea of robustness from from the beginning and so you don't necessarily want to train everything up towards the phd b: So where did he get his  his tar his  high - level targets about what 's sonorant and what 's not ? grad e: From  canonical mappings  at first phd b: OK . grad e: and then it 's unclear  eh phd b: Using TIMIT ? or using grad e: using TIMIT phd b:  - huh .  we ha we have a kind of iterative training because we do this embedded Viterbi ,  so there is some something that 's suggested , based on the data but it 's it 's not I think it s doesn't seem like it 's quite the same , cuz of this cuz then whatever that alignment is , it 's that for all all bands . professor a: Well no , that 's not quite right , we did actually do them separate tried to do them separately so that would be a little more like what he did . But it 's still not quite the same because then it 's it 's  setting targets based on where you would say the sound begins in a particular band . Might be closer I guess if we did a soft soft target   embedded neural net training like we 've done a few times  f the forward  do the forward calculations to get the gammas and train on those .  what 's next ? phd b: I could say a little bit about w stuff I 've been playing with . You 're playing ? phd b: I  Huh ? professor a: You 're playing ? phd b: Yes , I 'm playing .  so I wanted to do this experiment to see   what happens if we try to  improve the performance of the back - end recognizer for the Aurora task and see how that affects things . And so I had this  I think I sent around last week a this plan I had for an experiment , this matrix where I would take the  the original  the original system . So there 's the original system trained on the mel cepstral features and then com and then  optimize the b HTK system and run that again . So look at the difference there and then  do the same thing for the ICSI - OGI front - end . professor a: What which test set was this ? phd b: This is that I looked at ? professor a:   phd b: So as far as I 've gotten is I 've  been able to go through from beginning to end the  full HTK system for the Italian data and got the same results that  that  Stephane had . So  I started looking to and now I 'm I 'm sort of lookin at the point where I wanna know what should I change in the HTK back - end in order to try to  to improve it . One of the first things I thought of was the fact that they use the same number of states for all of the models professor a:   phd b: and so I went on - line and I  found a pronunciation dictionary for Italian digits professor a:   phd b: and just looked at , you know , the number of phones in each one of the digits .  you know , sort of the canonical way of setting up a an  system is that you use  three states per phone and  so then the the total number of states for a word would just be , you know , the number of phones times three . And so when I did that for the Italian digits , I got a number of states , ranging on the low end from nine to the high end , eighteen . Now you have to really add two to that because in HTK there 's an initial null and a final null so when they use  models that have eighteen states , there 're really sixteen states . And so  their guess of eighteen states seems to be pretty well matched to the two longest words of the Italian digits , the four and five which  , according to my , you know , sort of off the cuff calculation , should have eighteen states each . So my guess  And then if you I I printed out a confusion matrix   for the well - matched case , and it turns out that the longest words are actually the ones that do the best . So my guess about what 's happening is that you know , if you assume a fixed the same amount of training data for each of these digits and a fixed length model for all of them but the actual words for some of them are half as long you really  have , you know , half as much training data for those models . Because if you have a long word and you 're training it to eighteen states ,  you 've got you know , you 've got the same number of Gaussians , you 've gotta train in each case , professor a:   phd b: but for the shorter words , you know , the total number of frames is actually half as many . phd b: So it could be that , you know , for the short words there 's because you have so many states , you just don't have enough data to train all those Gaussians . So  I 'm going to try to  create more word - specific   prototype H M Ms to start training from . professor a: Yeah , it 's not at all uncommon you do worse on long word on short words than long words anyway just because you 're accumulating more evidence for the for the longer word , phd b:   phd b: Yeah so I 'll I 'll , the next experiment I 'm gonna try is to just  you know create  models that seem to be more w matched to my guess about how long they should be . phd b: And as part of that  I wanted to see sort of how the  how these models were coming out , you know , what w when we train up  th you know , the model for \" one \" , which wants to have nine states , you know , what is the  what do the transition probabilities look like in the self - loops , look like in in those models ? And so I talked to Andreas and he explained to me how you can calculate the expected duration of an  just by looking at the transition matrix professor a:   phd b: and so I wrote a little Matlab script that calculates that and so I 'm gonna sort of print those out for each of the words to see what 's happening , you know , how these models are training up , professor a:   I d I did quickly , I did the silence model and and  that 's coming out with about one point two seconds as its average duration and the silence model 's the one that 's used at the beginning and the end of each of the string of digits . And so the S P model , which is what they put in between digits , I I haven't calculated that for that one yet , but  . So they basically their their model for a whole digit string is silence digit , SP , digit , SP blah - blah - blah and then silence at the end . professor a: Are the SP 's optional ?  skip them ? phd b: I have to look at that , but I 'm not sure that they are . Now the one thing about the S P model is really it only has a single s emitting state to it . phd b: So if it 's not optional , you know , it 's it 's not gonna hurt a whole lot professor a: I see . phd b: and it 's tied to the center state of the silence model so it 's not its own  It doesn't require its own training data , professor a:   phd b: So it , it 's pretty good the way that they have it set up , but  i So I wanna play with that a little bit more . I 'm curious about looking at , you know how these models have trained and looking at the expected durations of the models and I wanna compare that in the the well - matched case f to the unmatched case , and see if you can get an idea of just from looking at the durations of these models , you know , what what 's happening . professor a: Yeah , I think that  , as much as you can , it 's good to d sort of not do anything really tricky . professor a: Not do anything that 's really finely tuned , but just sort of eh you know you t you i z phd b: Yeah . professor a: The premise is kind of you have a a good person look at this for a few weeks and what do you come up with ? phd b:   professor a: And  phd b: And Hynek , when I wa told him about this , he had an interesting point , and that was th  the the final models that they end up training up have I think probably something on the order of six Gaussians per state . And Hynek was saying that well , probably in a real application , you wouldn't have enough compute to handle models that are very big or complicated . But you know , it depends on what the actual application is and it 's really hard to know what your limits are in terms of how many Gaussians you can have . professor a: I I I what I thought you were gonna say i but which I was thinking was  where did six come from ? Probably came from the same place eighteen came from . professor a:  that 's another parameter , right ? that that maybe , you know ,  you really want three or nine or phd b: Yeah , yeah . Well one thing  , if I if if I start  reducing the number of states for some of these shorter models that 's gonna reduce the total number of Gaussians . professor a: how much better can you make it ? And  since they 're only simple things there 's nothing that you 're gonna do that is going to blow up the amount of computation phd b:   professor a: if you found that nine was better than six that would be O K , I think , actually . I really wasn't even gonna play with that part of the system yet , professor a:  -  , OK . phd b: I was just gonna change the the t professor a: Yeah , just work with the models , yeah . So  what 's  I guess your plan for You you you guys ' plan for the next next week is just continue on these these same things we 've been talking about for Aurora and phd c: Yeah , I guess we can try to have some kind of new baseline for next week perhaps . And then do other things , play with the spectral subtraction , and retry the MSG and things like that . I think that after all of this   confusion settles down in another some point a little later next year there will be some sort of standard and it 'll get out there and hopefully it 'll have some effect from something that that has  been done by our group of people but  e even if it doesn't there 's there 's go there 'll be standards after that . phd b: Does anybody know how to  run Matlab sort of in batch mode like you c send it s a bunch of commands to run and it gives you the output . Is it possible to do that ? grad e: I I think  Mike tried it phd b: Yeah ? grad e: and he says it 's impossible so he went to Octave . phd c: What is Octave so ? It 's a free software ? grad e: What 's that ?  , Octave ? phd c: Yeah . phd c: And it does the same syntax and everything eh like Matlab , or ? grad e:  i it 's a little behind , it 's the same syntax but it 's a little behind in that Matlab went to these like  you can have cells and you can you can  implement object - oriented type things with Matlab .  Octave doesn't do that yet , so I think you , Octave is kinda like Matlab  four point something or . phd b: If it 'll do like a lot of the basic matrix and vector stuff grad e: The basic stuff , right <doc-sep>professor c: So ,  grad f: so I wanted to discuss digits briefly , but that won't take too long . OK , agenda items , we have digits , What else we got ? phd a: New version of the presegmentation . postdoc b: do we wanna say something about the , an update of the , transcript ? phd g: Yeah , why don't you summarize the professor c: Update on transcripts . phd g: And I guess that includes some the filtering for the , the ASI refs , too . professor c: Filtering for what ? phd g: For the references that we need to go from the the fancy transcripts to the sort of brain - dead . postdoc b: It 'll it 'll be basically it 'll be a re - cap of a meeting that we had jointly this morning . OK well , the , w  as you can see from the numbers on the digits we 're almost done . You know , someone fills out the form and then they 're not at the meeting and so it 's blank . And so , once we 're it 's done it would be very nice to train up a recognizer and actually start working with this data . phd d: So we 'll have a corpus that 's the size of TI - digits ? grad f: And so One particular test set of TI - digits . grad f: So , I I extracted , Ther - there was a file sitting around which people have used here as a test set . It had been randomized and so on phd d:  grad f: and that 's just what I used to generate the order . professor c: So , I 'm impressed by what we could do , Is take the standard training set for TI - digits , train up with whatever , you know , great features we think we have ,  for instance , and then test on  this test set . grad f:  professor c: And presumably  it should do reasonably well on that , and then , presumably , we should go to the distant mike , and it should do poorly . professor c: And then we should get really smart over the next year or two , and it that should get better . grad f: so that the reason it 's not just a transcript is that there 're false starts , and misreads , and miscues and things like that . And so I have a set of scripts and X Waves where you just select the portion , hit R , it tells you what the next one should be , and you just look for that . You know , so it it 'll put on the screen , \" The next set is six nine , nine two two \" . And you find that , and , hit the key and it records it in a file in a particular format . professor c: So is this grad f: And so the the question is , should we have the transcribers do that or should we just do it ? Well , some of us . I 've been do I 've done , eight meetings , something like that , just by hand .  professor c: what what do you think ? postdoc b: My feeling is that we discussed this right before coffee and I think it 's a it 's a fine idea partly because , it 's not un unrelated to their present skill set , but it will add , for them , an extra dimension , it might be an interesting break for them . And also it is contributing to the , c composition of the transcript cuz we can incorporate those numbers directly and it 'll be a more complete transcript . grad f: There is there is professor c: So you think it 's fine to have the transcribers do it ? postdoc b:   grad f: There 's one other small bit , which is just entering the information which at s which is at the top of this form , onto the computer , to go along with the where the digits are recorded automatically . grad f: And so it 's just , you know , typing in name , times time , date , and so on .  , which again either they can do , but it is , you know , firing up an editor , or , again , I can do . postdoc b: And , that , you know , I 'm not , that that one I 'm not so sure if it 's into the the , things that , I , wanted to use the hours for , because the , the time that they 'd be spending doing that they wouldn't be able to be putting more words on . postdoc b: But that 's really your choice , it 's your phd d: So are these two separate tasks that can happen ? Or do they have to happen at the same time before grad f: No they don't have this you have to enter the data before , you do the second task , but they don't have to happen at the same time . grad f: So it 's it 's just I have a file whi which has this information on it , and then when you start using my scripts , for extracting the times , it adds the times at the bottom of the file . And so , it 's easy to create the files and leave them blank , and so actually we could do it in either order . grad f: it 's it 's sort of nice to have the same person do it just as a double - check , to make sure you 're entering for the right person . Yeah just by way of  , a  , order of magnitude , we 've been working with this Aurora ,  data set . And , the best score , on the , nicest part of the data , that is , where you 've got training and test set that are basically the same kinds of noise and so forth , is about ,  I think the best score was something like five percent , error , per digit . So So the The point there , and this is  car noise  ,  things , but but real real situation , phd d:   professor c: well , \" real \" , the  there 's one microphone that 's close , that they have as as this sort of thing , close versus distant .  but in a car , instead of instead of having a projector noise it 's it 's car noise . So , that 's that 's an indication ,  that was with , many sites competing , and this was the very best score and so forth , so . More typical numbers like phd d: Although the models weren't , that good , right ?  , the models are pretty crappy ? professor c: You 're right . I think that we could have done better on the models , but the thing is that we got this this is the kind of typical number , for all of the , things in this task , all of the , languages . Anyway , just an indication once you get into this kind of realm even if you 're looking at connected digits it can be pretty hard . phd d: How did we do on the TI - digits ? grad f: Well the prosodics are so much different s it 's gonna be , strange . grad f: So I 'm I 'm not sure how much of effect that will have . phd d: H how do phd g: What do you mean , the prosodics ? grad f: just what we were talking about with grouping . That with these , the grouping , there 's no grouping at all , and so it 's just the only sort of discontinuity you have is at the beginning and the end . phd g: So what are they doing in Aurora , are they reading actual phone numbers , grad f: Aurora I don't know . phd g: or , a a digit at a time , or ? professor c: I 'm not sure how phd g: Cuz it 's professor c: no , no  it 's connected it 's connected , digits , phd g: Connected . phd g: So there 's also the not just the prosody but the cross the cross - word modeling is probably quite different . phd d: H How grad f: But in TI - digits , they 're reading things like zip codes and phone numbers and things like that , phd g: Right . phd d: do we do on TI - digits ? grad f: so it 's gonna be different . grad f: One and a half percent , two percent , something like that ? professor c: I th no I think we got under a percent , but it was but it 's but  . The very best system that I saw in the literature was a point two five percent or something that somebody had at at Bell Labs , or . It s strikes me that there are more each of them is more informative because it 's so , random , grad f: OK . professor c: But I think a lot of systems sort of get half a percent , or three - quarters a percent , grad f: Right . grad f: But that  it 's really it 's it 's close - talking mikes , no noise , clean signal , just digits , every everything is good . phd g: It 's like the , single cell , you know , it 's the beginning of life , phd d: Pre - prehistory . grad f: OK , so , what I 'll do then is I 'll go ahead and enter , this data . And then , hand off to Jane , and the transcribers to do the actual extraction of the digits . One question I have that that  , we wouldn't know the answer to now but might , do some guessing , but I was talking before about doing some model modeling of arti  , marking of articulatory , features , with overlap and so on . The only thing is I 'm a little concerned that maybe the kind of phenomena , in w i i The reason for doing it is because the the argument is that certainly with conversational speech , the stuff that we 've looked at here before , just doing the simple mapping , from , the phone , to the corresponding features that you could look up in a book , isn't right . In fact there 's these overlapping processes where some voicing some up and then some , you know , some nasality is comes in here , and so forth . But , It could be that when we 're reading digits , because it 's it 's for such a limited set , that maybe maybe that phenomenon doesn't occur as much . Di - an anybody ? Do you have any ? Anybody have any opinion about that , postdoc b: and that people might articulate more , and you that might end up with more a closer correspondence . phd d: Sort of less predictability , grad f: That it 's just postdoc b:   phd d: and You hafta grad f: It 's a Well Would , this corpus really be the right one to even try that on ? phd g: Well it 's definitely true that , when people are , reading , even if they 're re - reading what , they had said spontaneously , that they have very different patterns . phd g: So the fact that they 're reading , first of all , whether they 're reading in a room of , people , or rea you know , just the fact that they 're reading will make a difference . So , may maybe the thing will be do to take some very small subset ,  not have a big , program , but take a small set , subset of the conversational speech and a small subset of the digits , and look and and just get a feeling for it . postdoc b: H That could could be an interesting design , too , cuz then you 'd have the com the comparison of the , predictable speech versus the less predictable speech professor c: Cuz I don't think anybody is , I at least , I don't know , of anybody , well , I don't know , the answers . postdoc b: and maybe you 'd find that it worked in , in the , case of the pr of the , non - predictable . phd d: Hafta think about , the particular acoustic features to mark , too , because , some things , they wouldn't be able to mark , like , you know , tense lax . grad f: M I think we can get Ohala in to , give us some advice on that . postdoc b: Also I thought you were thinking of a much more restricted set of features , that professor c: Yeah , but I I I I was , like he said , I was gonna bring John in and ask John what he thought . It should be such that if you , if you , if you had o  , all of the features , determined that you that you were  ch have chosen , that that would tell you , in the steady - state case , the phone . grad f: Even , I guess with vowels that would be pretty hard , wouldn't it ? To identify actually , you know , which one it is ? postdoc b: It would seem to me that the points of articulation would be m more , g  ,  that 's I think about articulatory features , I think about , points of articulation , which means , rather than vowels . phd d: Points of articulation ? What do you mean ? postdoc b: So , is it , bilabial or dental or is it , you know , palatal . phd g: Well it 's also , there 's , really a difference between , the pronunciation models in the dictionary , and , the pronunciations that people produce . And , so , You get , some of that information from Steve 's work on the on the labeling professor c: Right . That maybe , although I think the meeting context is great , that he has transcriptions that give you the actual phone sequence . And you can go from not from that to the articulatory features , but that would be a better starting point for marking , the gestural features , then , data where you don't have that , because , we you wanna know , both about the way that they 're producing a certain sound , and what kinds of , you know what kinds of , phonemic , differences you get between these , transcribed , sequences and the dictionary ones . professor c: Well you might be right that mi might be the way at getting at , what I was talking about , but the particular reason why I was interested in doing that was because I remember , when that happened , and , John Ohala was over here and he was looking at the spectrograms of the more difficult ones . One you know , one is going from a dictionary pronunciation of something , like , \" gonna see you tomorrow \" , grad f: And Or \" gonta \" . phd g: it could be \" going to \" or \" gonna \" or \" gonta s \" you know . And , that it would be nice to have these , intermediate , or these some these reduced pronunciations that those transcribers had marked or to have people mark those as well . phd g: Because , it 's not , that easy to go from the , dictionary , word pronuncia the dictionary phone pronunciation , to the gestural one without this intermediate or a syllable level kind of , representation . grad f: Well I don't think Morgan 's suggesting that we do that , though . professor c: Yeah , I I I 'm jus at the moment of course we 're just talking about what , to provide as a tool for people to do research who have different ideas about how to do it . So for instance , you might have someone who just has a wor has words with states , and has   , comes from articulatory gestures to that . But  , grad f: But What I 'm imagining is a score - like notation , where each line is a particular feature . grad f: so you would say , you know , it 's voiced through here , and so you have label here , and you have nas nasal here , and , they they could be overlapping in all sorts of bizarre ways that don't correspond to the timing on phones . professor c:  this is the kind of reason why I remember when at one of the Switchboard , workshops , that  when we talked about doing the transcription project , Dave Talkin said , \" can't be done \" . professor c: He was he was , what what he meant was that this isn't , you know , a sequence of phones , and when you actually look at Switchboard that 's , not what you see , and , you know . It , grad f: And in in fact the inter - annotator agreement was not that good , right ? On the harder ones ? professor c: yeah  it was phd g: It depends how you look at it , and I I understand what you 're saying about this , kind of transcription exactly , professor c: Yeah . phd g: because I 've seen you know , where does the voicing bar start and so forth . phd g: All I 'm saying is that , it is useful to have that the transcription of what was really said , and which syllables were reduced .  , if you 're gonna add the features it 's also useful to have some level of representation which is , is a reduced it 's a pronunciation variant , that currently the dictionaries don't give you professor c:   phd g: because if you add them to the dictionary and you run recognition , you , you add confusion . phd d: So it would be it would be great if we had , either these kind of , labelings on , the same portion of Switchboard that Steve marked , or , Steve 's type markings on this data , with these . phd g: And Steve 's type is fairly it 's not that slow , I dunno exactly what the , timing was , but . professor c: Yeah u I don't disagree with it the on the only thing is that , What you actually will end en end up with is something , i it 's all compromised , right , so , the string that you end up with isn't , actually , what happened . But it 's it 's the best compromise that a group of people scratching their heads could come up with to describe what happened . And it 's more accurate than the than the dictionary or , if you 've got a pronunciation  lexicon that has three or four , grad f: The word . professor c: this might be have been the fifth one that you tr that you pruned or whatever , phd d: So it 's like a continuum . phd g: an and in some places it would fill in , So the kinds of gestural features are not everywhere . phd g: So there are some things that you don't have access to either from your ear or the spectrogram , phd d:   phd g: but you know what phone it was and that 's about all you can all you can say . phd g: And then there are other cases where , nasality , voicing phd d: It 's basically just having , multiple levels of of , information and marking , on the signal . grad f: Well the other difference is that the the features , are not synchronous , phd g: Right . phd g: Th - there 'll be no way for you to actually mark what was said completely by features . grad f: Well not with our current system but you could imagine designing a system , that the states were features , rather than phones . phd g: And i if you 're Well , we we 've probably have a separate , discussion of ,  of whether you can do that . postdoc b: That 's Well , isn't that I thought that was , well but that wasn't that kinda the direction ? grad f: Yeah . postdoc b: I thought professor c: Yeah , so  , what , what where this is , I I want would like to have something that 's useful to people other than those who are doing the specific kind of research I have in mind , so it should be something broader . But , The but  where I 'm coming from is , we 're coming off of stuff that Larry Saul did with with , John Dalan and Muzim Rahim in which , they , have , a m a multi - band system that is , trained through a combination of gradient learning an and EM , to  , estimate , the , value for m for for a particular feature . And this is part of a larger , image that John Dalan has about how the human brain does it in which he 's sort of imagining that , individual frequency channels are coming up with their own estimate , of of these , these kinds of something like this . And the the th this particular image , of how thi how it 's done , is that , then given all of these estimates at that level , there 's a level above it , then which is is making , some kind of sound unit classification such as , you know , phone and and , you know . But that that 's sort of what I was imagining doing , and but it 's still open within that whether you would have an intermediate level in which it was actually phones , or not .  , but , Again , I wouldn't wanna , wouldn't want what we we produced to be so , know , local in perspective that it it was matched , what we were thinking of doing one week , And and , and , you know , what you 're saying is absolutely right . That , that if we , can we should put in , another level of , of description there if we 're gonna get into some of this low - level stuff . phd d: Well , you know ,   if we 're talking about , having the , annotators annotate these kinds of features , it seems like , You know , you The the question is , do they do that on , meeting data ? Or do they do that on , Switchboard ? grad f: That 's what I was saying , postdoc b: W Well it seems like you could do both . postdoc b: I was thinking that it would be interesting , to do it with respect to , parts of Switchboard anyway , in terms of , professor c:   postdoc b:  partly to see , if you could , generate first guesses at what the articulatory feature would be , based on the phone representation at that lower level . phd d: Well cuz the yeah , and then also , if you did it on Switchboard , you would have , the full continuum of transcriptions . phd d: You 'd have it , from the lowest level , the ac acoustic features , then you 'd have the , you know , the phonetic level that Steve did , postdoc b:   phd g: it is telephone band , so , the bandwidth might be phd d: It 'd be a complete , set then . So  i we 'll see wha how much we can , get the people to do , and how much money we 'll have and all this sort of thing , phd g: Yeah . phd d: But it it might be good to do what Jane was saying  , you know , seed it , with , guesses about what we think the features are , based on , you know , the phone or Steve 's transcriptions or something . grad f: Alright , so based on the phone transcripts they would all be synchronous , but then you could imagine , nudging them here and there . professor c: Well I think what  I 'm I 'm a l little behind in what they 're doing , now , and , the stuff they 're doing on Switchboard now . But I think that , Steve and the gang are doing , something with an automatic system first and then doing some adjustment . So  that 's probably the right way to go anyway , is to is to start off with an automatic system with a pretty rich pronunciation dictionary that , that , you know , tries , to label it all . postdoc b: So in in our case you 'd think about us s starting with maybe the regular dictionary entry , and then ? Or would we professor c: Well , regular dictionary , this is a pretty rich dictionary . It 's got , got a fair number of pronunciations in it postdoc b: But phd d: Or you could start from the if we were gonna , do the same set , of sentences that Steve had , done , we could start with those transcriptions . phd g: the problem is when you run , if you run a regular dictionary , even if you have variants , in there , which most people don't , you don't always get , out , the actual pronunciations , phd d: Yeah . phd g: so that 's why the human transcriber 's giving you the that pronunciation , postdoc b: Yeah . phd g: and so y they they I thought that they were professor c: Is that what they 're doing ? grad f: They are . professor c: Yeah , so I think that i i we also don't have , we 've got a good start on it , but we don't have a really good , meeting , recorder or recognizer or transcriber or anything yet , so . So ,  another way to look at this is to , is to , do some stuff on Switchboard which has all this other , stuff to it . professor c: And then , As we get , further down the road and we can do more things ahead of time , we can , do some of the same things to the meeting data . postdoc b: And I 'm and these people might they they are , s most of them are trained with IPA . professor c: Yeah postdoc b: They 'd be able to do phonetic - level coding , or articulatory . phd d: Are they busy for the next couple years , or ? postdoc b: Well , you know ,  they , they they 're interested in continuing working with us , so  I , and this would be up their alley , so , we could when the when you d meet with , with John Ohala and find , you know what taxonomy you want to apply , then , they 'd be , good to train onto it . phd g: It might be grad f:  you 'd you 'd want models for spreading . phd g: I was thinking it might be n phd d: Of the f acoustic features ? grad f: Yeah . phd g: Well it might be neat to do some , phonetic , features on these , nonword words . Are are these kinds of words that people never the \" huh \"s and the \"  \"s and the \" huh \" and the  These k No , I 'm serious . phd g: And some of them are , yeah , \"  - huh \"s , and \"  \"s , and , \"  ! \" \"  \" \" OK \" , \"  \" Grunts , that might be interesting . professor c: new version of , presegmentation ? phd a: oh yeah , I worked a little bit on the on the presegmentation to to get another version which does channel - specific , speech - nonspeech detection . And , what I did is I used some normalized features which , look in into the which is normalized energy , energy normalized by the mean over the channels and by the , minimum over the , other . And to to , to , yeah , to normalize also loudness and and modified loudness and things and that those special features actually are in my feature vector . phd a: And , and , therefore to be able to , somewhat distinguish between foreground and background speech in in the different in each channel . And , eh , I tested it on on three or four meetings and it seems to work , well yeah , fairly well , I I would say . grad f: So I I understand that 's what you were saying about your problem with , minimum . phd a: Yeah yeah , then I I did some some some things like that , postdoc b: Interesting . phd a: as there there are some some problems in , when , in the channel , there they the the speaker doesn't doesn't talk much or doesn't talk at all . Then , the , yeah , there are there are some problems with with with n with normalization , and , then , there the system doesn't work at all . So , I 'm I 'm glad that there is the the digit part , where everybody is forced to say something , professor c: Right . And , the thing is I I , then the evaluation of of the system is a little bit hard , as I don't have any references . phd a: Yeah , that 's the one one wh where I do the training on so I can't do the evaluation on So the thing is , can the transcribers perhaps do some , some some meetings in in terms of speech - nonspeech in in the specific channels ? grad f:  . postdoc b: Well , I have phd d: Well won't you have that from their transcriptions ? postdoc b: Well , OK , so , now we need grad f: No , cuz we need is really tight . postdoc b: so , I think I might have done what you 're requesting , though I did it in the service of a different thing . postdoc b: I have thirty minutes that I 've more tightly transcribed with reference to individual channels . postdoc b: And I could And And grad f: Hopefully that 's not the same meeting that we did . postdoc b: So , e so the , you know , we have the , th they transcribe as if it 's one channel with these with the slashes to separate the overlapping parts . postdoc b: And then we run it through then it then I 'm gonna edit it and I 'm gonna run it through channelize which takes it into Dave Gelbart 's form format . postdoc b: And then you have , all these things split across according to channel , and then that means that , if a person contributed more than once in a given , overlap during that time bend that that two parts of the utterance end up together , it 's the same channel , phd a: OK . postdoc b: and then I took his tool , and last night for the first thirty minutes of one of these transcripts , I , tightened up the , boundaries on individual speakers ' channels , phd a: OK . postdoc b: cuz his his interface allows me to have total flexibility in the time tags across the channels . phd a: so , yeah yeah , that that that 's great , but what would be nice to have some more meetings , not just one meeting to to be sure that that , there is a system , phd d: So , current This week . grad f: Yeah , so if we could get a couple meetings done with that level of precision I think that would be a good idea .  , how how m much time so the meetings vary in length , what are we talking about in terms of the number of minutes you 'd like to have as your as your training set ? phd a: It seems to me that it would be good to have , a few minutes from from different meetings , so . postdoc b: OK , now you 're saying different meetings because of different speakers or because of different audio quality or both or ? phd a: Both both . professor c: Yeah , we don't have that much variety in meetings yet ,  we have this meeting and the feature meeting and we have a couple others that we have  , couple examples of . grad e: Even probably with the gains differently will affect it , you mean phd a: not really as professor c: Poten - potentially . phd g: We can try running we haven't done this yet because , Andreas an is is gonna move over the SRI recognizer . phd g: cuz we 're running the evals and I just don't have machine time there . But , once that 's moved over , hopefully in a a couple days , then , we can take , what Jane just told us about as , the presegmented , the the segmentations that you did , at level eight or som at some , threshold that Jane , tha right , and try doing , forced alignment . phd g: And if it 's good , then that will that may give you a good boundary . Of course if it 's good , we don't then we 're we 're fine , phd a: Yeah . M phd g: but , I don't know yet whether these , segments that contain a lot of pauses around the words , will work or not . phd a: I I would quite like to have some manually transcribed references for for the system , as I 'm not sure if if it 's really good to compare with with some other automatic , found boundaries . postdoc b: Well , no , if we were to start with this and then tweak it h manually , would that that would be OK ? phd a: Yeah . phd g: but , I would have maybe a transciber , look at the result of a forced alignment and then adjust those . phd g: If they 're horrible it won't help at all , but they might not be horrible . postdoc b: How many minutes would you want from  , we could easily , get a section , you know , like say a minute or so , from every meeting that we have so f from the newer ones that we 're working on , everyone that we have . phd a: If it 's not the first minute of of the meeting , that that 's OK with me , but , in in the first minute , Often there are some some strange things going on which which aren't really , well , for , which which aren't re re really good . What what I 'd quite like , perhaps , is , to have , some five minutes of of of different meetings , so . postdoc b: And , then I wanted to ask you just for my inter information , then , would you , be trai cuz I don't quite unders so , would you be training then , the segmenter so that , it could , on the basis of that , segment the rest of the meeting ? So , if I give you like five minutes is the idea that this would then be applied to , to , providing tighter time bands ? phd a: I I could do a a retraining with that , yeah . phd a: That 's but but I hope that I I don't need to do it . phd a: I 'm I 'm not sure , but , for for for those three meetings whi which I which I did , it seems to be , quite well , but , there are some some as I said some problems with the lapel mike , but , perhaps we can do something with with cross - correlations to , to get rid of the of those . Well well what I want to do is to to look into cross - correlations for for removing those , false overlaps . phd g: Are the , wireless , different than the wired , mikes , at all ?  , have you noticed any difference ? phd a: I 'm I 'm not sure , if if there are any wired mikes in those meetings , or , I have have to loo have a look at them but , I 'm I 'm I think there 's no difference between , phd g: So it 's just the lapel versus everything else ? phd a: Yeah . postdoc b: OK , so then , if that 's five minutes per meeting we 've got like twelve minutes , twelve meetings , roughly , that I 'm that I 've been working with , then professor c: Of of of the meetings that you 're working with , how many of them are different , tha phd a: No . professor c: are there any of them that are different than , these two meetings ? postdoc b: Well oh wa in terms of the speakers or the conditions or the ? professor c: Yeah , speakers . postdoc b: just from what I 've seen , there are some where , you 're present or not present , and , then then you have the difference between the networks group and this group phd a: Yeah , I know , some of the NSA meetings , yeah . professor c: Do you have any of Jerry 's meetings in your , pack , er , postdoc b: no . professor c: No ? postdoc b: We could ,  you you recorded one last week or so . professor c: and and having as much variety for speaker certainly would be a big part of that I think . postdoc b: OK , so if I , OK , included include , OK , then , if I were to include all together samples from twelve meetings that would only take an hour and I could get the transcribers to do that right  , what  is , that would be an hour sampled , and then they 'd transcribe those that hour , right ? That 's what I should do ? professor c: Yeah . So they get it into the multi - channel format and then adjust the timebands so it 's precise . professor c: So that should be faster than the ten times kind of thing , postdoc b: Absolutely . postdoc b: Oh gosh , well , last night , I did about half an hour in , three hours , which is not , terrific , professor c: Yeah . postdoc b: but , anyway , it 's an hour and a half per professor c: Yeah . phd a: Do the transcribers actually start wi with , transcribing new meetings , or are they ? postdoc b: Well ,  they 're still working they still have enough to finish that I haven't assigned a new meeting , phd a: OK . postdoc b: but the next , m m I was about to need to assign a new meeting and I was going to take it from one of the new ones , phd a: OK . phd g: So they 're really running out of , data , prett  that 's good . professor c: They 're running out of data unless we s make the decision that we should go over and start , transcribing the other set . postdoc b: And so I was in the process of like editing them but this is wonderful news . postdoc b: We funded the experiment with ,  also we were thinking maybe applying that that to getting the , Yeah , that 'll be , very useful to getting the overlaps to be more precise all the way through . So , Liz , and and Don , and I met this morning , in the BARCO room , with the lecture hall , professor c: OK . postdoc b: and this afternoon , it drifted into the afternoon , concerning this issue of , the , well there 's basically the issue of the interplay between the transcript format and the processing that , they need to do for , the SRI recognizer . And , well , so , I mentioned the process that I 'm going through with the data , so , you know , I get the data back from the transcri Well , s  , metaphorically , get the data back from the transcriber , and then I , check for simple things like spelling errors and things like that . And , I 'm going to be doing a more thorough editing , with respect to consistency of the conventions . And , then , I run it through , the channelize program to get it into the multi - channel format , OK . And the , what we discussed this morning , I would summarize as saying that , these units that result , in a a particular channel and a particular timeband , at at that level , vary in length . But it 's really an empirical question , whether the units we get at this point through , just that process I described might be sufficient for them . So , as a first pass through , a first chance without having to do a lot of hand - editing , what we 're gonna do , is , I 'll run it through channelize , give them those data after I 've done the editing process and be sure it 's clean . And I can do that , pretty quickly , with just , that minimal editing , without having to hand - break things . postdoc b: And then we 'll see if the units that we 're getting , with the at that level , are sufficient . And if they do need to be further broken down then maybe it just be piece - wise , maybe it won't be the whole thing . So , that 's that 's what we were discussing , this morning as far as I Among phd g: Right . postdoc b: also we discussed some adaptational things , phd g: Then lots of postdoc b: so it 's like , phd g: Right . postdoc b:  You know I hadn't , incorporated , a convention explicitly to handle acronyms , for example , but if someone says , PZM it would be nice to have that be directly interpretable from , the transcript what they said , professor c:   It 's like y it 's and so , I 've I 've incorporated also convention , with that but that 's easy to handle at the post editing phase , and I 'll mention it to , transcribers for the next phase but that 's OK .  , and also I 'll be , encoding , as I do my post - editing , the , things that are in curly brackets , which are clarificational material . So , it 's gonna be either a gloss or it 's gonna be a vocal sound like a , laugh or a cough , or , so forth . Or a non - vocal sound like a doors door - slam , and that can be easily done with a , you know , just a one little additional thing in the , in the general format . phd g: Yeah we j we just needed a way to , strip , you know , all the comments , all the things th the that linguist wants but the recognizer can't do anything with .  , but to keep things that we mapped to like reject models , or , you know , mouth noise , or , cough . And then there 's this interesting issue Jane brought up which I hadn't thought about before but I was , realizing as I went through the transcripts , that there are some noises like , well the good example was an inbreath , where a transcriber working from , the mixed , signal , doesn't know whose breath it is , grad f: Right . phd g: and they 've been assigning it to someone that may or may not be correct . And what we do is , if it 's a breath sound , you know , a sound from the speaker , we map it , to , a noise model , like a mouth - noise model in the recognizer , and , yeah , it probably doesn't hurt that much once in a while to have these , but , if they 're in the wrong channel , that 's , not a good idea . And then there 's also , things like door - slams that 's really in no one 's channel , they 're like it 's in the room . phd g: And  , Jane had this nice , idea of having , like an extra ,  couple tiers , grad f: An extra channel . So if they hear a breath and they don't know who breath it is it 's better to put it in that channel than to put it in the speaker 's channel because maybe it was someone else 's breath , or  , so I think that 's a good you can always clean that up , post - processing . phd g: So a lot of little details , but I think we 're , coming to some kinda closure , on that . So the idea is then , Don can take , Jane 's post - processed channelized version , and , with some scripts , you know , convert that to to a reference for the recognizer and we can , can run these . So when that 's , ready you know , as soon as that 's ready , and as soon as the recognizer is here we can get , twelve hours of force - aligned and recognized data . And , you know , start , working on it , postdoc b: And phd g: so we 're , I dunno a coup a week or two away I would say from , if if that process is automatic once we get your post - process , transcript . I 'm just hoping that the units that are provided in that way , will be sufficient cuz I would save a lot of , time , dividing things . Just from I dunno how long were you did one ? grad e: I saw a couple , around twenty seconds , and that was just without looking too hard for it , so , I would imagine that there might be some that are longer . postdoc b: Well n One question , e w would that be a single speaker or is that multiple speakers overlapping ? grad e: No . No , but if we 're gonna segment it , like if there 's one speaker in there , that says \" OK \" or something , right in the middle , it 's gonna have a lot of dead time around it , phd g: Right . It 's not the it 's not the fact that we can't process a twenty second segment , it 's the fact that , there 's twenty seconds in which to place one word in the wrong place grad e: so it 's not postdoc b: Yeah . phd g: You know , if if someone has a very short utterance there , and that 's where , we , might wanna have this individual , you know , ha have your pre pre - process input . phd a: I I I thought that perhaps the transcribers could start then from the those mult multi - channel , speech - nonspeech detections , if they would like to . phd g: So that 's probably what will happen , but we 'll try it this way and see . We 'll probably get lots of errors because of the cross - talk , and , noises and things . postdoc b: Oh I wanted to ask one thing , the microphones the new microphones , professor c: Yeah ? K . postdoc b: when do we get ,  ? grad f: they said it would take about a week . phd g: So what happens to our old microphones ? professor c: They go where old microphones go . grad f:  phd g: Do we give them to someone , or ? grad f: Well the only thing we 're gonna have extra , for now , phd g: We don't have more receivers , we just have grad f: Right , we don so the only thing we 'll have extra now is just the lapel . Since , what I decided to do , on Morgan 's suggestion , was just get two , new microphones , and try them out . grad f: Since they 're they 're like two hundred bucks a piece , we won't , at least try them out . phd d: So it 's a replacement for this headset mike ? grad f: Yep . phd d: What 's the , style of the headset ? grad f: It 's , it 's by Crown , and it 's one of these sort of mount around the ear thingies , and , when I s when I mentioned that we thought it was uncomfortable he said it was a common problem with the Sony . grad f: And I checked on the web , and every site I went to , raved about this particular mike . It 's apparently comfortable and stays on the head well , so we 'll see if it 's any good . postdoc b: You said it was used by aerobics instructors ? grad f:  Yep . professor c: For the recor for the record Adam is not a paid employee or a consultant of Crown . professor c: I said \" For the record Adam is is not a paid consultant or employee of Crown \" . grad f: The P Z Ms are Crown , aren't they ? professor c: Yeah . professor c: So if we go to a workshop about all this this it 's gonna be a meeting about meetings about meetings . professor c: Oh , yeah , what Which 'll be the meeting about the meeting about the meeting . grad f: Cuz then it would be a meeting about the meeting about the meeting about meetings . phd a: S s grad f: Pause between the lines , remember ? grad e: Excuse me "

        "Query": "What were the thoughts of the Project Manager and the Industrial Designer regarding the energy source for the project, and why was the idea of using solar energy rejected?",
        "Summary": "The Project Manager expressed a preference for a disposable remote control that does not have a battery compartment and relies on predetermined battery life. The idea of using permanent batteries was also proposed. On the other hand, the Industrial Designer initially suggested rechargeable energy sources and later proposed a combination of solar and conventional batteries. This would allow the remote to use light as an energy source during the day and switch to the battery at night. However, the convenience of solar energy at night and the cost implications were questioned by the Industrial Designer.",
        "Article": "And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly . industrial designer: project manager: user interface: industrial designer: Well , I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and  user interface:  . B did you send us an email about this ? project manager: not yet , user interface: industrial designer: project manager: but if you want user interface: Yeah , we we received an email about this  d designs . project manager: Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ? industrial designer: user interface: Ah it's Okay . marketing: I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . user interface: 'Kay , we can project manager: So there are so we have three user interface: So there are three kinds of designs , that's all . project manager: So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? Any any volunteer ? industrial designer: I think our  responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager . user interface: Are you using the you are doing the in industrial designer: Yeah I I'm I'm Well , maybe we have okay so I industrial design . It was a little confusion about my  project manager: user interface: Ah industrial designer: but it's alright . industrial designer: Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done project manager: industrial designer: and what are your ideas about the project manager: About the design or Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ? industrial designer: Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess . industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno I project manager: And of course it should not be very costly . industrial designer: Well I I think that Norman and I would think about  the technical points and  we should discuss it in the next meeting , or user interface: Need to collect information .  , what is most important in a in a remote control ? What is the most important function aspect ?  . project manager: You won't user interface: Or or you can say for example ,  I want  to list all the programme tonight . Y you know , instead of  remote control it's doing the some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . project manager: I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . user interface: No , because no , project manager: S user interface: it's not very a lot . industrial designer: I I think if you want t to choose  from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use  w  I dunno marketing: I'm a okay . marketing:  the main  function of remote control is to have something in the hand project manager: In the hand . marketing: If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog user interface: Yeah . marketing: if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . industrial designer: marketing:  we have some or something , different technology but project manager: This is it's user interface: Yeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that  there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea project manager: industrial designer: but I I think that technically it would be  a little bit   more tricky to to achieve this than just to user interface: No . They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . user interface: And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons . industrial designer: Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to  navigate  through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so project manager: This is good idea . Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? industrial designer: Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen user interface: Good idea . industrial designer: and just  with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f user interface: I think I think that will be revol revolutionary . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: Because all the T_V_  the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . So I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff user interface: Okay . project manager: So we have five minutes to user interface: Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . project manager: Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we industrial designer: user interface: Five minutes . marketing: And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of user interface: Okay . marketing: So , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark  some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . industrial designer: Oh right so user interface: Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: Be before before writing you can  sit and that says what we what we said user interface:  . So so the most functional des  the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . The user can choose w which one they want , right ? industrial designer: Yeah , by content or by channel , user interface: By content or by channel . user interface: Okay , so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content . industrial designer: I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so user interface: Okay . And  industrial designer: I think that's the the things to do user interface: The main thing . user interface: So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get  the funct this is the functional designer ? That's the first aspect . project manager: So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ? And we'll discuss the other other aspects <doc-sep>industrial designer: How are you today ? How was your business trip to Boston ? project manager:  well , actually I didn't go , didn't feel like it . user interface: You have the same message of  Windows cannot  marketing: user interface: sen oh stand-by . user interface: project manager:  I'm sure you've had a mail from our account manager about it .  Ruud is here as the Marketing Expert , Roo is here as the User Interface Designer and Sebastian is here  in the role of Industrial Designer . project manager:  we're going to do    a little tool training  for the tools we are going to use  during  the meetings we are going to have here .  then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan ,  and we will have a discussion .  is there any room for a little presentation ?  maybe during the discussion  section ? project manager: There is ? Yeah , there is . user interface: project manager:  okay , this new product we are are g are going to develop ,  it's a remote control , a television remote control . Those are kind of easy    goals ,  and I'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop .  we will discuss  later on more ideas about  how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things .  we are going to use a a pred a project method  during  this development ,  which consists of three different design stages .  the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design ,  all of these stages   mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then  meet to discuss our   the the the progressions , yes . project manager:  the first stage , the functional design  we are going to search for the user requirements , and we will  make a specific  specification of that .  the second is the technical functional design ,  what effect should the remote have ? Well in this case control t the the television I think .  to  presentate , to show us  a file you'll need to  place it in your project documents folder , which is on your desktop , at least it should be . project manager: sensors , so do not grab it here , but a lit more a little bit more to the  to the end .  you can insert a new  slide or or white-board   file  by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button . user interface: or should we only use it in the in the meetings ? project manager: Yeah , in the meetings , only in the meetings .  to  oh well , I'm I wrote down the documents  should be in the project documents folder if you want to  discuss it with us .  as a little training  I will ask Ruud first to draw   your own animal on a new slide  with  a different colour and a different line width than the one  now selected . marketing: project manager:  Roo , could you do the same please ? But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width . Well , it looked more than a bunny than a cat , but it works , industrial designer: Well , I'll give it a try . user interface: project manager: Okay , so  you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to .  user interface: industrial designer: marketing: project manager: we  we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold  , if there is market  interest ,  in in more than one country . And  the production costs should not be more than  twelve Euro fifty , so we should keep that in mind by  w w during the development ,  because  , well , those are important numbers . industrial designer: Yes ,  I have some technical  issues which I would like to present to you  before we start the discussion , because  there might be some  project manager: Limitations . I would like to think about  the implementation of  of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities . So if someone of you comes up with  ideas ,  I'll try to translate them in technical functions , but  there might be some impossibilities .  and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product . industrial designer: I have some  initial ideas about some things  which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming  discussion . user interface: And for a cell phone ? industrial designer: Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them . We're not  living in the  nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not  project manager: industrial designer: is not really  hot  technical stuff anymore . user interface: But Yeah , but the infrared , it's  , well , a little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that . user interface: But all the T_V_s are  equipped with infrared , so industrial designer: But it's cost-effective . user interface: Or you shou sh use a industrial designer: So marketing: user interface: you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote . So that's just my role , I'll just  give you  everybody some technical input , and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what  the product should be and how it should look , project manager: Yeah . project manager: Okay , so the the main por  the main points you are  telling us are focus on the inter  operability , industrial designer: Yes , project manager: and industrial designer: so one thing  one remote control should  control one or more  pieces of equipment , project manager: Okay , and and  industrial designer: and the way of communicating with these equipments .  there are other things like  how to make it trendy , which is I think   most  Ru  Ruud's  role . project manager: H how do you think the remote should  function for the user ? user interface: Well , I had a few  things in mind .  well , the interoperability , just like  Sebastian said ,  the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different   Yeah  , what is it , devices ? project manager: Yep . user interface:  so i i I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in  a store . user interface: It's not for  for  for  Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product , project manager: Okay , so we're we're going business to consumer , user interface: right ? project manager: not we're we're it's not a user interface: Yeah , I do I don't know that . industrial designer: We're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ? project manager: No . industrial designer: we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad  public , so it should fit to every device . project manager:  Ruud , y do you agree ? marketing: Yeah , I think I think they're right , yeah . user interface:  Well , the techni fu technical function  what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the T_V_ . user interface: Well , that's just the fu the technical function is pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task  as an  as an  device .  but furthermore industrial designer: And you you see  the buttons as a as a means of doing this ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Or are there any o other controls ? user interface: Yeah , or maybe you want a touch-screen or industrial designer: Are there only any other cont Well , user interface: But industrial designer: I I've seen these remote controls with  this little stick  which you can move forward , sidewords . And  it's very easy for a user to to switch user interface: They're very vu vulnerable . industrial designer: to to switch b  between  channels or  change  between tracks on a on a C_D_ , on on a chapters , you know , on a D_V_D_ player .  point at a T_V_ , I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_ , industrial designer: user interface: Yeah , just don't even point it , so in that case infrared should  maybe  be restriction to that . project manager:  industrial designer:  is that  are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ? So when you're not able to point at the device  the range is very limited . For T_V_ , you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T_V_ , so I don't think think the range should be a problem to that , industrial designer: user interface: but if you want to  get it working with a radio , and you're in outside your garden with just one  speaker , then maybe the range should be  industrial designer: project manager: Okay , gentlemen ,   just a reminder , we d we have five minutes left for this meeting industrial designer: Okay . user interface:  You should able to feel the buttons without  it mis  you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons , so it should be as user interface  for feeling should be  good to understand . user interface: And of course you don't always know where all buttons are , so it should be visible al  in dark too . user interface: So when it's dark project manager: user interface: Those are two really  user interface project manager:  I'll write down glow in the dark . industrial designer: Do do you project manager:  do you have anything already w  ab idea about how the market  will respond to the such a product ? Or what we should take  in account when developing such a product ? marketing:  I think most most things have already been said , like  control multiple devices . project manager: Because ? marketing:  well , he said about n abo what he said about pointing . Okay , Sebastian , did you have any other ideas ? industrial designer:  well yes , I had ,  about three minutes ago , project manager: user interface: industrial designer: but I've seem to forget them forgot them . industrial designer:   would it be nice for a user to have display on this  remote control , on which you can see functions ? Which makes it easier to operate it . Well , maybe I  but it it can be quite simple , industrial designer: I I don't know . project manager: Yeah , yeah , okay , because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product . project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: Well , that's more project manager: twelve Euro fifty , yeah . I think the the financial part of this project  implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product . project manager: So  maybe we could  for example  only light the buttons that are   applicable at that moment or user interface: But  Necessary , yeah . user interface: 'Cause I think Bluetooth  industrial designer: It's use  a lot of  project manager: Well does it ? user interface: Yeah , I know it from the cell phone .  industrial designer: Well , cell phones have  integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it's it seems to work  quite okay . user interface: But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day .  next meeting starts in thirty minutes and  , well , you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it <doc-sep>project manager: I figured with the spam thing , if you can't beat it , join in . user interface: marketing: user interface: That's the kind of spam that everybody likes to receive . project manager: Are you ready ? Okay , right , well , I take it that you are all ready now .  which was we got together just to basically decide on well to talk about what it is that we were actually  supposed to be doing , marketing: project manager: and who we all are and stuff like that ,  get bit more of an idea together of what's going on .  what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is  now that we know what it is that we are doing , now we know that it's a T_V_ remote and stuff and you guys have just been off doing some some  R_ and D_ for that , that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before , user interface: marketing:  yeah , we're gonna hear your  th three little presentations , marketing: project manager: whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want . Do you have any preference  of order ? project manager:  I'd like to  hear marketing: project manager: o I'd like to hear who's g who's on the  from from  Catherine actually first . I want what I'd like to hear about is  if we've finally decided on  what sort of energy we're gonna be using and industrial designer: marketing: Batteries . project manager: It's just that yeah , let's let's hear from you first . industrial designer: Where is that thing ? user interface: Okay , it's  marketing: It's here . industrial designer:  so  for the energy sources we can have a basic battery , a hand dynamo which is which was used  in the fifties for torches , if you remember that kind of which wouldn't be v wouldn't be v v project manager: I don't think any of us remember the fifties . marketing: industrial designer: You can have a kinetic provision of energy , which is used on some watches these days . industrial designer: Or you can use solar cells , but I'm not sure about that indoors , really , but user interface: Well , there's sometimes combinations , like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power . project manager: Do sol solar panel things , do they have to work from the sun or can they work from a light bulb ? marketing:  . user interface:  I think , it has to be on the on the solar energy , but I don't know . industrial designer: And  if we want something fancier , I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice , marketing:  . industrial designer: For the case of the remotes itself ,  they can be a general case , which is just a flat one . You can have  a curved one or a double curved one , if you know what  , so project manager: What's a double curved one ? industrial designer: You know , kind of more ergonomic , that kind of suits the palm of your hand , that kind of thing . industrial designer: So  then the case material itself , so it can be   either plastic or latex ,  rubber , wood , or titanium . And th for each of them you have  cases where for example titanium , you can't use it for if you if we're choosing a double curved case , we can't choose titanium . And if we are choosing  solar cells then we can't choose latex for the case material , so we just have to take that into account . And I think we discussed earlier on the R_ S_ I_ problem thing , so we could  project manager: So that might be an idea of using the rubber , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: but then it should , you know user interface: Let's have a squeezable remote . And also it doesn't break as easily maybe , project manager: when a T_V_ programme's got one industrial designer: I dunno user interface: project manager: watching the match and your team's just lost , you can fuzz it across the room and it'll bounce off the wall back at you . marketing: I think rubber's project manager: Rubber , we're all we're all going we're all liking that idea ? You think you can market that ? marketing: But after my after my fashion thing , I think you'll realise that rubber is more project manager: Ooh , we like rubber , ooh . And then there are the push-buttons , so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels , like you have on a mouse ,  or you could have  L_C_D_ , which gives you a display . industrial designer: So if you use a rubber double curved case , you must use rubber push-buttons . project manager: Well , we're gonna go with I think we've decided that it's gonna be a rubber case so industrial designer: So it's a constraint . Yeah , but is it a double curved one or not ? If it's not a double curved , then we've got the choice for the push-buttons , if it's a double curve , we've gotta go for rubber push-buttons . user interface: If it's rubber , isn't it malleable anyway , it doesn't matter if it's double  isn't a rubber case , mean it's completely flexed , it it flexes to whatever they want it to ? Mean so what's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double rubber double curved case ? project manager: rubble double double . industrial designer: No , but na le you see , you've got , okay , the energy that's one thing , project manager: I'll have a Big Mac , please . And that's we don't care if it's rub rubber or not , but then we've decided that we going for rubber for the case material . So if we've chosen rub rubber and if now we have the choice for the case whether it's flat , single curved or double curved . And I'm just saying if it if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go I dunno why , but we need to go for  rubber push-buttons .  so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be so that's just the electronics between the but behind the push-buttons . industrial designer:  and the price that go with it with it , so the simple push-buttons are gonna be the cheapest . If we get an advanced chip which is  used for the L_C_D_ , the display thing , then that's even more expensive . project manager: is  , okay , advanced chip on print , which I presume is like one P_C_B_ and that's got all the electronics on one board including the  infra-red sender ? industrial designer: .  what a what alternatives do we have to that ? Y  what alternatives do we have to the chip on print ? industrial designer: Well , if if it's not chip on print then , I guess , you get different chip components , and you build them separately and doesn't include the infra-red . It's less expensive  project manager: so it sounds industrial designer: Technically speaking , it's not as advanced , but it does the job , too . project manager: So , why would we not go for that ? If it's something that's inside the the unit . project manager:  we wanna go for an i i all industrial designer: So let's not go for the project manager: so long as it works , industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . marketing: What about the just developed  sample sensor ? user interface: I think push-buttons is project manager: What about what ? marketing: G there , the sample sensor , sample speaker thing . industrial designer: Well project manager: Well , what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit ? marketing: I dunno . industrial designer: It'd be it'd be cool , but they are saying they've just developed it , user interface: Yeah . But it's gonna be the most expensive option , probably and project manager: S user interface: Th the the speech recognition  option is it doesn't seem really very promising for us  , project manager: Yeah . user interface: 'cause  The yeah the example that they're already using it for is with the coffee machine , where , basically , you can program a sample wi  That when you say something it will give a response , and you program the response as well . So you can program your coffee-maker that when you say , good morning , to it it says , hello Rick , or whatever . user interface: it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the T_V_ on like , turn the T_V_ on , and i turns comes on , but it's not that . user interface: So , yeah , like what's the point of saying , Hello remote , hello , how how are you ? marketing: Oh , then then project manager: Yeah . marketing: I thought I thought it was when they said user interface: Yeah , if you're really lonely , it is it's marketing: I thought when they said , voice recognition , they meant  like , industrial designer: Channel five . industrial designer: Okay , so I'll go back , maybe , to the previous slide and we can decide for each problem , what we should choose . project manager: It's cheap , it's cheerful , it's worked , does work . Then the case , do you want it flat or curved or sing or double curved ? project manager: We were go we were going with the late with the the R_S_I_ rubber , weren't we ? user interface: Yeah , so we want it rub rubber double curved . industrial designer: Okay , so then if we use double curved case , then we have to u choose rubber push-buttons , project manager: Yep , but we're going for the simple buttons . industrial designer: and that's fine ? project manager: And it's cheapest all round , it sounds kinda funky , and we can also market it industrial designer: P user interface: Yeah . project manager: as i 'cause we were s saying earl you were saying earlier in your research that  the the people have the R_ people were getting the complaining about R_S_I_ , and this is anti-R_S_I_ . You industrial designer: I thought they would give an option of flat buttons or a project manager: You see , you can still get it does you still get repetitive strain injury , whether you are pressing a button or pressing a flat bit of screen . project manager: It's the v it's the fact that you are pressing the same doing the same movement . industrial designer: project manager: But the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these anti-R_S_I_ ps specific marketing:  . marketing: Yeah , so they can sit there and go like user interface: Not that watching T_V_ should be that stressful . project manager: And you know , yeah , you can fuzz it across the room and throw it at throw it at your children yeah . marketing: user interface: Oh yeah , I guess T_V_ can be stressful , yeah , if you're watching sports .  I also took  Reissa's marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration  , 'cause I think that's that's crucial as far as  what keys we're going to inc inclu what buttons we are going to include and and how they're laid out . user interface:  and so the manufacturing division  sent some some samples of of  interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products ,  like the coffee machine . It would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the T_V_ .  so yeah , they they also give the  they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an M_P_ three player like iPod . user interface:  so we've already addressed that and I think that would actually be worse for something like R_S_I_  you got that thumb movement that you're constantly doing . user interface: and I I have a feeling that we're interested in in something more general , but they suggested  , you know , going i a little bit into a a niche , like either gearing our remote towards kids , where you could have lot of colours  , the keys might be you know , funny or or , project manager: user interface: or  something for the elderly , where the remote's very large and the buttons are very large and there's only a few buttons . But you know we can we can discuss this , but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general , but done well . You don't want  you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use a lot without  always pressing the wrong one  . And I didn't mention that we need a power button in our last I can give you an example here of  , good layout and bad layout industrial designer: user interface:  from our manufacturing department . So this would be an example of bad layout , where you have volume up and volume down , but they have a V_ on both of them , so  project manager: Yeah . user interface: And so , yeah , I th I think my personal preferences of we've all kind of talked about and seemed to be on the same page  . user interface: I didn't I didn't think the spinning-wheel or the  L_C_ display were were crucial for us . Well let's  so w what are our definite decisions on this then as a team ? The  The the  the interface type we're going for user interface: So we're we're not gonna have any sort of display I think  . user interface: ideally ,  a a power , channel up , channel down , volume up , volume down , and a numerical keypad . And some sort of it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that . user interface: Well now that we've decided on our project manager: Are we gonna hav hav an are we d marketing: project manager: have we decided on whether w we're gonna s supplement it with anything , you know , colours or particular gimmicky bits to it , we're not we're just gonna go for something user interface:  it seems like we wouldn't wanna make it too busy and too sort of gaudy , project manager: We're marketing: Maybe we can user interface: but  Yeah , I would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like  like a black with with yellow and somewhere , like maybe the R_R_ can be yellow , or something like that . Let's move over to user interface: I I guess the fact  also that we are having a rubber case  would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before . user interface: 'cause  s so if we wanna have a lock of some sort it would have to be a button . user interface: But I think that should be   , I can speak with the button department , but  I think that it should be easy to have a button that just prevents prevents the other  the other buttons from operating . Well , I'm just basically letting you know what's happening in the markets project manager:  yeah . marketing: and also recent investigation that we've done in the remote control market , we have found that for the remote control market these are like most important aspects like that we really need to project manager: marketing: which we've already probably discussed . So the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already that we already have . So it has to be project manager: Yeah , why should people buy this when they're already got a remote that came with the T_V_ ? marketing: Yep . So project manager: What's that mean ? marketing: Technologically it should be like  work , basically , I guess . user interface: Well it should be it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense , marketing: Should user interface:  have something that's little more technologically advanced than what's on the market . project manager: Okay , now the trouble is is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that works already , that's cheap . user interface:  it's different , but I wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy . marketing: That's why I was thinking , Bluetooth , 'cause if you like put up Bluetooth , and it's like a Bluetooth remote control , everybody's gonna like , oh , 'cause Bluetooth is the in thing nowadays , like it really is , like people and  when it comes to marketing like that's what people go for , they don't really care whether , you know , at the end of the day whether it works properly or not . marketing: Well , they do , but it's like it's not project manager: One hundred per cent , that's your first thing , you go , oh I'm not gonna buy that , 'cause I dunno if it works or not . project manager: Okay , well , what do you two think about this ? user interface: So is is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other marketing: But like project manager: Yeah , what I don't understand what m user interface: electronics ? marketing: You could always insert , yeah . user interface: Yeah , that's basically what it allows you to do , project manager: Yeah , user interface: right ? project manager: and it this is just gonna all this is being used for is your television . marketing: Yeah , but , people like project manager: It would that would mean you'd need a television that has Bluetooth in it , which no no television does , marketing: Well , if you're looking at if you looking at something that's going to be bought by people , you have to make it new , you have to make it state of the art . industrial designer: Well project manager: does it ? That would mean we'd have to make a television as well . industrial designer: Bluetooth would , for example , enable you , I think , to   connect for example you if you get a w call on your mobile phone , but your mobile phone is downstairs or something , you would get on your television you're being called by this person right now . industrial designer: No i user interface: Yeah , the that wouldn't be the remote so much , project manager: Yeah , user interface:  project manager: and i industrial designer: No , but if you get Bluetooth on the remote , you'd be able to project manager: Nah , the televi the television would have to be a Bluetooth compatible , basically . marketing: Well , it doesn't project manager: An and there is no there is no such thing marketing: Like it doesn't have to be , you know , Bluetooth , that was just an idea , but like it needs do something that , you know , is new . Whether it's a battery it could be something really really minor , you know , like but I think we are really keeping to what is already out there , and people've already seen it , people've already got it . marketing: If we want something new , we need to move away from what we already have and  just go creative . It's been done for watches , but I haven't seen that for remotes , yet . marketing: project manager: The fact that it's made out of this rubber , we can throw it about . Th we should encourage people to throw their remote controls about , because it charges itself up by doing it . industrial designer: Yeah , well , and in little characters you say , yeah , but not too much . user interface: Yes , so can project manager: But yeah , by the squeezing it the marketing: I think , safety s user interface: Yeah , we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating like the energy generator . Next year's fashion i very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . So next year people will be buying , I found this really funny , you know , strawberry shaped chairs , industrial designer: user interface: Okay , so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a  and an avocado key on them .  and as it's rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy , so it's it's not quite spongy , but spongy , I would say is user interface: . And so personal what I was just saying like move away from the current remote controls  like the look and the feel of the current ones and change the look and feel , while still keeping to the company's image , basically . marketing: So we're moving in the right direction like project manager: Alright , yeah , no , this i this is good , user interface: Yeah . project manager: so through all that we've we go we're right , we're gonna go go back to  going with the kinetic thing , industrial designer: Yep . project manager: that's great , using the spongy rubber that we were talking about that anti-R_S_I_ you can as you squeeze it you are not only therapeuticising yourself , you are charging the batteries , marketing:  . project manager: industrial designer: sued the Beatles so user interface: Okay , we'll make it a  pomegranate , a big pomegranate . industrial designer: project manager: Well , okay , it seems like the only thing that we haven't really finally  agreed on is its image . Like , yeah , we're we're saying no we don't want it to be fruit and vegetables , but we dunno what it should be , user interface: . project manager: or like are we going yeah it looks slick , but what do what do we mean by slick sort of thing ? marketing: Well I think , if it's rubber it needs to be project manager:  you said earlier on i it should be funky . I think , it's it should be  , what do you associate with rubber ? You know like project manager: L keep it clean , keep it clean . industrial designer: marketing: Okay , sor I sorry , I used the wrong word , what do you associate with the mate the material that material ?  industrial designer: marketing:  like I'm just thinking bright colours . Wanna make it different colours so anybody can choo like like project manager: Like the volume buttons should be the all the same colour and the d and the the channel buttons should be one colour and stuff like that , do you mean ? user interface:  . Tha user interface: The one thing I'm wondering about , I hope that we're not going like too much down a gimmicky road of of having project manager: Yeah ,  we that's we we user interface:  if somebody go goes into the store they're gonna see like three or four normal remotes , and then a big spongy pink t tomato  remote . user interface:  what are ninety per cent of people gonna take ? marketing: Well I can say in this country , you'll get , you know , lots of people wanting something really funky and cool . project manager: marketing: And  parents will see the will see the pro as well , because it's  like kids won't break it , it's not breakable if you throw it around . The only thing is is that really small kids might chew on it , but project manager: Well , it's it's gotta be chew proof . marketing: So user interface: marketing: so it's rea it's quite project manager: marketing: it's quite like  user friendly industrial designer: marketing: and also for different families , like like family use as well , so for little kids and for old ki like teenagers will like it , I think . Especially maybe younger girls if it's in pink they'll be like pink remote control for their room something . project manager: So , what are you saying , maybe we should market it in different colours for different marketing: Yeah . project manager: so we could do like the pink range , the blue range , the green range , the industrial designer: That's yeah . marketing: So like you walk in , you're like , oh I like that remote control , because it's so bright , and then , and then the shop assistant comes up and says , oh what colour would you like ? and then they go like , oh I can choose the colour wow . So it puts , I think , even the customer into more control over what they're buying instead of , you've got all colour it's either that or nothing . user interface: Yeah  , that that seems to work well with for products like iPod , marketing: It's  user interface: where , you know , you have a variety of colours , that people feel like they're customising it when they buy it , even , you know , just just by the fact of choosing . industrial designer: Although I'd be curious to see how many  marketing: D you've got the industrial designer: You know , there are some colours that I wouldn I would never choose , and I would be curious how many people choose that colour . project manager: Well that's that can be down to bit of market researching you know , user interface: Right . Well  , we'll alright let's what we're gonna aim to get together by the next meeting then  is from you Catherine wi your y y you know you're gonna be working on the the look and feel design . project manager:  Gabriel , you're gonna be working on , you know come up with the the user interface design . project manager: come up ki you know , be ab for the next meeting be able to come in and show us some some i some physical ideas . project manager: We were kinda going , yeah , it's gotta feel nice , it's gotta look cool and that it's industrial designer: It is . project manager: you know now we can actually start , you know , s some sort of physical something or other . And I will be  industrial designer: marketing: project manager: talking to the bosses , basically , and  marketing: project manager: f fielding off some more spam and  industrial designer: Great . So we know for definite we know we've we've now got some definite things going on . project manager: we definitely know that  it's gonna be a simple buttons , we're not gonna be going for the new technological chip on print expensive things , so we've we're keeping the costs down . project manager: People , you know , people are saying , oh , standard stuff gives you repetitive strain injury , well this remote control is designed to do the complete opposite , marketing: Yeah . you know , we're gonna we we're gonna as a sort of extra something on it , you know what what extra things are there extra things this product have ? We'll look into this lock key user interface: Right . project manager: facility , although whether or not it happens , or is possible , I don't know , but something to look into . project manager: everyone know what they're doing ? 'Cause if you don't , you'll I'm sure you'll soon get an e-mail about it . project manager: It's  we're we've still couple of minutes until our meeting's due to finish . But  I got a note saying that you two who are gonna be working together marketing: project manager: so bef before you all disappear off just user interface: Okay , I'll stay in here . user interface: Does the pay-raise immediately come into effect on our next pay-check , or is that project manager:  I think , it's  , yeah , I think , it's gonna be par part more of a profit sharing on the product . industrial designer: marketing: user interface: So we're buying fut  , we're getting futures in the company . project manager: Yeah , I think i I think that's I think that's the way it's gonna happen at the moment . user interface: I'd like to share in the coffee machine profits , because that's really doing well . user interface: Well I I did notice looking at  , they told you that they wanted whatev our product to represent the the R_R_ brand and and to be immediately noticeable . user interface: if you look like at the coffee maker at the at the corporate web page , it's not obvious . Well it is to us , because we we worked worked here for years and we use that coffee machine , but it's doesn't have the colour scheme of of the of the company anywhere on it obviously it's just sil silver and black . project manager: And the spaceship doesn't have the R_ have a massive R_ and R_ down the side of it user interface: No "

        "Summary": "The group aims to have the question answering mock-up and transcriber interface ready for the DARPA meeting in July, along with available data. Speaker fe008 is currently working on ensuring clean and properly coded transcripts, while speaker mn014's multi-channel speech/non-speech segmenter is being utilized. To save time, speaker mn005 will only mark regions of overlapping speech in the transcribed data. The task of extracting digits will be assigned to the person working on acoustics for the Meeting Recorder project.",
        "Article": "professor c: So ,  grad f: so I wanted to discuss digits briefly , but that won't take too long . OK , agenda items , we have digits , What else we got ? phd a: New version of the presegmentation . postdoc b: do we wanna say something about the , an update of the , transcript ? phd g: Yeah , why don't you summarize the professor c: Update on transcripts . phd g: And I guess that includes some the filtering for the , the ASI refs , too . professor c: Filtering for what ? phd g: For the references that we need to go from the the fancy transcripts to the sort of brain - dead . postdoc b: It 'll it 'll be basically it 'll be a re - cap of a meeting that we had jointly this morning . OK well , the , w  as you can see from the numbers on the digits we 're almost done . You know , someone fills out the form and then they 're not at the meeting and so it 's blank . And so , once we 're it 's done it would be very nice to train up a recognizer and actually start working with this data . phd d: So we 'll have a corpus that 's the size of TI - digits ? grad f: And so One particular test set of TI - digits . grad f: So , I I extracted , Ther - there was a file sitting around which people have used here as a test set . It had been randomized and so on phd d:  grad f: and that 's just what I used to generate the order . professor c: So , I 'm impressed by what we could do , Is take the standard training set for TI - digits , train up with whatever , you know , great features we think we have ,  for instance , and then test on  this test set . grad f:  professor c: And presumably  it should do reasonably well on that , and then , presumably , we should go to the distant mike , and it should do poorly . professor c: And then we should get really smart over the next year or two , and it that should get better . grad f: so that the reason it 's not just a transcript is that there 're false starts , and misreads , and miscues and things like that . And so I have a set of scripts and X Waves where you just select the portion , hit R , it tells you what the next one should be , and you just look for that . You know , so it it 'll put on the screen , \" The next set is six nine , nine two two \" . And you find that , and , hit the key and it records it in a file in a particular format . professor c: So is this grad f: And so the the question is , should we have the transcribers do that or should we just do it ? Well , some of us . I 've been do I 've done , eight meetings , something like that , just by hand .  professor c: what what do you think ? postdoc b: My feeling is that we discussed this right before coffee and I think it 's a it 's a fine idea partly because , it 's not un unrelated to their present skill set , but it will add , for them , an extra dimension , it might be an interesting break for them . And also it is contributing to the , c composition of the transcript cuz we can incorporate those numbers directly and it 'll be a more complete transcript . grad f: There is there is professor c: So you think it 's fine to have the transcribers do it ? postdoc b:   grad f: There 's one other small bit , which is just entering the information which at s which is at the top of this form , onto the computer , to go along with the where the digits are recorded automatically . grad f: And so it 's just , you know , typing in name , times time , date , and so on .  , which again either they can do , but it is , you know , firing up an editor , or , again , I can do . postdoc b: And , that , you know , I 'm not , that that one I 'm not so sure if it 's into the the , things that , I , wanted to use the hours for , because the , the time that they 'd be spending doing that they wouldn't be able to be putting more words on . postdoc b: But that 's really your choice , it 's your phd d: So are these two separate tasks that can happen ? Or do they have to happen at the same time before grad f: No they don't have this you have to enter the data before , you do the second task , but they don't have to happen at the same time . grad f: So it 's it 's just I have a file whi which has this information on it , and then when you start using my scripts , for extracting the times , it adds the times at the bottom of the file . And so , it 's easy to create the files and leave them blank , and so actually we could do it in either order . grad f: it 's it 's sort of nice to have the same person do it just as a double - check , to make sure you 're entering for the right person . Yeah just by way of  , a  , order of magnitude , we 've been working with this Aurora ,  data set . And , the best score , on the , nicest part of the data , that is , where you 've got training and test set that are basically the same kinds of noise and so forth , is about ,  I think the best score was something like five percent , error , per digit . So So the The point there , and this is  car noise  ,  things , but but real real situation , phd d:   professor c: well , \" real \" , the  there 's one microphone that 's close , that they have as as this sort of thing , close versus distant .  but in a car , instead of instead of having a projector noise it 's it 's car noise . So , that 's that 's an indication ,  that was with , many sites competing , and this was the very best score and so forth , so . More typical numbers like phd d: Although the models weren't , that good , right ?  , the models are pretty crappy ? professor c: You 're right . I think that we could have done better on the models , but the thing is that we got this this is the kind of typical number , for all of the , things in this task , all of the , languages . Anyway , just an indication once you get into this kind of realm even if you 're looking at connected digits it can be pretty hard . phd d: How did we do on the TI - digits ? grad f: Well the prosodics are so much different s it 's gonna be , strange . grad f: So I 'm I 'm not sure how much of effect that will have . phd d: H how do phd g: What do you mean , the prosodics ? grad f: just what we were talking about with grouping . That with these , the grouping , there 's no grouping at all , and so it 's just the only sort of discontinuity you have is at the beginning and the end . phd g: So what are they doing in Aurora , are they reading actual phone numbers , grad f: Aurora I don't know . phd g: or , a a digit at a time , or ? professor c: I 'm not sure how phd g: Cuz it 's professor c: no , no  it 's connected it 's connected , digits , phd g: Connected . phd g: So there 's also the not just the prosody but the cross the cross - word modeling is probably quite different . phd d: H How grad f: But in TI - digits , they 're reading things like zip codes and phone numbers and things like that , phd g: Right . phd d: do we do on TI - digits ? grad f: so it 's gonna be different . grad f: One and a half percent , two percent , something like that ? professor c: I th no I think we got under a percent , but it was but it 's but  . The very best system that I saw in the literature was a point two five percent or something that somebody had at at Bell Labs , or . It s strikes me that there are more each of them is more informative because it 's so , random , grad f: OK . professor c: But I think a lot of systems sort of get half a percent , or three - quarters a percent , grad f: Right . grad f: But that  it 's really it 's it 's close - talking mikes , no noise , clean signal , just digits , every everything is good . phd g: It 's like the , single cell , you know , it 's the beginning of life , phd d: Pre - prehistory . grad f: OK , so , what I 'll do then is I 'll go ahead and enter , this data . And then , hand off to Jane , and the transcribers to do the actual extraction of the digits . One question I have that that  , we wouldn't know the answer to now but might , do some guessing , but I was talking before about doing some model modeling of arti  , marking of articulatory , features , with overlap and so on . The only thing is I 'm a little concerned that maybe the kind of phenomena , in w i i The reason for doing it is because the the argument is that certainly with conversational speech , the stuff that we 've looked at here before , just doing the simple mapping , from , the phone , to the corresponding features that you could look up in a book , isn't right . In fact there 's these overlapping processes where some voicing some up and then some , you know , some nasality is comes in here , and so forth . But , It could be that when we 're reading digits , because it 's it 's for such a limited set , that maybe maybe that phenomenon doesn't occur as much . Di - an anybody ? Do you have any ? Anybody have any opinion about that , postdoc b: and that people might articulate more , and you that might end up with more a closer correspondence . phd d: Sort of less predictability , grad f: That it 's just postdoc b:   phd d: and You hafta grad f: It 's a Well Would , this corpus really be the right one to even try that on ? phd g: Well it 's definitely true that , when people are , reading , even if they 're re - reading what , they had said spontaneously , that they have very different patterns . phd g: So the fact that they 're reading , first of all , whether they 're reading in a room of , people , or rea you know , just the fact that they 're reading will make a difference . So , may maybe the thing will be do to take some very small subset ,  not have a big , program , but take a small set , subset of the conversational speech and a small subset of the digits , and look and and just get a feeling for it . postdoc b: H That could could be an interesting design , too , cuz then you 'd have the com the comparison of the , predictable speech versus the less predictable speech professor c: Cuz I don't think anybody is , I at least , I don't know , of anybody , well , I don't know , the answers . postdoc b: and maybe you 'd find that it worked in , in the , case of the pr of the , non - predictable . phd d: Hafta think about , the particular acoustic features to mark , too , because , some things , they wouldn't be able to mark , like , you know , tense lax . grad f: M I think we can get Ohala in to , give us some advice on that . postdoc b: Also I thought you were thinking of a much more restricted set of features , that professor c: Yeah , but I I I I was , like he said , I was gonna bring John in and ask John what he thought . It should be such that if you , if you , if you had o  , all of the features , determined that you that you were  ch have chosen , that that would tell you , in the steady - state case , the phone . grad f: Even , I guess with vowels that would be pretty hard , wouldn't it ? To identify actually , you know , which one it is ? postdoc b: It would seem to me that the points of articulation would be m more , g  ,  that 's I think about articulatory features , I think about , points of articulation , which means , rather than vowels . phd d: Points of articulation ? What do you mean ? postdoc b: So , is it , bilabial or dental or is it , you know , palatal . phd g: Well it 's also , there 's , really a difference between , the pronunciation models in the dictionary , and , the pronunciations that people produce . And , so , You get , some of that information from Steve 's work on the on the labeling professor c: Right . That maybe , although I think the meeting context is great , that he has transcriptions that give you the actual phone sequence . And you can go from not from that to the articulatory features , but that would be a better starting point for marking , the gestural features , then , data where you don't have that , because , we you wanna know , both about the way that they 're producing a certain sound , and what kinds of , you know what kinds of , phonemic , differences you get between these , transcribed , sequences and the dictionary ones . professor c: Well you might be right that mi might be the way at getting at , what I was talking about , but the particular reason why I was interested in doing that was because I remember , when that happened , and , John Ohala was over here and he was looking at the spectrograms of the more difficult ones . One you know , one is going from a dictionary pronunciation of something , like , \" gonna see you tomorrow \" , grad f: And Or \" gonta \" . phd g: it could be \" going to \" or \" gonna \" or \" gonta s \" you know . And , that it would be nice to have these , intermediate , or these some these reduced pronunciations that those transcribers had marked or to have people mark those as well . phd g: Because , it 's not , that easy to go from the , dictionary , word pronuncia the dictionary phone pronunciation , to the gestural one without this intermediate or a syllable level kind of , representation . grad f: Well I don't think Morgan 's suggesting that we do that , though . professor c: Yeah , I I I 'm jus at the moment of course we 're just talking about what , to provide as a tool for people to do research who have different ideas about how to do it . So for instance , you might have someone who just has a wor has words with states , and has   , comes from articulatory gestures to that . But  , grad f: But What I 'm imagining is a score - like notation , where each line is a particular feature . grad f: so you would say , you know , it 's voiced through here , and so you have label here , and you have nas nasal here , and , they they could be overlapping in all sorts of bizarre ways that don't correspond to the timing on phones . professor c:  this is the kind of reason why I remember when at one of the Switchboard , workshops , that  when we talked about doing the transcription project , Dave Talkin said , \" can't be done \" . professor c: He was he was , what what he meant was that this isn't , you know , a sequence of phones , and when you actually look at Switchboard that 's , not what you see , and , you know . It , grad f: And in in fact the inter - annotator agreement was not that good , right ? On the harder ones ? professor c: yeah  it was phd g: It depends how you look at it , and I I understand what you 're saying about this , kind of transcription exactly , professor c: Yeah . phd g: because I 've seen you know , where does the voicing bar start and so forth . phd g: All I 'm saying is that , it is useful to have that the transcription of what was really said , and which syllables were reduced .  , if you 're gonna add the features it 's also useful to have some level of representation which is , is a reduced it 's a pronunciation variant , that currently the dictionaries don't give you professor c:   phd g: because if you add them to the dictionary and you run recognition , you , you add confusion . phd d: So it would be it would be great if we had , either these kind of , labelings on , the same portion of Switchboard that Steve marked , or , Steve 's type markings on this data , with these . phd g: And Steve 's type is fairly it 's not that slow , I dunno exactly what the , timing was , but . professor c: Yeah u I don't disagree with it the on the only thing is that , What you actually will end en end up with is something , i it 's all compromised , right , so , the string that you end up with isn't , actually , what happened . But it 's it 's the best compromise that a group of people scratching their heads could come up with to describe what happened . And it 's more accurate than the than the dictionary or , if you 've got a pronunciation  lexicon that has three or four , grad f: The word . professor c: this might be have been the fifth one that you tr that you pruned or whatever , phd d: So it 's like a continuum . phd g: an and in some places it would fill in , So the kinds of gestural features are not everywhere . phd g: So there are some things that you don't have access to either from your ear or the spectrogram , phd d:   phd g: but you know what phone it was and that 's about all you can all you can say . phd g: And then there are other cases where , nasality , voicing phd d: It 's basically just having , multiple levels of of , information and marking , on the signal . grad f: Well the other difference is that the the features , are not synchronous , phd g: Right . phd g: Th - there 'll be no way for you to actually mark what was said completely by features . grad f: Well not with our current system but you could imagine designing a system , that the states were features , rather than phones . phd g: And i if you 're Well , we we 've probably have a separate , discussion of ,  of whether you can do that . postdoc b: That 's Well , isn't that I thought that was , well but that wasn't that kinda the direction ? grad f: Yeah . postdoc b: I thought professor c: Yeah , so  , what , what where this is , I I want would like to have something that 's useful to people other than those who are doing the specific kind of research I have in mind , so it should be something broader . But , The but  where I 'm coming from is , we 're coming off of stuff that Larry Saul did with with , John Dalan and Muzim Rahim in which , they , have , a m a multi - band system that is , trained through a combination of gradient learning an and EM , to  , estimate , the , value for m for for a particular feature . And this is part of a larger , image that John Dalan has about how the human brain does it in which he 's sort of imagining that , individual frequency channels are coming up with their own estimate , of of these , these kinds of something like this . And the the th this particular image , of how thi how it 's done , is that , then given all of these estimates at that level , there 's a level above it , then which is is making , some kind of sound unit classification such as , you know , phone and and , you know . But that that 's sort of what I was imagining doing , and but it 's still open within that whether you would have an intermediate level in which it was actually phones , or not .  , but , Again , I wouldn't wanna , wouldn't want what we we produced to be so , know , local in perspective that it it was matched , what we were thinking of doing one week , And and , and , you know , what you 're saying is absolutely right . That , that if we , can we should put in , another level of , of description there if we 're gonna get into some of this low - level stuff . phd d: Well , you know ,   if we 're talking about , having the , annotators annotate these kinds of features , it seems like , You know , you The the question is , do they do that on , meeting data ? Or do they do that on , Switchboard ? grad f: That 's what I was saying , postdoc b: W Well it seems like you could do both . postdoc b: I was thinking that it would be interesting , to do it with respect to , parts of Switchboard anyway , in terms of , professor c:   postdoc b:  partly to see , if you could , generate first guesses at what the articulatory feature would be , based on the phone representation at that lower level . phd d: Well cuz the yeah , and then also , if you did it on Switchboard , you would have , the full continuum of transcriptions . phd d: You 'd have it , from the lowest level , the ac acoustic features , then you 'd have the , you know , the phonetic level that Steve did , postdoc b:   phd g: it is telephone band , so , the bandwidth might be phd d: It 'd be a complete , set then . So  i we 'll see wha how much we can , get the people to do , and how much money we 'll have and all this sort of thing , phd g: Yeah . phd d: But it it might be good to do what Jane was saying  , you know , seed it , with , guesses about what we think the features are , based on , you know , the phone or Steve 's transcriptions or something . grad f: Alright , so based on the phone transcripts they would all be synchronous , but then you could imagine , nudging them here and there . professor c: Well I think what  I 'm I 'm a l little behind in what they 're doing , now , and , the stuff they 're doing on Switchboard now . But I think that , Steve and the gang are doing , something with an automatic system first and then doing some adjustment . So  that 's probably the right way to go anyway , is to is to start off with an automatic system with a pretty rich pronunciation dictionary that , that , you know , tries , to label it all . postdoc b: So in in our case you 'd think about us s starting with maybe the regular dictionary entry , and then ? Or would we professor c: Well , regular dictionary , this is a pretty rich dictionary . It 's got , got a fair number of pronunciations in it postdoc b: But phd d: Or you could start from the if we were gonna , do the same set , of sentences that Steve had , done , we could start with those transcriptions . phd g: the problem is when you run , if you run a regular dictionary , even if you have variants , in there , which most people don't , you don't always get , out , the actual pronunciations , phd d: Yeah . phd g: so that 's why the human transcriber 's giving you the that pronunciation , postdoc b: Yeah . phd g: and so y they they I thought that they were professor c: Is that what they 're doing ? grad f: They are . professor c: Yeah , so I think that i i we also don't have , we 've got a good start on it , but we don't have a really good , meeting , recorder or recognizer or transcriber or anything yet , so . So ,  another way to look at this is to , is to , do some stuff on Switchboard which has all this other , stuff to it . professor c: And then , As we get , further down the road and we can do more things ahead of time , we can , do some of the same things to the meeting data . postdoc b: And I 'm and these people might they they are , s most of them are trained with IPA . professor c: Yeah postdoc b: They 'd be able to do phonetic - level coding , or articulatory . phd d: Are they busy for the next couple years , or ? postdoc b: Well , you know ,  they , they they 're interested in continuing working with us , so  I , and this would be up their alley , so , we could when the when you d meet with , with John Ohala and find , you know what taxonomy you want to apply , then , they 'd be , good to train onto it . phd g: It might be grad f:  you 'd you 'd want models for spreading . phd g: I was thinking it might be n phd d: Of the f acoustic features ? grad f: Yeah . phd g: Well it might be neat to do some , phonetic , features on these , nonword words . Are are these kinds of words that people never the \" huh \"s and the \"  \"s and the \" huh \" and the  These k No , I 'm serious . phd g: And some of them are , yeah , \"  - huh \"s , and \"  \"s , and , \"  ! \" \"  \" \" OK \" , \"  \" Grunts , that might be interesting . professor c: new version of , presegmentation ? phd a: oh yeah , I worked a little bit on the on the presegmentation to to get another version which does channel - specific , speech - nonspeech detection . And , what I did is I used some normalized features which , look in into the which is normalized energy , energy normalized by the mean over the channels and by the , minimum over the , other . And to to , to , yeah , to normalize also loudness and and modified loudness and things and that those special features actually are in my feature vector . phd a: And , and , therefore to be able to , somewhat distinguish between foreground and background speech in in the different in each channel . And , eh , I tested it on on three or four meetings and it seems to work , well yeah , fairly well , I I would say . grad f: So I I understand that 's what you were saying about your problem with , minimum . phd a: Yeah yeah , then I I did some some some things like that , postdoc b: Interesting . phd a: as there there are some some problems in , when , in the channel , there they the the speaker doesn't doesn't talk much or doesn't talk at all . Then , the , yeah , there are there are some problems with with with n with normalization , and , then , there the system doesn't work at all . So , I 'm I 'm glad that there is the the digit part , where everybody is forced to say something , professor c: Right . And , the thing is I I , then the evaluation of of the system is a little bit hard , as I don't have any references . phd a: Yeah , that 's the one one wh where I do the training on so I can't do the evaluation on So the thing is , can the transcribers perhaps do some , some some meetings in in terms of speech - nonspeech in in the specific channels ? grad f:  . postdoc b: Well , I have phd d: Well won't you have that from their transcriptions ? postdoc b: Well , OK , so , now we need grad f: No , cuz we need is really tight . postdoc b: so , I think I might have done what you 're requesting , though I did it in the service of a different thing . postdoc b: I have thirty minutes that I 've more tightly transcribed with reference to individual channels . postdoc b: And I could And And grad f: Hopefully that 's not the same meeting that we did . postdoc b: So , e so the , you know , we have the , th they transcribe as if it 's one channel with these with the slashes to separate the overlapping parts . postdoc b: And then we run it through then it then I 'm gonna edit it and I 'm gonna run it through channelize which takes it into Dave Gelbart 's form format . postdoc b: And then you have , all these things split across according to channel , and then that means that , if a person contributed more than once in a given , overlap during that time bend that that two parts of the utterance end up together , it 's the same channel , phd a: OK . postdoc b: and then I took his tool , and last night for the first thirty minutes of one of these transcripts , I , tightened up the , boundaries on individual speakers ' channels , phd a: OK . postdoc b: cuz his his interface allows me to have total flexibility in the time tags across the channels . phd a: so , yeah yeah , that that that 's great , but what would be nice to have some more meetings , not just one meeting to to be sure that that , there is a system , phd d: So , current This week . grad f: Yeah , so if we could get a couple meetings done with that level of precision I think that would be a good idea .  , how how m much time so the meetings vary in length , what are we talking about in terms of the number of minutes you 'd like to have as your as your training set ? phd a: It seems to me that it would be good to have , a few minutes from from different meetings , so . postdoc b: OK , now you 're saying different meetings because of different speakers or because of different audio quality or both or ? phd a: Both both . professor c: Yeah , we don't have that much variety in meetings yet ,  we have this meeting and the feature meeting and we have a couple others that we have  , couple examples of . grad e: Even probably with the gains differently will affect it , you mean phd a: not really as professor c: Poten - potentially . phd g: We can try running we haven't done this yet because , Andreas an is is gonna move over the SRI recognizer . phd g: cuz we 're running the evals and I just don't have machine time there . But , once that 's moved over , hopefully in a a couple days , then , we can take , what Jane just told us about as , the presegmented , the the segmentations that you did , at level eight or som at some , threshold that Jane , tha right , and try doing , forced alignment . phd g: And if it 's good , then that will that may give you a good boundary . Of course if it 's good , we don't then we 're we 're fine , phd a: Yeah . M phd g: but , I don't know yet whether these , segments that contain a lot of pauses around the words , will work or not . phd a: I I would quite like to have some manually transcribed references for for the system , as I 'm not sure if if it 's really good to compare with with some other automatic , found boundaries . postdoc b: Well , no , if we were to start with this and then tweak it h manually , would that that would be OK ? phd a: Yeah . phd g: but , I would have maybe a transciber , look at the result of a forced alignment and then adjust those . phd g: If they 're horrible it won't help at all , but they might not be horrible . postdoc b: How many minutes would you want from  , we could easily , get a section , you know , like say a minute or so , from every meeting that we have so f from the newer ones that we 're working on , everyone that we have . phd a: If it 's not the first minute of of the meeting , that that 's OK with me , but , in in the first minute , Often there are some some strange things going on which which aren't really , well , for , which which aren't re re really good . What what I 'd quite like , perhaps , is , to have , some five minutes of of of different meetings , so . postdoc b: And , then I wanted to ask you just for my inter information , then , would you , be trai cuz I don't quite unders so , would you be training then , the segmenter so that , it could , on the basis of that , segment the rest of the meeting ? So , if I give you like five minutes is the idea that this would then be applied to , to , providing tighter time bands ? phd a: I I could do a a retraining with that , yeah . phd a: That 's but but I hope that I I don't need to do it . phd a: I 'm I 'm not sure , but , for for for those three meetings whi which I which I did , it seems to be , quite well , but , there are some some as I said some problems with the lapel mike , but , perhaps we can do something with with cross - correlations to , to get rid of the of those . Well well what I want to do is to to look into cross - correlations for for removing those , false overlaps . phd g: Are the , wireless , different than the wired , mikes , at all ?  , have you noticed any difference ? phd a: I 'm I 'm not sure , if if there are any wired mikes in those meetings , or , I have have to loo have a look at them but , I 'm I 'm I think there 's no difference between , phd g: So it 's just the lapel versus everything else ? phd a: Yeah . postdoc b: OK , so then , if that 's five minutes per meeting we 've got like twelve minutes , twelve meetings , roughly , that I 'm that I 've been working with , then professor c: Of of of the meetings that you 're working with , how many of them are different , tha phd a: No . professor c: are there any of them that are different than , these two meetings ? postdoc b: Well oh wa in terms of the speakers or the conditions or the ? professor c: Yeah , speakers . postdoc b: just from what I 've seen , there are some where , you 're present or not present , and , then then you have the difference between the networks group and this group phd a: Yeah , I know , some of the NSA meetings , yeah . professor c: Do you have any of Jerry 's meetings in your , pack , er , postdoc b: no . professor c: No ? postdoc b: We could ,  you you recorded one last week or so . professor c: and and having as much variety for speaker certainly would be a big part of that I think . postdoc b: OK , so if I , OK , included include , OK , then , if I were to include all together samples from twelve meetings that would only take an hour and I could get the transcribers to do that right  , what  is , that would be an hour sampled , and then they 'd transcribe those that hour , right ? That 's what I should do ? professor c: Yeah . So they get it into the multi - channel format and then adjust the timebands so it 's precise . professor c: So that should be faster than the ten times kind of thing , postdoc b: Absolutely . postdoc b: Oh gosh , well , last night , I did about half an hour in , three hours , which is not , terrific , professor c: Yeah . postdoc b: but , anyway , it 's an hour and a half per professor c: Yeah . phd a: Do the transcribers actually start wi with , transcribing new meetings , or are they ? postdoc b: Well ,  they 're still working they still have enough to finish that I haven't assigned a new meeting , phd a: OK . postdoc b: but the next , m m I was about to need to assign a new meeting and I was going to take it from one of the new ones , phd a: OK . phd g: So they 're really running out of , data , prett  that 's good . professor c: They 're running out of data unless we s make the decision that we should go over and start , transcribing the other set . postdoc b: And so I was in the process of like editing them but this is wonderful news . postdoc b: We funded the experiment with ,  also we were thinking maybe applying that that to getting the , Yeah , that 'll be , very useful to getting the overlaps to be more precise all the way through . So , Liz , and and Don , and I met this morning , in the BARCO room , with the lecture hall , professor c: OK . postdoc b: and this afternoon , it drifted into the afternoon , concerning this issue of , the , well there 's basically the issue of the interplay between the transcript format and the processing that , they need to do for , the SRI recognizer . And , well , so , I mentioned the process that I 'm going through with the data , so , you know , I get the data back from the transcri Well , s  , metaphorically , get the data back from the transcriber , and then I , check for simple things like spelling errors and things like that . And , I 'm going to be doing a more thorough editing , with respect to consistency of the conventions . And , then , I run it through , the channelize program to get it into the multi - channel format , OK . And the , what we discussed this morning , I would summarize as saying that , these units that result , in a a particular channel and a particular timeband , at at that level , vary in length . But it 's really an empirical question , whether the units we get at this point through , just that process I described might be sufficient for them . So , as a first pass through , a first chance without having to do a lot of hand - editing , what we 're gonna do , is , I 'll run it through channelize , give them those data after I 've done the editing process and be sure it 's clean . And I can do that , pretty quickly , with just , that minimal editing , without having to hand - break things . postdoc b: And then we 'll see if the units that we 're getting , with the at that level , are sufficient . And if they do need to be further broken down then maybe it just be piece - wise , maybe it won't be the whole thing . So , that 's that 's what we were discussing , this morning as far as I Among phd g: Right . postdoc b: also we discussed some adaptational things , phd g: Then lots of postdoc b: so it 's like , phd g: Right . postdoc b:  You know I hadn't , incorporated , a convention explicitly to handle acronyms , for example , but if someone says , PZM it would be nice to have that be directly interpretable from , the transcript what they said , professor c:   It 's like y it 's and so , I 've I 've incorporated also convention , with that but that 's easy to handle at the post editing phase , and I 'll mention it to , transcribers for the next phase but that 's OK .  , and also I 'll be , encoding , as I do my post - editing , the , things that are in curly brackets , which are clarificational material . So , it 's gonna be either a gloss or it 's gonna be a vocal sound like a , laugh or a cough , or , so forth . Or a non - vocal sound like a doors door - slam , and that can be easily done with a , you know , just a one little additional thing in the , in the general format . phd g: Yeah we j we just needed a way to , strip , you know , all the comments , all the things th the that linguist wants but the recognizer can't do anything with .  , but to keep things that we mapped to like reject models , or , you know , mouth noise , or , cough . And then there 's this interesting issue Jane brought up which I hadn't thought about before but I was , realizing as I went through the transcripts , that there are some noises like , well the good example was an inbreath , where a transcriber working from , the mixed , signal , doesn't know whose breath it is , grad f: Right . phd g: and they 've been assigning it to someone that may or may not be correct . And what we do is , if it 's a breath sound , you know , a sound from the speaker , we map it , to , a noise model , like a mouth - noise model in the recognizer , and , yeah , it probably doesn't hurt that much once in a while to have these , but , if they 're in the wrong channel , that 's , not a good idea . And then there 's also , things like door - slams that 's really in no one 's channel , they 're like it 's in the room . phd g: And  , Jane had this nice , idea of having , like an extra ,  couple tiers , grad f: An extra channel . So if they hear a breath and they don't know who breath it is it 's better to put it in that channel than to put it in the speaker 's channel because maybe it was someone else 's breath , or  , so I think that 's a good you can always clean that up , post - processing . phd g: So a lot of little details , but I think we 're , coming to some kinda closure , on that . So the idea is then , Don can take , Jane 's post - processed channelized version , and , with some scripts , you know , convert that to to a reference for the recognizer and we can , can run these . So when that 's , ready you know , as soon as that 's ready , and as soon as the recognizer is here we can get , twelve hours of force - aligned and recognized data . And , you know , start , working on it , postdoc b: And phd g: so we 're , I dunno a coup a week or two away I would say from , if if that process is automatic once we get your post - process , transcript . I 'm just hoping that the units that are provided in that way , will be sufficient cuz I would save a lot of , time , dividing things . Just from I dunno how long were you did one ? grad e: I saw a couple , around twenty seconds , and that was just without looking too hard for it , so , I would imagine that there might be some that are longer . postdoc b: Well n One question , e w would that be a single speaker or is that multiple speakers overlapping ? grad e: No . No , but if we 're gonna segment it , like if there 's one speaker in there , that says \" OK \" or something , right in the middle , it 's gonna have a lot of dead time around it , phd g: Right . It 's not the it 's not the fact that we can't process a twenty second segment , it 's the fact that , there 's twenty seconds in which to place one word in the wrong place grad e: so it 's not postdoc b: Yeah . phd g: You know , if if someone has a very short utterance there , and that 's where , we , might wanna have this individual , you know , ha have your pre pre - process input . phd a: I I I thought that perhaps the transcribers could start then from the those mult multi - channel , speech - nonspeech detections , if they would like to . phd g: So that 's probably what will happen , but we 'll try it this way and see . We 'll probably get lots of errors because of the cross - talk , and , noises and things . postdoc b: Oh I wanted to ask one thing , the microphones the new microphones , professor c: Yeah ? K . postdoc b: when do we get ,  ? grad f: they said it would take about a week . phd g: So what happens to our old microphones ? professor c: They go where old microphones go . grad f:  phd g: Do we give them to someone , or ? grad f: Well the only thing we 're gonna have extra , for now , phd g: We don't have more receivers , we just have grad f: Right , we don so the only thing we 'll have extra now is just the lapel . Since , what I decided to do , on Morgan 's suggestion , was just get two , new microphones , and try them out . grad f: Since they 're they 're like two hundred bucks a piece , we won't , at least try them out . phd d: So it 's a replacement for this headset mike ? grad f: Yep . phd d: What 's the , style of the headset ? grad f: It 's , it 's by Crown , and it 's one of these sort of mount around the ear thingies , and , when I s when I mentioned that we thought it was uncomfortable he said it was a common problem with the Sony . grad f: And I checked on the web , and every site I went to , raved about this particular mike . It 's apparently comfortable and stays on the head well , so we 'll see if it 's any good . postdoc b: You said it was used by aerobics instructors ? grad f:  Yep . professor c: For the recor for the record Adam is not a paid employee or a consultant of Crown . professor c: I said \" For the record Adam is is not a paid consultant or employee of Crown \" . grad f: The P Z Ms are Crown , aren't they ? professor c: Yeah . professor c: So if we go to a workshop about all this this it 's gonna be a meeting about meetings about meetings . professor c: Oh , yeah , what Which 'll be the meeting about the meeting about the meeting . grad f: Cuz then it would be a meeting about the meeting about the meeting about meetings . phd a: S s grad f: Pause between the lines , remember ? grad e: Excuse me <doc-sep>grad a: And you should be able to see which one which one you 're on by , watching the little bars change . grad a: So , actually , if you guys wanna go ahead and read digits now , as long as you 've signed the consent form , that 's alright . grad e: Are we supposed to read digits at the same time ? grad a: No . We 're talking about doing all at the same time but I think cognitively that would be really difficult . grad a: So , when you 're reading the digit strings , the first thing to do is just say which transcript you 're on . You can see the transcript ? There 's two large number strings on the digits ? So you would just read that one . And the pause is just so the person transcribing it can tell where one line ends and the other begins . And I 'll give I 'll read the digit strings first , so can see how that goes . Well , why don't I go ahead and read digit strings and then we can go on from there . All of you look like you 're doing it reasonably correctly , but you want it about two thumb widths away from your mouth , and then , at the corner . And that 's so that you minimize breath sounds , so that when you 're breathing , you don't breathe into the mike . And the short form  , you should read the consent form , but  , the thing to notice is that we will give you an opportunity to edit a all the transcripts . So , if you say things and you don't want them to be released to the general public , which , these will be available at some point to anyone who wants them , you 'll be given an opportunity by email , to bleep out any portions you don't like .  , should I Do you want me to talk at all about why we 're doing this and what this project is ? professor c: yeah . Oh grad e: Does Nancy know that we 're meeting in here ? grad b: I sent an email . So are the people going to be identified by name ? grad a: Well , what we 're gonna we 'll anonymize it in the transcript . So , then in terms of people worrying about , excising things from the transcript , it 's unlikely . Oh , I see , but the a but the but the grad a: Right , so if I said , \" Oh , hi Jerry , how are you ? \" , we 're not gonna go through and cancel out the \" Jerry \"s . grad a: so we will go through and , in the speaker ID tags there 'll be , you know , M - one O seven , M - one O eight . grad a: it w  , I don't know a good way of doing it on the audio , and still have people who are doing discourse research be able to use the data . grad a: And so we don't wanna have to do aliases professor c: Right . grad a: So I think that it 's better just as a pro post - process to edit out every time you bash Microsoft . The idea is that you 'd be able to put a PDA at the table at an impromptu meeting , and record it , and then be able to do querying and retrieval later on , on the meeting . So that 's my particular interest , is a portable device to do m  , information retrieval on meetings . And so what we wanted is a room that 's instrumented with both the table top microphones , and these are very high quality pressure zone mikes , as well as the close talking mikes . What the close talk ng talking mikes gives us is some ground truth , gives us , high quality audio , especially for people who aren't interested in the acoustic parts of this corpus . So , for people who are more interested in language , we didn't want to penalize them by having only the far field mikes available . So that 's why we 're recording in parallel with the close talking and the far field at the same time . And then , all these channels are recorded simultaneously and framed synchronously so that you can also do things like , beam - forming on all the microphones and do research like that . Our intention is to release this data to the public , probably through f through a body like the LDC . So because the general environment is so challenging , we decided to to do at least one set of digit strings to give ourselves something easier . And it 's exactly the same digit strings as in TI - digits , which is a common connected digits corpus . grad a: OK , so when the l last person comes in , just have them wear a wireless . So , the most important form is the consent form , so just be s be sure everyone signs that , if they consent . grad b: I 'm sure it 's pretty usual for meetings that people come late , grad a: Yeah . And  , just give me a call , which , my number 's up there when your meeting is over . grad a: And I 'm going to leave the mike here but it 's n  , but I 'm not gonna be on so don't have them use this one . So you guys who got email about this oh f  , Friday or something about what we 're up to . grad e: What was the nature of the email ? professor c: Oh , this was about  , inferring intentions from features in context , and the words , like \" s go to see \" , or \" visit \" , or some grad b: Wel - we I  I I professor c: You didn't get it ? grad e: I don't think I did . We could pursue , if we thought it 's it 's worth it but , I think we we will agree on that , to come up with a with a sort of very , very first crude prototype , and do some implementation work , and do some some research , and some modeling . So the idea is if you want to go somewhere , and focus on that object down Oh , I can actually walk with this . Now , we found in our , data and from experiments , that there 's three things you can do . If you want to actually go up or into the tower , you have to go this way , and then through some buildings and up some stairs and so forth . If you actually want to see the tower , and that 's what actually most people want to do , is just have a good look of it , take a picture for the family , you have to go this way , and go up here . grad b: or so That 's ab er , i the street network of our geographic information system . It would always use the closest point to the object , and then the tourists would be faced , you know , in front of a wall , but it would do them absolutely no good . grad e: What 's it what 's it made out of ? grad b: r red limestone . Okay , I This ,  These intentions , we w w we could , if we want to , call it the the Vista mode , where we just want to eh s get the overview or look at it , the Enter mode , and the , well , Tango mode . So But sometimes the the Tango mode is really relevant in the in the sense that , if you want to ,  If you don't have the intention of entering your building , but you know that something is really close to it , and you just want to approach it , or get to that building . Consider , for example , the Post Office in Chicago , a building so large that it has its own zip code . So , I 've looked , through twenty some  , I didn't look through all the data .  , and there there 's  , a lot more different ways in people  , the ways people phrase how to g get if they want to get to a certain place . Maybe I should go back a couple of steps and go through the professor c: No , OK come in , sit down . grad b: Is I I think grad e: No , that one 's already on , I thought he said .  , people , when they w when they want to go to a building , sometimes they just want to look at it . I I gave an example where the point where you end up if you want to look at it is completely different from where if you want to enter it . So , this is sort of how people may ,  may phrase those requests to a a a mock - up system at least that 's the way they did it . And we get tons of of these \" how do I get to \" , \" I want to go to \" , but also , \" give me directions to \" , and \" I would like to see \" . And  , what we can sort of do , if we look closer a closer at the the data That was the wrong one . This is of course a crucial factor , \" what type of object is it ? \" So , some buildings you just don't want to take pictures of . Sometimes I found in the  , looking at the data , in a superficial way , I found some s sort of modifiers that that m may also give us a hint , \" I 'm trying to get to \" Nuh ? \" I need to get to \" . Sort of hints to the fact that you 're not really sightseeing and and just f there for pleasure and so forth and so on . That whatever it is you 're doing at the moment may also inter influence the interpretation of of a phrase . What we do know , is that the parser we use in the SmartKom system will never differentiate between any of these . So it 's it 's it 's way too crude to d capture those differences in intentions . So , I thought , \" Mmm ! Maybe for a deep understanding task , that 's a nice sort of playground or first little thing . \" Where we can start it and n sort of look \" OK , we need , we gonna get those M - three - L structures . We may need additional part of speech , or maybe just some information on the verb , and modifiers , auxiliaries . And I will try to to sort of come up with a list of factors that we need to get out of there , and maybe we want to get a g switch for the context . So this is not something which we can actually monitor , now , but just is something we can set . And then you can all imagine sort of a a constrained satisfaction program , depending on on what , comes out . We want to have an a structure resulting if we feed it through a belief - net or or something along those lines . We 'd get an inferred intention , we we produce a structure that differentiates between the Vista , the Enter , and the , Tango mode . So we think it 's a well - formed , starter task for this , deeper understanding in the tourist domain . grad f: So , where exactly is the , deeper understanding being done ? Like  , s is it before the Bayes - net ? Is it ,  professor c: Well , it 's the it 's it 's always all of it . But it 's deep enough that you can distinguish between these th three quite different kinds of , going to see some tourist thing . And , so that 's that 's the quote \" deep \" that we 're trying to get at . And , Robert 's point is that the current front - end doesn't give you any way to Not only doesn't it do it , but it also doesn't give you enough information to do it . It isn't like , if you just took what the front - end gives you , and used some clever inference algorithm on it , you would be able to figure out which of these is going on . So , and this is Bu - I in general it 's gonna be true of any kind of deep understanding , there 's gonna be contextual things , there 're gonna be linguistic things , there 're gonna be discourse things , and they gotta be combined . And , my idea on how to combine them is with a belief - net , although it may turn out that t some totally different thing is gonna work better .  , the idea would be that you , take your You 're editing your slide ? grad b: Yeah . So the thing is , i  , d naively speaking , you 've you 've got a for this little task , a belief - net , which is going to have as output , the conditional pr probability of one of three things , that the person wants to  , to View it , to Enter it , or to Tango with it . And , then the question is there are two questions is , one , where do you get this i information from , and two , what 's the structure of the belief - net ? So what are the conditional probabilities of this , that , and the other , given these things ? And you probably need intermediate nodes . So it may well be that , for example , that , knowing whether Oh , another thing you want is some information abou I think , about the time of day . And , if things are obviously closed , then , you grad b: People won't want to enter it . And , if it 's not obvious , you may want to actually  , point out to people that it 's closed you know , what they 're g going to is closed and they don't have the option of entering it . grad b: s b professor c: So another thing that can come up , and will come up as soon as you get serious about this is , that another option of course is to have a more of a dialogue . So one thing you could do is build a little system that , said , \" whenever you got a question like that I 've got one of three answers . grad b: But maybe that 's a false state of the system , that it 's too close to call . You want the you want the ability to a You want the ability to ask , but what you don't wanna do is onl build a system that always asks every time , and i That 's not getting at the scientific problem , grad b:   professor c: and it 's In general you 're you know , it 's gonna be much more complex than that .  , I think also the the the deep understanding part of it is is going to be in there to the extent that we  , want it in terms of our modeling . We can start , you know , basic from human beings , model that , its motions , going , walking , seeing , we can mem model all of that and then compose whatever inferences o we make out of these really conceptual primitives . S so so the way that might come up , if you wanna Suppose you wanted to do that , you might say , \"  , as an intermediate step in your belief - net , is there a Source - Path - Goal schema involved ? \" OK ? And if so , is there a focus on the goal ? Or is there a focus on the path ? or something . And that could be , one of the conditiona you know , th the In some piece of the belief - net , that could be the the appropriate thing to enter . grad f: So , where would we extract that information from ? From the M - three - L ? professor c: No . See , the M - three - L is not gonna give th What he was saying is , the M - three - L does not have any of that . grad e: The M - three - L is the old SmartKom output ? professor c: Right . professor c: So we have th w we we we have to have a better w way of referring to grad b: The parser output ? professor c:   grad b: \" Analyzed speech \" I think it 's what they call it , professor c: Yeah . grad b: o th No , actually , intention lattices is what we 're gonna get . professor c: Is - i but they c they call it intention lattice , but tha grad b: In - in a intention lattice k Hypothesis . So , th they 're gonna give us some cr  or We can assume that y you get this crude information . And they don't give you the kind of object , they don't give you any discourse history , if you want to keep that you have to keep it somewhere else . grad e: So , if someone says , \" I wanna touch the side of the Powder - Tower \" , that would basically , we need to pop up Tango mode and the and the directions ? professor c: If i if Yeah , if it got as simple as that , yeah . But that doesn't necessarily But we 'd have to infer a Source - Path - Goal to some degree for touching the side , right ? grad b: Well  , th the there is a p a point there if I understand you . \" Where is the city hall ? \" And this do they don't wanna sh see it on a map , or they don't wanna know it 's five hundred yards away from you , or that it 's to the your north . Where is that damn thing ? grad e: And the parser would output grad b: Well , that 's a a question mark . sh A lot of parsers , just ,  That 's way beyond their scope , is of interpreting that . You know ? But  , still outcome w the outcome will be some form of structure , with the town hall and maybe saying it 's a WH focus on the town hall . grad e: I 'm just trying to figure out what the SmartKom system would output , depending on these things . grad b: it will probably tell you how far away it is , at least that 's That 's even what Deep Map does . Because i we can not differentiate , at the moment , between , you know , the intention of wanting to go there or the intention of just know wanting to know where where it is . grad d: People no might not be able to infer that either , right ? Like the fact Like , I could imagine if someone came up to me and asked , \" Where 's the city hall ? \" , I might say , g ar \" Are you trying to get there ? \" Because how I describe  , t its location  , p probably depend on whether I think I should give them , you know , directions now , or say , you know , whatever , \" It 's half a mile away \" or something like that . grad b: because where people ask you , \" Where is New York ? \" , you will tell them it 's on the East Coast . grad b: Y y eh you won't tell them how to get there , ft you know , take that bus to the airport and blah - blah - blah . grad b: But if it 's the post office , you will tell them how to get there . professor c: But i Go go back to the the  , th grad b: So I w this is \" onto \" is is knowledge about buildings , professor c: Yeah , that slide . grad b: their opening times , and then t coupled with time of day , this should You know . grad d: So that context was like , their presumed purpose context , i like business or travel , as well as the utterance context , like , \" I 'm now standing at this place at this time \" . professor c: Yeah , well I think we ought to d a As we have all along , d We we 've been distu distinguishing between situational context , which is what you have as context , and discourse context , grad b:   And , so what we were talking about doing , a a as a first shot , is not doing any of the linguistics . So , the the the reason the belief - net is in blue , is the notion would be  , this may be a bad dis bad idea , but the idea is to take as a first goal , see if we could actually build a belief - net that would make this three way distinction  , in a plausible way , given these We have all these transcripts and we 're able to , by hand , extract the features to put in the belief - net . Saying , \" Aha ! here 're the things which , if you get them out of out of the language and discourse , and put them into the belief - net , it would tell you which of these three  , intentions is most likely . \" And if to actually do that , build it ,  you know , run it y y run it on the data where you hand - transcribe the parameters .  th th i i if you can't do this task ,  grad b: We need a different , engine . Well it i I if it if it 's the belief - nets , we we 'll switch to you know , logic or some terrible thing , but I don't think that 's gonna be the case . I think that , if we can get the information , a belief - net is a perfectly good way of doing the inferential combination of it . The real issue is , do what are the factors involved in determining this ? And I don't know . grad d: I missed the beginning , but ,  I guess could you back to the slide , the previous one ? So , is it that it 's ,  These are all factors that  , a These are the ones that you said that we are going to ignore now ? or that we want to take into account ? You were saying n professor c: Take them into account . And and it 's clear from the data , like , sorta the correct answer in each case . professor c: Let 's go back to th Let 's go back to the the the slide of data . grad d: That 's that 's the thing I 'm curious ab grad b:  grad d: Like do we know from the data wh which OK . But , since we are designing a a a an , compared to this , even bigger data collection effort , we will definitely take care to put it in there , grad d:   grad b: in some shape , way , form over the other , grad d:   grad b: to see whether we can , then , get sort of empirically validated data . grad b: from this , we can sometimes , you know an and that 's that but that isn't that what we need for a belief - net anyhow ? is sort of s sometimes when people want to just see it , they phrase it more like this ? But it doesn't exclude anybody from phrasing it totally differently , even if they still grad d:   grad b: But then other factors may come into play that change the outcome of their belief - net . And I 'm sure even i the most , sort of , deliberate data collection experiment will never give you data that say , \" Well , if it 's phrased like that , the intention is this . grad b: You know , because then , you grad d: u u  , the only way you could get that is if you were to give th the x subjects a task . Right ? Where you have where your , current goal is to grad b: We Yeah ! That 's what we 're doing . grad d:  grad b: But but we will still get the phrasing all over the place . So , I think you all know this , but we are going to actually use this little room grad d:  professor c: and start recording subjects probably within a month or something . So , this is not any lo any of you guys ' worry , except that we may want to push that effort to get information we need . If it turns out that we need data of a certain sort , then the sort of data collection branch can be , asked to do that . And one of the reasons why we 're recording the meeting for these guys is cuz we want their help when we d we start doing  , recording of subjects . No , you you will not have , and there it is , and ,  But you know , y y the ,  grad d: And I think the other concern that has come up before , too , is if it 's  I don't know if this was collected what situation this data was collected in . Was it is it the one that you showed in your talk ? Like people grad b: No , no . So was this , like , someone actually mobile , like s using a device ? grad b: N no , no not i it was mobile but not not with a w a real wizard system . But , is it I guess I don't know The situation of of collecting th the data of , like Here you could imagine them being walking around the city . And then you have all sorts of other c situational context factors that would influence w how to interpret , like you said , the scope and things like that . grad d: If they 're doing it in a you know , \" I 'm sitting here with a map and asking questions \" , I I would imagine that the data would be really different . But It was never th th the goal of that data collection to to serve for sat for such a purpose . So that 's why for example the tasks were not differentiated by intentionality , grad d:    I 'm sure we can produce some if we need it , that that will help us along those lines . So , to Finding out what , you know , situational con what the contextual factors of the situation really are , you know is an interesting s interesting thing . grad b: u u Sort of I 'm , at the moment , curious and I 'm I 'm s w want to approach it from the end where we can s sort of start with this toy system that we can play around with , grad d:   grad b: so that we get a clearer notion of what input we need for that , grad d:   And then we can start worrying about where to get this input , what what do we need , you know Ultimately once we are all experts in changing that parser , for example , maybe , there 's just a couple three things we need to do and then we get more whatever , part of speech and more construction - type - like stuff out of it . grad e: How exactly does the data collection work ? Do they have a map , and then you give them a scenario of some sort ? grad b: OK . You 're gonna be in here , and somebody And and you see , either th the three - D model , or  , a QuickTime animation of standing u in a square in Heidelberg . So , just off a textbook , tourist guide , to familiarize , yourself with that sort of odd - sounding German street names , like Fischergasse and so forth . Part two is , you 're told that this huge new , wonderful computer system exists , that can y tell you everything you want to know , and it understands you completely . And so you 're gonna pick up that phone , dial a number , and you get a certain amount of tasks that you have to solve . First you have to know find out how to get to that place , maybe with the intention of buying stamps in there . Maybe So , the next task is to get to a certain place and take a picture for your grandchild . It crashes , And grad d: a At the third ? Right then ? grad b: After the third task . And then , a human operator comes on , and and exp apologizes that the system has crashed , but , you know , urges you to continue , you know ? now with a human operator . And so , you have basically the same tasks again , just with different objects , and you go through it again , and that was it . Oh , and one one little bit w And  , the computer you are you are being told the computer system knows exactly where you are , via GPS . And so you have to do some s tell the person sort of where you are , depending on what you see there .  , this is a a a a a bit that I d I don't think we Did we discuss that bit ?  , I just sort of squeezed that in now . grad d: So , in the display you can Oh , you said that you cou you might have a display that shows , like , the grad b: Yeah . grad d: And so , as you grad b: n grad d: Oh , two - D . grad d: So as you move through it that 's - they just track it on the for themselves grad b: Yeah . So grad b: Yeah ?  that would be an an an enormous technical effort , unless we would We can show it walks to , you know . grad b: And you see the label of the name So we get those names , pronunciation stuff , and so forth , and we can change that . So your tasks don't require you to  ,  yo you 're told So when your task is , I don't know , \" Go buy stamps \" or something like that ? So , do you have to respond ? or does your  , what are you ste what are you supposed to be telling the system ? Like , w what you 're doing now ? or grad b: Well , we 'll see what people do . grad d: There 's no OK , so it 's just like , \" Let 's figure out what they would say under the circumstances \" . grad b: in both cases it 's gonna be a human , in the computer , and in the operator case . grad b: And we will re there will be some dialogue , you know ? So , you first have to do this , and that , grad d: Yep . But  , maybe the maybe what you 're suggesting Is what you 're suggesting that it might be too poor , the data , if we sort of limit it to this ping pong one t  , task results in a question and then there 's an answer and that 's the end of the task ? You wanna m have it more more steps , sort of ? grad d: Yeah , I I don't know how much direction is given to the subject about what their interaction  , th they 're unfamiliar w with interacting with the system .  , we we have to have this discussion of th the experiment , and the data collection , and all that sorta stuff grad d:  - huh . Sh - Is sh grad d: She started taking the class last year and then didn't  , you know , didn't continue . So , anyway , she 's looking for some more part time work w while she 's waiting actually for graduate school . So we may have someone , to do this , and she 's got you know , some background in in all this stuff . That 's So , Nancy , we 'll have an At some point we 'll have another discussion on exactly wha t t you know , how that 's gonna go . professor c: And  , Jane , but also , Liz have offered to help us do this , data collection and design and stuff . professor c: So , when we get to that we 'll have some people doing it that know what they 're doing . I guess the reason I was asking about the sort of the de the details of this kind of thing is that , it 's one thing to collect data for , I don't know , speech recognition or various other tasks that have pretty c clear correct answers , but with intention  , obviously , as you point out , there 's a lot of di other factors and I 'm not really sure , how how e the question of how to make it a t appropriate toy version of that  , it 's ju it 's just hard . So , obviously it 's a grad e: Yeah , actually I guess that was my question . Is the intention implicit in the scenario that 's given ? Like , do the grad d: It is , if they have these tasks that they 're supposed to grad e: Yeah , I just wasn't sure to what level of detail the task was . professor c: the The problem that I was tr gonna try to focus on today was , let 's suppose by magic you could collect dialogues in which , one way or the other , you were able to , figure out both the intention , and set the context , and know what language was used . The issue is , can we find a way to , basically , featurize it so that we get some discrete number of features so that , when we know the values to all those features , or as many as possible , we can w come up with the best estimate of which of the , in this case three little intentions , are most likely . grad d: w What are the t three intentions ? Is it to go there , to see it , and grad b: To come as close as possible to it . professor c: Th - the terminology we 're using is to grad d: Yeah , it 's @ @ . \" Take a picture of it \" you you might well want to be a really rather different place than entering it . professor c: And , for an object that 's at all big , sort of getting to the nearest part of it  , could be quite different than either of those . professor c: Just sort of grad d: OK , so now I understand the referent of Tango mode . grad b: S To \" Waltz \" it ? grad d: Yeah , like , how close are you gonna be ? professor c: Well . So grad f: All these So , like , the question is how what features can like , do you wanna try to extract from , say , the parse or whatever ? professor c: Right . grad f: Like , the presence of a word or the presence of a certain  , stem , or certain construction or whatever . Is there a construction , or the kind of object , or w  , anything else that 's in the si It 's either in the in the s the discourse itself or in the context . So if it turns out that , whatever it is , you want to know whether the person 's  , a tourist or not , OK ? that becomes a feature . But fo for the current problem , it would just be , \" OK , if you can be sure that it 's a tourist , versus a businessman , versus a native , \" or something , that would give you a lot of discriminatory power and then just have a little section in your belief - net that said , \" pppt ! \" Though sin f in the short run , you 'd set them , grad f:   professor c: and see ho how it worked , and then in the longer run , you would figure out how you could derive them . So , how should What 's the  , plan ? Like , how should we go about figuring out these professor c: OK . So , first of all is , do e either of you guys , you got a favorite belief - net that you 've , you know , played with ? JavaBayes or something ? grad f: Oh . OK ? So y so one of th one of the things we wanna do is actually , pick a package , doesn't matter which one , presumably one that 's got good interactive abilities , cuz a lot of what we 're gonna be d You know , we don't need the one that 'll solve massive , belief - nets quickly . Because i that 's A lot of what it 's gonna be , is , playing with this . So that if if we have all these cases OK ? So we make up cases that have these features , OK , and then you 'd like to be able to say , \" OK , here 's a bunch of cases \" There 're even ones tha that you can do learning OK ? So you have all their cases and and their results and you have a algorithms to go through and run around trying to set the the probabilities for you .  , my guess is we aren't gonna have enough data that 's good enough to make the these data fitting ones worth it , but I don't know . OK , and you wanna it s You know , the standard things you want it stable , you want it yeah , @ @ . And , as soon as we have one , we can start trying to , make a first cut at what 's going on . OK ? We we have a we know what the outcomes are gonna be , and we have some some data that 's loose , we can use our own intuition , and see how hard it is , and , importantly , what intermediate nodes we think we need . So it if it turns out that just , thinking about the problem , you come up with things you really need to You know , this is the kind of thing that is , you know , an intermediate little piece in your belief - net . grad b: And it and it may serve as a platform for a person , maybe me , or whoever , who is interested in doing some linguistic analysis .  , w we have the For - FrameNet group here , and we can see what they have found out about those concepts already , that are contained in the data , you know , to come up with a nice little set of features and  , maybe even means of s  , extracting them . And and that altogether could also be  , become a nice paper that 's going to be published somewhere , if we sit down and write it . And  When you said JavaBayes belief - net you were talking about ones that run on coffee ? or that are in the program language Java ? professor c: No , th It turns out that there is a ,  The new end of Java libraries . I have no idea whether that 's  The obvious advantage of that is that you can then , relatively easily , get all the other Java packages for GUIs or whatever else you might want to do . professor c: So that i that 's I think why a lot of people doing research use that . But it may not be I have no idea whether that 's the best choice an and there 're plenty of people around , students in the department who , you know , live and breathe Bayes - nets . So , grad d: There 's the m tool kit that  , Kevin Murphy has developed , professor c: Right . I don't know I don't know whether you guys have met Kevin yet or not , grad b:   grad b: But i But since we all probably are pretty sure that , the professor c: Yeah . And the ontology that  ,  the student is is constructing for me back in in EML is in OIL and that 's also in XML . And so that 's where a lot of knowledge about bakeries , about hotels , about castles and stuff is gonna come from . grad b: so , if it has that IO capability and if it 's a Java package , it will definitely be able We can couple . grad b: Who isn't , nuh ? professor c: So , in terms of of interchanging in and out of any module we build , It 'll be XML . And if you 're going off to queries to the ontology , for example , you 'll have to deal with its interface . But that 's that 's fine an and  , all of these things have been built with much bigger projects than this in mind . It 's kind of blackboards and multi - wave blackboards and ways of interchanging and registering your a And so forth .  if we can get the core of the thing to work , in a way that we 're comfortable with , then we ca we can get in and out of it with , XML , little descriptors . Yeah , I like , for example , the what you said about the getting input from from just files about where you h where you have the data , have specified the features and so forth . professor c: I don't I don't see grad b: That 's , of course , easy also to do with , you know , XML . grad b: So r professor c: That that  , you know , feature value XML format is probably as good a way as any . So it 's als Yeah , I guess it 's also worth , while you 're poking around , poke around for XML packages that  , do things you 'd like . grad f: Doesn't does SmartKom system have such packages ? grad b: Yeah . It 's also professor c: And the question is , d you c you you 'll have to l We 'll have to l That should be ay We should be able to look at that grad b: No , u u y  the What I What sort of came to my mind i is was the notion of an idea that if if there are l nets that can actually lear try to set their own , probability factors based on on on on input professor c: Yeah . grad b: which is in file format , if we , get really w wild on this , we may actually want to use some some corpora that other people made and , for example , if if they are in in MATE , then we get X M L documents with discourse annotations , t you know , t from the discourse act down to the phonetic level . grad b: Michael has a project where you know , recognizing discourse acts and he does it all in MATE , and so they 're actually annotating data and data and data . So if we w if we think it 's worth it one of these days , not not with this first prototype but maybe with a second , and we have the possibility of of taking input that 's generated elsewhere and learn from that , that 'd be nice . professor c: It 'd be nice , but but I I I do I don't wanna count on it .  , you can't you can't run your project based on the speculation that that the data will come , grad b: No , no , just for professor c: and you don't have to actually design the nets . So in terms of of the ,  the what the SmartKom gives us for M - three - L packages , it could be that they 're fine , or it could be eeh . professor c: it 's ,  It doesn't control what you do in you know , internally . grad b:  grad e: What 's the time frame for this ? grad b: Two days ? Two , three days ? professor c: Huh ? Yeah bu w I 'd like that this y yeah , this week , to ha to n to have y guys , you know , pick the y you know , belief - net package grad b: No . professor c: and tell us what it is , and give us a pointer so we can play with it or something . professor c: And , then as soon as we have it , I think we should start trying to populate it for this problem . Make a first cut at , you know , what 's going on , and probably the ea easiest way to do that is some on - line way .  , you can f figure out whether you wanna make it a web site or You know , how grad b:  I I I  , OK , I t Yeah . grad b: But  , maybe it might be interesting if if the two of you can agree on who 's gonna be the speaker next Monday , to tell us something about the net you picked , and what it does , and how it does that . grad b: So that will be sort of the assignment for next week , is to to for slides and whatever net you picked and what it can do and and how far you 've gotten . Pppt ! professor c: Well , I 'd like to also , though , ha have a first cut at what the belief - net looks like . OK ? So , you know , here a here are grad e: So we 're supposed to @ @ about features and whatnot , professor c: Right . professor c: And , as I said , what I 'd like to do is , what would be really great is you bring it in If if if we could , in the meeting , say , you know , \" Here 's the package , here 's the current one we have , \"  , you know , \" What other ideas do you have ? \" and then we can think about this idea of making up the data file . Of , you know , get a t a p tentative format for it , let 's say XML , that says , l you know , \" These are the various scenarios we 've experienced . \" We can just add to that and there 'll be this this file of them and when you think you 've got a better belief - net , You just run it against this ,  this data file . grad e: And what 's the relation to this with Changing the table so that the system works in English ? grad b: OK . I 've downloaded them both , and I started to unpack the Linux one  , the NT one worked fine . and I started unta pack the Linux one , it told me that I can't really unpack it because it contains a future date . Now ,  Then it will be my job to get this whole thing running both on Swede and on this machine . And then  Hopefully that hoping that my urgent message will now come through to Ralph and Tilman that it will send some more documentation along , we I control p Maybe that 's what I will do next Monday is show the state and show the system and show that .  , what one hopes is that when we understand how the analyzer works , we can both worry about converting it to English and worry about how it could ex extract the parameters we need for the belief - net . So we 're gonna do belief - nets this week , and then professor c: Oh , yeah . n None of this is i n Neither of these projects has got a real tight time - line , in the sense that over the next month there 's a there 's a deliverable . If if you know , if we don't get any information for these guys f for several weeks then we aren't gonna sit around , you know , wasting time , trying to do the problem or guess what they You know , just pppt ! go on and do other things . grad b: Yeah , but  but the  This point is really I think very , very valid that ultimately we hope that that both will merge into a harmonious and , wonderful , state where we can not only do the bare necessities , IE , changing the table so it does exactly in English what it does in German , but also that we can sort of have the system where we can say , \" OK , this is what it usually does , and now we add this little thing to it \" , you know ? whatever , Johno 's and Bhaskara 's great belief - net , and we plug it in , and then for these certain tasks , and we know that navigational tasks are gonna be a core domain of the new system , it all all of a sudden it does much better . Nuh ? Because it can produce better answers , tell the person , as I s showed you on this map , n you know , produce either you know , a red line that goes to the Vista point or a red line that goes to the Tango point or red line that goes to the door , which would be great . So not only can you show that you know something sensible but ultimately , if you produce a system like this , it takes the person where it wants to go .  So this was actually an actual problem that we encountered , which nobody have has because car navigation systems don't really care . grad b: If you go d If you wanna drive to the SAP in Waldorf , I 'm sure the same is true of Microsoft , it takes you to the the address , whatever , street number blah - blah - blah , you are miles away from the entrance . professor c: Probably not then , cuz y you probably can't drop the mail there anyway . So , you two , who 'll be working on this , li are are you gl will you be doing Well ,  are you supposed to just do it by thinking about the situation ? Can you use the sample data ? professor c: Of course they use the sample data . grad d: Is it like Yeah , ho is there more than Is there a lot s of sample data that is beyond what you what you have there ? grad b: There there 's more than I showed , but  , I think this is sort of  , in part my job to look at that and and to see whether there are features in there that can be extracted , grad d: Yeah . grad b: and to come up with some features that are not you know , empirically based on on a real experiment or on on on reality grad d: Right . grad b: but sort of on your intuition of you know , \" Aha ! This is maybe a sign for that , grad d:   We can end the meeting and call Adam , and then we wanna s look at some filthy pictures of Heidelberg . professor c: is that OK ? grad b: And that 's why , when it was hit by  , a cannon ball , it exploded . I first thought it had something to do with the material that it w that 's why I asked <doc-sep>"

        "Summary": "The remote control design should prioritize functionality, with a focus on a comfortable fit, clear and obvious functions, and legible text. The appearance of the remote should be visually appealing and eye-catching. To meet the Christmas deadline and stay ahead of competition, the remote needs to be in the market soon. The trend for that year was fruit and vegetable shapes, along with a soft and spongy feel. The star features of the remote should be narrowed down to one or two, with voice recognition as a potential option. Marketing identified three key findings: a fancy look and feel, innovative technology, and high ease of use. They aimed to combine these findings with the trendy fruit and vegetable theme and sponge material, while considering the preferences of both the elder and young markets. Specific topics discussed included color design, related symbols and pictures, and the placement of the business logo. Marketing highlighted three main inspirations: the customer's desire for fashion in electronics, the simplicity of technology, and the importance of aesthetics in the remote's shape and color. Evaluation criteria were established, focusing on a fancy look and feel, innovativeness, and ease of use. The Industrial Designer and User Interface teams scored the prototypes, with emphasis on look and feel, innovativeness, and ease of use. The decision was made to create a remote control without an LCD screen, improving the design to make it more visually appealing. All functions would be included in the same set, but some, like speech recognition, would be optional. The team would also explore different shapes and materials for the remote.",
        "Article": "marketing: Where are are all the other presentations ? industrial designer: I just put it in the in the shared folder so it should be marketing: The conceptual or industrial designer: yeah I think so . Because I see only my own presentation user interface: industrial designer: No no no , can you go back one ? marketing: yeah . industrial designer:  'cause it has to be PowerPoint pre yeah components design , that's it . industrial designer: 'cause I knew that I didn't have time so I just copy and paste everything into the user interface: marketing: Ah , project manager: Ah . marketing: I can't cut and paste it into the other folder but project manager: You can look at the final report , 'cause I have to record everything we are deciding and such , so I'm trying to write it down between everything else . industrial designer: Sometimes I have these pop-ups or these sounds and there's nothing there , marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: and also with I don't know how to use PowerPoint , so it takes me forever to get something done with it .  we have again three presentations and then we have to decide on what concepts the mobile phone has to  f the remote control has to support . project manager: Yes ? industrial designer: Who wants to start ? marketing: Me first again or project manager: Yeah sure . So  the developments I will address them project manager: marketing: oh yeah well this is the fruit and vegetables looks of fresh bright colours .  Well the first aspect  was twice as important as the second aspect,w which was twice as important as the third aspect . user interface: marketing:  nothing about the buttons but just sponge kind of thing , and and some fruit and colours user interface: Yeah . Yeah you're just the user interface  ? user interface: It's better than than my  drawing . And I used  possibilities from our manufacturing department about current components which will have to be implemented in the design .  I could not drag the pictures into the the slides so s so I don't have examples of how it looks like . But it comes down to what you  what you think we should do with the spongey and the fruity looking  type . If you , the young dynamic people want soft primary colours  , which looks like fruits you know , you can and shapes that are curved and not  solid straight lines anymore . user interface: project manager: industrial designer: There's a lot of options that we have to discuss .  we have a hand dynamo , which we yeah we Dutch refer to it as the kneipgatt . industrial designer:  the kinetic provision of energy which means if you move the thing , if you shake it . project manager: industrial designer: Which will be fun for toddlers right , if they wanna use the project manager: marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: yeah also also in you know countries where there's n isn't much light like in Scandinavia , they wouldn't be y able to use it half of the year you know .  I wasn't able to finish my  personal preferences sheet , but well you know that we will have to go for the double curved 'cause it's daring and different from what we have now . industrial designer: Well we have all kinds of hard  materials like the the hard plastic , the wood and the titanium .  we can use a scroll buttons for the menus , but we already kind of decided to go for the f for the pushbuttons , for the the arrow buttons . industrial designer: Electronics ? Yeah , maybe we wanna decide on what electronics to use the advanced chip I think is easiest to implement  for the production , 'cause they they can print it better . I first  chose for the battery , 'cause yeah I'm traditional and that's the most obvious , easiest choice to go to . user interface: Or combine  both with a with one  project manager:  I think you can only fit one  source of energy on the industrial designer: Yeah maybe we marketing: I guess we can only choose one . But it is more longlasting , that the people don't have to ever buy batteries again . I always chuck my  remote control around , so marketing: Yeah , just playing with it project manager: Yeah . It can be done , you can't harm it , project manager: S yeah it's safe . industrial designer: You don't have to be scared about bouncing it off the g floor and breaking it or whatever . marketing: So double curved is like this , this , this , or industrial designer: No it means curved in two dimensions . So  w single curved ?  let's say would be a b square box , but then with curves on one dimension . So  Yeah  yeah that's one thing  which I'm not sure  of how to implement it  into the remote control . project manager: Well the visual representation is not there with speech industrial designer: Design ? user interface: No okay but it has to be combined with with the menu  for functions and project manager: but you can Yeah . user interface: But do  j do we  do the speech just for the basic options , for the simple buttons ? project manager: Both . Everybody says it so that's what's  yeah  Yeah in the in the last  meeting we  we were yeah putting the the simple and the advanced options separated . And only the the L_C_D_ panel will  light up and then you can only  change the yeah the options . project manager: user interface: you have to  delete this but this is the the the simple  layout . user interface:  display on the upper side with the the menu button and maybe a some sort of cancel button or save button . project manager: You did read the minutes I wrote ? user interface:  project manager: You did read the minutes I wrote ? user interface: What ? A little bit I think but not not everything w industrial designer: I project manager: Oh okay 'cause I pretty much summed up all the buttons there were . user interface: But But this is the the basic  design  for the for the m yeah for the buttons . And  if there are older people they wanted more  yeah more  luxurous so that's an a also an option . Okay so what we have to decide is what kind of components do we use ?  energy source , chip type , case type . industrial designer: Yeah we need the the chip on print to be able to support the the screen and  and f audio function . industrial designer: I'm just thinking , this is not my department , but I I'm not sure what this is gonna cost , marketing: Kinetic . industrial designer: to be able to m project manager:  I didn't get any info on this . industrial designer: That's gonna be difficult huh ? marketing: The cost of making it should be twelve and a half ? project manager: I have total here . project manager: Yeah the interface , maybe can user interface:  it's it's quite difficult because we we haven't got all the options  yeah .  do you have a picture of doubly curved case ? And could you put that in the group folder ? Of the project folder . marketing: If you go to your homepage or something , you should industrial designer: Yeah I'm going there now . marketing: I got my fresh and fyoo fruity  picture  also  over there , so project manager: Ah you didn't draw it yourself . industrial designer: S see this is the the the standard traditional type , where the form  yeah serves the function , you know . industrial designer: where your thumbs would be laying in the instrument and it has to be nice to hold . And user interface: But it has also to it it has also to be  luxurous  for for yeah rich people . industrial designer: Yeah but that's that's the the problem  yeah the dilemma actually , project manager: Distinction . industrial designer: 'cause we wanna appeal to the to the young public with fancy with flashy colours , and with a lot of shape . industrial designer: Yeah , and the and the rubber , it it will look cheap always , user interface: The colour Yeah . Okay but the the colours , you you can make it  make the colours with LEDs  beneath the the buttons . user interface: If you press a button and you can disable the the colour LEDs for for people that don't like it . industrial designer: To customise it and so  kids can make it look more flashy with different kinds of colours user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and people who want something , you know , different , or more  design , they can go for one colour project manager: Different . marketing: industrial designer: Just give me the thing that it's inside there project manager: Yeah but this this the is for the . industrial designer: A compromise between what ? project manager:  instead of doubly curved we take a single curved . marketing: Yeah so we keep it singly c single curved then ? project manager: Yeah that would be an option . industrial designer: And I I'm I'm thinking  you know  a drawing palette , where you have the shape for your thumb . user interface: Yeah but if you if you make it more curved we we can make more and more options for buttons . user interface: If you have  it have it in your hand , you you you are not only  yeah you don't need one dimension but you can use other dimensions for pressing the the buttons . Something to shoot at your television industrial designer: Yeah or that that is the confirmation button or something , project manager: industrial designer: That would be a nice way to use it but  , yeah , I'm thinking big already , and we need something that well that that you can able to use in one hand I think . marketing: Maybe because the the screen is on top you can have project manager: To switch from buttons to interface  . industrial designer: How about marketing: Well well you have it in your hand so it's a kind of an angle from your eyes to the screen . And the buttons are more , well it's very thick now but industrial designer: Yeah I understand what you mean . marketing: That's  that's industrial designer: How about we do a  a pop-up screen , like the laptop . marketing: Yeah ? That that you can press it and then it comes up ? Or industrial designer: And then if you want project manager:  so you have a the the side view . marketing:  maybe it's too much project manager: make this industrial designer: No  like project manager: . industrial designer: Yeah or preferably even keep the simple buttons here , and then under the screen even you could put more more advanced buttons . user interface: But you you want industrial designer: F for the L_C_D_ menu right ? user interface: okay . industrial designer: So w w project manager: No not all because you need most of them , the arrow buttons . project manager: and you can maybe even drop the menu button because maybe if you flip it open it will auto activate amauto   automatically . Yeah and it says menu and it flips open and then you have the buttons to control it , in combination with your user interface: That's but it's it's not industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: Well yeah the the idea of it was , is that because you close it , you cover the L_C_D_ screen and it won't be vulnerable to scratches or whatever . marketing: An adv an adv and it will be covered in some kind of  thin rubber layer or something like that . industrial designer: That actually will offer some extra protection for the project manager: Okay but then we still have the the the thing of the the the shape . project manager: What kind of industrial designer: Yeah I was thinking , if if you have your hand , it this is your th project manager: Harder . marketing: Yeah the lower part doesn't work I guess , so maybe you should try it over there . project manager: industrial designer: That you , that it would be kind of shape like this , you know . So it's easier to hold in your hand , to y f user interface: But when you are left-handed , that's that's a problem . user interface: But that's that's very expensive  industrial designer: Like like you drew here . user interface: We we could make some some rubber  some rubber  yeah mouse , with which you can change  industrial designer:  project manager: Oh yeah . marketing: we have to make industrial designer: Yeah but we have hardware inside , which is so it has to have some sort of basic shape . marketing: Yeah we we better so choose one industrial designer: And also the screen , you cannot mould it . marketing: But that's the kind of the idea , industrial designer: And then you can marketing: so it lays good in the hand , and then on on the side with with your thumb , industrial designer: You can place the screen here , which can come . marketing: yeah , you can use the button option project manager: So the keywords are primary co colours , spongey ? industrial designer: And but then I w I would marketing: Spongey . marketing: Spongey can be reached by means of industrial designer: Those buttons ? And the simple buttons here , user interface: . And and the and the control thngs in the middle ? The the the arrows ? industrial designer: I  y eah that's what  . industrial designer: or do we wanna make its shape look like a banana or something ? user interface: industrial designer: I dunno . project manager: Yeah that's user interface: marketing:  bananas wierd shape and other fruits also , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: so it's better to have  some sort of basic print and then a fruit print in some primary  colours . industrial designer: Yeah we could make marketing: I don't know what what colours should the basic print be like ? Like some soft green or something ? project manager: Orange or something . marketing: Or and then user interface: Or blue ? Dark blue or marketing: Oh yeah yeah , dark blue industrial designer: We should use marketing: and then and then very bright ,  a yellow banana , an orange ,  a green apple , stuff like that , user interface: Yeah . user interface: Yeah but the primary colours w we can  create with the with the LEDs on the on the remote control . If you make it  just a yeah bl give it a blue colour , then it's just a neutral colour , project manager: user interface: also for the for the more  yeah for the people . project manager: Y marketing: So that's that's a dark blue basic colour I guess . industrial designer: Like you have on the Samsung , well I don't like to call brands phones , marketing: industrial designer: the you know that 'cause I remember from one of our first meetings that  people lose their  remote controls often . marketing: Yeah ? industrial designer: So it not not only in in the colours of the LEDs , that we want something to keep it visible at all times , or marketing: How do you mean ? project manager: Yeah if you if flashing colour so you can't lose it , basically . project manager: Well I think it's a bit too much but user interface: Maybe a industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: but it's should be more real dark blue , so the contrast with the with the fruit objects is  pretty high . user interface: And which which colour should  should I give the the display ?  project manager: Who ? user interface: Or marketing: the the colour of the background of the display ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: Ah well I don't guess it s has to be a sixty  sixty six five thousand  colour , so yeah too expensive . J industrial designer: As long as you loo use  high contrast between the the background and the foreground colour . user interface: maybe a maybe a white a white backlight ? industrial designer: So that people with  with marketing: White backlight , and dark . Or is it  too expensive ? marketing: But maybe  they have to they have to have some colour right ? project manager: It's difficult . industrial designer: But don't we wanna make the background the the bright colo colours ? So th the total of the thing is very bright ? project manager: Yeah you can industrial designer: Like the pictures I showed you guys . user interface: It's it's not industrial designer: The green ? project manager: Why ? user interface: Yeah . user interface: But the but the buttons have their own LEDs or not ? project manager: They have LEDs but they have a colour . marketing: How do you mean ? project manager:  they they don't determine the colour that much , I think . Yeah I I was think about a red  red LEDs and blue LEDs and project manager: 'Cause you have to print on them you have a background marketing: No that's that's too busy I guess . project manager: So you can't change the colour so marketing: You better bet better better keep the LED and the button itself in the same colour I guess . industrial designer: what we should do I think is is make kind of a see-through plastic button , with  one coloured LED behind it . industrial designer: as the colour the And if you think about easy to use buttons , we have to , well we have to make it the shape so that it's easy to hold f for both hands , marketing: industrial designer: but also that you can reach the buttons with your thumb , if you hold the machine . project manager: Okay with  Don't mean to discourage you but  basically you two are going to work on the smartboard . project manager: Yeah  about user interface: marketing: So wh how should I do that ? project manager: Yeah I don't know . marketing: because you are going to design it on this board right ? project manager: Yeah but maybe you can do the evaluation you don't have to evaluate yet but you can make a procedure which to follow . industrial designer: So we're gonna work here ? On this sketchboard ? project manager: Yeah . user interface: But we have to do it at this moment , after th this meeting ? industrial designer: Alright . user interface: Ah so this is basically the what what we are thinking about ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: So if you'll rather draw in paint or something industrial designer: Current colour ? marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah 'cause I have to  focus on the on the basic look-and-feel design . And you have to think  how we're gonna put the screen in it and those kind of things . industrial designer: So if I'm drawing and you think okay I'm not gonna be able to put a screen in there , you have to correct . industrial designer: so we kind of want the girlish marketing: project manager: That's included . Excuse me ? marketing: Well it's a good thing that the buttons aren't  , well that they are plastic , because then you can light up the light on when when they are usable . industrial designer: How do we   marketing: Erase ? industrial designer: or insert text ? project manager: I dunno . industrial designer:  I thought for the side view , that the w the basic section would be rather  a bit thicker than the middle , where you're holding it with your project manager: Jesus . industrial designer: 'cause your fingers have to fit underneath and user interface: The middle has to be very small so you can have it in your hand . marketing: I don't see a sign that the meeting is over yet but industrial designer: Exactly but the  but the upper side has to be a bit more like that I think . user interface: Yeah the display , industrial designer:  don't you think ? user interface: we yeah we can put a display . industrial designer: So the display we will put in here , the basic  functions in here , where it's most reachable . user interface: industrial designer: What do don't have to draw it exactly do we ? user interface: No it's it's  it's okay . industrial designer: So this is gonna be from the marketing: I is it if if this is from the side industrial designer:  from user interface: From the marketing: woah . marketing: So then it's like this , industrial designer: Yeah ? marketing: or that's not convenient because then you have the screen like this and look like the it's better to have it somewhat like this . Or does it flip all the way ? user interface: Yeah I'm I'm industrial designer: The the idea is that it has to flip up to here . user interface: May maybe it's it's easier to to integrate the the the L_C_D_ screen just into this this bubble . user interface: Because here marketing: It's better to to have this like this I guess , and then flip it like this . user interface: But why why do we need  the flipping  industrial designer: you can adjust the angle to which it flips . industrial designer: Yeah because I think it will feel weird if you would make this smaller and this bigger or something that user interface: marketing: user interface: Yeah . marketing: user interface:  the the shape is okay but yeah ? I don't see the the yeah why why we should use the the flipping  mechanism . It's it's for for for more trendy  marketing: Yeah but maybe Yeah but maybe we we should then user interface: Because we have enough space . marketing: Yeah there the middle Sh sh shouldn't we integrate it ? user interface: Yeah and then h we sh  . user interface: marketing: Okay but the screen is a bit lower because if it falls on the other side , it doesn't fall on the screen . user interface: Yeah , then it's marketing: So there's a layer of rubber on the side . project manager: marketing: So no flipping but just user interface: No flipping or project manager: No flipping ? marketing: no . user interface: you wanted the flipping so industrial designer: Yeah I guess but   most votes count right ? user interface: But if you if you If you drop it it it just breaks . user interface: And it's also for the for the children , it's yeah for people not sixteen years . user interface: But there are more marketing:  they are responsible enough to have a mobile phone , so also to to deal with their  remote  control . user interface: Okay wi industrial designer: Remember that the weird pocketphone thingy which looked like kind of a Gameboy . project manager: I don't see any power cables here so industrial designer: Let's see . But do we want  options on the on the side with the with the buttons ? industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah I'm just thinking , if we i we wanna make something different project manager: industrial designer: right ? So the with the scroll is is more futuristic than the standard arrow buttons <doc-sep>user interface: Why won't it wake up ? Is it on ? marketing: The power light doesn't work . Okay , so I just show you the m the no   the the the the the the minutes , minute . project manager: Okay , so we just talked about  Oh you want me to show that there or user interface: No , industrial designer:  no . And the functions are volume , channel to choose channels , an on-off , a mute  button , and a text T_V_ button . project manager: So I just want to give you  Mike again , the first  presentation of your marketing: Shall I start ? project manager: Yeah . I searched the web ,  and  I searched  on this d document , recent investigation of the remote control market .  but  they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look and feel . And then  that  This is a point of discussion , because we just decided that we don't make use of  L_C_D_ or  speech recognition . marketing: But  this is the second  important  aspect , and I think  we must use some of the new technology , to be  innovative . And it says  fashion-watchers of   Pari  France and  Italy , yeah ,  have detected the following trends . marketing: But the  the next  aspect also in contrast to last year , the feel of material is expe   is expected to be spongy . marketing: But spongy , what what does spongy says ? industrial designer: Spongy . project manager: because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground . project manager: Is it a bit like like the the the the remote control ? user interface: How are you gonna make it ? project manager: R_ soft . industrial designer: Yeah , marketing:  industrial designer: I've some  material  information , but I'll give you it later in my presentation . marketing: Okay ? project manager: marketing: What do I think ?  because a fancy look is the most important thing  for remote control  control , I think about changeable fronts . Yeah , how do we do that ? Maybe speech ? We ma must have some kind of gadget . marketing: Intro project manager: Because it's only twelve and a half Euros you have to spend on every remote control . user interface: So  industrial designer: Yeah , well actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost . But maybe it's cheap user interface: Yeah , industrial designer: and it's easy to implement . I d They don't say how much it will cost , so  but  marketing: user interface: if we implement  speech recognition , I think it would be better to implement L_C_D_ as well . So you can say , you can user interface: Since you have to  configure speech thing . project manager: But that's definitely more expensive than user interface: Yeah , that's that's something I dunno . But a telephone also have a L_C_D_ and and it's about t two hundred Euros . user interface: Yeah , so  we gotta de project manager: So  user interface: We have to decide on that . That was this ? user interface:   industrial designer: Oh I got an email  And it says  the chip can be  simple , regular or advanced . So user interface: L_D_C_ doesn't require industrial designer: it's m the most expensive . industrial designer: I I haven't got anything about speech recognition , but user interface: I'll I'll give you my design . 'Cause remote con control , you can see it here , you have to bo reach both out both sides . project manager: Yeah , maybe the teletext tel user interface: Yeah , text button , maybe there and there . user interface: but it's marketing: No , I don't  I don't like it . And you can't use them now with your thumb , because the thing is not , it's not easy to control . industrial designer: Yeah okay , m maybe we cho should put that on top , and buttons we we don't use on , in the bottom . user interface: They're on top ? project manager: Yeah , just th th th other buttons like text T_V_ . industrial designer: But I I think w you'll use  the switch channels buttons  more often than the normal  channel buttons , like one two three . I dunno , but yeah we'll industrial designer: Like zapping is just switching one channel at a time . user interface: And  if you don't light 'em up , they don't  you don't see 'em very good . industrial designer: That's that's good , but user interface: I think it's modern to light this area up , and to light this area up . It's s We have to look  what's easy to use , and how it's easier to use . user interface: I dunno if it l will look good , if you put those on t on the bottom half . Yeah , maybe industrial designer: But  we we can switch those two , user interface: Those two , yeah . user interface: And  , yeah , you have to make sure it's easy to  Yes , it has to be big enough so you can hold it , right . And  well  if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something , we I don't think we should put it on top then . I think that , if we're gonna put in more technology , that you need to be able to  switch it open . project manager: We have to decide this this lecture , or this this this  fifty minutes , yeah , how it is gonna look . If you aim at a young public , you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green , blue , red . I don't know exactly what that means , but it should be , well yeah , popular kind of project manager: Yeah , we have to put our Real Reaction logo as well on the on the remote control . user interface:  Yeah , it's project manager: So we have ha to ma make it in black , black , yellow . industrial designer: Yeah ,  n Not that weird , because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy , to attract a young public . user interface: Yeah , but  I don't think the the colours black and yellow go well together . But project manager: We make i Maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front . That's a that's a sen That's just a matter of tastes , but user interface: Yeah , okay . user interface:  can't we use  different  fron  fronts , with all with the the logo on it ? Can we do that ? So project manager: Yeah , it's cool . industrial designer: S user interface: You can Just like a mobile phone , you can make  different fronts on it . user interface: A more Yeah , just  marketing:   project manager: That's better prob industrial designer: With the hard hard buttons . The the the new  new modern  remote controls ,  the buttons are part of the  the style , I think is part of the remote control itself .  it's n doesn't Is  a button   How do you say it ? industrial designer: Yeah , it's it's all on one level . marketing: It it didn't it i it don't come out of the on the background . project manager: basic remote control from normal plastic , marketing: project manager: and industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: But I think we have to make the case transparent , otherwise the back light won't work . industrial designer: So if you put project manager: Y i if you The numbers could be can be user interface:  you can just make them around the buttons  project manager: Yeah , that's right . user interface: Or it runs the whole industrial designer: Yeah , but we can still make it transparent . user interface: Yeah , you can halfs transparent , industrial designer: Or no user interface: or just that it's comes out a bit . user interface:  depends on the colour of the project manager: Yeah , but you can't choo You can't choose it when you buy it . Is marketing: but can you change it if you already bought the the remote control ? user interface: Yeah , it can . project manager: industrial designer: I don't know what it is , but it should be there I think . marketing: project manager: user interface: industrial designer:  this is the normal circuit board , like a chip board in in a lot of  things . project manager: Yeah , we have to hurry up a bit , so industrial designer: W So we d we just need this and this transistors and resonators . user interface: industrial designer:  they they basically said that that's almost the same on any  remote controls . project manager: We still want to have a recharger , don't we ? industrial designer: Yeah but project manager: Is that still the user interface: Yes . industrial designer: Yeah , but it i We don't wanna have a ar an How do you call it ? Accu . user interface: project manager: It's just batteries , industrial designer: so marketing: project manager: that's cheaper . So we need  the expensive , most expensive chip , if we use an L_C_D_ . industrial designer:  are are we using a a rubber case , or project manager: Oh just sk industrial designer: We haven't decided yet . It's user interface:  I don't think a rubber case looks industrial designer: L marketing:  but we have to do something about the trend . Or should we do it in the next meeting ? user interface:  I_D_ and U_I_D_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board . industrial designer: So we should did it here ? project manager: That's for th user interface: So we're staying here ? project manager:  that I think that's the next next meeting . user interface: Okay , so now we're ka thirty minutes alone again ? industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Just a bit cur Okay , I'll see if I can see any of those . You see what  ? industrial designer: What ? project manager: If I draw here It draws about four centimetres lower than industrial designer: Oh . industrial designer: I think  you'll get a a lot of  volume changing when it's not wanted . project manager: And industrial designer: Yeah , but maybe we can make a a plastic , so that you i if you like drop it , it won't change the volume . user interface: Yeah , maybe you just have to make it  That's not scrollable too easy . And  what's the channel choose ? Where do we  put that ? Still on the bottom industrial designer: I think in middle . project manager: or user interface:  wh what is the middle part ? project manager: That's the numbers . industrial designer:  I think th the numbers should be in the bottom , and and the switch channel in the middle . project manager: It doesn't make a difference , if you put the s  the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other . user interface: Use the dz project manager: Because you already have the volume here , so You can also put it here one butt and the other one there . project manager: So you can also can put it all on the top , and this , you keep this empty . industrial designer: Or you could do the switch channel up button above the the numbers and switch channel down button below . project manager: But that's not want to zap very quick , so user interface: Yeah , I think  zapping is the highest priority . project manager: Yeah ? Is this a opportunity , user interface: And then you use those  project manager: or you don't want a different user interface: Yeah , of course  . industrial designer:  but I think we we should bu  put 'em on top of each other , so project manager: Why ? industrial designer: Because then it's it's easy to know m if I push the the the up project manager: But still the next It's still the next one . Doesn't make industrial designer: Yeah , but the top the top button is is like you switch channel up , and down button is If you put them project manager: Yeah , but fo from left to right is exactly the same . industrial designer: But  but I I think  left to right is more often associated with volume , and top down is more with  channel changing . user interface: Yeah , I think industrial designer: So so if we use that , they will probably have a long learning  time . I You already have the volume on the side , user interface: No ,  I think project manager: so you can't make it you can't ma make a mistake . project manager: So it's  user interface: I think it's s so simple industrial designer: I dunno . user interface: you just project manager: So but that's for that's for you , industrial designer: Okay . project manager: 'cause it's user interface: Yeah , okay I'll d I'll take a look at it . user interface: Think we need to work  thirty minutes again ? marketing: Yeah , we have to care that it r  looks really new . marketing: 'Cause wha what I see the only difference i i i in fact is that we use a scroll-wheel on the outside . user interface: No , you have  It is industrial designer: Yeah , but i i it should be round in in shape . marketing: Some some kind of bling bling   can we have industrial designer: user interface: Where you can put a ve  we have If we do it like that we have below have we  a lot of room to put a nice logo . marketing:  and how many  fronts  fronts do we put on the market then ?  five or something ? project manager: Yeah , five . user interface: marketing: Or more or user interface: Maybe you can buy separate ones and  marketing: And    buy the product . industrial designer: No , tha that will be project manager: So y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger ? Is that is that a good good opportunity ? user interface: Yes . marketing: Yeah , we can b It c it could be just just a square , just a packet . industrial designer: But we have to make contacts on the on the remote control and the recharger as well . user interface: I think i marketing: user interface: Yeah okay , tho those are al already a bit cornered . industrial designer: Yeah , but we can we can do all kinds of  As long as it isn is in two D_ we can use all kind of round shapes . project manager: industrial designer: project manager: It's a bit annoying , isn't it ? marketing: Yeah . I know we can do a lot more , but marketing: Yeah , it project manager: industrial designer: Like in this kind of shape or marketing:  it's very annoying . project manager: So we have to make a decision , what kind of form it's gonna have t going to have . project manager: But why do we have to round it on the t bottom then ? Of Skip that one as well . user interface: and marketing: It's not not a lot of trends I  I found  project manager: Okay , so we have s still one minute left . So just marketing:  project manager: I think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square . Yeah , marketing: It The th th industrial designer: I d I don't know n something about ergonomic kind of fits-in-the-hand  stuff . It's only annoying if it if it's like that f formed like that , like f Whatever . Just you have a normal industrial designer: Yeah , but we're we're aiming at a young public . marketing: There is one There's just one overall important aspect is that we must make it fancy and it looks original , and I hope we can  make it look not like the iPod itself . But you're If you look at the way remote controls are now project manager: But i it is it is it is already fancy . user interface: And if you make it look like the iPod marketing: Yeah , they're all the same . So that's already a very big change project manager:  maybe maybe make the the  the wha what's it called  scroll wheel . Maybe we have to ask  to the the  to her if it has if it can work better than this . project manager: We just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition . Yeah , do we s keep that ? Yeah , I think project manager: Or keep that ? It's okay . But you'd definitely need a industrial designer: S user interface: Well  project manager: advanced chip . marketing:  industrial designer: And we we have to build in a microphone and user interface: Well that's very easy . We already have  the beeping of the home station , industrial designer: Yeah , and I do I don't know anything about that . user interface: so industrial designer: I d I didn't receive any information on speech recognition , marketing: No . Becau project manager: Can we just put it speech recognition in it as well , marketing: Yeah . But project manager: okay ? user interface: So marketing: Ma user interface: shall we it open then ? project manager: Yeah . user interface: Oh yeah , I marketing: But we don't have any f information about the cost . marketing: We started with information about the cost was now th user interface: I just I just received the industrial designer: Yeah ,  I have I have some some information about the cost . marketing: And how much is the chip ? The the the industrial designer: I don't know how much , but user interface: Yeah , our division has developed a new speech recognition feature , the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker u unit . industrial designer: Just in inexpensive or user interface: This is a very small electronic unit , will give a standard answer after it recognise a question . user interface: Yeah  th that's just It's a marketing: Does it say does it say something back ? project manager: Okay , we have to stop it now . Yeah , it Well that's integrated in the chip , so if you use the speech recognition , that's in it . project manager: Okay , that's a r That's that's a advanced industrial designer: But i it's a separate chip . user interface: I dunno , but if we use speech recognition , that will be in it as well . industrial designer: Yeah , I don't know anything about this , marketing:  project manager: Yeah , we just decide not to put it in , industrial designer: but Nah . project manager: Okay , just user interface: And there's a chip in it that will project manager: We have to stop it now <doc-sep>Then  I've I will also take notes during this meeting and I will send you  a summary then as usual . We will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by  our two colleagues that make good work . industrial designer: marketing: project manager: And  then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product . And  end with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits with it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not . project manager: d let's start with the cost aspect so so I look at the aspect discussed last time , that is to say  to have a standard battery , to have a yellow banana shaped  case with  a rubber material around it industrial designer: project manager: to be  to feel spongy , user interface: Like a banana . project manager: So for the financial aspect it's okay , we can  we can continue with this product  as if , marketing: project manager: and we are now going to see the project evaluation with  our marketing expert . marketing: So I made an evaluation and the the evaluation criteria is made according to the users' requirements and the market trends we talked about  during the previous  meetings . marketing: So we we want to have a product fancy look and feel , technologically innovative , easy to use , fashion , easy to find in a room , and robust , project manager: Yeah . marketing: and  according to what you think about the this project you can   make a one point , two point or seven point . marketing: The okay ?  so  fancy look and feel , what do you think ? project manager: Okay . user interface: Do you vote  Christine ? marketing: eh ? user interface: Do you also vote ? marketing: No , I just want to see something project manager: Maybe we all have to agree on a common user interface: Well , we can very easily . So user interface: marketing: Need to project manager: this is your marketing:  I don't know if you we ha we have to put  one  f If it's better or project manager: One is most . project manager: How much would you give on the fancy aspect , on the fashionable aspect ? marketing: Six  s you can how much what ? project manager: How much would you you don't answer to this  questionnaire ? marketing: Oh yes I  I dunno  , I think six , it's a good  user interface: So it will have five point five average . project manager: Four ? industrial designer: A four also , because , except for the wheel , we don't have so much innovation . I I user interface: D are we including the voice are you glu are we including the voice in the end or not ? Huh ? project manager: No . project manager: Four ? So we have four , four f and five ? marketing: We can put four ? user interface: Yeah . Is it fashion ? project manager: Oh yeah , user interface: project manager: its its f its fruit fruit shape . marketing: Yeah it's fashion , because it's a fruit , user interface: Yeah , we can we can put a seven here . marketing: We have the lightning , or project manager: Yeah , we have the marketing: The lighting . project manager: we don't sesh especially have the lightning user interface: So you'll make the material transparent project manager: but marketing: user interface: so that it  lights up completely , or project manager: So it's yellow . project manager: I think it's very easy to marketing: Seven ? project manager: I would say seven . marketing: Is it is it robust ? project manager: Yeah , it's rubber , made of rubber , industrial designer:  f yeah , it's ru it's rubber . user interface: Yeah the only problem there might be which know , i if it's very sensitive , project manager: Yeah . user interface: I don't know project manager: But it is  it is surrounded by rubber material .  if we say that seven it's  it's the better , project manager: Yeah , the be . industrial designer: user interface: Yeah , the top marketing: and when  s six sit six are good it's a good  p product , I think . user interface: Because I saw  some phones that were banana shaped ,  wireless phones not mobile ones , wireless for the house , marketing: project manager: Yeah . user interface:  quite big also , marketing: user interface: and they were selling something like a hundred Euros , two hundred Euros . project manager: I think the industrial designer: But almo also the complexity between a phone and a remote control is not cannot compare . user interface: it's much more complex , but project manager: So , I think , we can summarise . We we have the cost below  our threshold and so we could sell at twenty five Euros and make i make profit . marketing: project manager: So the cost is in the budget , the evaluation is okay , so I th I think we can now  open champagne and make a huge party . user interface: project manager: I don't know if it's provided by  by the meeting staff . user interface: So what does the management say ? project manager: Sorry ? user interface: What does the management say ? project manager: I think we will have  much bigger project next time and a much bigger salary as well "

        "Query": "What were the opinions of the User Interface and Industrial designers regarding the attractiveness and appearance of the product, as well as the price and ease of use, during the evaluation of the prototype and discussion of functional requirements?",
        "Summary": "The User Interface team believed that the product incorporated fashion elements to attract buyers, as some buttons were shaped like cherries and had a spongy texture. They also mentioned a banana-shaped wireless phone that sold for over a hundred Euros, making their product's price of just 25 Euros very attractive to customers. The product would offer basic functions, with the option for users to pay more for additional features such as an LCD and speech recognition with a microphone. To make the product look fancy and meet different customers' needs, the team suggested offering it in multiple colors instead of just one standard grey. During a discussion about creating a new product that was both fashionable and easy for elderly users to use, the User Interface team emphasized the importance of ensuring better usability and making the remote control visually appealing. The Marketing team also suggested considering different colors or shapes for the remote control.",
        "Article": "industrial designer: How are you today ? How was your business trip to Boston ? project manager:  well , actually I didn't go , didn't feel like it . user interface: You have the same message of  Windows cannot  marketing: user interface: sen oh stand-by . user interface: project manager:  I'm sure you've had a mail from our account manager about it .  Ruud is here as the Marketing Expert , Roo is here as the User Interface Designer and Sebastian is here  in the role of Industrial Designer . project manager:  we're going to do    a little tool training  for the tools we are going to use  during  the meetings we are going to have here .  then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan ,  and we will have a discussion .  is there any room for a little presentation ?  maybe during the discussion  section ? project manager: There is ? Yeah , there is . user interface: project manager:  okay , this new product we are are g are going to develop ,  it's a remote control , a television remote control . Those are kind of easy    goals ,  and I'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop .  we will discuss  later on more ideas about  how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things .  we are going to use a a pred a project method  during  this development ,  which consists of three different design stages .  the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design ,  all of these stages   mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then  meet to discuss our   the the the progressions , yes . project manager:  the first stage , the functional design  we are going to search for the user requirements , and we will  make a specific  specification of that .  the second is the technical functional design ,  what effect should the remote have ? Well in this case control t the the television I think .  to  presentate , to show us  a file you'll need to  place it in your project documents folder , which is on your desktop , at least it should be . project manager: sensors , so do not grab it here , but a lit more a little bit more to the  to the end .  you can insert a new  slide or or white-board   file  by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button . user interface: or should we only use it in the in the meetings ? project manager: Yeah , in the meetings , only in the meetings .  to  oh well , I'm I wrote down the documents  should be in the project documents folder if you want to  discuss it with us .  as a little training  I will ask Ruud first to draw   your own animal on a new slide  with  a different colour and a different line width than the one  now selected . marketing: project manager:  Roo , could you do the same please ? But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width . Well , it looked more than a bunny than a cat , but it works , industrial designer: Well , I'll give it a try . user interface: project manager: Okay , so  you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to .  user interface: industrial designer: marketing: project manager: we  we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold  , if there is market  interest ,  in in more than one country . And  the production costs should not be more than  twelve Euro fifty , so we should keep that in mind by  w w during the development ,  because  , well , those are important numbers . industrial designer: Yes ,  I have some technical  issues which I would like to present to you  before we start the discussion , because  there might be some  project manager: Limitations . I would like to think about  the implementation of  of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities . So if someone of you comes up with  ideas ,  I'll try to translate them in technical functions , but  there might be some impossibilities .  and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product . industrial designer: I have some  initial ideas about some things  which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming  discussion . user interface: And for a cell phone ? industrial designer: Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them . We're not  living in the  nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not  project manager: industrial designer: is not really  hot  technical stuff anymore . user interface: But Yeah , but the infrared , it's  , well , a little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that . user interface: But all the T_V_s are  equipped with infrared , so industrial designer: But it's cost-effective . user interface: Or you shou sh use a industrial designer: So marketing: user interface: you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote . So that's just my role , I'll just  give you  everybody some technical input , and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what  the product should be and how it should look , project manager: Yeah . project manager: Okay , so the the main por  the main points you are  telling us are focus on the inter  operability , industrial designer: Yes , project manager: and industrial designer: so one thing  one remote control should  control one or more  pieces of equipment , project manager: Okay , and and  industrial designer: and the way of communicating with these equipments .  there are other things like  how to make it trendy , which is I think   most  Ru  Ruud's  role . project manager: H how do you think the remote should  function for the user ? user interface: Well , I had a few  things in mind .  well , the interoperability , just like  Sebastian said ,  the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different   Yeah  , what is it , devices ? project manager: Yep . user interface:  so i i I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in  a store . user interface: It's not for  for  for  Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product , project manager: Okay , so we're we're going business to consumer , user interface: right ? project manager: not we're we're it's not a user interface: Yeah , I do I don't know that . industrial designer: We're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ? project manager: No . industrial designer: we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad  public , so it should fit to every device . project manager:  Ruud , y do you agree ? marketing: Yeah , I think I think they're right , yeah . user interface:  Well , the techni fu technical function  what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the T_V_ . user interface: Well , that's just the fu the technical function is pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task  as an  as an  device .  but furthermore industrial designer: And you you see  the buttons as a as a means of doing this ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Or are there any o other controls ? user interface: Yeah , or maybe you want a touch-screen or industrial designer: Are there only any other cont Well , user interface: But industrial designer: I I've seen these remote controls with  this little stick  which you can move forward , sidewords . And  it's very easy for a user to to switch user interface: They're very vu vulnerable . industrial designer: to to switch b  between  channels or  change  between tracks on a on a C_D_ , on on a chapters , you know , on a D_V_D_ player .  point at a T_V_ , I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_ , industrial designer: user interface: Yeah , just don't even point it , so in that case infrared should  maybe  be restriction to that . project manager:  industrial designer:  is that  are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ? So when you're not able to point at the device  the range is very limited . For T_V_ , you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T_V_ , so I don't think think the range should be a problem to that , industrial designer: user interface: but if you want to  get it working with a radio , and you're in outside your garden with just one  speaker , then maybe the range should be  industrial designer: project manager: Okay , gentlemen ,   just a reminder , we d we have five minutes left for this meeting industrial designer: Okay . user interface:  You should able to feel the buttons without  it mis  you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons , so it should be as user interface  for feeling should be  good to understand . user interface: And of course you don't always know where all buttons are , so it should be visible al  in dark too . user interface: So when it's dark project manager: user interface: Those are two really  user interface project manager:  I'll write down glow in the dark . industrial designer: Do do you project manager:  do you have anything already w  ab idea about how the market  will respond to the such a product ? Or what we should take  in account when developing such a product ? marketing:  I think most most things have already been said , like  control multiple devices . project manager: Because ? marketing:  well , he said about n abo what he said about pointing . Okay , Sebastian , did you have any other ideas ? industrial designer:  well yes , I had ,  about three minutes ago , project manager: user interface: industrial designer: but I've seem to forget them forgot them . industrial designer:   would it be nice for a user to have display on this  remote control , on which you can see functions ? Which makes it easier to operate it . Well , maybe I  but it it can be quite simple , industrial designer: I I don't know . project manager: Yeah , yeah , okay , because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product . project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: Well , that's more project manager: twelve Euro fifty , yeah . I think the the financial part of this project  implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product . project manager: So  maybe we could  for example  only light the buttons that are   applicable at that moment or user interface: But  Necessary , yeah . user interface: 'Cause I think Bluetooth  industrial designer: It's use  a lot of  project manager: Well does it ? user interface: Yeah , I know it from the cell phone .  industrial designer: Well , cell phones have  integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it's it seems to work  quite okay . user interface: But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day .  next meeting starts in thirty minutes and  , well , you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it <doc-sep>And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly . industrial designer: project manager: user interface: industrial designer: Well , I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and  user interface:  . B did you send us an email about this ? project manager: not yet , user interface: industrial designer: project manager: but if you want user interface: Yeah , we we received an email about this  d designs . project manager: Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ? industrial designer: user interface: Ah it's Okay . marketing: I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . user interface: 'Kay , we can project manager: So there are so we have three user interface: So there are three kinds of designs , that's all . project manager: So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? Any any volunteer ? industrial designer: I think our  responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager . user interface: Are you using the you are doing the in industrial designer: Yeah I I'm I'm Well , maybe we have okay so I industrial design . It was a little confusion about my  project manager: user interface: Ah industrial designer: but it's alright . industrial designer: Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done project manager: industrial designer: and what are your ideas about the project manager: About the design or Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ? industrial designer: Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess . industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno I project manager: And of course it should not be very costly . industrial designer: Well I I think that Norman and I would think about  the technical points and  we should discuss it in the next meeting , or user interface: Need to collect information .  , what is most important in a in a remote control ? What is the most important function aspect ?  . project manager: You won't user interface: Or or you can say for example ,  I want  to list all the programme tonight . Y you know , instead of  remote control it's doing the some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . project manager: I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . user interface: No , because no , project manager: S user interface: it's not very a lot . industrial designer: I I think if you want t to choose  from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use  w  I dunno marketing: I'm a okay . marketing:  the main  function of remote control is to have something in the hand project manager: In the hand . marketing: If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog user interface: Yeah . marketing: if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . industrial designer: marketing:  we have some or something , different technology but project manager: This is it's user interface: Yeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that  there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea project manager: industrial designer: but I I think that technically it would be  a little bit   more tricky to to achieve this than just to user interface: No . They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . user interface: And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons . industrial designer: Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to  navigate  through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so project manager: This is good idea . Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? industrial designer: Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen user interface: Good idea . industrial designer: and just  with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f user interface: I think I think that will be revol revolutionary . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: Because all the T_V_  the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . So I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff user interface: Okay . project manager: So we have five minutes to user interface: Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . project manager: Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we industrial designer: user interface: Five minutes . marketing: And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of user interface: Okay . marketing: So , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark  some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . industrial designer: Oh right so user interface: Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: Be before before writing you can  sit and that says what we what we said user interface:  . So so the most functional des  the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . The user can choose w which one they want , right ? industrial designer: Yeah , by content or by channel , user interface: By content or by channel . user interface: Okay , so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content . industrial designer: I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so user interface: Okay . And  industrial designer: I think that's the the things to do user interface: The main thing . user interface: So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get  the funct this is the functional designer ? That's the first aspect . project manager: So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ? And we'll discuss the other other aspects <doc-sep>industrial designer: Is there any time for a cup of coffee ? user interface: We have a slight problem . project manager: Sorry ? industrial designer: Can I get a cup of coffee ? project manager:  no . project manager:  then  the three of you  prepared a presentation , I think ? Sebastian ? industrial designer: I think so too . user interface: industrial designer: project manager: Then we'll do your one   as la  the last .  the top goal of this m user interface: But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe . project manager:  the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group  and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind .  the new project requirements , first of all ,  we didn't speak about it , but we should not  support teletext in the remote ,  because our b  board  feels that  teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext .  the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not  f  feasible , it's not  w user interface: Yeah . project manager:   we we cannot make it because of the time to market  that we have to deal with . project manager:  the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than  forty , which is important for you ,  Ruud , and as well for  Roo .  then for Roo , as well  important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product .  the individual presentations , I th  Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ? user interface: Yeah , I'll start .  the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . user interface: Then I found  two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function  remote control with many possibilities , but  the lack of the feeling I already mentioned  in the previous  discussion . user interface: And the ease-of-use remote control with  the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . My personal preferences were ease of  the easy to use remote control , because  the user-friendliness and  it can be more trendy in in user design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not  in our design . But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is  the best  possi possibility for us . project manager: Okay , so marketing: project manager: the important thing here is user interface: And it's also i indeed   Ruud's  insight in the in the topic . project manager: Yeah , okay , w we will s we all  user interface: Just for  for user desi  user  friendliness I  should choose for the the ease of use remote control .  well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . user interface: industrial designer:  basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by  sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to  implement a picture here , user interface: Energies and  industrial designer: but it's hardly readable . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using  infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . It's almost every piece of equipment  every piece of  every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . And I think that's what we w user interface: The glow in the dark  concept  we discussed . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . industrial designer: and I think we should  we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . industrial designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared , because  otherwise our device cannot  communicate with  almost every T_V_ set . And  if we want to use  a rechargeable design or  a energy-save design , we should really implement them .  for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost  circuit board ,  because most of the production cost are are in this  part of the equipment . industrial designer: And  the money we save on using this we can use  for elaborate fancy lighting  techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . user interface: And what's the  industrial designer: I think our  users will really  will really like that . user interface: if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or industrial designer: No , they're p f  power friendly LEDs also . user interface: For the same costs , it's can be  in our industrial designer:  no , they're  they're a little bit more expensive , but by    making user interface: Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's  industrial designer: We can we can make its I think . project manager: Yeah , but but the question is whether  two or four buttons makes  m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to  include fancy lightning techniques , I guess . user interface: Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , marketing: true . Well , it's not one light , it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . project manager: Okay well , industrial designer: project manager: we ar we are very curio curious to what the market  will feel about such a product . marketing: But  since  the other part is  forty percent of the market , I  thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . The buttons to zap are used the about  fifteen hundred times , when  the power button is only used one time . So user interface: Yeah , well it should just have a design The perfect design for those only those buttons . Just one thing I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? industrial designer: Well marketing: Yeah , that's  a problem . project manager: Well industrial designer: Usually project manager: maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , user interface: It should be   project manager: like  turning on and off the the the lights . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a  kind of weird sound , and your  remote controls then start to beep . project manager: But  th user interface: But but T_V_s don't have all   buttons . marketing: And you project manager: Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home  user interface: But I believe you will have an marketing: Yeah , and usually industrial designer: We do not control the T_V_ set so well . marketing: And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button ,  you would have to walk to your T_V_ , industrial designer: Yes , m yes . S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , marketing: and it's project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so we should think about project manager: So what about the clapping technique ?  because you se user interface: I'm convinced  Sebastian will  find  one solution for us . marketing: And b project manager: Well , you see it a lot in in light  lightning   industrial designer: Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics  the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , project manager: Yeah , a peak . industrial designer: But there are many other sounds  which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . industrial designer: Yes , user interface: But we can have just   a home stat  f a base station next to the T_V_ . user interface: Well if you lost th industrial designer: Well , project manager: Well  industrial designer: is there not something f something more easily user interface: I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . user interface:  that's just  industrial designer: No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and  b  perform a a some kind of  . You do not want another device , which can be  everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . project manager: Yeah , m maybe  w we  we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . project manager:  maybe Sebastian should have  a detailed look later on and  come up with a solution , industrial designer: But  before I do that I w I want to warn you that  by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated project manager: And there are some implepe imp user interface: And do we even  prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning  function ? industrial designer: Well , I I think so , because  when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . user interface: It's a unique item  project manager: Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . project manager: and  I think  it's worth   looking and and probably more i interesting than  than the lights . user interface: And just about  the user interface , I came up with  an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . marketing: Well , t  we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function . project manager: Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players  and all kind of stuff . user interface: So industrial designer: we should save costs  by not implementing a lot of functions and  the money that we can save from that we should use for  having a nice design and  thinking about the user interface project manager: Yeah . Okay , industrial designer: and project manager: Ruud , how do you feel about that ?  do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to  a simple marketing:  well if we  include other  innovative functions  then they  might , project manager: user interface:  just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated ,  because it has many functions . industrial designer: Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very  friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but  nevertheless project manager: But but are we not in in the in the manual   if you have few buttons , no display ,    I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and  one button can  industrial designer: Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . project manager: But but how does how does the remote  report  r  give back to the user w in what state it is ? user interface: Yeah , I don't know yet . There's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . project manager: I know , but but if we use  like a stick , for example ,  industrial designer: W When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe  a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just  pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t  turned up the volume . marketing: And if you use that stick for volume control and channel  selection , you have the m two most important functions in one  button . user interface: But does it  I then should n just use  i instead of the stick ,  like many cell phones , just a round m well , project manager: Yeah , draw draw it on the board . Oh user interface: It's just an easy  way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . user interface: A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down project manager: Yeah , it can break down . marketing: And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it  attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . project manager: Okay , but w we still we're still in the question of    putting in advanced options .  we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , I think . user interface: Yes ? project manager: We need to  have the  the user function  the functions decided and   our target audience . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ?  which  incorporates all function available on the device ? project manager:  well , I do not want a full  it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want  the kind of functions , for example  th the most important are volume and  programme selecting . l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but user interface: Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to  two channels , when you have  something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can  change industrial designer: project manager: Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last  Mielsen . industrial designer: but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . project manager: And and do we want  the ten digits ? user interface: The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so . industrial designer: Well , are are you sure ? marketing: Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . industrial designer: but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think but you should  shou you should know that . industrial designer: Okay , user interface:  and I think the most industrial designer: I can imagine when project manager: I agree actually . user interface: Just elder elder people would would buy it , industrial designer: I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . marketing: Well user interface: but industrial designer: But if you're  a regular T_V_ user , and you just want  to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can  you can use  about ten buttons . industrial designer: Well , marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: but how how often do you watch all these channels ? marketing: and if if we And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . Don't you think ? project manager: Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the industrial designer: The design . marketing: Well project manager: You c you can d make them very fancy marketing: And project manager: by   Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . industrial designer: Okay , so you can experiment by  with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .  it might be expensive and  hard to implement , but it would be a solution  for project manager: Okay , speech . industrial designer: So  when you add  speech recognition to your remote control ,  it's very easy to change  the channel . industrial designer: So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . project manager:  If if we would  drop the ten digits industrial designer: But maybe when we  project manager: but keep the programme and the volume , industrial designer: It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find  find the remote control button  remote control function . industrial designer: There are some  hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . industrial designer: So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . project manager: But But but can we manage it bu  for the costs ? industrial designer: You have to do nothing for it . marketing: And  if we if we could inc  include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be  a big problem . marketing: 'Cause when project manager: Is a cradle very cheap ? industrial designer: It's Oh , it's very cheap .  I would like to hear  maybe maybe you all have th  things not  spoken about , yeah , but that are important .  are there other things about the market we should know ? marketing:  I think we dealt with the most important information . project manager: Sebastian ? industrial designer:  I just want to make a summary of all all things  spoken and  the different possibilities . So on the outside it looks easy , but  we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by  implementing  speech techniques ,  voice recognition , that these kinds of things .  there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement  fancy techniques , which  I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about  the the costs and  the things like  battery lifetime , energy saving . industrial designer:  another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons . If we just add   a chip which does the voice recognition ,  our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another project manager: Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board industrial designer: well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . user interface: But the cheaper the ch  the the chip or th what was it ? industrial designer: project manager: No , it's th industrial designer: The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . user interface: Well it then we should just  take a look at the costs and  especially for the voice recognition . project manager: I'm not sure how how we'll f  determine the costs , I will have a look at it . project manager:  I'm not sure how how that industrial designer: Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will  have a lo  look at it . project manager:  I'm don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out . project manager:  then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work ,  and I'm sure your personal coaches will  assist you with it . project manager: User Interface Designer ,  Roo , I would like to see the user interface c  concept . project manager: And  user interface:  the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis  decisions Sebastian makes . industrial designer: Well project manager: Well , i it should be easy , user interface: Well project manager: that's w w what we concluded . industrial designer: So we drop the voice recognition ? project manager: No no no , we didn't industrial designer: Or project manager: but it shouldn't be integrated industrial designer: Oh . project manager: yeah , it's of course it's user interface , but  i I was talking about really the design of the industrial designer: Okay "

        "Query": "Summarize the discussion on the disadvantages of ATLAS and other options and the opinions of C and F regarding these disadvantages.",
        "Summary": "The team discussed the use of different frameworks for the external file representation. While the team was familiar with Perl and preferred a flat file format due to its simplicity, the idea of using ATLAS was suggested. It was proposed to initially use ATLAS and evaluate its suitability before fully adopting it. The team also considered P files, but the concern was that they could become large. One team member, C, emphasized the importance of considering the learning curve of other options and believed that a flat file format works well for everyone. C suggested that Perl could be combined with external representations of ATLAS files to create a functional system. Additionally, C mentioned that exploring alternatives to P files could be interesting, despite the potential learning curve. Another team member, F, focused on dealing with prosodic features at the level of small linguistic units. F proposed attaching these features to words or segments, with the option of extracting smaller units. This approach would allow the team to build on their existing work without starting from scratch.",
        "Article": "project manager: Hello ,  this meeting we are it's fo should be focused on the conceptual design of the remote control . project manager:  the goal of this meeting is to reach a decision at the end on the concept and I think the last time we talked about an a lot and we had a rough idea of what is going to be , but  in th at the end of this meeting we have to to reach a decision . So ,  we will have again three presentation , from all of you , and  I hope it will be fast because I would like to have time to for long discussion and and decisions .  so basically I just want to presented to you present to you some recent results we've had from  looking at   some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world .  the fashion trends we got from talking to our our contacts in the fashion industry based in Paris and Milan .  so f from our market research basically we've come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel ,  as opposed to a functional look and feel , is our number one priority .  and third thirdly the easiness of use is is the  is is important as well , but again two times less important as the technologically innovativeness of the remote control . From our f fashion people in Paris and Milan ,  we've discovered that this year  fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in in clothes , shoes and furniture . marketing:  so in conclusion , we need a our remote control needs to be something that's really fancy ,  has lots of technolog tech technology in it . user interface: marketing: And that it's easy to use and from our last meeting our you know Fabian told us that w you know one of the requirements is that we have to reflect the look and feel of our of th the Real Reaction company . marketing: So  fanciness first and then two ti you know , half as important as that is technology technology , project manager: Okay . So I am going to talk about a little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use . I think  I think the feature easy to use is more important than being fancy , but okay , we can discuss about it  later .  generally , generally  this remote control   should be should be something , in my opinion ,  the first feature is just to be easy to use . So , the more frequent buttons should be larger , they should be placed in a good position   inside the remote control . And  s  I can conclude like this , that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it . It should be we shouldn't need to es open a a t book and  start reading and  learning how to use this  this  remote control . So what I found out that  as I said  I think it's better to put  more frequent    ke  buttons which are used more in the middle of the remote control , and they should be bigger in size . user interface: And maybe  just like some toys , some joystick which is easier to take inside the hand . And  also f   m because because customers doesn't like to buy lots of battery , it should not  consume lots of energy . And my personal p  preference is  , as I said ,  just putting this buttons in a special places and covered some buttons which are not used  that much like settings button , like mobile phone . Usually some mobile phone cover the dialling number part , so we can cover these buttons which are not used or  number buttons for the for the for the can channels , and just put  volume change or s ch can  channel change buttons   in the remote control . And if the user needed to do some more complex task  he he can open the cover and then change settings or something like this . And also  I think if we put some some some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier . For example , a sliding or rolling   d  stuff , if we put it inside then we can easily manipulate with  thumb . And  I dunno but  I think usage of a speech recogn  r recogniser can be good . I know that it consumes lots of energy , but if we do it in some way that it asleeps when there is no sound and when it detects some sound it may consume less energy . And I think it's good because it's something new and usually young people like something new . industrial designer:  okay , so good news from me   for me from Hamed , but bad news from Bob obviously , because spongy design , I don't like it as marketing: project manager: industrial designer: Okay , so could you please , Fabien , open it . I Most of the things I have to write myself on the board , but project manager: This one , yeah . This this is just  one thing I wanted to mention and show you that I just  I just found this , that our company  developed a s a seven f seven fingers or I'll just marketing: Inch . industrial designer: Yeah , seven seven inch T_ T_F_T_ screen , which is good news for us , since we wanted to include a display there . industrial designer: Okay , so the this will be like the overall scheme or overall requirements from the engineering point of view .  first thing is  this will be the overall shape , no  I'm not speaking about the real shape of the device , but the shape of the inside of the device .  the main energy will be taken from batteries that we can   And if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there , we must use additional source of energy , which I found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can  supply everything . I was computing all the all the things related to the speech recognition , and it's okay to use just  two batteries and solar cells , so .  the main board with all the circuits will take at least seven to seven centimetres , so this is my like hard requirement for the guys from the design . It depends where you put your screen , because the screen is  seven inch , so it depends on you where where you put it . Then the graphical card  for the T_F_T_ and the third unit is the I_R_ . The good news is that we can  we decided to use the infra-red unit because our company has also developed the chip for communication by the infra-red , including all the stuff inside , so it will be very cheap for us . So the once again the overall requirements , seven to seven centimetres for the board , which has to be which can be spongy but has to be this size , and the T_F_T_ which is seven inches .  I have to check what I wanted to  from my point of view I don't care about the about the material used for the overall des  ov all the device . project manager: Can you fit any  for example a T_F_T_ or any electronic device in a spongy thing , or is there any problem for that ? For example , put electronic card on a spongy thing , I can I can imagine it could be a problem . industrial designer: A all these things in in  in this box are okay to put in in any shape , basically . Maybe it a good feature , since it takes if it's around the T_F_T_ then it's good , because it's just keeps it safe , project manager: Okay . user interface: Well maybe it can have two shells , a hard shell inside and a spongy shell outside . marketing: This seven inch T_F_T_ screen , industrial designer: Yeah ? marketing: how big is it in reality ? industrial designer: Well , seven to seven inches . industrial designer: marketing:   have we decided that we're gonna use this T_F_T_ screen ? project manager: No , I don't think it's seven by seven , industrial designer: Yeah but project manager: I think it's seven the diagonal is seven . industrial designer: To be honest , I was project manager: Usually when they say seven inch I think it's the diagonal . industrial designer: Yeah , honestly speaking I was thinking that it was seven centimetres initially , marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , no no problem , user interface: industrial designer: because because because then the size of the graphic card will be one fourth . industrial designer: So marketing: industrial designer: Yeah , but no problem to to me to cut the screen . marketing: So , what's the size of the device ? industrial designer: Ah well this is like this is almost nothing . marketing: Even from my perspective seven t seven centimetres by seven centimetres is still industrial designer: Yeah , but we wanted the big buttons and stuff like that , you know . marketing: Is it Can you hold that , or ? industrial designer: Because if it's t too small we can we can lose it , at home , you know . project manager: A sm industrial designer: marketing: But is something that's seven centimetres square e easy to hold ? user interface: industrial designer: W I I think so . I if the roller buttons are on the side you don't have to catch it like that , but just like this , and you know follow follow Well , that's that's no task for me , but well seven to seven at least yeah , project manager: So maybe you can finish your presentation , user interface: project manager: and afterwards we will discuss about all this .  , so I think we have a lot We have to take decision today , so I think we have to do some work to finalise our idea and take decisions .  first I think energy it's a key problem because  it depend what can we have as feature if we use only batteries , for example , or something like that . Because can we have L_C_D_ and speech recognition with battery , and it's also r related to the size of the of the devi of the device ? industrial designer: Not J  just a point to the energy th things . If we use the batteries , and the additional so solar cell , then it's okay for L_  speech recognition and L_C_D_ , project manager: Okay . project manager: but using how many batteries , for example ? Are are what Maybe what is the size of the battery industrial designer: Yeah I was thinking just common A_A_ cells . marketing: So if we use s solar cells ,  where is the sun if someone's watching T_V_ inside ? industrial designer: S  d doesn't need to be sun . industrial designer: Yeah well I I suppose that I suppose that  that this remote control won't be in the in the room like this , where there is light only when when there are people , but . project manager: At least when there is T_V_ you can get light from the T_V_ . industrial designer: Ah it's a it's a compromise , no ? marketing: project manager: At least it's new and maybe technology New technology . industrial designer: Yeah , that's why I wanted to to include the speech recognition , because you wanted all the new things . user interface: project manager: So I think before talking about the other thing , it's important thing it's the case . industrial designer: project manager:  what what are gonna be the size , because its weight drives the other what we are going to use as features and so on . For example for the for the L_C_D_ , if we choose to have a small device , we cannot use this  a such a a a screen . Well what what would you guess as a shape ? Or what what would be the shape ? user interface:  . And I prefer to is it shouldn't have a uniform shape , so in the middle it should be a little bit thinner , maybe maybe . You can take  some some joystick you can take inside hand easier because it's it's designed for your f  taking into account your finger shape and your palm shape . So  seven not seven but let's say five by ten it's I think it's that's my opinion . industrial designer: Yeah , I think it's feasib Well one   How could we do it ? We could put the board next to , well , under the L_C_D_ and for example make the L_C_D_ be totally unrelated to the thing that you hold in your hand . industrial designer: Like holding something , and the L_C_D_ to be just on top of it , you know somehow . I've I s I think the easiest thing would be to to have a smaller L_C_D_ , if it's possible . industrial designer: Okay , so five to ten , I I think it's it's feasible . user interface: but I don't want to now invent something new , because we didn't discuss about it . So using some L_C_D_s we can touch , so we can remove  keys and just  having  , I dunno the name , L_C_D_ responding to fingers . user interface: So But for now if we don't want to use such kind of screens I I think we using a a smaller screen is better , project manager: Yeah . user interface: because project manager: The problem is we have a limit in a month of time , so we cannot do something very new . user interface: project manager: So let's go for a small L_C_D_ . marketing: So industrial designer: Okay , so Yeah , so so just just give me the the the five by ten numbers that you find the best and send it me user interface: A smaller s project manager: Yeah okay .  something easy to use , you said something easy to use but how does that fit in a fashion way , like with fruit and vegetable , and about the colour and logo of the of the company and so on , now , can we do that ? My first idea is because our colour is more yellow , and the it should be easy to take in a hand , I thought about banana , or something like that , which is fruits , and industrial designer: Seven to ten banana . marketing: Well it's it's definitely the obvious choice , with the colour of our company . user interface: marketing:  what other what other fruit and vegetables project manager: But it's just an idea . I dunno what you think about , but marketing: Do you know of any any other fruit and vegetables that are yellow ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: industrial designer: Well , but If it's If it If the banana is big enough . Well user interface: project manager: Yeah , and industrial designer: user interface: I think this is not good . project manager: The screen has to be square ? Or it can be like a a shape , quite ,  with curves . industrial designer: But if it's square then we get four screens out of one by cutting just . But if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches , so . I think that's more important than saving a bit of money on on the T_F_T_ screen . industrial designer: Yeah , m maybe the banana could be like a bit  fatter than than the c c common one . Yeah , it should remember banana , but it's not doesn't have to b to be   really the size and exactly the shape of a banana . project manager: So we are agree with the banana thing ? industrial designer: Well it we'll stick to banana , or ? user interface: Okay . project manager: So , the last point we decided it's infra-red , I guess . You have other thing to add to this point , or  no ? So ,  about the user interface , so we are going to use L_C_D_ . You talked about the buttons on the side industrial designer: Like like peeling of the banana you s user interface: Yeah , peeling of the banana . marketing: industrial designer: First layer obviously spo Yeah , project manager: So industrial designer: w It's it's like silly , but the people will really appreciate it , yeah I think . project manager: Is it is it possible to do that ? It would be a great idea , but is it possible technically ? user interface:  project manager: Like doing a spongy layer of the banana , and you open it . marketing: I think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that , project manager: Yeah . marketing: you know , to manipulate that to hav be a cover that you can pull off and user interface: user interface: Yeah , some Something like a plastic cover covering  some interface , U_S_B_ interface as in the in  digital camera . You open a plastic cover and you see some U_S_B_ interfaces , some some interfaces for adaptor . So keys can be  buttons can be covered like this , with a plastic cover and  when  and when you open this cover it's like peeling a banana . project manager: Yeah , but do you see that as a rigid thing , or like like a banana , something very soft , you can open like banana , or . industrial designer: Well is it possible to make it soft ? user interface: Yeah , yeah , yeah it's a lic like a plastic cover , so . industrial designer: So I think if it's so then it's cool ? project manager: So , I dunno what you think , Bob , but it would be great for users I think , and very good for marketing .  maybe , how can we , if we have a soft thing , like this , and to open it we have to attach it somewhere , I dunno how to do that technically , or . Yeah or a Yeah it can is it can be a plastic cover  sticking to the to the all the stuff like  with magnetic p  magnetic  magnetic  materials in the border , so it's it sticks like refrigerator door , completely . So you you can be sure that it will not be open while you're  while while  you are commonly using  buttons on the banana . industrial designer: Well since since the since the things like the like the screen and  how to say that , solar cell has to be has to be like kept kept in the shape , we cannot b  So we need that the that the peeling  I dunno but we should we should take care of these two two things . So , if if  the solar cell won't be visible while the banana is closed , then the material must be able to put the light inside , you know . So you're saying is it possible to have a solar cell and this removable cover and industrial designer: It is possible , but , well if it marketing: And a and a banana . industrial designer: I dunno how to how to do it if if t if to if it's better to put the solar cell to the t to the peeling or outside it , or or inside . project manager: And something we forgot , maybe ,  about the speech recognition system , are we going to use it , or not ? marketing: user interface: Yes , I think . project manager: So we have the de design , the a good shape , new and so on , user interface:  . marketing: user interface: project manager: And  , yeah , I  I think you should work together , s you  Hamed and Peter , to work  in a in a first prototype , and  more about the shape and so on and how you can manage to put everything together <doc-sep>industrial designer: Is there any time for a cup of coffee ? user interface: We have a slight problem . project manager: Sorry ? industrial designer: Can I get a cup of coffee ? project manager:  no . project manager:  then  the three of you  prepared a presentation , I think ? Sebastian ? industrial designer: I think so too . user interface: industrial designer: project manager: Then we'll do your one   as la  the last .  the top goal of this m user interface: But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe . project manager:  the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group  and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind .  the new project requirements , first of all ,  we didn't speak about it , but we should not  support teletext in the remote ,  because our b  board  feels that  teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext .  the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not  f  feasible , it's not  w user interface: Yeah . project manager:   we we cannot make it because of the time to market  that we have to deal with . project manager:  the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than  forty , which is important for you ,  Ruud , and as well for  Roo .  then for Roo , as well  important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product .  the individual presentations , I th  Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ? user interface: Yeah , I'll start .  the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . user interface: Then I found  two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function  remote control with many possibilities , but  the lack of the feeling I already mentioned  in the previous  discussion . user interface: And the ease-of-use remote control with  the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . My personal preferences were ease of  the easy to use remote control , because  the user-friendliness and  it can be more trendy in in user design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not  in our design . But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is  the best  possi possibility for us . project manager: Okay , so marketing: project manager: the important thing here is user interface: And it's also i indeed   Ruud's  insight in the in the topic . project manager: Yeah , okay , w we will s we all  user interface: Just for  for user desi  user  friendliness I  should choose for the the ease of use remote control .  well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . user interface: industrial designer:  basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by  sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to  implement a picture here , user interface: Energies and  industrial designer: but it's hardly readable . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using  infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . It's almost every piece of equipment  every piece of  every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . And I think that's what we w user interface: The glow in the dark  concept  we discussed . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . industrial designer: and I think we should  we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . industrial designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared , because  otherwise our device cannot  communicate with  almost every T_V_ set . And  if we want to use  a rechargeable design or  a energy-save design , we should really implement them .  for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost  circuit board ,  because most of the production cost are are in this  part of the equipment . industrial designer: And  the money we save on using this we can use  for elaborate fancy lighting  techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . user interface: And what's the  industrial designer: I think our  users will really  will really like that . user interface: if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or industrial designer: No , they're p f  power friendly LEDs also . user interface: For the same costs , it's can be  in our industrial designer:  no , they're  they're a little bit more expensive , but by    making user interface: Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's  industrial designer: We can we can make its I think . project manager: Yeah , but but the question is whether  two or four buttons makes  m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to  include fancy lightning techniques , I guess . user interface: Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , marketing: true . Well , it's not one light , it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . project manager: Okay well , industrial designer: project manager: we ar we are very curio curious to what the market  will feel about such a product . marketing: But  since  the other part is  forty percent of the market , I  thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . The buttons to zap are used the about  fifteen hundred times , when  the power button is only used one time . So user interface: Yeah , well it should just have a design The perfect design for those only those buttons . Just one thing I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? industrial designer: Well marketing: Yeah , that's  a problem . project manager: Well industrial designer: Usually project manager: maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , user interface: It should be   project manager: like  turning on and off the the the lights . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a  kind of weird sound , and your  remote controls then start to beep . project manager: But  th user interface: But but T_V_s don't have all   buttons . marketing: And you project manager: Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home  user interface: But I believe you will have an marketing: Yeah , and usually industrial designer: We do not control the T_V_ set so well . marketing: And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button ,  you would have to walk to your T_V_ , industrial designer: Yes , m yes . S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , marketing: and it's project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so we should think about project manager: So what about the clapping technique ?  because you se user interface: I'm convinced  Sebastian will  find  one solution for us . marketing: And b project manager: Well , you see it a lot in in light  lightning   industrial designer: Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics  the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , project manager: Yeah , a peak . industrial designer: But there are many other sounds  which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . industrial designer: Yes , user interface: But we can have just   a home stat  f a base station next to the T_V_ . user interface: Well if you lost th industrial designer: Well , project manager: Well  industrial designer: is there not something f something more easily user interface: I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . user interface:  that's just  industrial designer: No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and  b  perform a a some kind of  . You do not want another device , which can be  everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . project manager: Yeah , m maybe  w we  we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . project manager:  maybe Sebastian should have  a detailed look later on and  come up with a solution , industrial designer: But  before I do that I w I want to warn you that  by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated project manager: And there are some implepe imp user interface: And do we even  prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning  function ? industrial designer: Well , I I think so , because  when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . user interface: It's a unique item  project manager: Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . project manager: and  I think  it's worth   looking and and probably more i interesting than  than the lights . user interface: And just about  the user interface , I came up with  an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . marketing: Well , t  we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function . project manager: Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players  and all kind of stuff . user interface: So industrial designer: we should save costs  by not implementing a lot of functions and  the money that we can save from that we should use for  having a nice design and  thinking about the user interface project manager: Yeah . Okay , industrial designer: and project manager: Ruud , how do you feel about that ?  do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to  a simple marketing:  well if we  include other  innovative functions  then they  might , project manager: user interface:  just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated ,  because it has many functions . industrial designer: Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very  friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but  nevertheless project manager: But but are we not in in the in the manual   if you have few buttons , no display ,    I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and  one button can  industrial designer: Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . project manager: But but how does how does the remote  report  r  give back to the user w in what state it is ? user interface: Yeah , I don't know yet . There's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . project manager: I know , but but if we use  like a stick , for example ,  industrial designer: W When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe  a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just  pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t  turned up the volume . marketing: And if you use that stick for volume control and channel  selection , you have the m two most important functions in one  button . user interface: But does it  I then should n just use  i instead of the stick ,  like many cell phones , just a round m well , project manager: Yeah , draw draw it on the board . Oh user interface: It's just an easy  way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . user interface: A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down project manager: Yeah , it can break down . marketing: And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it  attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . project manager: Okay , but w we still we're still in the question of    putting in advanced options .  we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , I think . user interface: Yes ? project manager: We need to  have the  the user function  the functions decided and   our target audience . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ?  which  incorporates all function available on the device ? project manager:  well , I do not want a full  it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want  the kind of functions , for example  th the most important are volume and  programme selecting . l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but user interface: Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to  two channels , when you have  something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can  change industrial designer: project manager: Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last  Mielsen . industrial designer: but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . project manager: And and do we want  the ten digits ? user interface: The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so . industrial designer: Well , are are you sure ? marketing: Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . industrial designer: but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think but you should  shou you should know that . industrial designer: Okay , user interface:  and I think the most industrial designer: I can imagine when project manager: I agree actually . user interface: Just elder elder people would would buy it , industrial designer: I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . marketing: Well user interface: but industrial designer: But if you're  a regular T_V_ user , and you just want  to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can  you can use  about ten buttons . industrial designer: Well , marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: but how how often do you watch all these channels ? marketing: and if if we And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . Don't you think ? project manager: Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the industrial designer: The design . marketing: Well project manager: You c you can d make them very fancy marketing: And project manager: by   Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . industrial designer: Okay , so you can experiment by  with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .  it might be expensive and  hard to implement , but it would be a solution  for project manager: Okay , speech . industrial designer: So  when you add  speech recognition to your remote control ,  it's very easy to change  the channel . industrial designer: So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . project manager:  If if we would  drop the ten digits industrial designer: But maybe when we  project manager: but keep the programme and the volume , industrial designer: It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find  find the remote control button  remote control function . industrial designer: There are some  hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . industrial designer: So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . project manager: But But but can we manage it bu  for the costs ? industrial designer: You have to do nothing for it . marketing: And  if we if we could inc  include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be  a big problem . marketing: 'Cause when project manager: Is a cradle very cheap ? industrial designer: It's Oh , it's very cheap .  I would like to hear  maybe maybe you all have th  things not  spoken about , yeah , but that are important .  are there other things about the market we should know ? marketing:  I think we dealt with the most important information . project manager: Sebastian ? industrial designer:  I just want to make a summary of all all things  spoken and  the different possibilities . So on the outside it looks easy , but  we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by  implementing  speech techniques ,  voice recognition , that these kinds of things .  there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement  fancy techniques , which  I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about  the the costs and  the things like  battery lifetime , energy saving . industrial designer:  another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons . If we just add   a chip which does the voice recognition ,  our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another project manager: Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board industrial designer: well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . user interface: But the cheaper the ch  the the chip or th what was it ? industrial designer: project manager: No , it's th industrial designer: The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . user interface: Well it then we should just  take a look at the costs and  especially for the voice recognition . project manager: I'm not sure how how we'll f  determine the costs , I will have a look at it . project manager:  I'm not sure how how that industrial designer: Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will  have a lo  look at it . project manager:  I'm don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out . project manager:  then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work ,  and I'm sure your personal coaches will  assist you with it . project manager: User Interface Designer ,  Roo , I would like to see the user interface c  concept . project manager: And  user interface:  the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis  decisions Sebastian makes . industrial designer: Well project manager: Well , i it should be easy , user interface: Well project manager: that's w w what we concluded . industrial designer: So we drop the voice recognition ? project manager: No no no , we didn't industrial designer: Or project manager: but it shouldn't be integrated industrial designer: Oh . project manager: yeah , it's of course it's user interface , but  i I was talking about really the design of the industrial designer: Okay <doc-sep>Then  I've I will also take notes during this meeting and I will send you  a summary then as usual . We will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by  our two colleagues that make good work . industrial designer: marketing: project manager: And  then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product . And  end with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits with it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not . project manager: d let's start with the cost aspect so so I look at the aspect discussed last time , that is to say  to have a standard battery , to have a yellow banana shaped  case with  a rubber material around it industrial designer: project manager: to be  to feel spongy , user interface: Like a banana . project manager: So for the financial aspect it's okay , we can  we can continue with this product  as if , marketing: project manager: and we are now going to see the project evaluation with  our marketing expert . marketing: So I made an evaluation and the the evaluation criteria is made according to the users' requirements and the market trends we talked about  during the previous  meetings . marketing: So we we want to have a product fancy look and feel , technologically innovative , easy to use , fashion , easy to find in a room , and robust , project manager: Yeah . marketing: and  according to what you think about the this project you can   make a one point , two point or seven point . marketing: The okay ?  so  fancy look and feel , what do you think ? project manager: Okay . user interface: Do you vote  Christine ? marketing: eh ? user interface: Do you also vote ? marketing: No , I just want to see something project manager: Maybe we all have to agree on a common user interface: Well , we can very easily . So user interface: marketing: Need to project manager: this is your marketing:  I don't know if you we ha we have to put  one  f If it's better or project manager: One is most . project manager: How much would you give on the fancy aspect , on the fashionable aspect ? marketing: Six  s you can how much what ? project manager: How much would you you don't answer to this  questionnaire ? marketing: Oh yes I  I dunno  , I think six , it's a good  user interface: So it will have five point five average . project manager: Four ? industrial designer: A four also , because , except for the wheel , we don't have so much innovation . I I user interface: D are we including the voice are you glu are we including the voice in the end or not ? Huh ? project manager: No . project manager: Four ? So we have four , four f and five ? marketing: We can put four ? user interface: Yeah . Is it fashion ? project manager: Oh yeah , user interface: project manager: its its f its fruit fruit shape . marketing: Yeah it's fashion , because it's a fruit , user interface: Yeah , we can we can put a seven here . marketing: We have the lightning , or project manager: Yeah , we have the marketing: The lighting . project manager: we don't sesh especially have the lightning user interface: So you'll make the material transparent project manager: but marketing: user interface: so that it  lights up completely , or project manager: So it's yellow . project manager: I think it's very easy to marketing: Seven ? project manager: I would say seven . marketing: Is it is it robust ? project manager: Yeah , it's rubber , made of rubber , industrial designer:  f yeah , it's ru it's rubber . user interface: Yeah the only problem there might be which know , i if it's very sensitive , project manager: Yeah . user interface: I don't know project manager: But it is  it is surrounded by rubber material .  if we say that seven it's  it's the better , project manager: Yeah , the be . industrial designer: user interface: Yeah , the top marketing: and when  s six sit six are good it's a good  p product , I think . user interface: Because I saw  some phones that were banana shaped ,  wireless phones not mobile ones , wireless for the house , marketing: project manager: Yeah . user interface:  quite big also , marketing: user interface: and they were selling something like a hundred Euros , two hundred Euros . project manager: I think the industrial designer: But almo also the complexity between a phone and a remote control is not cannot compare . user interface: it's much more complex , but project manager: So , I think , we can summarise . We we have the cost below  our threshold and so we could sell at twenty five Euros and make i make profit . marketing: project manager: So the cost is in the budget , the evaluation is okay , so I th I think we can now  open champagne and make a huge party . user interface: project manager: I don't know if it's provided by  by the meeting staff . user interface: So what does the management say ? project manager: Sorry ? user interface: What does the management say ? project manager: I think we will have  much bigger project next time and a much bigger salary as well "

        "Query": "What is the professor's opinion on the pragmatic overview of the project and can you summarize the discussion surrounding it?",
        "Summary": "The team discussed potential improvements for their model, specifically focusing on MSG and multi-band. However, the professor acknowledged that the task was challenging and their current model was not yet suitable for a real system. Despite this, the team was enthusiastic about the Aurora data, which provided a more realistic scenario, and expressed their interest in continuing to explore the task. The professor emphasized the need for further work and encouraged the team to share any ideas they had for pursuing new directions. He suggested experimenting with MSG and multi-band himself and also recommended learning more about different acoustic environments.",
        "Article": "grad e: Hello ? professor a: So everybody everybody 's on ? phd d: Today 's professor a: Yeah . professor a: eh e and  I guess Chuck you weren't there either , so the  phd b: I was there . professor a: Oh you were there ? phd b: With Hynek ? professor a: Yeah . professor a: What was the w what was the downsampling problem again ? phd c: So we had professor a: I forget . phd c: So the fact that there there is no  low - pass filtering before the downsampling . phd c: There is because there is LDA filtering but that 's perhaps not  the best w m professor a: Depends what it 's frequency characteristic is , yeah . So we discussed about this , about the  professor a: Was there any conclusion about that ? phd c:  \" try it \" . So again this is th this is the downsampling  of the  the feature vector stream phd c:  . professor a: and  Yeah I guess the the  LDA filters they were doing do have   let 's see , so the the the feature vectors are calculated every ten milliseconds so  the question is how far down they are at fifty fifty hertz . Does anybody know what the frequency characteristic is ? phd c: We don't have yet professor a: Oh OK . And the third point  was the  , yeah , the on - line normalization where , well , the recursion f recursion for the mean estimation is a filter with some kind of delay professor a: Yeah . For this , the conclusion of Hynek was , well , \" we can try it but \" professor a:  - huh . professor a: Try try what ? phd c: So try to   take into account the delay of the recursion for the mean estimation . And so while discussing about these these LDA filters , some i issues appeared , like well , the fact that if we look at the frequency response of these filters it 's  , well , we don't know really what 's the important part in the frequency response and there is the fact that in the very low frequency , these filters don't don't really remove a lot .  and that 's probably a reason why , yeah , on - line normalization helps because it it , professor a: Right . Yeah , but perhaps everything could should be could be in the filter ,  the the mean normalization and Yeah . phd c: And this was this LDA  tuning perhaps and Hynek proposed again to his  TRAPS , so . phd c: Yeah , professor a:  I g I guess the key thing for me is is figuring out how to better coordinate between the two sides phd c:  . professor a:  I was talking with Hynek about it later and the the sort of had the sense sort of that that neither group of people wanted to to bother the other group too much . And and I don't think anybody is , you know , closed in in their thinking or are unwilling to talk about things but I think that you were sort of waiting for them to tell you that they had something for you and and that and expected that they would do certain things and they were sor they didn't wanna bother you phd c:   professor a: and they were sort of waiting for you and and and  we ended up with this thing where they they were filling up all of the possible latency themselves , and they just had hadn't thought of that .  it 's true that maybe maybe no one really thought about that that this latency thing would be such a a strict issue phd c: Yeah . Well professor a: in in  the other phd c: Yeah I don't know what happened really , but professor a: Yeah . Because , well , we discussed about that about this problem and they told us \" well , we will do all that 's possible to have enough space for a network \" but then , yeah , perhaps they were too short with the time and professor a: Then they couldn't . Well maybe we should just   you 're you 're bus other than that you folks are busy doing all the all the things that you 're trying that we talked about before right ? And this machines are busy and you 're busy phd c: Yeah . professor a: Let 's let 's , I think that as as we said before that one of the things that we 're imagining is that  there there will be  in the system we end up with there 'll be something to explicitly   do something about noise phd c:   professor a: in addition to the  other things that we 're talking about and that 's probably the best thing to do . And there was that one email that said that it sounded like   things looked very promising up there in terms of  I think they were using Ericsson 's approach or something and in addition to They 're doing some noise removal thing , right ? phd c: Yeah , yeah . phd c: And phd d: Yeah , I modified it well , modifying I studied Barry 's sim code , more or less . and we have some the feature for Italian database and we will try with this feature with the filter to find the result . phd d: and maybe try another type of spectral subtraction , I don't professor a: When you say you don't have a result yet you mean it 's it 's just that it 's in process or that you it finished and it didn't get a good result ? phd d: No . No , no n we have n we have do the experiment only have the feature the feature but the experiment have phd c: Yeah . So  I suggest actually now we we we sorta move on and and hear what 's what 's what 's happening in in other areas like what 's what 's happening with your investigations about echos and so on . grad f: Oh  Well  I haven't started writing the test yet , I 'm meeting with Adam today professor a:   grad f:  and he 's going t show me the scripts he has for  running recognition on mee Meeting Recorder digits . grad f:  I also  haven't got the code yet , I haven't asked Hynek for for the for his code yet . Cuz I looked at  Avendano 's thesis and I don't really understand what he 's doing yet but it it it sounded like  the channel normalization part  of his thesis  was done in a a bit of I don't know what the word is , a a bit of a rough way  it sounded like he  he he it it wasn't really fleshed out and maybe he did something that was interesting for the test situation but I I 'm not sure if it 's what I 'd wanna use so I have to I have to read it more , I don't really understand what he 's doing yet . Yeah I haven't read it in a while so I 'm not gonna be too much help unless I read it again , phd d: It 's my phd c: Oh yeah ? phd d: I know this is mine here . The  so you , and then you 're also gonna be doing this echo cancelling between the the close mounted and the and the the the what we 're calling a cheating experiment  of sorts between the distant grad f:  I I 'm ho Right . grad f: I I think he 's at least planning to do it for the cl close - mike cross - talk and so maybe I can just take whatever setup he has and use it . Yeah actually  he should  I wonder who else is I think maybe it 's Dan Ellis is going to be doing  a different cancellation . One of the things that people working in the meeting task wanna get at is they would like to have cleaner close - miked recordings . So  this is especially true for the lapel but even for the close close - miked  cases  we 'd like to be able to have  other sounds from other people and so forth removed from So when someone isn't speaking you 'd like the part where they 're not speaking to actually be So what they 're talking about doing is using ec  echo cancellation - like techniques . It 's not really echo but  just   taking the input from other mikes and using   a  an adaptive filtering approach to remove the effect of that  other speech .  what was it , there was there was some some some point where eh  Eric or somebody was was speaking and he had lots of silence in his channel and I was saying something to somebody else  which was in the background and it was not it was recognizing my words , which were the background speech on the close close mike . phd b: Yeah that was actually my I was wearing the I was wearing the lapel and you were sitting next to me , professor a: Oh you it was you I was Yeah . phd b: and I only said one thing but you were talking and it was picking up all your words . So I think I think Dan Ellis or somebody who was working with him was going to  work on that . And  I don't know if we 've talked lately about the the plans you 're developing that we talked about this morning  I don't remember if we talked about that last week or not , but maybe just a quick reprise of of what we were saying this morning . So continuing to  extend phd b: What about the stuff that  Mirjam has been doing ? And and S Shawn , yeah . professor a: But that 's   all that 's is a a certainly relevant  study and , you know , what are the features that they 're finding . professor a:  what are the variables , what we 're calling this one , what are the variables that they 're found finding useful phd c:  . professor a:  for phd b: And their their targets are based on canonical mappings of phones to acoustic f features . And that 's certainly one thing to do and we 're gonna try and do something more f more fine than that but   so  So I guess you know what , I was trying to remember some of the things we were saying , do you ha still have that ? Yeah . professor a: There 's those that  yeah , some of some of the issues we were talking about was in j just getting a good handle on on  what \" good features \" are and phd b: What does what did  Larry Saul use for it was the sonorant  detector , right ? How did he H how did he do that ? Wh - what was his detector ?   professor a: And the other thing you were talking about is is is where we get the targets from . So  , there 's these issues of what are the what are the variables that you use and do you combine them using the soft \" AND - OR \" or you do something , you know , more complicated  and then the other thing was so where do you get the targets from ? The initial thing is just the obvious that we 're discussing is starting up with phone labels from somewhere and then  doing the transformation . But then the other thing is to do something better and eh w why don't you tell us again about this this database ? This is the phd b:  ! professor a: And then tell them to talk naturally ? Yeah , yeah . professor a: Maybe you could go to these parlors and and you could , you know you know have have , you know , reduced rates if you if you can do the measurements . You could what you could do is you could sell little rings and stuff with embedded you know , transmitters in them and things professor a: Yeah . phd b:  ! There 's a bunch of data that l around , that people have done studies like that w way way back right ?  I can't remember where  Wisconsin or someplace that used to have a big database of Yeah . I remember there was this guy at A T - andT , Randolph ? or r What was his name ? Do you remember that guy ?  , researcher at A T - andT a while back that was studying , trying to do speech recognition from these kinds of features . professor a: Do you mean eh but you  Mar phd c: Well he was the guy the guy that was using professor a: you mean when was was Mark Randolph there , or ? phd b: Mark Randolph . phd c: Is it the guy that was using the pattern of pressure on the tongue or ? phd b: I can't remember exactly what he was using , now . But I know I just remember it had to do with you know  positional parameters phd c: What Yeah . So the only the only  hesitation I had about it since ,  I haven't see the data is it sounds like it 's it 's continuous variables and a bunch of them . professor a: I don't know how complicated it is to go from there What you really want are these binary labels , and just a few of them . And maybe there 's a trivial mapping if you wanna do it and it 's e but it I I I worry a little bit that this is a research project in itself , whereas  if you did something instead that like  having some manual annotation by  you know , linguistics students , this would there 'd be a limited s set of things that you could do a as per our discussions with with John before phd b:   professor a: but the things that you could do , like nasality and voicing and a couple other things you probably could do reasonably well .  the other thing you could do is boot trying to to  get those binary variables and take the continuous variables from  the   the data itself there , but I I 'm not sure phd b: Could you cluster the just do some kind of clustering ? professor a: Guess you could , yeah . So anyway that 's that 's  that 's another whole direction that cou could be looked at .  in general it 's gonna be for new data that you look at , it 's gonna be hidden variable because we 're not gonna get everybody sitting in these meetings to wear the pellets and  . phd b: So you 're talking about using that data to get  instead of using canonical mappings of phones . phd b: So you 'd use that data to give you sort of what the the true mappings are for each phone ? grad e:   So wh yeah , where this fits into the rest in in my mind , I guess , is that  we 're looking at different ways that we can combine  different kinds of of rep front - end representations  in order to get robustness under difficult or even , you know , typical conditions . And part of it , this robustness , seems to come from  multi - stream or multi - band sorts of things and Saul seems to have a reasonable way of looking at it , at least for one one  articulatory feature . The question is is can we learn from that to change some of the other methods we have , since  , one of the things that 's nice about what he had I thought was that that it it  the decision about how strongly to train the different pieces is based on  a a reasonable criterion with hidden variables rather than  just assuming that you should train e e every detector  with equal strength towards  it being this phone or that phone . It 's a soft \" AND \" , I guess but in in principle you you wanna get a strong concurrence of all the different things that indicate something and then he \" OR 's \" across the different soft \" OR 's \" across the different  multi - band channels . And  the weight yeah , the target for the training of the \" AND \" \" AND ' ed \" things is something that 's kept  as a hidden variable , and is learned with EM . Whereas what we were doing is is  taking the phone target and then just back propagating from that phd b: So he doesn't have professor a: which means that it 's it 's  i It could be for instance that for a particular point in the data you don't want to   train a particular band train the detectors for a particular band . You you wanna ignore that band , cuz that 's a Ban - band is a noisy noisy measure . professor a: And we don't We 're we 're still gonna try to train it up . In our scheme we 're gonna try to train it up to do as well well as it can at predicting . phd b: So he doesn't have to have truth marks or Ho grad e: F right , and  he doesn't have to have hard labels . professor a: Well at the at the tail end , yeah , he has to know what 's where it 's sonorant . But he 's but what he 's - but what he 's not training up  what he doesn't depend on as truth is grad e: Right . professor a:  I guess one way of describing would be if if a sound is sonorant is it sonorant in this band ? Is it sonorant in that band ? grad e: Right . professor a: Is it sonorant in that band ? i It 's hard to even answer that what you really mean is that the whole sound is sonorant . professor a: then it comes down to , you know , to what extent should you make use of information from particular band towards making your decision . And   we 're making in a sense sort of this hard decision that you should you should use everything  with with  equal strength . professor a: And  because in the ideal case we would be going for posterior probabilities , if we had  enough data to really get posterior probabilities and if the if we also had enough data so that it was representative of the test data then we would in fact be doing the right thing to train everything as hard as we can . But  this is something that 's more built up along an idea of robustness from from the beginning and so you don't necessarily want to train everything up towards the phd b: So where did he get his  his tar his  high - level targets about what 's sonorant and what 's not ? grad e: From  canonical mappings  at first phd b: OK . grad e: and then it 's unclear  eh phd b: Using TIMIT ? or using grad e: using TIMIT phd b:  - huh .  we ha we have a kind of iterative training because we do this embedded Viterbi ,  so there is some something that 's suggested , based on the data but it 's it 's not I think it s doesn't seem like it 's quite the same , cuz of this cuz then whatever that alignment is , it 's that for all all bands . professor a: Well no , that 's not quite right , we did actually do them separate tried to do them separately so that would be a little more like what he did . But it 's still not quite the same because then it 's it 's  setting targets based on where you would say the sound begins in a particular band . Might be closer I guess if we did a soft soft target   embedded neural net training like we 've done a few times  f the forward  do the forward calculations to get the gammas and train on those .  what 's next ? phd b: I could say a little bit about w stuff I 've been playing with . You 're playing ? phd b: I  Huh ? professor a: You 're playing ? phd b: Yes , I 'm playing .  so I wanted to do this experiment to see   what happens if we try to  improve the performance of the back - end recognizer for the Aurora task and see how that affects things . And so I had this  I think I sent around last week a this plan I had for an experiment , this matrix where I would take the  the original  the original system . So there 's the original system trained on the mel cepstral features and then com and then  optimize the b HTK system and run that again . So look at the difference there and then  do the same thing for the ICSI - OGI front - end . professor a: What which test set was this ? phd b: This is that I looked at ? professor a:   phd b: So as far as I 've gotten is I 've  been able to go through from beginning to end the  full HTK system for the Italian data and got the same results that  that  Stephane had . So  I started looking to and now I 'm I 'm sort of lookin at the point where I wanna know what should I change in the HTK back - end in order to try to  to improve it . One of the first things I thought of was the fact that they use the same number of states for all of the models professor a:   phd b: and so I went on - line and I  found a pronunciation dictionary for Italian digits professor a:   phd b: and just looked at , you know , the number of phones in each one of the digits .  you know , sort of the canonical way of setting up a an  system is that you use  three states per phone and  so then the the total number of states for a word would just be , you know , the number of phones times three . And so when I did that for the Italian digits , I got a number of states , ranging on the low end from nine to the high end , eighteen . Now you have to really add two to that because in HTK there 's an initial null and a final null so when they use  models that have eighteen states , there 're really sixteen states . And so  their guess of eighteen states seems to be pretty well matched to the two longest words of the Italian digits , the four and five which  , according to my , you know , sort of off the cuff calculation , should have eighteen states each . So my guess  And then if you I I printed out a confusion matrix   for the well - matched case , and it turns out that the longest words are actually the ones that do the best . So my guess about what 's happening is that you know , if you assume a fixed the same amount of training data for each of these digits and a fixed length model for all of them but the actual words for some of them are half as long you really  have , you know , half as much training data for those models . Because if you have a long word and you 're training it to eighteen states ,  you 've got you know , you 've got the same number of Gaussians , you 've gotta train in each case , professor a:   phd b: but for the shorter words , you know , the total number of frames is actually half as many . phd b: So it could be that , you know , for the short words there 's because you have so many states , you just don't have enough data to train all those Gaussians . So  I 'm going to try to  create more word - specific   prototype H M Ms to start training from . professor a: Yeah , it 's not at all uncommon you do worse on long word on short words than long words anyway just because you 're accumulating more evidence for the for the longer word , phd b:   phd b: Yeah so I 'll I 'll , the next experiment I 'm gonna try is to just  you know create  models that seem to be more w matched to my guess about how long they should be . phd b: And as part of that  I wanted to see sort of how the  how these models were coming out , you know , what w when we train up  th you know , the model for \" one \" , which wants to have nine states , you know , what is the  what do the transition probabilities look like in the self - loops , look like in in those models ? And so I talked to Andreas and he explained to me how you can calculate the expected duration of an  just by looking at the transition matrix professor a:   phd b: and so I wrote a little Matlab script that calculates that and so I 'm gonna sort of print those out for each of the words to see what 's happening , you know , how these models are training up , professor a:   I d I did quickly , I did the silence model and and  that 's coming out with about one point two seconds as its average duration and the silence model 's the one that 's used at the beginning and the end of each of the string of digits . And so the S P model , which is what they put in between digits , I I haven't calculated that for that one yet , but  . So they basically their their model for a whole digit string is silence digit , SP , digit , SP blah - blah - blah and then silence at the end . professor a: Are the SP 's optional ?  skip them ? phd b: I have to look at that , but I 'm not sure that they are . Now the one thing about the S P model is really it only has a single s emitting state to it . phd b: So if it 's not optional , you know , it 's it 's not gonna hurt a whole lot professor a: I see . phd b: and it 's tied to the center state of the silence model so it 's not its own  It doesn't require its own training data , professor a:   phd b: So it , it 's pretty good the way that they have it set up , but  i So I wanna play with that a little bit more . I 'm curious about looking at , you know how these models have trained and looking at the expected durations of the models and I wanna compare that in the the well - matched case f to the unmatched case , and see if you can get an idea of just from looking at the durations of these models , you know , what what 's happening . professor a: Yeah , I think that  , as much as you can , it 's good to d sort of not do anything really tricky . professor a: Not do anything that 's really finely tuned , but just sort of eh you know you t you i z phd b: Yeah . professor a: The premise is kind of you have a a good person look at this for a few weeks and what do you come up with ? phd b:   professor a: And  phd b: And Hynek , when I wa told him about this , he had an interesting point , and that was th  the the final models that they end up training up have I think probably something on the order of six Gaussians per state . And Hynek was saying that well , probably in a real application , you wouldn't have enough compute to handle models that are very big or complicated . But you know , it depends on what the actual application is and it 's really hard to know what your limits are in terms of how many Gaussians you can have . professor a: I I I what I thought you were gonna say i but which I was thinking was  where did six come from ? Probably came from the same place eighteen came from . professor a:  that 's another parameter , right ? that that maybe , you know ,  you really want three or nine or phd b: Yeah , yeah . Well one thing  , if I if if I start  reducing the number of states for some of these shorter models that 's gonna reduce the total number of Gaussians . professor a: how much better can you make it ? And  since they 're only simple things there 's nothing that you 're gonna do that is going to blow up the amount of computation phd b:   professor a: if you found that nine was better than six that would be O K , I think , actually . I really wasn't even gonna play with that part of the system yet , professor a:  -  , OK . phd b: I was just gonna change the the t professor a: Yeah , just work with the models , yeah . So  what 's  I guess your plan for You you you guys ' plan for the next next week is just continue on these these same things we 've been talking about for Aurora and phd c: Yeah , I guess we can try to have some kind of new baseline for next week perhaps . And then do other things , play with the spectral subtraction , and retry the MSG and things like that . I think that after all of this   confusion settles down in another some point a little later next year there will be some sort of standard and it 'll get out there and hopefully it 'll have some effect from something that that has  been done by our group of people but  e even if it doesn't there 's there 's go there 'll be standards after that . phd b: Does anybody know how to  run Matlab sort of in batch mode like you c send it s a bunch of commands to run and it gives you the output . Is it possible to do that ? grad e: I I think  Mike tried it phd b: Yeah ? grad e: and he says it 's impossible so he went to Octave . phd c: What is Octave so ? It 's a free software ? grad e: What 's that ?  , Octave ? phd c: Yeah . phd c: And it does the same syntax and everything eh like Matlab , or ? grad e:  i it 's a little behind , it 's the same syntax but it 's a little behind in that Matlab went to these like  you can have cells and you can you can  implement object - oriented type things with Matlab .  Octave doesn't do that yet , so I think you , Octave is kinda like Matlab  four point something or . phd b: If it 'll do like a lot of the basic matrix and vector stuff grad e: The basic stuff , right <doc-sep> and I  like to show you the agenda for the meeting , I don't know if it was sent round to all of you . project manager: this is the the plan for today's meeting is  firstly just to introduce the project briefly ,  although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already . project manager:  then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings ,  specifically the whiteboard over there .  then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan  and discuss come up with some preliminary ideas about it .  we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product . The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . We're going the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that .  similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together . industrial designer: I'm a bit confused about  what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ?  i is it just  more detail ,  as I understand it ? project manager: I think it th w we're talking the the functional design is more your  area of things where you'll be we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control industrial designer: Right . project manager: and what what specific things it it has to do industrial designer: project manager: but the conceptual design is  perhaps bigger than that and includes the how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing . So whe where do we identify the components of our  product ?  I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ? project manager:  I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then industrial designer: Okay .  what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for for the project , specifically the whiteboard . project manager: So each person in turn , I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project . industrial designer: marketing: Why are you looking at me ? user interface: marketing: project manager: Would you like to go first ? marketing: Do I have a choice ? industrial designer: marketing: Okay . marketing: So , my name's Cat and I'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey industrial designer: project manager: marketing: so  user interface: marketing: Okay . industrial designer: project manager: marketing: Yeah , I don't think it's furry enough , so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit . industrial designer: marketing:  okay and I like it because it's small and it's fluffy . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: And one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink . project manager: Excellent , and what's your what's your role within the team ? marketing: I am the  I need my notebook ,  ooh industrial designer: marketing: top banana . Okay , cool , I am the Marketing Expert  so like I'm gonna be doing the apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything the user g requirements specification of the functional design ,  trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design project manager: industrial designer: project manager: And more about yourself , you're from ? marketing:  I'm from Leicester , project manager:  what else do you want to know ? industrial designer: marketing: I like sports  yeah , aerobics , kickboxing , spinning project manager: marketing:  and  project manager: But not with rabbits . project manager: There's a an if you have not enough room there's an eraser there and you can rub it off .  so   I'm the Interface Designer in this project and my favourite animal , I m  I'm not so sure because I'm not so so very  familiar with all kinds of animals , but I do like dogs . project manager: user interface: Oh , sorry , maybe I should have shouldn't have said it beforehand but industrial designer:  . project manager: industrial designer: marketing: user interface:  well , there are different kinds of dogs , but okay  . user interface:  yeah and I do like dogs because they are good friends to people and they are loyal . project manager: user interface:  yeah maybe maybe the fact that they protect their home as well , yeah . project manager: user interface:  I hope to be loyal to the project industrial designer: marketing: user interface: and not to n not to  let people doing similar projects know the details of our project or something , yeah . industrial designer: project manager: And where where are you from ? user interface: I'm from Estonia project manager: Estonia .  so is there anything else you'd like to know ? Oh , right , my roles , industrial designer: . user interface:  so  in the different  stages of the design , so at first I will be responsible for  for yeah , designing the technical functions of the   of the remote control  then in the in the conceptual design stage I need to  come up with  interface concept and then in the last  stage I will be responsible for the int infa for the user interface design . Okay  I'll do some I'll rub the features project manager: industrial designer: and let the drawing stay . user interface: industrial designer:  this is going to be marketing: They're not just like a big round body and then some really skinny legs industrial designer: Yeah , that'll do . industrial designer: Big , round body , really skinny legs marketing: project manager: industrial designer: and they've got a long tail marketing: industrial designer: and a long face . industrial designer: So this is what I like about cows marketing: Horns , project manager: user interface: industrial designer: that they just keeps sitting there eating grass , marketing: draw some horns . industrial designer: they do not disturb anybody  marketing: project manager: industrial designer: they're kind of Buddhist in a way .  my my role in the project is   the industrial designer , so I'm supposed to design all the details of of the product  ho how it works and whatever it'll  take during the functional role , what are the various functions that have to be performed by it  during the  conceptual design , what are the various components of it and  finally , I'm not too sure what was the last part .  the detailed design , I I guess it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other .  I'm doing my P_H_D_ in Psycholinguistics , I sit at the Department of Psychology . industrial designer: That doesn't look like a cow , does it ? project manager: Okay , here's a space . project manager:  I like dogs too , but I can't do that already because I can't draw a dog as well as you can . marketing: Is there a difference ? user interface: Is a ar are they also like lizards or are they project manager: They're Yeah , they're l it's a kind of lizard . user interface: yeah , they are project manager: And I I like geckos user interface: project manager: and , and where I was living in Cambodia they used to live in my house user interface: Ah . marketing: project manager: and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening . industrial designer: user interface: I hope you don't like snakes , do you ? project manager: I don't like snakes . project manager: I'm from Melbourne and I'm your Project Manager for today industrial designer:  . project manager: and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way , so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product . So , I've just thought marketing: If you right click on it you can project manager: yeah I've just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally as marketing: industrial designer: We've got  we're planning to sell these remote controls for let's make that go away , that means we've got five minutes .  so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target . Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about  what we're thinking of this remote control ? user interface: Yep . I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones . I think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us , industrial designer: project manager: but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be  included in this remote control that that are out of the ordinary . industrial designer: I think  i in the beginning  one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be  trendy , user friendly and original so  I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this . marketing: and the other things that they've made and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures . marketing: and  so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , you know ? project manager: marketing: So I'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that . marketing: You know , so something heading towards that , so it's not overly  I don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so I figure how many do you need , you know ? project manager: project manager: So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or industrial designer: marketing: Something that's a little less crowded than this , like  you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ? project manager: marketing: They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again . industrial designer: There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time , marketing: Sometimes they play a movie . marketing: there's no need to have buttons on it to do that , project manager: So , no . project manager: It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that . marketing: So , if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that's fine project manager: industrial designer:  . marketing: and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . marketing: 'Cause like if you look at the train , it's just very like , there's no extra bits on it , the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing project manager: Oh I haven't had a look yet , yep . marketing:  but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people , but it looks really pretty too .  we can aim for  we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although I don't think that  it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life , project manager: user interface: Yeah but   e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't  go like too far away from from the usual ones , because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems industrial designer: Yeah . So , i it should kind of fit in as well , and the stereotype of a project manager: It's like those fancy websites that you can't access industrial designer: yeah . project manager: because you have no idea how to get in , but the designers thought they were great . Okay , so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this .  we've got another meeting in thirty minutes , so you're you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im basically you're looking at the working design , industrial designer: Alright . project manager: you're looking at the technical functions design , and for you it's the user requirements specification , marketing: - <doc-sep>professor a: We 're not recording yet , are we ? grad g: Well , I don't think phd f: No , that that wasn't recorded . phd f: I guess I have to d stop doing this sigh of contentment , you know , after sipping cappuccino or something . phd f: I was just noticing a big s professor d: So are we recording now ? Is this phd e: Yeah . professor d: So , what were we gonna talk about again ? So we said we said data collection , which we 're doing . Do we do th do you go around the room and do names or anything ? grad g: I think that phd e: It 's a good idea . grad g: u usually we 've done that and also we 've s done digits as well , but I forgot to print any out . Besides with this big a group , phd b: You can write them on the board , if you want . I it 'd be even better with this big grad g: it would take too much time . phd e: Mari ? postdoc h: What professor a: What ? professor d: It 's not that long . professor d: w u phd e: So that thing the little th that part should be pointing upwards . professor a: It 's kind of professor d: Oh , yeah , the element , yeah , n should be as close to you your mouth as possible . So what we had was that we were gonna talk about data collection , and , you you put up there data format , professor a:  . professor d: and other tasks during data collection , professor a: So , I think the goal the goal was what can we do how can you do the data collection differently to get professor d: and professor a: what can you add to it to get , some information that would be helpful for the user - interface design ? Like grad g: especially for querying . postdoc h: Well , one thing that came up in the morning in the morning was the , i  , if he I ,  if he has s I I don't remember , Mister Lan - Doctor Landry ? grad g: Landay . postdoc h: La - Landay ? So he has , these , tsk note - taking things , professor a:   postdoc h: then that would sort of be a summary which you wouldn't have to solicit . professor a: Well , if if you actually take notes as a summary as opposed to n take notes in the sense of taking advantage of the time - stamps . So action item or  , reminder to send this to so - and - so , blah - blah - blah . grad g: But if we had the CrossPads , we could ask people , you know , if if something comes up write it down and mark it somehow , postdoc h:   And so , you know phd f: the down - side to that is that he sort of indicated that the , quality of the handwriting recognition was quite poor . I don't think there 'd be so many that you couldn't have someone clean it up professor a: So grad g: pretty easily . We also could come up with some code for things that people want to do so that for frequent things . So , if that you know , if if we just keep it simple then maybe it 's still useful . professor d: I just realized we skipped the part that we were saying we were gonna do at the front where we each said who we were . professor a: But anyway , shall we do the roll call ? professor d: No , not a No , I just My mind went elsewhere . So , yeah , I 'm Morgan , and where am I ? I 'm on channel three . postdoc h: Should we have used pseudo - names ? Should we do it a second time with pseudo No . professor d: I 'm Rocky Raccoon on channel phd e: Let me , turn that off . grad g: And , do you want to do the P D As and the P Z phd e: Oh . phd e: PDM - right , PZA - right PDA - right , PDA - left . grad g: Yeah , and eventually once this room gets a little more organized , the Jimlets will be mounted under the table , and these guys will be permanently mounted somehow . postdoc h: I have a question on protocol in these meetings , which is when you say \" Jimlet \" and the person listening won't know what that is , sh shou How how do we get Is that important information ? You know , the Jimlet  , the box that contains the professor d: Well , suppose we broaden out and go to a range of meetings besides just these internal ones . There 's gonna be lots of things that any group of people who know each other have in column common that we will not know . professor d: we we were originally gonna do this with VLSI design , and and and the reason we didn't go straight to that was because immediately ninety percent of what we heard would be jargon to to us . Should we do it and , if so , what 'll we have them do ?  , do we have s people write summaries ? Everybody or one person ? And then , do we ask people for how they would query things ? Is that phd f: There 's there 're sub - problems in that , in that where or when do you actually ask them about that ? professor a: Right . phd f: that was One thing I was thinking about was is that Dan said earlier that , you know , maybe two weeks later , which is when you would want to query these things , you might ask them then . phd f: But there 's a problem with that in that if you 're not If you don't have an interactive system , it 's gonna be hard to go beyond sort of the first level of question . professor d: There 's there 's another problem grad g: And professor d: which is , we certainly do want to branch out beyond , recording meetings about Meeting Recorder . And , once we get out beyond our little group , the people 's motivation factor , reduces enormously . And if we start giving them a bunch of other things to do , how you know , we we did n you know another meeting here for another group and and , they were fine with it . But if we 'd said , \" OK , now all eight of you have to have to come up with , the summar \" grad g: Well , I asked them to and none of them did . grad g: So , I I asked them to send me ideas for queries after the meeting postdoc h:   grad g: So I didn't track them down and say \" please do th do it now \" . professor d: I I 'm worried that if you did even if you did push them into it , it it it might be semi - random , professor a: Right . professor d: as opposed to what you 'd really want to know if you were gonna use this thing . grad g: I just don't know how else to generate the queries other than getting an expert to actually listen to the meeting and say \" that 's important , that might be a query \" . Well , there is this other thing which y which you were alluding to earlier , which is , there are certain key words like , you know , \" action item \" and things like that , which could be used in , t to some degree finding the structure . phd e: Although professor a: W postdoc h: And and I also , was thinking , with reference to the n  , note - taking , the advantage there is that you get structure without the person having to do something artificial later . And the fir third thing I wanted to say is the summaries afterwards , I think they should be recorded instead of written because I think that , it would take so long for people to write that I think you wouldn't get as good a summary . professor a: How about this idea ? That normally at most meetings somebody is delegated to be a note - taker . professor a: And So why don't we just use the notes that somebody takes ? postdoc h: Yeah . grad g: that gives you a summary but it doesn't really How do you generate queries from that ? phd e: Well . But , maybe a summary is one of the things we 'd want from the output of the system . phd b: Actually And so grad g: James and I were talking about this during one of the breaks . And the problem with that is , I 'm definitely going to do something with information retrieval even if it 's sort of not full full - bore what I 'm gonna do for my thesis . And so if someone wants to do that , that 's fine , but it 's not gonna be me . professor d: Well , I think that we  , the the f the core thing is that you know once we get some of these issues nailed down , we need to do a bunch of recordings professor a: Well professor d: and send them off to IBM and get a bunch of transcriptions even if they 're slightly flawed grad g: Yep . professor d: And then , i i we can start l looking and thinking , what do we want to know about these things and at the very least . So , if you could sense just when people are writing , and you tell them not to doodle , or try not to be using that for other purposes , and each person has a note pad . Then you c you can just have a fff plot of wh you know , who 's writing when . But I bet that 's that will allow you to go into the sort of the hot places where people are writing things down . phd b: you can tell when you 're in a meeting when everybody stops to write something down that something was just said . phd b: It may not be kept in the later summary , but at that point in time is was something that was important . phd b: And that wouldn't take any extra postdoc h: That 's a nice idea . phd b: Or someone could just pu you could just put your hand on the pad professor d: It professor c:   It 's professor d: That 's a good idea but that doesn't Maybe I 'm missing something , but that doesn't get to the question of how we come up with queries , right ? professor a: Well , what it does phd b: Well , then you can go to the points where the you could actually go to those points in time and find out what they were talking about . phd b: And grad g: y professor a: I I think it 's an interesting thing . I don't think it gets at the the queries per - se , but it does give us an information fusion sort of thing that , you know , you wanna i say \" what were the hot - points of the meeting ? \" phd b: Yeah . professor d: That that 's what  , is that I think it gets at something interesting but if we were asking the question , which I thought we were , of of of , \" how do we figure out what 's the nature of the queries that people are gonna want to ask of such a system ? \" , knowing what 's important doesn't tell you what people are going to be asking . phd e: Well , see , there are th professor a: I think you could say they 're gonna ask about , when  , when did so - and - so s talk about blah . phd b: At least you can find the locations where there are maybe keywords professor d: Maybe . grad g: i this would tell you what the hit is , phd b: and grad g: not what the query is . grad g: And so you could you can generate a query from the hits , professor a: Right . grad g: but phd b: We don't even know what  , if you want to find out what any user will use , that might be true for one domain and one user , professor d:   professor d: Yeah , but we 're just looking for a place to start with that phd b:  . professor d: because , you know , th what what what James is gonna be doing is looking at the user - interface and he 's looking at the query in in i We we have five hours of pilot data of the other stuff but we have zero hours of of of queries . So he 's just sort of going \" where where do I where do I start ? \" professor a: w Well , th you could do I think the summaries actually may help get us there , professor d: OK . One , if you have a summary if you have a bunch of summaries , you can do a word frequency count and see what words come up in different types of meetings . professor a: So \" action item \" is gonna come up whether it 's a VLSI meeting , or speech meeting , or whatever . So words that come up in different types of meetings may be something that you would want to query about . professor a: the second thing you could possibly do with it is just run a little pilot experiment with somebody saying \" here 's a summary of a meeting , what questions might you want to ask about it to go back ? \" grad g: Yeah , I think that 's difficult because then they 're not gonna ask the questions that are in the summary . professor a: Well grad g: But , I think it would give professor a: That 's one possi one possible scenario , though , is you have the summary , grad g:   So that that is another use of Meeting Recorder that we haven't really talked about , which is for someone else , as opposed to as a remembrance agent , which is what had been my primary thought in the information retrieval part of it would be . But , I guess if you had a meeting participant , they could use the summary to refresh themselves about the meeting and then make up queries . phd e: But th there is this ,  There is this class of queries , which are the things that you didn't realize were important at the time but some in retrospect you think \" oh , hang on , didn't we talk about that ? \" And it 's something that didn't appear in the summary but you professor a:   phd e: And that 's kind of what this kind of , complete data capture is kind of nicest for . phd e: Cuz it 's the things that you wouldn't have bothered to make an effort to record but they get recorded . So ,  And th there 's no way of generating those , u u until we just until they actually occur . phd e: But  , it 's difficult to sort of say \" and if I was gonna ask four questions about this , what would they be ? \" Those aren't the kind of things that come up . postdoc h: I also think that w if if you can use the summaries as an indication of the important points of the of the meeting , then you might get something like y So if th if the obscure item you want to know more about was some form of data collection , you know , maybe the summary would say , you know , \" we discussed types of na data collection \" . If you if you had the the larger structure of the of the discourse , then if you can categorize what it is that you 're looking for with reference to those l those larger headings , then you can find it even if you don't have a direct route to that . postdoc h: I think that grad g: That 's a pretty fine grain that the note - taker will have to take . I think you got to have somebody who knows the pro knows the topic or you know , whose job it is delegated to be the note - taker . phd b: No , but someone who can come sit in on the meetings and then takes the notes with them that the real note - taker grad g: But they phd b: And that way that one student has , you know , a rough idea of what was going on , and they can use it for their research .  , this isn't really necessarily what you would do in a real system , grad g:   But if he has some students that want to study that then they should sort of get to know the people and attend those meetings , professor d:   Their sort of note - taking application stuff they 've been doing for the last couple of years , and I don't think anyone is still working on it . grad g: And so the question is \" is there such a person ? \" And I think right now , the answer is \" no \" . professor a: Well professor d: I 've b been thinking grad g: We 'll just have to see . professor d: I 've been thinking about it a little bit here about the  , th this , e  I think that the now I 'm thinking that the summary a summary , is actually a reasonable , bootstrap into this into what we 'd like to get at . It 's it 's not ideal , but we you know , we we have to get started someplace . So I was I was just thinking about , suppose we wanted to get w We have this collection of meeting . So now we have five hours of meetings and , you ask me , \" Morgan , what d you know , what kind of questions do you want to ask ? \"  , I wouldn't have any idea what kind of questions I want to ask . So in fact if I looked at summary of it , I 'd go \" oh , yeah , I was in that meeting , I remember that , what was the part that \" And and th I think that might then help me to think of things even things that aren't listed in the summary , but just as a as a as a refresh of what the general thing was going on in the meeting . One , as sort of a refresh to help bootstrap queries , professor d:   professor a:  phd b: So how does the summary get generated ? professor a: Well , i i ? phd b: I 'm not against the idea of a summary , grad g: By hand . phd b: but I wanted to think carefully about who 's generating it professor a: Or , d o phd b: and how because the summary will drive the queries . professor a: What I I think , you know , in most meetings , phd b: So professor a: this one being different , but in most meetings that I attend , there 's somebody t explicitly taking notes , frequently on a laptop  , you can just make it be on a laptop , phd b:   professor a: so then yo you 're dealing with ASCII and not somebody you don't have to go through handwriting recognition . postdoc h: I I I think that , there 's we 're using \" summary \" in two different ways . postdoc h: And what I originally thought was , if you asked someone \" what was the meeting about ? \" phd b: OK . postdoc h: And then they would say \" well , we talked about this and then we talked about that , and so - and - so talked about \" And then you 'd have , like I e My thought was to have multiple people summarize it , on recording rather than writing because writing takes time and you get irrelevant other things that u take time , that professor a:   postdoc h: Whereas if you just say it immediately after the meeting , you know , a two - minute summary of what the meeting was about , I think you would get , with mult See , I I also worry about having a single note - taker because that 's just one person 's perception . And , you know , it it 's releva it 's relative to what you 're focus was on that meeting , professor d:   professor d: A postdoc h: So , my proposal would be that it may be worth considering both of those types , you know , the note - taking and a spontaneous oral summary afterwards , professor a: OK . postdoc h: no longer than two minutes , professor d: Adam , you can postdoc h: from multiple people . professor d: but but , my impression was that , pretty much , true that the meetings here , nobody sits with a w  , with a laptop grad g: Never . Does anyone ? phd b: Dan ? professor d: I grad g: Dan is the one who who most frequently would take notes , phd e: Yeah . Most of the meetings we have are four or five people grad g: That 's true are four or five people . professor d: and you 're not you don't have somebody sitting and taking minutes for it . professor a: So , I think it depends on whether it 's a business meeting or a technical discussion . grad g: The IRAM meeting , they they take notes every professor d: Do they ? grad g: There 's  a person with a laptop at each meeting . phd b: I don't know how , but for instance , the outline is sort of up here and that 's what people are seeing . phd e: We sh we should grad g: I agree , but but you you just you g end up with video , postdoc h: I agree . phd e: f u I think for this data capture , it would be nice to have a digital camera grad g: Yeah , different phd b: y phd e: just to take pictures of who 's there , where the microphones are , and then we could also put in what 's on the board . grad g: But don't you think that 's Don't you think that But postdoc h: I agree .  , I I just think  , I think that right now we don't make a record of where people are sitting on the tables . phd e: Not not as part of the not as a part of the data that you have to recover . phd e: Just just in terms of phd b: We should just Like archiving it or storing it . postdoc h: It 's i because discourse is about things , phd b: Because someone postdoc h: and then you have the things that are about , and it 's recoverable . phd b: someone later might be able to take these and say \" OK , they , you know at least these are the people who were there phd e: So phd b: and here 's sort of what they started talking about , and \" and just postdoc h: Yes . professor d: Li postdoc h: Like you said , three snapshots professor d: L L L postdoc h: and professor d: Liz , you postdoc h: Just to archive . professor d: u  , Liz , you sa you sat in on the , subcommittee meeting or whatever phd e: Actually professor d: on you on the subcommittee meeting for for at the ,  that workshop we were at that , Mark Liberman was was having . They they they they h must have had some discussion about video and the visual aspect , and all that . But I 'm just saying first of all there 's a whole bunch of fusion issues that DARPA 's interested in . And there 's also I think a personal interest on the part of Mark Liberman in this kind of in storing these images in any data we collect professor d:   phd b: And professor d: I think you  , that the key thing there is that this is a description of database collection effort that they 're talking about doing . professor d: And if the database exists and includes some visual information that doesn't mean that an individual researcher is going to make any use of it . professor d: So ,  grad g: But that it 's gonna be a lot of effort on our part to create it , and store it , and get all the standards , and to do anything with it . So we 're gonna So we 're gonna do what we 're gonna do , whatever 's reasonable for us . phd b: I think even doing something very crude professor d: But having phd b: Like I know with ATIS , we just had a tape recorder running all the time . phd b: And later on it turned out it was really good that you had a tape recorder of what was happening , even though you w you just got the speech from the machine . So if you can find some really , you know , low , perplexity , grad g: Low fidelity . And if it 's simple as  , as simple as just the digital phd b: Otherwise you 'd you lose it . professor d: Well , minimally , what what Dan is referring to at least having some representation of the p the spatial position of the people , postdoc h: Yeah . professor d: so ,  grad g: Well , once the room is a little more fixed that 's a little easier professor d: Yeah . grad g: But phd b: Also CMU has been doing this and they were the most vocal at this meeting , Alex Waibel 's group . And they have said , I talked to the student who had done this , that with two fairly inexpensive cameras they they just recorded all the time professor d:   phd b: and were able to get all the information from or maybe it was three from all the parts of the room . So I think we would be we might lose the chance to use this data for somebody later who wants to do some kind of processing on it if we don't collect it at all . The problem with it is you 'll have more people who don't want to be filmed than who don't want to be recorded . grad g: So that there 's going to be another group of people who are gonna say \" I won't participate \" . phd b: Or you could put a paper bag over everybody 's head grad g:  phd b: and not look at each other and not look at boards , and just all be sitting talking . phd b: That would be an interes Bu postdoc h: Well professor d: Great idea . But I think y she 's we 're just proposing a minimal preservation of things on boards , phd b: Yeah . postdoc h: sp spatial organization And you could anonymize the faces for that matter . You know , this is grad g: But , you know , that 's a lot of infrastructure and work . postdoc h: We can talk about the grad g: To set it up and then anonymize it ? postdoc h: It 's just one snapshot . phd b: No , it wa n not ,  professor a: No , no , no , no . Maybe we don't want to spend that much more time discussing it , phd f: Did they store it digitally , or ? postdoc h: but phd b:   I think they just phd f: or just put it on videotape ? phd b: I think they just had the videotapes with a c you know , a counter or something . Well , I think for  , for our purposes we probably will d phd b: I 'm not sure . professor d: we we might try that some and and we certainly already have some recordings that don't have that , which , you know , we we 'll we 'll get other value out of , I think . postdoc h: Th The thing is , if it 's easy to collect it it th then I think it 's a wise thing to do because once it 's gone it 's gone . And phd b: I 'm just The community If LDC collects this data u  , and L - if Mark Liberman is a strong proponent of how they collect it and what they collect , there will probably be some video data in there . phd b: And so that could argue for us not doing it or it could argue for us doing it . The only place where it sort of overlaps is when some of the summarization issues are actually could be , easier made easier if you had the video . professor d: I think at the moment we should be determining this on the basis of our own , interests and needs rather than hypothetical ones from a community thing . professor d: As you say , if they if they decide it 's really critical then they will collect a lot more data than we can afford to , and and will include all that . professor d: professor a: e professor d: I I I 'm not worried about the cost of setting it up . In other words , it 's it it 'd be kind of silly to collect it all and not look at it at all . And so I I I think that we do have to do some picking and choosing of the stuff that we 're doing . But I I am int I do think that we m minimally want something we might want to look at at some some , subsets of that . Like for a meeting like this , at least , take a Polaroid of the of the of the boards , phd b: Of the board . phd b: Or at least make sure that the note - taker takes a sh you know , a snapshot of the board . professor d: a and know the position of the people phd b: That 'll make it a lot easier for meetings that are structured . phd b: otherwise later on if nobody wrote this stuff on the board down we 'd have a harder time summarizing it or agreeing on a summary .  , this is shared knowledge among all the participants , and it 's a shame to keep it off the recording . grad g: except in postdoc h: s grad g: er , if we weren't recording this , this this would get lost .  , I just think that the grad g: The point is that we 're not saving it anyway . postdoc h: Well professor a: What do you mean we 're not saving it anyway ? I 've written all of this down and it 's getting emailed to you . That would be the other alternative , to make sure that anything that was on the board , is in the record . postdoc h: Well professor a: Well , that 's why that 's why I 'm saying that I think the note - taking would be I think in many for many meetings there will be some sort of note - taking , in which case , that 's a useful thing to have  , we  , we don't need to require it . professor a: so so we won't worry about requiring these things , but the more things that we can get it for , the more useful it will be for various applications . professor d: So So , departing for the moment from the data collection question but actually talking about , you know , this group and what we actually want to do , so I guess that 's th the way what you were figuring on doing was was was , putting together some notes and sending them to to everybody from from today ? OK . professor d: So so the question that that we started with was whether there was anything else we should do during during th during the collection . professor d: And I guess the CrossPads was certainly one idea , and we 'll get them from him and we 'll just do that . Right ? And then the next thing we talked about was the was the summaries and are we gonna do anything about that . professor a: So , if I 'm collecting data then there is this question of do I use CrossPads ? professor d: Yeah . professor a: So , I think that if we really seriously have me collect data and I can't use CrossPads , it 's probably less useful for you guys to go to the trouble of using it , unless you think that the CrossPads are gonna n I 'm not I 'm not sure what they 're gonna do . But but having a small percentage of the data with it , I 'm not sure whether that 's useful or not . professor d: I guess the point was to try again , to try to collect more information that could be useful later for for the UI stuff . professor d: So it 's sort of Landay supplying it so that Landay 's stuff can be easier to do . professor d: So it it Right now he 's g operating from zero , professor a: Nothing . professor d: and so even if we didn't get it done from UW , it seems like that would could still You shou professor a: OK . phd b: I think it 'd be useful to have a small amount of it just as a proof of concept . grad g: And and they seem to not be able to give enough of them away , so we could probably get more as well . So if it if it seems to be really useful to you guys , we could probably get a donation to me . I think it it it will again depend on Landay , and if he has a student who 's interested , and how much infrastructure we 'll need . grad g: but if it requires a lot of our time , we probably won't do it . professor d: I guess a lot of the stuff we 're doing now really is pilot in one sense or another . That if if people have something in front of them phd b: I 'd be sort of cool . So , I j I think we should just say this is not we don't want to put any extra burden on people , but if they happen to generate minutes , could could they send it to us ? grad g: Yeah . What I was gonna say is that I don't want to ask people to do something they wouldn't normally do in a meeting . professor d: So who who does this summarization ? postdoc h: Yeah , I 'm thinking that grad g: People in the meeting . grad g: You know , just at at the end of the meeting , before you go , postdoc h:  - huh . phd e: People with radio mikes can go into separate rooms and continue recording without hearing each other . phd b: Well , then you should try them a few weeks later postdoc h: How fascinating . phd b: and They have all these memory experiments about how little you actually retain grad g: And see score them ? phd e: That 's right . phd b: and wasn't phd e: If we do if we collect four different summaries , you know , we 're gonna get all this weird data about how people perceive things differently . professor a: But but again , like the CrossPads , I don't think I would base a lot of stuff on it , professor d: Ru grad g: I d yeah , I don't know how you would do it , though . professor a: because I think I know when I see the the clock coming near the end of the meeting , I 'm like inching towards the door . grad g: Maybe e Is email easier ? postdoc h: Well , I think if grad g: I when you first said do do it , spoken , what I was thinking is , oh then people have to come up postdoc h:   postdoc h: Yeah , I 'd just try Well , however the least intrusive and and quickest way is , and th and closest to the meeting time too , cuz people will start to forget it as soon as they l leave . But , I don't think that they 'll necessarily you 'll you 'll get many people willing to stay . professor a: But , you know , if you get even one postdoc h: w professor d: Well , I think it 's like the note - taking thing , postdoc h: I would s Yeah . professor d: that that y that you can't certainly can't require it or people aren't gonna want to do this . postdoc h: And I 'm also wondering , couldn't that be included in the data sample so that you could increase the num you know , the words that are , recognized by a particular individual ? If you could include the person 's meeting stuff and also the person 's summary stuff , maybe that would be  , phd e: Yeah . postdoc h: Under the same acoustic circumstance , cuz if they just walk next door with their set - up , nothing 's changed , phd e: Right . postdoc h: just phd f: So I have a question about queries , grad g: God , that 's bugging me . phd f: which is , grad g: Can we turn that light off ? postdoc h: You turn phd f:  grad g: If can we turn that just that that let professor d: The fl the fluorescent light is flickering . grad g: Yeah , there 's a phd b: Oh , it is it is like OK . professor a: That and y Too much caffeine and really tired , grad g: Too much caffeine . phd f: the question I had about queries was , so what we 're planning to do is have people look at the summaries and then generate queries ? Are are we gonna try and o grad g: We we 've just been talking , how do we generate queries ? phd f: Yeah . phd f: so , the question I had is is have we given any thought to how we would generate queries automatically given a summary ?  , I think that 's a whole research topic un unto itself , professor d: Mmm . phd f: n phd b: Shouldn't Landay and his group be in charge of figuring out how to do this ? professor d: Yeah . phd b: They 're the expert phd e: Mari ? professor a: Yeah ? phd e: Someone wants to know when you 're getting picked up . Is someone picking you up ? professor a: what 's our schedule ? professor d: Well , you still wanted to talk with Liz . professor a: Let 's see , you and I need dis  , no , we did the Liz talk . professor a: We need to finish this discussion , and you and I need a little time for wrap - up and quad chart . So , grad g: And what ? professor a:  professor d: I 'm at your disposal . professor a: what what 's the plan for this discussion ? We should professor d: I think we should be able to wind up in another half - hour or something , you think ? grad g: At least . professor a: So , I think phd b: It 's interesting that he 's got , like , this discussion free professor d: Well , we still haven't talked about the action items from here and so on . professor d: And professor a: e e why don't you say five - thirty ? I don't phd e: OK , five - thirty . grad g: Well , in answer to \" is it Landay 's problem ? \" , he doesn't have a student who 's interested right now in doing anything . So I don't think he wants to do information retrieval , query generation , that sort of stuff . professor d: Yeah , well there 's gonna be these student projects that can do some things but it can't be , yeah , very deep . u I I actually think that that , again , just as a bootstrap , if we do have something like summaries , then having the people who are involved in the meetings themselves , who are cooperative and willing to do yet more , come up with with with queries , could at least give give Landay an idea of the kind of things that people might want to know .  , ye Right ? If he doesn't know anything about the area , and the people are talking about and and ,  phd b: But the people will just look at the summaries or the minutes and re and sort of back - generate the queries . phd f: Well , I 'm not sure I 'm not sure that 's a solved problem . phd f: Right ? Of how to how to generate queries from a phd b: How to do this from the summary . phd b: So what you want to h to do is , people who were there , who later see , minutes and s put in summary form , which is not gonna be at the same time as the meeting . phd b: and , like , make up some stuff to which these notes would be an answer , or or a deeper Yeah . phd b: You postdoc h: I 'm also wondering if we could ask the the people a a question which would be \" what was the most interesting thing you got out of this meeting ? \" Becau - in terms of like informativeness , phd b: That 's a good one . postdoc h: it might be , you know , that the summary would would not in even include what the person thought was the most interesting fact . professor a: But actually I would say that 's a better thing to ask than have them summarize the meeting . postdoc h: Because you get , like , the general structure of important points and what the what the meeting was about . postdoc h: So you get the general structure , the important points of what the meeting was about with the summary . But with the \" what 's the most interesting thing you learned ? \"  , so the fact that , I know that Transcriber uses Snack is something that I thought was interesting phd b: Going to see the kids . So , you could ge pick up some of the micro items that wouldn't even occur as major headings professor a:   professor c: Are you thinking about just asking one participant or all of them ? grad g: As many are willing to do it . Cuz you 'll get cuz you 'll get very different answers from everybody , right ? professor c: and then Yeah . phd e: So grad g: Well , maybe one thing we could do is for the meetings we 've already done  , I we didn't take minutes and we don't have summaries . professor a: But actually it would be an easy thing to just go around the room and say what was the most interesting thing you learned , grad g: Mmm . postdoc h: And that I think it would pick up the micro - structure , the some some of the little things that would be hidden . professor d: Boy , I I don't know how we get at this postdoc h: That would be interesting . professor c: Yeah , but when you go around the room you might just get the effect that somebody says something grad g: Or want to get up and leave . professor c: and then you go around the room and they say \" yeah , me too , I agree . professor c: So phd e: On the other hand people might try and come up with different ones , right ? professor d: Well phd e: They might say \" oh , I was gonna say that one but now I have to think of something else \" . grad g: Well , you have the other thing , that that they know why we 're doing it . We 'll  , we 'll we 'll be telling them that the reason we 're trying to do this is is to d generate queries in the future , so try to pick things that other people didn't say .  , It seemed The kind of , interest that I had in this thing initially was , that i basically the form that you 're doing something else later , professor a:   So it 's really the imp the the list of what 's important 's in the something else professor a: Right . professor d: in fact if if it was really major , if it 's the thing that really stuck in your head , then you might not need to go back and and and check on it even . So it 's it 's that you 're trying to find You 're you 've now You weren't interested Say I I said \" well , I wasn't that much interested in dialogue , I 'm more of an acoustics person \" . professor d: But but thr three months from now if for some reason I get really interested in dialogue , and I 'm \" well what is what was that part that that that , Mari was saying ? \" grad g: Yeah , like Jim Bass says \" add a few lines on dialogue in your next perf \" professor a:  professor d: Yeah . professor d: And then I 'm trying to fi  , that 's that 's when I look in general when I look things up most , is when it 's something that didn't really stick in my head the first time around and but for some new reason I 'm I 'm I 'm interested in in in the old stuff . professor a: Well , I That 's hard to generate professor d: So , I don't I don't know . phd f: Do we professor a: and and I think that 's half of what i I would use it for . But I also a lot of times  , make you know , think to myself \" this is interesting , professor d:   professor a: So , things that I think are interesting , I would be , wanting to do a query about . And also , I like the idea of going around the room , because if somebody else thought something was interesting , I 'd kind of want to know about it and then I 'd want to follow up on it . That that might get at some of what I was I was concerned about , being interested in something later that w  , I didn't consider to be important the first time , which for me is actually the dominant thing , because if I thought it was really important it tends to stick more than if I didn't , but some new task comes along that makes me want to look up . grad g: But But what 's interesting to me may not b have been interesting to you . grad g: Yeah , I I think you can't get at all of it , professor d: Yeah . phd f: The question the question then is h h how much bias do we introduce by you know , introduce by saying , you know , this was important now and , you know , maybe tha something else is important later ? professor d:   But postdoc h: Well , and and one thing , we we 're saying \" important \" and we 're saying \" interesting \" . But I I I guess that 's the question , really , is that  , postdoc h:   professor d: W phd f: does building queries based on what 's important now introduce an irreversible bias on being able to do what Morgan wants to do later ? professor d: Well , irreversible . phd f: That 's that 's professor d: I I  , I guess what I what I I keep coming back to in my own mind is that , the soonest we can do it , we need to get up some kind of system postdoc h: Yeah . professor d: so that people who 've been involved in the meeting can go back later , even if it 's a poor system in some ways , and ,  and ask the questions that they actually want to know . If you know , if  , as soon as we can get that going at any kind of level , then I think we 'll have a much better handle on what kind of questions people want to ask than in any anything we do before that . postdoc h: I will say that that I I chose \" interesting \" because I think it includes also \" important \" in some cases . postdoc h: Well , and and also i it puts a lot of burden on the person to to evaluate . You know , I think inter \" interesting \" is is non - threatening in professor a: OK - OK . professor a: In the interest of , grad g: Importance ? postdoc h: Yeah . professor a: No , i in the interest of generating some minutes here , and also moving on to action items and other things , let me just go through the things that I wrote down as being important , that we at least decided on . CrossPads we were going to try , if Landay can get the ,  get them to to you guys , and see if they 're interesting . professor a: getting just , digital pictures a couple digital pictures of the the table and boards to set the context of the meeting .  , and then going around the room at the end to just say qu ask people to mention something interesting that they learned . So rather than say the most interesting thing , something interesting , postdoc h: k professor a: and that way you 'll get more variety . \" And then the last thing c would be for those people who are willing to stay afterwards and give an oral summary . professor a: OK ? Does that pretty much cover everything we talked about ? That well , that we want to do ? postdoc h:   grad g: Yeah , that 's like n I think that 's gonna predominantly end up being whoever takes down the equipment then . postdoc h: And and that would also be that the data would be included in the database . phd e: there is still this hope that people might actually think of real queries they really want to ask at some point . phd e: And that if if that ever should happen , then we should try and write them down . grad g: Give them a reward , a dollar a query ? phd e: Yeah , really . So professor d: Well , and again , if we can figure out a way to jimmy a a a a very rough system , say in a year , then  , so that in the second and third years we we actually have something to postdoc h: Yeah .  , the level of the query could be , you know , very low - level or very high - level . And it gets fuzzier and fuzzier as you go up , right ? grad g: Well , we 're gonna phd b: So you need to have some sort of if you start working with queries , some way of identifying what the you know , if this is something that requires a a one - word answer or it 's one place in the recording versus was there general agreement on this issue of all the people who ha phd e:  . phd b: In fact , they 're very meaningful cuz they 're very high - level . phd b: It But it may well grad g: But professor d: Because  , b because it depends on , what our goal is . grad g: Really ? professor d: If our goal is Wizard of Oz - ish , we might want to know what is it that people would really like to know about this data . professor d: And if it 's if if it 's something that we don't know how to do yet , th great , phd e: Yeah . grad g: Yeah , I was thinking about Wizard of Oz , but it requires the wizard to know all about the meetings . phd e: Well just imagine if professor d: But but just phd e: Get people to ask questions that they def the machine definitely can't answer at the moment , professor d: Yeah . w Just \" what would you like to know ? \" phd e: but grad g: Yep . postdoc h: I I was wondering if if there might be one s more source of queries which is indicator phrases like \" action item \" , professor a: OK . postdoc h: Yeah , that 's something to be determined , something to be specified , phd b: Well , probably if you have to sit there at the end of a meeting and say one thing you remember , it 's probably whatever action item was assigned to you . phd b: So , in general , that could be something you could say , right ? I 'm supposed to do this . Well , but then you could you could prompt them to say , you know , \" other than your action item \" , you know , whatever . phd e: Well postdoc h: But but the action item would be a way to get , maybe an additional query . Well , but you know , but you could get again @ @ professor a: Well , we 're piloting . professor a: or maybe we should wait until the summary of this until this meeting is transcribed and then we will hav professor d: We we had  , phd e: Yeah . professor d: somewhere up there we had milestones , but I guess Did y did you get enough milestone , from the description things ? professor a: I got Yeah . In fact , why don't you hand me those transparencies so that I remember to take them . professor d: And , you know , there 's obviously detail behind each of those , as much as is needed . What I have down for action items is we 're supposed to find out about our human subject , requirements . professor a: people are supposed to send me U R for their for web pages , to c and I 'll put together an overall cover . We professor a:  ? phd e: we need to look at our web page professor a: And and you also need to look at your web page phd e: and make one that 's that 's p professor a: and clean it up by mid - July . And so ,  professor a: How about if I just c  , Right now all I want I personally only want text data . I think the only thing Jeff would do anything with right now But I 'm just speaking fr based on a conversation with him two weeks ago I had in Turkey . professor d: Wh postdoc h: You could email to both of us , just  , if you wanted to . postdoc h: I don't think either of us would mind recei professor a: OK . postdoc h: but but in any case I 'd be happy to send you the professor a: And your email is ? professor d: i postdoc h: Edwards at ICSI . professor a: And then professor d: In in our phone call , before , we we ,  It turns out the way we 're gonna send the data is by , And ,  and then what they 're gonna do is take the CD - ROM and transfer it to analog tape and give it to a transcription service , that will grad g: Oh , is this IBM ? professor d: Yeah . postdoc h: Yeah , using foot pedals professor d: Yeah , foot foot pedals postdoc h: and professor d: and grad g: so do they How are they gonna do the multi - channel ? professor d: See , that 's a good question . professor d: probably about like you did , grad g: Mix ? professor d: and then there will be some things you know , many things that don't work out well . And that 'll go back to IBM and they 'll they 'll ,  they run their aligner on it and it kicks out things that don't work well , which you know , the overlaps will certainly be examples of that . professor d: We 'll give them all the the multi - channel stuff grad g: So we 'll give them all sixteen channels professor d: and grad g: and they 'll do whatever they want with it . phd b: But you also should probably give them the mixed You know , equal sound - level professor d: Yeah . professor d: It 's also won't be adding much to the data to give them the mixed . phd f: But w phd b: I phd f: It 's not professor a: Right . phd b: You should that may be all that they want to send off to their transcribers . Related to to the conversation with Picheny , I need to email him , my shipping address and you need to email them something which you already did . I I m emailed them the Transcriber URL , the on - line , data that Adam set up , The URL so they can click on an utterance and hear it . And I was gonna m email them the which I haven't yet , a pointer to to the web pages that we that we currently have , cuz in particular they want to see the one with the the way the recording room is set up postdoc h: Good . grad g: And then p possibly postdoc h: I C - I CC ' ed Morgan . grad g: Not an immediate action item but something we do have to worry about is data formats for for higher - level information . We were gonna grad g: Well , or d or not even higher level , different level , prosody and all that sort of stuff . professor a: That 's postdoc h: Well ,  professor a: W My my u feeling right now on format is you guys have been doing all the work phd e: Well  , yeah . So , what n important thing professor a: but Cuz I 'm not actually touching the data , postdoc h: Well , it c phd e: Right . professor d: So a key thing will be that you we tell you postdoc h: Great . phd f: and \" professor d: We also had the ,  that we were s  , that you were gonna get us the eight - hundred number professor a: Oh , yeah . professor d: and we 're all gonna we 're gonna call up your Communicator thing and and we 're gonna be good slash bad , depending on how you define it , users . professor c: Now , something that I mentioned earlier to Mari and Liz is that it 's probably important to get as many non - technical and non - speech people as possible in order to get some realistic users . Cuz we don't want people who already know how to deal with dialogue systems , professor a: Yeah . Or , like if you have a professor c: who know that you shouldn't hyper - articulate , for instance , and things like that . professor a: Or , like if you have somebody who makes your your plane reservations for you , professor c: So . e You know , it could result in some good bloopers , which is always good for presentations . professor d: My mother would have a very interesting conversation with it grad g: He would never use it . So I have the professor d: We talked about that we 're getting the recording equipment running at UW . And so it depends , w e e e they 're you know , they 're p m If that comes together within the next month , there at least will be , major communications between Dan and UW folks phd e: Yeah .  , professor a: I 'm I 'm shooting to try to get it done get it put together by the beginning of August . professor d: as to phd e: we should talk about it , but postdoc h: Mmm . professor a: So , you know , if professor d: But we have it it 's it 's pretty We don't know .  , he he s  , he said that it was sitting in some room collecting dust professor a: We don't know . professor d: and and so we don't know , professor a: i It 's probably unlikely that we 'll pull this off , professor d: i e professor a: but a at least it 's worth trying .  , and I will email these notes  , I 'm not sure what to do about action items for the data stuff , although , then somebody I guess somebody needs to tell Landay that you want the pads . professor d: and he also said something about outside there that came up about the outside text sources , that he he may have grad g:   professor a: Oh ! professor d: some text sources that are close enough to the sort of thing that we can play with them for a language model . phd e: Yeah , that was  , that was What he was saying was this he this thing that , Jason had been working on finds web pages that are thematically related to what you 're talking about . But it 's p it might be phd e: so professor a: But but that 's actually what I wanna do . grad g: Un - unfortunately Landay told me that Jason is not gonna be working on that anymore . He seemed when I asked him if he could actually supply data , he seemed a little bit more reluctant . If I don't get something grad g: Who ? Landay or Jason ? professor a: Landay . professor a: you know , otherwise , if you guys have any papers or I could I could use ,  I could use your web pages . You 've got all the web pages on the Meeting Recor professor d: Yeah , why search for them ? professor a: Yeah ! professor d: They 're we know where they are . professor d: There 's there 's some , Carnegie Mellon stuff , right ? On on meeting recording , grad g: Yep . professor a: So , there 's there 's ICSI , Xerox , professor d: and phd b: And there 's You should l look under , like , intelligent environments , professor d: And Xerox . phd b: smart rooms , grad g: the \" Georgia Tech Classroom Two Thousand \" is a good one . J There 's th That 's where I thought you would want to eventually be able to have a board or a camera , professor a:   phd b: because of all these classroom grad g: Well , Georgia Tech did a very elaborate instrumented room . I think that 's good enou that 's that 's pretty much all I can think of . postdoc h: Can I ask , one thing ? It relates to data data collection and I and I 'd and we mentioned earlier today , this question of  , so , I s I know that from with the near - field mikes some of the problems that come with overlapping speech , are lessened . But I wonder if  , is that sufficient or should we consider maybe getting some data gathered in such a way that , u w we would c  , p have a meeting with less overlap than would otherwise be the case ? So either by rules of participation , or whatever . postdoc h: Now , you know , it 's true , we were discussing this earlier , that depending on the task so if you 've got someone giving a report you 're not gonna have as much overlap . phd f: Adam ! postdoc h: But , i i  , so we 're gonna have s you know , non - overlapping samples anyway . But , in a meeting which would otherwise be highly overlapping , is the near - field mike enough or should we have some rules of participation for some of our samples to lessen the overlap ? professor d:  . phd e: turn off professor a: I don't think we should have rules of participation , but I think we should try to get a variety of meetings . That 's something that if we get the the meeting stuff going at UW , that I probably can do more than you guys , postdoc h: OK . Just want to be sure there 's enough data to professor a: phd b: They 're still gonna overlap , postdoc h: OK , good . phd b: but Mark and others have said that there 's quite a lot of found data from the discourse community that has this characteristic and also the political Y you know , anything that was televised for a third party has the characteristic of not very much overlap . professor d: Wasn - but w I think we were saying before also that the natural language group here had less overlap . postdoc h: because you know , it is true people can modify the amount of overlap that they do if if they 're asked to . postdoc h: Not not entirely modify it , but lessen it if if it 's desired . But if if that 's sufficient data I just wanted to be sure that we will not be having a lot of data which can't be processed . So I 'm just writing here , we 're not gonna try to specify rules of interaction but we 're gonna try to get more variety by i using different groups of people postdoc h: Time . And I you know , I I know that the near f near - field mikes will take care of also the problems to s to a certain degree . professor a: Cuz if I recorded some administrative meetings then that may have less overlap , because you might have more overlap when you 're doing something technical and disagreeing or whatever . Well , I just as as as a contributary eh , so I I know that in l in legal depositions people are pr are prevented from overlapping . They 'll just say , you know you know , \" wait till each person is finished before you say something \" . professor a: Well , the reason why I didn't want to is be why I personally didn't want to is because I wanted it to be as , unintrusive as possi postdoc h:   I just want to be sure we don't that we 're able to process , i u  , you know , as much data as we can . Did they discuss any of that in the the meeting they had with L Liberman ? phd b:   professor d: What phd b: And there was a big division , professor d: What what do they phd b: so Liberman and others were interested in a lot of found data . phd b: So there 's lots of recordings that They 're not close - talk mike , professor d: Yeah . phd b: but And and there 's lots of television , you know , stuff on , political debates and things like that , congre congressional hearings .  , and then the CMU folks and I were sort of on the other side in cuz they had collected a lot of meetings that were sort of like this and said that those are nothing like these meetings . And , I guess we just left it as @ @ that if there 's found data that can be transformed for use in speech recognition easily , then of course we would do it , professor d:   Is that is that going to be publicly available , phd b: As far as I know , they h have not . grad g: It 's also it 's not it 's not near - far , right ? phd b: I 'm not sure .  , if people were interested they could talk to them , but I I got the feeling there was some politics involved . grad g: Cuz I had thought they 'd only done far - field , phd b: I think you need to talk to Waibel and grad g: intelligent - room sorts of things . phd b: But they had multiple mikes and they did do recognition , and they did do real conversations . Well , once we send out postdoc h: Yeah , I think professor d: we still haven't sent out the first note saying \" hey , this list exists \" . But but , once we do that professor a: Is that an action item ? professor d: Yeah . We should at least check that everybody here ? grad g: I think everyone here is on the list . grad g: I I added a few people who didn't who I knew had to be on it even though they didn't tell me . grad g: You are on it , aren't you ? postdoc h: Yeah , I am . So \" found data \" , they mean like established corpora of linguistics and and other fields , right ? phd b: What they mean is stuff they don't have to fund to collect , postdoc h: It sounds like such a t phd b: and especially good postdoc h: Yeah , OK . It 's things occur without any You know , the pe these people weren't wearing close - talking mikes , but they were recorded anyway , like the congressional hearings and , you know , for legal purposes or whatever . Of course it 's not \" found \" in the sense that at the time it was collected for the purpose . phd b: But what he means is that You know , Mark was really a fan of getting as much data as possible from you know , reams and reams of stuff , of broadcast stuff , postdoc h: That 's interesting . phd e: We should go around and say something interesting that happened at the meeting ? professor a: Oh . phd b: Rrrh ! grad g: Now , I was already thinking about it , so professor d: Oh ! Good man . phd b: I grad g: So , I really liked the idea of what I thought was interesting was the combination of the CrossPad and the speech . So , can you determine the interesting points by who 's writing ? Can you do special gestures and so on that that have , special meaning to the corpora ? I really liked that . postdoc h: Well , I I just realized there 's another category of interesting things which is that , I I found this discussion very , i this this question of how you get at queries really interesting . And and the and I and the fact that it 's sort of , nebulous , what what that what kind of query it would be because it depends on what your purpose is . So I actually found that whole process of of trying to think of what that would involve to be interesting . I just sort of thought we we went around a nice discussion of the factors involved there , which I thought was worthwhile . grad g: Did you take pictures of the boards ? phd e: Not that I postdoc h: Yeah .  , I will take pictures of them , but postdoc h: That 's a good point . phd f: I 'm gonna pass because I can't  , of the Jane took my answer . But I will say  , I will actually  , a spin on different slightly different spin on what you said , this issue of , realizing that we could take minutes , and that actually may be a goal . So that that may be kind of the test in a sense , test data , the the template of what we want to test against , generating a summary . I think the question of how to generate queries automatically was the most interesting question that came up , and it 's something that , as you said , is a whole research topic in itself , so I don't think we 'll be able to do anything on it because we don't have funding on it , in this project . professor d: Well , being more management lately than than research , I think the thing that impressed me most was the people dynamics and not any of the facts . phd e: How are we gonna find that in the data ? grad g: Well , if we had people wearing the wireless mikes all the time phd e: Oh , yeah . grad g: Yeah , I think phd f: Well , one thing you could search for is were people laughing a lot . phd e: How happy were they ? professor d: I 'd probably search for something like that . postdoc h:  h Do we need do I need to turn something off here , or I do unplug this , or ? professor d: Now these we turn off "

        "Query": "Why did User Interface propose using more buttons in the technical function design and what were the advantages of big thick keys? Additionally, what did the User Interface discuss about the shape of the button and what recommendations did the user interface designer make regarding the problem of having fewer buttons?",
        "Summary": "The User Interface team suggested reducing the number of buttons for DVD control compared to the current design, aiming to keep the maximum number of buttons within ten. Taking inspiration from mobile phones, they proposed using big thick keys for the remote control, which are popular among younger generations and create a less cluttered and more spacious look. The team agreed on a round shape for most buttons arranged in a triangle, with a square button in the middle and four buttons for channel and volume control. The industrial designer recommended incorporating multiple functions into one button using a switch menu, categorizing functions and linking them to specific menu categories.",
        "Article": "project manager:  after the opening we're going to have a prototype presentation , then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote . Then we're going to evaluate the product and I think the whole production process , and then we're gonna close it up , and we have forty minutes , so let's get started . Well , since our materials aren't exactly what we were going for , I'm just gonna translate what this all means for you . user interface: The base is gonna be gunmetal gray , which is what we had decided , and it's gonna be plastic . user interface: The whole thing lights up if you press any button , rather than it just that one button will light up . industrial designer: On off switch will be here and as you've noticed on our prototype  they've ended up with a curvature kind of , by concave sort of thing , except for , you know , can't see underneath . industrial designer: So I'm hoping that when we get to production we can actually make them like that , because they're very nice to stock you know , stick your finger in .  the two squared buttons are are two probably least used , menu , mute , user interface: Thumb-shaped . industrial designer: and then these are the numbers , so our channel and our volume will be on either side . And then the last thing is just that it'll be black labelling on top , just which we didn't do . And did you determine  the curvature of the bottom part of it for the hand , is it gonna be a single or a double ? user interface: industrial designer: I'd say a single . marketing: Yeah , I think it's a beautiful project manager: It is beautiful , and it's everything that we discussed . project manager: Alright industrial designer: project manager: what's next in our agenda ?  we're gonna discuss the evaluation criteria , and that's with Courtney .  so these are the criteria we're gonna ask , is it easy to use , is it fashionable  yeah , I guess we should write these down so we can reference them . user interface: Feel good meaning what ? marketing: Like does it feel good , like user interface: Physically , project manager: Right . industrial designer: Yeah , it was a little difficult to incorporate the cover with the cherry fruit on it . Okay so , we're using the criteria  for a seven point scale , and so we need to discuss how we feel . It falls within this range , so for easy to use , do we feel it's very easy to use ? project manager: Are we going to indi user interface: True or false , easy to use . project manager: I say we individually rate what do you say ? marketing: You guys project manager: Just orally . user interface: industrial designer: I'll give it a two , because at the moment it's not looking that way . project manager: Oh , and ma it's a prototype , marketing: Well , that's that's just like that's a clay , it's a prototype . user interface: But then I'm not fashionable , so marketing: Yeah , it's a two . marketing:  user interface: marketing: does it feel good ? project manager: Imagine , since we obviously don't have that . user interface: Does it feel good ? marketing: I feel like industrial designer:  the shape of it actually does  . industrial designer: marketing:  yeah ,  and it does it have voice  the phrase recognition on it ? project manager: Yes . It wasn't we have no reflection of it on the prototype , marketing: And there's no way you can represent it on here . marketing: Then yes , then I would well it isn't what else would it need for it to be technologically innovative ? industrial designer: It project manager: Well we don' have the you know , we can't say channel , and it changes the channel , channel eight . marketing: And it doesn't cover anything other then T_V_ , project manager: Right . I'd go for a three or four on that one , so user interface: Yeah I go four . project manager: Alright , and the last criteria is it is it  user interface: Squishy and fruity . project manager: Well , we've covered that with the user interface: It's just trendy , basically . marketing: So  our re model slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie appears to be a winner , project manager: industrial designer: marketing: and  hopefully we'll sell millions . industrial designer: How did you get that in there ? user interface: marketing: What ? industrial designer: The slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie . I'm gonna show you an Excel spreadsheet and we're going to fill it in together based on what components we're including in our remote and see if it's under twelve fifty Euro . If so , we can proceed , if not , we need to go back to the drawing board a little bit .  it's not hand dynamo , it's powered by battery , so we give it a industrial designer: Yep . project manager: But if it's a do you wanna go for this is where we need to make a final call on if it's a lithium or do we wanna go triple A_s , 'cause triple A_s we're gonna have t do more than one battery . What do you say ? industrial designer: Yeah , user interface: marketing: Yeah , let's let's do a lithium . project manager: I think  I think the people who purchase this are gonna be technologically industrial designer: it's . marketing: We're gon that's gon Nologically advanced , project manager: right . We're gonna need this kind , correct , if we do the voice sensor , industrial designer: Yep . marketing: But it's Yeah , project manager: This ? marketing: but i so i industrial designer: Integrated scroll-wheel or push-button . marketing: But will we w actually we'll need two , won't we ? One for the top and then one for the s one e for each side . user interface: Oh like the twenty nine means like you have both scrolls and industrial designer: Push-button . project manager: Right I think she's industrial designer: But we just have push user interface: push-buttons . project manager: I think what Courtney's talking about is do we need to put two here ? marketing: Like because there's like one interface right here and then because it's not gonna be on the same plane when you press the button . marketing: So is that gonna be an extra one on each side ? project manager: I don't know , they might put us well , let's just . user interface: Two interfaces , is that what w should we s say ? project manager: Two or would it be three ? industrial designer: Let's call it th marketing: Or three , because of one on each side and one on top . project manager: and we're gonna user interface: project manager: button supplements the buttons are no  okay . Now we're gonna talk about the project process  and whether or not we're satisfied with the whole process and the result .  did we have a lot of room for creativity ? Did we have a lot of room for individual leadership ,  teamwork , and the means , meaning the technology that we used to produce our little guy there , and if we found any new ideas . Who want who would like to go first ? industrial designer: We think we got stifled for cri creativity by the company itself , in restricting us only to using a T_V_ remote , initially . project manager: And how did you feel about the whole the whole process though ? marketing: Oh , overall  I thought we did a good job like user interface: marketing: We got to choose basically we had control over minus it being just merely a T_V_ remote we got to choose what we wanted to do with it . project manager: Right , and we got say over what how technologically advanced it should be and also how fashionable , which I kind of like marketing: And we're a fashion forward technology company . project manager:  what about  the teamwork aspect ? How did you guys enjoy making the model , the prototype ? marketing: industrial designer: Yeah .  minus you guys being wha what is it , the survey , annoying or what is it ? project manager: Irritating . marketing: And the digital the digital pens user interface: Like it's information project manager: Yeah , digital pens . marketing: Yeah they were fun , even though I'm not really sure what I could do with them , but they are awesome . project manager: Right , laptops are extremely handy , industrial designer: It was wireless too , so . And that we have a shared network where we can put all of the marketing: And these things whoa . industrial designer: project manager: 'Kay , have we found any new ideas through this process ? marketing:  we are really gonna sell this . project manager: For something that looks cool and also has what I want it to b do technologically . project manager: And that's your right brain taking over , w wanting the artistic , the fashionable , the hip , you know . project manager: If we all just went out and bought useful things , I don't think  that's not what technology . user interface: Well , that's why I don't like  Macs or Apples , just 'cause I look at it , and I know it's probably a very good computer , but I look at it , and I'm taken back to elementary school , 'cause they look the same . user interface: Exactly , so I associate them with like really low-tech , really cheap , bad project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , no , iPods They want all those words for presentation , even the plugs .  how many people went out and bough a Nokia phone , back when we were like in high school , just so they could get the changeable face plates . user interface: But the my but my one issue is just like the whole it's for T_V_ only . user interface: I was like who's gonna buy a remote just for the T_V_ unless they've lost theirs . marketing: We could have like an Adam and Eve type commercial , and that's the fig-leaf .  the costs are within the budget , we evaluated the project , user interface: project manager: and now we're gonna complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary , and then we're going to have a big giant party , apparently , according to this , so <doc-sep>And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly . industrial designer: project manager: user interface: industrial designer: Well , I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and  user interface:  . B did you send us an email about this ? project manager: not yet , user interface: industrial designer: project manager: but if you want user interface: Yeah , we we received an email about this  d designs . project manager: Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ? industrial designer: user interface: Ah it's Okay . marketing: I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . user interface: 'Kay , we can project manager: So there are so we have three user interface: So there are three kinds of designs , that's all . project manager: So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? Any any volunteer ? industrial designer: I think our  responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager . user interface: Are you using the you are doing the in industrial designer: Yeah I I'm I'm Well , maybe we have okay so I industrial design . It was a little confusion about my  project manager: user interface: Ah industrial designer: but it's alright . industrial designer: Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done project manager: industrial designer: and what are your ideas about the project manager: About the design or Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ? industrial designer: Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess . industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno I project manager: And of course it should not be very costly . industrial designer: Well I I think that Norman and I would think about  the technical points and  we should discuss it in the next meeting , or user interface: Need to collect information .  , what is most important in a in a remote control ? What is the most important function aspect ?  . project manager: You won't user interface: Or or you can say for example ,  I want  to list all the programme tonight . Y you know , instead of  remote control it's doing the some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . project manager: I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . user interface: No , because no , project manager: S user interface: it's not very a lot . industrial designer: I I think if you want t to choose  from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use  w  I dunno marketing: I'm a okay . marketing:  the main  function of remote control is to have something in the hand project manager: In the hand . marketing: If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog user interface: Yeah . marketing: if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . industrial designer: marketing:  we have some or something , different technology but project manager: This is it's user interface: Yeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that  there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea project manager: industrial designer: but I I think that technically it would be  a little bit   more tricky to to achieve this than just to user interface: No . They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . user interface: And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons . industrial designer: Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to  navigate  through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so project manager: This is good idea . Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? industrial designer: Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen user interface: Good idea . industrial designer: and just  with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f user interface: I think I think that will be revol revolutionary . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: Because all the T_V_  the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . So I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff user interface: Okay . project manager: So we have five minutes to user interface: Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . project manager: Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we industrial designer: user interface: Five minutes . marketing: And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of user interface: Okay . marketing: So , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark  some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . industrial designer: Oh right so user interface: Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: Be before before writing you can  sit and that says what we what we said user interface:  . So so the most functional des  the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . The user can choose w which one they want , right ? industrial designer: Yeah , by content or by channel , user interface: By content or by channel . user interface: Okay , so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content . industrial designer: I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so user interface: Okay . And  industrial designer: I think that's the the things to do user interface: The main thing . user interface: So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get  the funct this is the functional designer ? That's the first aspect . project manager: So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ? And we'll discuss the other other aspects <doc-sep>industrial designer: project manager:  so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design . industrial designer: Okay so I think I will do my presentation on the components concept so can you please  open  I'm participant two . project manager: industrial designer: Okay so  the first thing  I have done is to to made a review together with the  manufactural  department and have which components was  available to build a remote control . So for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy , hand dynamo and  kinetic  well  kinetic  technique to to store the energy . user interface: marketing: industrial designer: We also  we also can put a regular battery in the in the remote control . But if we use battery industrial designer: Yeah b  f well  I meant  by by battery I meant  I will not have a  a wire between the remote control and the energy source but  I didn't fou we didn't decide yet which kind of battery we will put inside the the remote . But  well it's not a a re  well a real issue for the from the technical  point of view . Concerning the interface  we can we can put  just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons  much more complicated , but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated so . So what I have f found is that I think basic battery or kinetic  energy  collection is the is the better way to provide energy because I think solar energy wi won't work in a cluttered   environment . For the case  well  I think that  titanium is  is a good choice because it's trendy and it's  it's  well it's modern and  user are are are  will be  very happy to have a a a nice remote . For the interface  I think that we can ach achieve  all the desired functionalities by s just  using  rubber buttons , simple buttons and th thus this allow to use a regular chip that are  well cheaper . user interface: What is this single curved what does it mean ? industrial designer: Well   i i it's  it's the the shape of the  of the remote . user interface: So it's it's not industrial designer: You you will have the well  the the curve will fit into your hand when you grab the user interface: Yo l yeah . And the battery , is it kind of a rechargeable or it doesn't matter ? industrial designer: Yeah the  that's the point . The kinetic one is  y you can recharge  by the  user interface: That that's what it means by kinetic . industrial designer: Yeah and by well by just by moving the ar  your arm the  well the remote will  accumulate energy . industrial designer: But I d I don't know it's if it is feasible because I don't know if yet if if the user will move enough to provide the remote  all the necessary energy . We we might check with our R_ and D_ department to see if they have this product ready for market . Wha industrial designer: So  you're right we can  see in our  R_ and D_  if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy . industrial designer: Oh yeah user interface: industrial designer: I take care , it's all right . user interface: So the titanium case is the normal case that I'll show you some pictures that I have and you tell me whether they are titanium case or not . There's another point I want to make , is that the  well you've seen them I le na my presentation that  I point out some why buttons are not the  not the only ways you can use Yeah . So the user interface is  i it uses the aspect  of a computer system , a programme which can be seen or heard or otherwise perceived by the human user project manager: user interface: and the commands and mechanism the user uses to control its operation and input data . So you s this gives you the ways to input data and we have  we are more we emphasise more on the graphical user interface here . The idea is to represent buttons as figures , diagrams , symbols and on so you you can easily when you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing . user interface: So some people are propose voice recognition and so ah by the way I receive an email from the from one our departments saying that the voice recognition has been used in the coffee machine for this by a company industrial designer: user interface: when you tell the you say good morning coffee machine and the machine are reply to you . user interface: And it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used so we might consider that , supposedly .  so somebody some people use  some people use a spinning wheel th with the L_C_ display so instead of using the  buttons you have a L_C_D_ screen and then there you can u you can use that as buttons , you can use that as real so so that could be an option as well . So s basically this deals with special users , children , handicapped people , old people , and   and prog basically they are programmable , specially for children . And then they also secure  covers , to protect  secure and hidden programming and battery covers that will protect your settings . I'm just saying that the currently in the market there are there are control there are remote controllers f customisable for different people . So the adults might wanna have a key to lock that to pr so children will not touch the button inside . But for our product we don't need a big one because you have voice recognition e eventually with use . industrial designer: user interface: T_V_ remote controller where are you ? project manager: user interface: And then , he will beeps and to say that I am here , for example . industrial designer: project manager: We should include speech synthesis in this case , no ? user interface: Is it possible ? industrial designer: Yeah . user interface:  ? industrial designer: Yeah but  as Norman say if  there is  already a commercial product available who t who do this we we can check  to integrate it i into our  new remote control . And  , this is another one where you can  the the the part that's a V_ standing for the volume . But you the see that in the V_ , the V_ appears to be the down arrow on the top on the top up arrow if you project manager: user interface: up arrow there's a V_ like as as if it's turning down so it's confusing interface , so I wanna avoid this kind of thing in the design . user interface: And here are is  here is a s short summary that I summary that I compiled after the findings I found . Big buttons are convenient , voice recognition helps , push buttons , scroll buttons , spinning wheels can be used as navigation tools . user interface: And basically  industrial designer: Well I I think you it's it's it's fine you have  reviewed all all the possibilities user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: but   well  i if we consider that  the user interface is displayed on the T_V_ screen I don't think we nee  we need much buttons in the remote project manager: user interface: industrial designer: since we we just have to navigate and to have a okay or enter key or things like that , user interface: Yeah . project manager: Or maybe we can include the user manual in the in the remote control and we should have just a button like help and you say  and you ik you press the button help and maybe you see the the user m might in the in the T_V_ . So wi marketing: But people are often enough looking at the help , project manager: If the if marketing: once they see the help button they say oh this is a complicated stuff . industrial designer: But  wel well I think project manager: It's just for user customizable , for kids or old people . project manager: So marketing:  it just showed us the remote with an cap which could be used for kids and if you remove the project manager: So it's the same marketing: Same remote with some project manager: Can be used by both kids and old people . Well  what I s propose is that  you know a remote controller , i it could be a cube , industrial designer: user interface: is  a small device that  looks like a cube and maybe you can just change the  the buttons , if you ch turn one side you get one one buttons , you turn the other side you get the other buttons , so for maybe new generation people who get used to the computer they want lots of controls . project manager: Maybe for kids , kids they like  t no l they like to user interface: Small industrial designer:  well . project manager: marketing: So we just made an marketing survey of what people need from our remotes and how it could be special from the other remotes . So seventy percent of the users , they find their remote controls very ugly , they don't find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything . And eighty percent of the people they are always l  they are willing to spend more money if the remote control would look fancy . marketing: so the rest of the ninety percent of the buttons they're not used most of the times . Most of fifty percent of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room and people are always searching for them rather than watching the T_V_ . marketing: So they're frustrated a lot user interface: marketing: And  if the remote control is too complicated it takes much time to learn the functionality of it . marketing: So you can just see the percentage , fifty percent people they responded that they always lose their remotes and thirty four percent they say that it's quite difficult to learn if it's too complex . marketing: So keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations I think this should be the solution for them . industrial designer: Well  w well I I I don't really see the advantage of having  L_C_D_ on the on the remote control if we have a a a big screen and  display on the screen . industrial designer: It's marketing: - ? industrial designer: yeah of course it's fancy trendy and so on but it's it's expensive to produce and it's not really marketing:  as our survey says that people are willing to pay more if their remotes are fancy . marketing: So if we have a L_C_D_ on the remote , rather than looking onto the T_V_ you just look into a remote and navigate it . The thing marketing: We just play around industrial designer: Yeah but when you play with the iPod you don't have a big screen in front of you , s project manager: You can use this screen instead of the big se screen , user interface: Yeah . user interface: If you re-use the existing screen , we element eliminate the L_C_D_ , after all the L_C_D_ just to display project manager:  . user interface: and if you have the colourful screen you can make the display colourful , fancy , as fancy as the one on the L_C_D_ , marketing: Yeah . marketing: So industrial designer: So I th I I well I think we we can focus on the  on the fancy look on the  user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: but well I think L_C_D_ will  will  make us spend a lot of money for not so big results . So i is marketing:  yeah we have  project manager: user interface: so the thing is you can find out how much an L_C_D_ will cost and then we'll decide again . project manager: industrial designer: user interface:  maybe you can find out the price and tell us next time . industrial designer: And marketing: And it's always good to have an voice recognition for the remote controls . marketing: the scroll button , from the survey we never see that people would like to have some scrolling button . Yeah I think that marketing: Because they they just they're just frightened to use the scrollings or help button . industrial designer: Yeah I I I think that  well  as we have seen in the in the presentation  well  about   fifty percent of the of the percent n choose the button user interface: Don't use the buttons . But project manager: But they are just less used compar marketing: They're not used much . industrial designer: But the  the thing is is i is that we can add a functionality on the on the T_V_ screen user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and then you choose with the with the button to well you navigate user interface: Yeah , yeah . industrial designer: and you project manager: Or maybe we can u  or maybe we can  make this the ten percent of button more bigger than the others . marketing: industrial designer: But if i i if we if we could have a a a display  g a user interface that is very complete on the T_V_ screen I think that just five buttons are sufficient , user interface: Yep . marketing: Or it could be like this , as the people say , if they have a L_C_D_ on the remote not on the television . Because when you have the L_C_D_ onto the television screen you miss the picture in the background , we are most focused on the commands . industrial designer: Yeah but marketing: So if you have then L_C_D_ in the remote , you just have a menu , and increasing and lower these signs here to change the programs and this menu when you press the menu , in the L_C_D_ displays as you go on pressing the menu it faster displays volume , then the program , then the brightness , contrast and all the stuff . industrial designer: Yeah but if you look at the L_C_D_ you you don't look at the T_V_ screen marketing: And accordingly you can just increase or decrease . industrial designer: so i i it's not really worth to get to have the image if you don't look at , so . project manager: And I think it's increases the cost of the the remote control if you use L_C_D_ . user interface: I think that there's no contradiction here , because if there are few buttons , you don't have to look at your your controller any more because you know where the buttons are , so if you wanna control the screen d sh sharpness you just say sharpness industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: and then you t turn you just press lef increase or decrease button industrial designer: user interface: and the same for the volume and the channel , marketing: Yeah . user interface: if you had the speech recognition there you just shout your channel , just tell your channel and then you don't even have to look at the butto at the controller so finally that wil eliminates the the need for L_C_D_ , marketing: Okay . user interface: with the help of speech recogniser you can marketing: better if we could just check all the cost with L_C_D_ user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Well so we we can think about a well a a vocal command like  find user interface:  . industrial designer: and when the remote control  hears fine well yeah just  to make him beep or t project manager: You will listen to a peep , special peep . marketing:  it's always boring to change the batteries of the remotes control , user interface:  . marketing: so we have some one charger there and whenever we don't use the remote control we put it in the charger . marketing: And when we're using that t remote and if we misplace somewhere , in the charger we have a small button , and just by pressing the button in the charger the  remote control beeps , wherever it is . marketing:  it doe it also doesn't require a voice command , project manager: But you don't you don't have to move the the charger . user interface: That we can what we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off T_V_ button , the off button , the remote there be s  instruction on the screen , please charge charge me . user interface: because  every time you're off the computer the T_V_ you are asked the the command the T_V_ com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where to the charger . user interface: So it's it's  it's all about strategy , y marketing: And of course the final point is a fancy look . marketing: As we have seen earlier the remotes which were displayed by Norman they weren't fancy , user interface:  . marketing: I think we should have something it industrial designer: Well the last one with the  yeah with the two parts was  original , so user interface: With  two two two parts controller . marketing:       you see if it's like that even a kid who wants to have a control he could just plug it and use it , you can't avoid him . marketing: So just by pressing the button with some code , you t you put a lock onto the remote , so that he can't use even user interface:  . industrial designer: Well we can think about  having  on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the T_V_ you can  well write a code or choose a category , if it is kids ,  things like that . project manager: Or maybe you have to to show some specific programmes for kids and then just just yeah just push  kids button so it's automatically user interface:  . marketing: I think these other four points they're the market demands and so it's for the user interface design and industrial design to just think industrial designer: So for  project manager: Yeah . So for my part I will check the prices the  the prices difference  of what to use , where to use , and s  and so on . marketing: Yeah I think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th  these could be included . I think we need to define also a s the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: because  if you want  say we can sort by channels or sort by T_V_ programs , you have to decide a category of vocabularies for them . user interface: but if name the channel by by name industrial designer: Well I think we can we can have just numbers for channels and you can say to your remote control like  sports and then on the T_V_ you have a list with with   well with sports program playing now user interface:  . You see  if you have a voice commands and you are s you are watching a score on  basketball score or something , and if the score comes twenty four thirty five , you've just say twenty five project manager: Yeah it's yeah . marketing: So I think there should be a prefix to some numbers industrial designer: Well but well e every possible word  has a probability to come about of the T_V_ so . marketing:  the the you just check all the probability that saying T_V_ twenty five and just ordinary twenty five . marketing: Ordinary twenty five you almost there's a probability of being said around sixty seventy percent user interface:  . marketing: and T_V_ twenty five I dunno it will be round about one or two percent . user interface: But I I I think that the user would like wou would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than than the numbers . user interface: You say numbe channel number five of the T_V_ correspond to something else in the channel . user interface:  ? project manager: Because you have to s t  a ch user interface: Well , it's convenient for the user . marketing: Then project manager: Or maybe the user can create his own vocabulary , user interface: The    . user interface: I I think that I have   I think there's another way you can do is that  you can  if when the user ch press a button to choose the channel for example , then what you can do is that the you can make the T_V_ screen to split them into small little little squares of images where you you you have a snapshot of every channel , so let's say it's a four by four matrix of the images , so now what you do is f looking at the all the sixteen channels available at one time , you just use the control button  , you just you you just choose the the option you want marketing: Yeah , the . Just you have  in the beginning you have  t you have to train you have to create the vocabulary by yourself . industrial designer: Well I  I also project manager: By associating each channel with the name or industrial designer: I I also think about  another problem , if if there is  more than one person who is watching T_V_ project manager: And for each one has his own . user interface: industrial designer: the s well the the speech  r recogniser should be able to distinguish between the two . industrial designer: Because  I remember when I was a young child with my sister we yeah we always want to w to watch different emission at the at the same time user interface:  . project manager: Or you have to s user interface: Yeah , I wanna watch this , I wanna watch that . industrial designer: so it's a pr it could be a problem if  if well if someone passes by when you are watching T_V_ and say oh T_V_ thirty and just run , s user interface:  . If we are using the television in the different environments , say in the factories or in the shops where there is a lot of noise and this voice commands if they fail to work , that would bring a bad name bad  reputation for our company . marketing: So I think we should specify some pre-requirements if we want to use a voice commands , say that it should be used in an silent homely environment or s something . industrial designer: Yeah that's well I think that's a good  a good option because it's simple and  simple to implement also , so . industrial designer: marketing: Oh it came there on three minutes back so we are I think we can just press the okay "

        "Query": "Why did the Industrial Designer disagree with Marketing and User Interface on various design aspects of the product?",
        "Summary": "The marketing team suggested that the remote control should have only one button and be compatible with Windows media center, allowing it to operate multiple devices simultaneously. However, the industrial designer disagreed, stating that additional buttons, such as play, fast forward, and stop, would be necessary for a video player. The industrial designer also proposed using titanium for a tough and stylish cover, appealing to older customers. They emphasized the importance of using real titanium instead of titanium-like plastic or compromising the LCD screen. The industrial designer also raised questions about the remote control's universality and programmability, suggesting the need for different modes to send out signals. They also considered the size of the remote, given the complexity of integrating various technical parts. Ultimately, the industrial designer proposed an integrated material approach to reduce costs.",
        "Article": "And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly . industrial designer: project manager: user interface: industrial designer: Well , I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and  user interface:  . B did you send us an email about this ? project manager: not yet , user interface: industrial designer: project manager: but if you want user interface: Yeah , we we received an email about this  d designs . project manager: Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ? industrial designer: user interface: Ah it's Okay . marketing: I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . user interface: 'Kay , we can project manager: So there are so we have three user interface: So there are three kinds of designs , that's all . project manager: So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? Any any volunteer ? industrial designer: I think our  responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager . user interface: Are you using the you are doing the in industrial designer: Yeah I I'm I'm Well , maybe we have okay so I industrial design . It was a little confusion about my  project manager: user interface: Ah industrial designer: but it's alright . industrial designer: Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done project manager: industrial designer: and what are your ideas about the project manager: About the design or Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ? industrial designer: Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess . industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno I project manager: And of course it should not be very costly . industrial designer: Well I I think that Norman and I would think about  the technical points and  we should discuss it in the next meeting , or user interface: Need to collect information .  , what is most important in a in a remote control ? What is the most important function aspect ?  . project manager: You won't user interface: Or or you can say for example ,  I want  to list all the programme tonight . Y you know , instead of  remote control it's doing the some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . project manager: I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . user interface: No , because no , project manager: S user interface: it's not very a lot . industrial designer: I I think if you want t to choose  from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use  w  I dunno marketing: I'm a okay . marketing:  the main  function of remote control is to have something in the hand project manager: In the hand . marketing: If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog user interface: Yeah . marketing: if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . industrial designer: marketing:  we have some or something , different technology but project manager: This is it's user interface: Yeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that  there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea project manager: industrial designer: but I I think that technically it would be  a little bit   more tricky to to achieve this than just to user interface: No . They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . user interface: And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons . industrial designer: Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to  navigate  through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so project manager: This is good idea . Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? industrial designer: Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen user interface: Good idea . industrial designer: and just  with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f user interface: I think I think that will be revol revolutionary . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: Because all the T_V_  the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . So I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff user interface: Okay . project manager: So we have five minutes to user interface: Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . project manager: Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we industrial designer: user interface: Five minutes . marketing: And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of user interface: Okay . marketing: So , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark  some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . industrial designer: Oh right so user interface: Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: Be before before writing you can  sit and that says what we what we said user interface:  . So so the most functional des  the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . The user can choose w which one they want , right ? industrial designer: Yeah , by content or by channel , user interface: By content or by channel . user interface: Okay , so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content . industrial designer: I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so user interface: Okay . And  industrial designer: I think that's the the things to do user interface: The main thing . user interface: So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get  the funct this is the functional designer ? That's the first aspect . project manager: So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ? And we'll discuss the other other aspects <doc-sep>user interface:  ? marketing: industrial designer: I'm afraid I'm a bit too slow . project manager:  we're supposed to develop a new remote control , that's both original , trendy and user-friendly . project manager: then we do some in individual work , then we have a meeting to discuss the results , etcetera etcetera . project manager: Okay and in the format menu you can select colour and line width , etcetera etcetera . industrial designer: Different pen widths , how do you do that ? user interface: project manager:  with the format menu . project manager: And what's that supposed to be ? industrial designer: Are you serious ? marketing: Should it be one project manager: Oh yeah . marketing: so y you must save it at the end project manager: Yeah marketing: and then project manager: you can press the next button , which is  yeah . user interface: industrial designer: How much time do we have to draw anyway ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: What is it ? industrial designer: marketing: user interface: It's a it's a giraffe . Yeah I see a long neck user interface: Yeah , that's a project manager: but marketing: It's more like a dinosaur . user interface: industrial designer: Is this part of our a acquai or introduction to each other ? project manager: Yeah sorry , introduction and get acquainted marketing:  project manager: and industrial designer: Alright . user interface: project manager: Yeah it's a bit slow , marketing: It's not that fast . user interface: 'Cause it's so project manager: You were slow too user interface: 'cause it's green . marketing: So  some other line  width  industrial designer: Do you have a turtle pet ? project manager: user interface: marketing: No . marketing: Yeah ? project manager: Yeah not exactly legs but More like fins marketing: industrial designer: Stumpy stuff . user interface: marketing: or project manager: There's a a gum , marketing: Yeah ? Alright . industrial designer: And why did you choose this animal ? marketing: So project manager: He said it was slow . marketing: A cat who had an accident or project manager: Why a cat ? industrial designer:  yeah I dunno . Yeah I'm not so good at drawing with this kind of project manager: The pen , industrial designer: st Oh shit . It's my favourite  pet animal , 'cause they're cute , they're independent and cuddly , I dunno . industrial designer: Or do I need to use more colours and project manager: I think it's okay . Okay industrial designer: So we have to s project manager: now it's time for some discussion . project manager:  did any of you already do some work on this part or industrial designer: Well I started making an overview for myself ,  what I had to do , 'cause we have three design steps and in every step I have a s specific task to perform or whatever . industrial designer: So I had to  , I dunno , make an overview for myself about what I have to do , project manager: industrial designer: and kind of let it work in to get ideas about well how I have to fill it . And do you have any ideas about the product  so far ? industrial designer: Well I started I started with the first phase , I think was the functional . industrial designer: And  let's see I had to focus on the working design , which you said . industrial designer: and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the T_V_ . Yeah I kept it global 'cause that it activates or deactivates specific functions , user interface: Okay , yeah . project manager:  and what did the Marketing Expert do ? marketing:  well from a marketing  perspective ,  well the function des design phase  consists out of the user requirements . marketing:  what needs and desires are to be fulfilled ? So there are a few means to reach that  by by doing research  to see what existing products are there out in the market . marketing:  especially what are their shortcomings ? Are there any new functions  which can be added to our product ? project manager: For example for  well what kind of applications do current remote controls support , and what are f featur features of  current and future televisions ? project manager: Yep . What w what would they like to see  on a new remote control ?  especially for future users , project manager: Okay . marketing:  I'm thinking of early adopters , because they they use new technology first , project manager: marketing: and they play with a lot of tools and stuff so maybe they have some good ideas to  to add . project manager:  but have you any idea so far as what  the user requirements are ? marketing: No n not specifically . user interface: I got some  requirements marketing: and project manager: Yeah ? user interface: it has  it has to be user-friendly . user interface:  really easy to use buttons , not not  very small buttons , but not the the also the big big buttons , but just normal buttons . project manager:  what do you mean by that ? user interface:  the distance  from your television to your  remote control has to be ,  yeah  yeah , quite a big distance . project manager:  user interface: Are you going to put the the notes on the project manager: Yeah , in the project folder . industrial designer: Well no I'm just a bit wondering what we're gonna do the next  session ? user interface: Yeah . Because then we have a user interface: After that we are going to the conceptual  project manager: Yeah . project manager: Y you do some individual work , marketing: We're just working the three phases . And then I have to prepare  I have to defend our design , user interface: project manager: so make it good . marketing: Better make it industrial designer: I am gonna work on the conceptual design already 'cause yeah it's fairly important to know what kind of components we want to put in . industrial designer: Do we  , is it gonna be a multimedia control centre ? Do we want to be able to use the video recorder with it ? marketing: Yeah . user interface: I would first m industrial designer: So if I don't know what components to put in , it's kind of hard . marketing: Yeah project manager: You can always add a few marketing: well like l li like some like some some remotes who are out there , which I know , there's one button which is very easy to switch between devices . marketing: So you can switch to your video project manager: marketing: and then the same buttons control your video . marketing: And another function I'll think of switch to your media centre , because that's getting very popular . industrial designer: Yeah so marketing: And then use your Windows media centre under your T_V_ with the same remote control . industrial designer: Yeah I I know what you mean , but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player . industrial designer: And and for a t  teletext you need additional buttons as well , marketing: No . project manager: We could just start with the assumption that's only for T_V_ and video <doc-sep>We're here to have a kick-off meeting for the design of a f for the beginning of new project   remote control for the design for a new remote control . marketing: project manager: So I'm first going to do an opening then we get used to one anothers and we speak about this tool we're going to design and try to make a project plan , some discussion and then we talk of  the next meeting . marketing: project manager:  I think the important points we have to t talk about are  it's functional design , it's conceptual design , and desail detailed design . project manager: user interface: It's gonna be not my favourite one but the one I can draw . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: And it's gonna be you'll try to guess . marketing: A r a rabbit , oh oh yeah , where is the carrot ? project manager: user interface: That's it . project manager: You want to go ? industrial designer: marketing: I am not very good at  this kind of stuff . industrial designer: marketing: My favourite animal is project manager: industrial designer: You wa marketing: user interface: Wow . industrial designer: project manager: marketing: What about you  project manager:  yeah Christa Pavlov  . project manager: So they have to be waterproof maybe ? marketing: It has to be  wha baby proof project manager: 'Cause they eat she ate it . marketing: because even if she's not very tall she's  high enough so that  when she throw it away it's  industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: But how gonna okay , just  but it's  monochrome it's n it's not like industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah even we can change colours , no ? Like the  marketing: Oh like the phones , industrial designer: like the phones and these things we c yeah . project manager: Small also ? Don't you think industrial designer: Huh not so big like yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , not too much buttons and marketing: Should it be , y you know these  remote controls where  they are what they call a universal ret remote control project manager: marketing: so y you can decide that now it's the remote control for the television , then it's the remote control for the the sound system , or for your refrigerator industrial designer:  . project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: marketing: whatever project manager: that's marketing: I dunno if it's project manager: marketing: Or if we should have a targeted re remote control . marketing: So colour , robustness , easy to use , size , project manager: So , I think there's marketing: yeah , size matters , yeah . Colour , size , sh project manager: So you you think it's better if small than bigger . marketing: But  what would be different from this , from the others ? I dunno if industrial designer:  maybe we can change the colours that at least the frame . marketing: I think one thing important for instance in this remote control if you remember when people use it they're they never find a good button in the right place . marketing: For some reason they they they click the off button when they want to use the industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: So there's a problem in the design of that kind of remote control somehow , project manager:  . So , some kind of idea  with   cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what marketing: I dunno . marketing: Too expensive for twelve Euro ? user interface: And n maybe not too expensive , project manager: And too expensive . marketing: So ma I prefer to have the off button at the top right , industrial designer: Ye yeah . marketing: so I would have my own design of the remote control because it's in fact just a a full touch screen remote control , industrial designer:  . industrial designer:  it it's like marketing: I don't know if it makes sense , but project manager: industrial designer: it's like two types no ? people are right handed or left handed so y because I am left handed I use like this , say if you're right handed you use like this marketing: Yeah , for instance ,  . industrial designer:  user interface: so how many actions do we need to implement in it ? industrial designer: huh . user interface: On off ? industrial designer: Maybe I think even we can keep two switches and then we can  only make one working . industrial designer: We can adapt only one switch , suppose here like we can make two switches and if I'm left-hander I use this switch to follow the main operations . user interface:  if it's less than three  then we can make it  like a industrial designer: Two . marketing: Three buttons you mean ? user interface: like three mental states , project manager: Three option . project manager: Maybe if it's more , if there is a software inside industrial designer: project manager: that ask you three user interface: industrial designer: marketing: project manager: If it if we want a r universal remote control that we sa like we say before it may may need more than three  three button , three  possibilities , ye yeah . user interface: But for standard actions you usually what do you do , you change channels , you adjust volume , and nothing else . marketing: Yeah but for instance when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five . industrial designer: marketing: Because I'm only using three or four channels but industrial designer: Yeah . But they keep generally their t slash slash  this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put yeah , you can only have one bit . I change channel like this , m  I want to go to twenty five , and then to ten , -huh  yeah . marketing: And then back to the one I was before , project manager: Also we can be here marketing: so there's whichever it was . project manager: marketing: Then you can watch what your ah you could also record your record your sequence of actions , industrial designer:  . marketing: that becomes more complex , project manager: industrial designer: marketing: but you could look at what  the other people have used there or remote controls . project manager:  we're going to meet again in thirty minutes and  I want you to  work on these ideas and try to make a  the ones , make  to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we don't want . marketing: So what does M_E_ means ? M_E_ the user requirements ? Or that's  that's for us ? user interface: Market Expert . user interface: marketing: Oh , of course yeah , the user requirement specifications , -huh , yeah "

        "Query": "Why did the team have doubts about relying solely on speech recognition and eliminating buttons for the remote control? What challenges did they face in implementing speech recognition in the new remote controls?",
        "Summary": "Age group data for remote control use was not available, but it is acknowledged that many people may not want to learn how to use a new remote control. Despite this, certain buttons such as channel control, volume settings, and on/off are still necessary. The Industrial Designer raised concerns about the size and bulkiness of remote controls with too many buttons, while a small and slim design was deemed prone to being lost. The User Interface suggested a PDA or hand-held type of remote control, but this was deemed unfriendly in terms of unit price. Marketing expressed concerns about the cost and price implications of implementing voice recognition, arguing that the elderly would not find it user-friendly compared to an LCD screen. The Project Manager agreed with Marketing's opinion and prioritized the LCD screen over voice recognition. The Project Manager also noted the difficulty of implementing speech recognition in remotes due to noise interference, which was expensive to solve. However, the User Interface proposed a solution involving a signal-emitting device built into the TV and a microphone and transmitter on the remote control, utilizing subtractive cancellation of noise.",
        "Article": "project manager: and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . So I will first  marketing: No y you do the minutes first , or ? project manager: What ? marketing: No ? project manager: I I think I will let  our User Interface Designer speak first , Mister David Jordan . The second concept is a fancy controller ,  so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive ,  they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g  industrial designer:  . industrial designer: marketing: user interface: Yeah , it's very , you know project manager: It's very big , user interface: if you're project manager: yeah . marketing: user interface: It's hard f i it's easy for you to remember it . user interface: so maybe we should  use   technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and  gesture recognition . project manager: I just have one question , because for the intelligent controller , you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition , user interface: Yeah . project manager: but as the  expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels . Do you think they will be able to use gestures ? user interface: Yeah , so project manager: Because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ? user interface: Y marketing: industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , I think they will be bored after a while . You don't think so ? user interface:  I think some time it's very  convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button . user interface: For example , if you cannot find your  controller , you can just  just just  speak something such as , yeah , one two . project manager: I industrial designer: Oh yeah , that's a good that's a good point , so . industrial designer: marketing: Yeah but how how is how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition ? project manager: Broken arm ? user interface: For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very marketing: Okay . project manager: Yeah , but suppose you have a family watching T_V_ , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you think it will work ? Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: If you have one brother and one sister marketing: Yeah project manager: and they want to watch their favourite  T_V_ programme , marketing: Yeah , but the project manager: so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time , industrial designer: Yeah but Yeah user interface: Yeah , it's very interesting . industrial designer: but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , marketing: I don't think it project manager: but you have the remote control , so maybe you can keep it f with you . marketing: Oh , okay , okay , you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff . Even you h you have the controller , I can I can say channel three , industrial designer: It's it's marketing: No . user interface: so it's c come to channel three , marketing: No , but this is disadvant disadvantage . user interface: I don't have to project manager: Yeah , I think it's a disadvantage . industrial designer: And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to project manager: Yeah , but one other question . marketing:  if you if if you use the basic user interface: No no we just  have some cooperation with some research institute , we don't have to do some basic research on this field . project manager: So you think it won't cost an Not a lot for us ? Or ? user interface: Yeah , I think it's  because  this technology is   for limited wor or limited wor  lexical recognition , it's very project manager: Yeah , but   user interface: it's  yeah . It's marketing: But it's it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built . industrial designer: Well y y you have also the language problem , user interface: No it's  Even for the f  because the the vocabulary the industrial designer: you know when you project manager: project manager: Yeah , but there is one problem that  Baba talked about is the international industrial designer: Yeah . If you want to go to England , it will be able to understand English , user interface: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , the key , the key  the key of our the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some some  adaptation marketing: Yeah , this could be downloaded by the web maybe , or industrial designer: Yeah but you know . It's It's it means when you when you sell this controller in China it's can recognise Chinese . industrial designer: It's a very smart , it's a very smart controller maybe project manager: okay . user interface: Yeah , project manager: And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ? user interface: it's industrial designer: Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah . project manager: Yeah , but how will you user interface: So industrial designer: Yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one . industrial designer: because  the for example for Se user interface: Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to industrial designer: Oh really ? That's project manager: Oh . marketing: but then w Yeah , industrial designer: Comple user interface: No , it's not so complex . marketing: we have to take care of the twelve Euros project manager: And what about voice recognition , do we have microphones ? marketing: problem . project manager: And where will be they ? Do you think if we're far from television it will work ? user interface: No no no it's not I think that's n that's not a problem because you you don't have to wear a microphone . industrial designer: project manager: Yeah , but we're marketing: No , but then it's it's like this  project manager: here it's  an object . project manager: Yeah , but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object . user interface: Yeah yeah just you just put the controller here , then you industrial designer: I if you say one , he switch to channel , user interface: you use your command project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: yeah . user interface: No no it's n y if you lose it industrial designer: So well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the T_V_ to switch to channel one . project manager: Okay you so you can build a kind of black box industrial designer: Devic project manager: and put it on T_V_ and just to recognize gestures and voice . Or is it do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ? Or you you still have the possibility to use buttons ? user interface: think it we should give the  flexibility to the user and we think marketing: Okay , so you project manager: Yeah , user interface: yeah . user interface: No , project manager: And maybe it will be quite user interface: that's quite inter quite attractive . industrial designer: But I think that , you know , switching from one country to to another will be a problem , so although y y user interface: Well , if you do language adaptation , there should be no problem . marketing: What ? project manager: Which kind of controller would you prefer to use , you as a remote control user ? marketing: If if  ,  I'm sure if the user pays the same price , he's happy to have recognition . industrial designer: Yeah , but marketing: But if if if it like doubles  industrial designer: I think he need a control that is very reliable , marketing: no one would would be interested . project manager: So I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller . user interface: project manager: Just want to have something controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy . You think it's possible ? user interface: Yeah but if if you stick to  stick to the first two parts . So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ? There's no k features of our controller , so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ? industrial designer: Yeah . No , user interface: Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that marketing:  industrial designer: It's not really the we marketing: Y industrial designer: we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet , so or something like that . But  I think a user need user interface: Yeah , you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller , that's a function of T_V_ . You can replace your T_V_ with a new T_V_ with internet browsing function , marketing: No , user interface: but marketing: but you need you need new remote controller then . Because if you wanna browse internet or , I don't know , if you wanna type something , industrial designer: Don't have a the the Yeah user interface: Okay . user interface: But it's not the only the problem only the issue of controller , it's it's also the issue of the T_V_ . industrial designer: Because the p the problem I can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example if marketing: Cause for example yeah . user interface: Yeah , but we do we do we we we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller , marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , but  we want so user interface: but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , but you when you choose a new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition . user interface: the feature is not one hundred percent reliable , but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our from other products . project manager: Yeah , but w we we want something th that works all the time , every day , every hour , for everyone . industrial designer: And for all the person of the family maybe , user interface: Yeah ,  project manager: You don't need to tune it . user interface: Yeah , if if if if you're if you ar if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable , would you replace it with another one ? project manager: Yeah , why not ? If it's marketing: for example the goo y industrial designer: Because you have new marketing: you say we would we would to have a Google-like controller . marketing: I don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like Google . marketing: so I I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it's already a lot . marketing:  thi this  , the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition user interface: The then nn marketing: or user interface: no . marketing: if he has something that works fine and is really fancy , looks nice and it's easy easy to use , easy to use . user interface: But the there's there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller . marketing: See user interface: That's the same marketing: That's the problem , user interface: yeah .  , I I know it's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever . marketing: But you have to think , the user is the one who gonna buy the product user interface: Yeah . project manager: Two ? industrial designer: Yeah , participant two  project manager: Working ? industrial designer: Yeah , working design , user interface: industrial designer: so . marketing: industrial designer: So I think project manager: I can industrial designer: Can you go to the next one ? I  it's not this one . industrial designer: It's  oth the oth so I marketing: industrial designer: It's the working design . project manager: It's okay industrial designer: So this yeah so this is the described use project manager: industrial designer: What ? Are you inst project manager:  I think there's something wrong with your user interface: It did didn't r receive it . project manager: It seems that we have a problem with the marketing: I dunno if you remember what you had to say or industrial designer: I can say it to you without . project manager: Yeah , so user interface: Yeah , maybe we can first come to project manager: No , I think it will be more interesting to start with  user interface:  to Frahan . With Frahan , then you can prepare your slides , marketing: I think it's more interesting what he says , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: exac marketing: project manager: You will had s some more information in industrial designer: Okay . industrial designer: I s because i in my presentation I don't have here with user interface: project manager: Okay , never mind . industrial designer: so It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r user interface: Okay . So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside user interface: Okay . So I in fact the the f something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use , project manager: industrial designer: so will it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one . industrial designer: so it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like L_C_D_ where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night , project manager: industrial designer: And the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be for example  d  solar energy alimentation user interface: -huh . And I think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have  both of them , so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities  for example in some place in in S Senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come user interface: industrial designer: and so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con It can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example . project manager: Yeah , I think it's an added value to the remote control industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers industrial designer: Ecologists , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . project manager: and but about the the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more , industrial designer: project manager: no ? industrial designer: Alrigh In fact , having them both will if we want to have battery , regular battery and and the solar energy battery it could be it'll it will add a little bit of the price , project manager: So . project manager: And what tha what about the  materials ? industrial designer: And the materials , it depends for example you if you have a wooden material it can be more the plastic material is more common project manager: Impersonal , industrial designer: it's very resistant but , you know , something wooden will be like , I don't know high cl so a special high class , project manager: Yeah . marketing: Special for industrial designer: or you know , you can have some project manager: Yeah , and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood . industrial designer: Yeah , even if it is not completely wood , but just a part of the , you know , will be wooden , in wood user interface: industrial designer: And so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , it depends , but I think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module . project manager: Yeah , we want something easy to use and so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough . project manager: And you think that we will be industrial designer: Yeah , I think it will fit on the price we want , twel twelve Euros , project manager: Okay . industrial designer: project manager: And what about the buttons ? industrial designer: I think the buttons I pr I prefer , you know , the L_C_D_ you know lighted buttons because , you know , it's I don't know  yeah , in the dark , it's fashion project manager: No it's fashion , yeah . industrial designer: and it's related to how beautiful it is or  if you want to watch T_V_ in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness it's very easy so , right . industrial designer: I think a touch screen will be t as expensive as the L_C_D_ buttons so .  , I think so , just Yeah , so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of  have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , so next . project manager: marketing: So again , it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting . Like the one you've shown , David , with all the buttons and  i i it sounds good technically user interface:  . marketing: but it's it's not what they want and  So , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on . Wha what we really see this year is that  everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables , industrial designer: Ah yes . marketing: okay , so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing . And then  if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance . marketing: So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , and then if we combine this with the fashion  from Milan and Paris industrial designer: And fruit and vegetables yeah . And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch , industrial designer: Spongy 'Kay . industrial designer: Yeah , but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ? marketing: Yeah thi this is this would be like  industrial designer: Pla S marketing: plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like  industrial designer: Very stuff Okay , rubber rubber desi okay , yeah . marketing: Okay , tha tha that was the main point , I think , from the trend in fashion . So , as you say you want something technologically innovative , maybe using solar energy and with battery would be something interesting , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager:  cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be  enough to have something working well . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: industrial designer: No wood but Plastic ? marketing: Maybe not no wood , but  ma maybe not the part you touching you know . industrial designer: Would some user interface: Pla project manager: Maybe you industrial designer: I think we can have wood for example in the bottom and , you know . marketing: But still y project manager: Th The feeling is natural , industrial designer: Yeah , it's natural marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: And it can be correlated to energy , solar energy , so for the marketing aspect , you know , saying that it's ecol marketing: Yeah ,  it's not exactly right for the spongy point of view . marketing: But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons , industrial designer: Okay . project manager:  and what about the user interface concept ? industrial designer: Google and project manager: Google and fancy ? industrial designer: and fancy , f how about the the voice ? And project manager: Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this . industrial designer:  maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested user interface:  yes . industrial designer: But and the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the T_V_ , so speak directly to the T_V_ and you don't need a remote control actually , project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: so . industrial designer: But it will be embedded on the T_V_ and not on the remote control , so . project manager: So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller , marketing: I dunno . project manager: maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood . project manager: Yeah , I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add . And pf what can we think a supplement to marketing: What interface ? project manager: Yeah , for the interface something added value . It is just , you know , it is not the most important , but it can be a part of project manager: With a module ? You mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . So the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes so we'll you will all have to work in in your direction . So you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the  simple vocal commands recognition . project manager:  you will have to work more , Baba , on the  spongy way to to add spongy  touch to the buttons industrial designer: expensive buttons Yeah , to make some new project manager: and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control . project manager: And remember as as I said last meeting , we really have to build a fashion remote control and  the colour of the  the society will be really it will be seen in the remote control . project manager: So you will have Baba and David Jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us  modelling a cl a clay remote control , user interface: Yeah . Yep project manager: And I think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach <doc-sep> we will start with the  Manager Expert wi who will talk about  user re requirements , whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device . marketing: Okay , so basically I'm gonna present some findings of a study we conducted  into  what users want in this remote control . Oh that's okay , it's jus marketing:  so first of all we what we did is we  conducted a an experiment with a hundred test subjects .  we put them in a in our  usability laboratory and got them to , you know ,  play with remote controls , and also to complete , after they'd done that , to complete a questionnaire  to tell us what they like and what they don't like in remote controls . So basically  the major things we found out was that  basically users don't like the look and feel of of most remote controls that are currently on the market .  they , you know , seventy five percent of the people we we  did the experiments on , found that rem remote the remote controls that they'd used in the past were ugly .  they they didn't match the operating behaviour of the user , that is , you know , the the way users use remote controls when they're watching T_V_ .  and thirdly they say that w half of the users that we  tested said that they only used ten percent of the buttons that  are on remote controls .  so we collect we also some collected some usage statistics  based on how these test subjects were using their remote control . And from this we basically came up with the figure that the channel buttons , the channel selection buttons are the most by far the most used buttons on the remote control .  and you can see they're used a hundred and sixty eight times per hour on average , while the user's watching T_V_ . industrial designer: project manager: marketing:  the closest button that was used , well the cl the button that was used that was closest to the channel button was the teletext button ,  which was used fourteen times per hour , followed by the volume button , which was four times per hour , all the other , all the other  buttons , such as ch  audio and picture selection  configuration buttons and things were used , you know , l approx well less than or equal to one times per hour .  we also asked users  which buttons had the most importance to them , you know , which which buttons they felt were the most important buttons on on the remote control . And basically they came they said the channel , volume , and power buttons had the highest relevance to users ,  note that only power was very infrequently used , it only had a b a a fr usage frequency of about one times per hour , but users ranked it as having a very very high relevance .  and the audio and picture settings had a very that well the users thought that  w the audio and picture settings were very  weren't very important to them  , and they used them very infrequently a as well . And fifty percent of the users said that  what frustrates them is losing the remote control  somewhere in the room and not being able to find it .  they also said that it  it takes a lot of time to learn a new remote control , especially when there's many buttons and it's a , you know , a c a a unintuitive interface .  and then thirdly , they some users commented on the fact that the the you know the way that you have to hold and press buttons on a remote control ar are bad and  cause u repetitive strain injury . We also asked some users about some specific features that they'd like to see in the on the remote control . In particular , do they want an L_C_D_ d display , and secondly , do they think speech recognition  is a useful feature to have on a remote control . project manager: marketing:  basically our findings are that  amongst a younger age groups  the answer is umv overwhelmingly yes . industrial designer: marketing:  for instance , ninety one percent of pe of people aged between fifteen and twenty five said yes , they want these features . Whereas  the the trend was as users as users  became older and older  they were less likely to want these sort of features in a  in a remote control .  and as our company motto is putting fashion in electronics ,  I think we're focusing on the younger younger  target demographic , and so maybe we should think about adding these sort of high technology features into our remote control . project manager: So ,  maybe now we can talk about a user interface and  about the technical function of this device . So  Pet Peter , can you talk say something about that ? industrial designer: Well , okay , yeah . marketing: Yeah , it's true , but , you know , they're features that users want , industrial designer: marketing: so it's industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: And our production cost of twelve fifty Euros per per unit is fairly high I think , user interface: industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: At least we have couple of months t to work on it so so it will be cheaper finally . Okay , first what is a remote control ? Simply it's a device , as you know , for  , for sending some commands by some waves to  another device to to tell different commands  with this device . And the main idea we don't use any cable and we can rec react simpler with the device .  first is remote control have sh ha should have some electric circuits  making interface with  keyboard and  r reading  keyboard and reading the keyboard  commands . And then there should be  an electronic circuit making  electronic signals according to these commands and  finally there is a transmitter which is a cord or a a diode making  making  waves to transmit through the air and   this air this  wave  will be received by the by the other device like a television or whatever , to  r to realise the command . Okay ,  about what I found about  different  these different blocks are  , usually there are two different methods  to for designing a remote control . This is  this can be   the the differences the th between different kind of waves , infra-red or radio waves . And  also as  I understood , and  I think it was a part of  Bob ,   presentation , people prefer to have  to have  the remote control with less button . So for the electronic part , working and interfacing , with button , we should we should try to t try to design a remote control having  some some simpler buttons or some rolling buttons to just to just to search between different options , and showing o something on T_V_ and putting less lesser stuff on the  on the remote control . And  personal preferences ,     certainly a remote control with  working with radio waves is  preferred because  you can pr you can take it in any direction and you don't need to tune it any way . marketing: Do you think radio waves  will interfere with other appliances in the home ? user interface: I don't think so , because  we can make  we ca we can make this wave in a specific frequency . So they can be in a range which is not inter interfering with the with other devices inside the home . project manager: So can we use any any frequency ? industrial designer: Yeah , it should be okay . project manager: We have the right to use any frequency ? user interface:  no but as I know , there is a range for  for this  f for for  for this stuff , for designing this circuit . We can we can we can tune our  transmitter to work in this range , and for this range we don't need to ask any permission . And what happen with  radio waves when two neighbours have the same have our remote control , for example ? And so do they have the same frequency , or ? user interface:  for this I'm not  I I don't know the solution , but one solution can be something like putting  p password or something inside the wave , so the only your T_V_ can understand it project manager: Okay . A kind of identification , user interface: Yeah , identification code inside the industrial designer: Yeah f  I know about this , since it's my it's exactly my field , so . So industrial designer: It's  kind of handshaking , when starting to  when you start to communicate with the your T_V_ then then it's like an handshaking protocol with your your remote . So industrial designer: So so if two two devices are trying to go to communicate with the T_V_ set then the the the one which has the more energy in the wave is chosen . A specific  remote control has a specific f industrial designer: Yeah but we we don't have to think  about this because I think as a function designer that we will use the already made  circuits which we probably bu buy . I have only a couple of things because I had I struggled a bit with the software that I'm supposed to use in this   in this company .  what  I have to do ? A look at what the other company Okay so  presently I am looking what is possible to use , what circuits to use and stuff like that because  I didn't work  with these  circuits so far so I have to look what what is a v a v available on the market for for the communication for the I_R_ circuits and so on , so I'm currently looking what is available on the web . And  I wanted to ask you m maybe afterwards , after after our discussion , if we have some contacts in some companies , so , which can report on what is going on there , so , I would be glad if you can tell me about them .  , okay findings , that's the point that I'm working on currently but  so far I I was  looking what what are the blue circuit ,  radio wave radio frequency circuits are available now , marketing: So , I know that  the user interface people and these speak about radio frequency waves because you can you can  you can make the T_V_ do what you want even if you are in the bathroom or so on , user interface: industrial designer: but you know , when you are not close to the T_V_ you probably won't need to to change the program and so on and so I am I am voting for s to stick to the  infra-red control instead of R_W_ but we will discuss it later maybe . Components to use , I'm not exactly sure what I will use for the design of the circuit . It depends  on whether we will use the L_C_D_ and mainly the speech recognition , user interface: industrial designer: because the speech rec Yeah ? marketing: Are we  are we planning to take an off the shelf an O_E_M_ component for the radio wave circuit , or are we planning to construct our own circuit board ? industrial designer: No no no no no . This we this we buy I think , because it's rather cheap nowadays and it's not worth to construct ourselves . So , speech recognition well , L_C_D_ it's okay because it's common nowadays to use L_C_D_ , project manager: industrial designer: so I agree on using any kind of L_C_D_ , less buttons good for me as a as a designer of the circuit . industrial designer: But the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the what does it offer , you know . So what do you think would be the price , it would be out of range ? industrial designer: Yeah , I'm project manager: Or it would be maybe feasible ? industrial designer: Oh . But if we use the L_C_D_  even the radio frequency communication with the T_V_ set and the backlight and  related things like the photo diodes and stuff , it should be okay . If we decide to use the speech recognition , then we probably could struggle but we'll see afterwards . industrial designer: It depends of you if if the M_E_ or U_I_D_ , project manager:  . industrial designer: I'm sorry about the names , I don't really know ,  want to have it like in metal or in plastic , these things , it it depends on you not Because the the the electronic device's price is not not so big in comparison to to the overall shape and stuff like that , so . And  my personal preference is yes , I would like also preferably to use R_W_ circuit , but from the point of view  of the design and price , I would stick to I_R_s . project manager: Why ? Because it's simpler ? industrial designer: Because because the the range where you can use it is fair . industrial designer: Otherwise I don't care what I put there because it's the chip which I buy or which we buy . marketing: What how much more expensive ? Are we talking three times more expensive ? project manager: industrial designer: Well , three to three to five . marketing: Or ten times more expensive ? Or industrial designer: N not ten times , marketing: Okay . marketing: because  all the other remote controls on the market have infra-red , so people don't expect anything other than infra-red . project manager: Well I , oh industrial designer: Th they are used to use it when they can see the T_V_ so , I don't know . project manager: we want to to have something new and So we I think we should still thinking about it . marketing: But I think , based on my usability studies I th I feel that users are prioritise the look and the feel and the trendiness above , you know , the difference between infra-red or radio waves . project manager: So  I have to inform you I receive an email from the management bon board today and they have new requirements for the for the remote control . And  Because of the internet popularity and everybody has internet at home , and actually it's not useful to have teletext .  the second thing is  they suggest that that we should  use the remote control only for T_V_ , not for D_V_D_ and other devices , because it make it it makes it's too complex and  because we have not much time for this project we should stay on T_V_ on the only specific T_V_ remote control .  ,  It's That mean we should use the colour of our company and maybe put somewhere the s the slogan of the company , which is  , we put fashion of in electronics . So , when people see the the remote control , they should say oh it's from Real Reaction and he s they should recognise the company . So ,  So now we we should take the decision what we are going to what function we will have on this  on this remote control . industrial designer: Okay , so the available things are L_C_D_ , the buttons and everything . project manager: Yeah but first maybe what is what are the usual function of a standard remote control ? industrial designer: You should probably speak . Do we will we use only two buttons , or or like numbered buttons ?  those nine plus one or two ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: I think it would be a b industrial designer: Because it's many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number . project manager: On the other side we have more and more channels , and if you want to pass through all the channels to get the channel you want , it's marketing: Yeah , I user interface: Yeah . project manager: Maybe maybe we could think of something more betweens , like user interface: Yeah yeah , at least nine , ten button . project manager:  industrial designer: Like ten plus , five plus , one plus , one minus or something . Maybe we could have key buttons , like  discovery channe like documentary channel , and movies channel and industrial designer: You mean like hierarchical structure . project manager: If you want to see a movie you click on the movie button so you have all the movie channels and after you've you plus plus plus . industrial designer: So it requires the use of L_C_D_ probably , to to tell you project manager: Yeah , probably , yeah , yeah . marketing: We could maybe also c  incorporate Petre's idea of the  slider for the volume , with the channel . industrial designer: So we are still s speaking about the common devices user interface: industrial designer: or we are inviting the new one ? marketing: I think so . project manager: What about the settings of the T_V_ ? Because it's button we don't use very often , but it's we need it anyway . user interface: we should just design the remote control and we sh we don't have any access to the to the T_V_ design or we can change some design . Because one solution for this    ch changing channels is to see a summary of all channels , some some preview of all channels and then you can industrial designer: On the screen , you mean ? user interface: Yeah . user interface: And then marketing: I don't Oh , I don't but I don't think we're we're the ones .  this remote control we're developing is a generic control for all T_V_s , I think . I don't know if it's possible to to watch something on T_V_ user interface: W I I think it it would be better to to stick to the remote control and not to bother the T_V_ to to to print these things . industrial designer: Well it wi it will be still more expensive , but for the L_C_D_ and this stuff is no problem in the price . project manager: So , what are we doing with the settings ? Because settings if we want to do settings we need buttons for that and we want less buttons , so . Maybe with the L_C_D_ we can do something with less buttons , but user interface: Yeah . marketing: But then you don't want to make the L_C_D_ display too complicated at the same time . marketing:  there's always we can always have these l less often used functions hidden somewhere , under a cover or at the back of under a slide or some project manager: Yeah . marketing: So I think s the settings we th we are agreeing are agreed that they're required . project manager: In the menus of the L_C_D_ or in the back of the remote control , or something like that . industrial designer: Should should shouldn't we do it like sleep mode after five minutes of not using it ? Because generally project manager: It's it's a kind of setting , I think . marketing: well I think when they say power button they mean to turn the T_V_ on and off . project manager: No , I think it's after after five minutes or something a timer industrial designer: Yes . Well I I  project manager: I I think , no ? industrial designer: marketing: But if you're watching T_V_ for two hours , you don't want your T_V_ to turn off after five five minute industrial designer: project manager: industrial designer: You don't need to every five minutes to keep it alive . marketing:  based on our usability studies again ,  pe  people said that the power button was v a very relevant button . marketing: you know , it was nine out of ten industrial designer: Okay , so we we could p what we could probably do is to keep also to keep  keep the L_C_D_ and all the buttons and stuff , marketing: re relevance . industrial designer: we could make it like a opening opening style that if you open it you are you just turn on the T_V_ and if you close it , it will project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Because , well it's maybe question for you t marketing: I think we need to concentrate on the , you know , the major usage of the th of the control , user interface: marketing: which is you sit down , you turn on your T_V_ , you change channels , you change the volume , you turn the T_V_ off . marketing:  and all the other f functionality is industrial designer: user interface: Yeah , they can yeah they can be hide somewhere by a cover or something like this . industrial designer: Yeah but since we have the L_C_D_ , we didn't need too much button too many buttons . user interface: industrial designer: Should we make it a button , or some some something which would be project manager: For what ? industrial designer:  power button . marketing: I think it should be a bu industrial designer: If it if it's a button or user interface: Yeah . marketing: S What about things like the clock and  timers ? industrial designer: Do we still have the time ? I I just wonder . Well what w what was the question ? user interface: Clock or marketing: you know , some func some features on the control to display a time , or t to display project manager: Usually it's already on T_V_ or something like that . industrial designer: Yeah but since we want to control all the televisions , and and it would probably be worth to to set the timing on the remote , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: no ? Because if if the T_V_ turns on itself , it well you know , if the time The timer should be there . If we if we add the time , we have to have maybe a bigger display or something like that , and is it very useful ?  , are users wants to have the time on the on the remote ? user interface:  . project manager: W In my opinion we should have only useful thing and Because apparently they want The simpler it's is better . industrial designer: Did you did you ever use the like the timing of turning on the T_V_ , user interface: project manager: industrial designer: well And based on your user interface: marketing: Very , yeah okay , very occasionally . industrial designer: marketing: But I do use the I do use the display of the time quite often , but user interface:  . industrial designer: Yeah but it can be on the display in in a corner all the time on the remote . industrial designer: user interface: And  do we need to include anything about the speech recognition and the speech commands , or ? industrial designer: Yes yes . project manager: I think user interface: I I thin I think it will not take lots of place , we just need a microphone and the software , so , and it sh and it will be a little bit new and interesting , so people may be attracted to buy this stuff and it's not very difficult to  put a software inside the the electronic device and put a microphone . project manager: So maybe we think we can think more about that , and discuss that maybe last time next time <doc-sep>project manager:  I think we're slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting , user interface: project manager: This is where we talk about  properties , materials , user-interface and trend-watching . project manager: So I think we've touched on a few things to do with that already , but we'll just go over it .  we had a couple of  changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext , it wasn't gonna be a control for everything  and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow .  we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition , we've decided on there being a flip design and  a different shape from what's normal . We were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , just a different shape from what's normal ,  . project manager: and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost , user interface: project manager: things like that , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Okay , so shall we start with the first presentation ? marketing: Shall I ? user interface: Yep . Okay  so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching .  the methods we used to decide on  current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional  our usual market research study  with a hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im  w I'm sorry I'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch , user interface: project manager: It's okay .  we decided on the most important aspect i  required in a remote control device and we'll come to that later . Also with our company  being forerunners in  putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update  using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan .  so the general findings from that was  in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls . They also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use . Now I should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use . So possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at . marketing: Okay , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group ,  we found from our  consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ? There also seems to be  a trend towards a spongy feel to materials ,  again in contrast to last year . So a lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in Paris and Milan . marketing: Unless anyone has any questions about that ? project manager: I don't think so , not yet . project manager: especially if you do them on too tight and you can't get the leverage on them to undo them .  this is  all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment . The the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the T_V_ and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find .  also in this study I've looked into the availability of some of the materials , 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't un unfortunately aren't available . This is  the chip called the T_A_ double one eight three five which is what's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals , based on your input and  it's pretty much used for all all T_V_ remotes at the moment . marketing: industrial designer: There's  actually no rechargeable option available , so we I saw the  the standard double A_ and triple A_ which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment , dynamo charging , I thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest , project manager: Wa can you explain that ? industrial designer: people won't it's it's basically like wind-up radio . marketing: project manager: How what kind of how l long can you get out of that , industrial designer: It might project manager:  can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night ? Or industrial designer: You Yeah , yeah , oh yeah I presu you wouldn't have to wind it for very long , but I don't I don't think it's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options , like the the solar charging , 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when when you got T_V_ . project manager: That doesn't count though does it ? marketing: Does does light charge as as sunlight does ? project manager: I thought it was U_V_ like industrial designer: No . marketing: Artificial light ? industrial designer: Is it ? Alright i project manager: Any , any marketing: Has to be solar . Regarding those sizes , which one you think will be light because we we have to take into consideration size also , so maybe a standard triple A_ might take lesser space or and dynamo might take more space . industrial designer: Yeah it would the d yeah the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up . marketing: That's going to project manager:  people who live in basement flats there's not that many people , but there are people . user interface:  marketing: I know , industrial designer: But marketing: different parts of the world too , if we're if we're marketing internationally . industrial designer: and most people most people also watch T_V_ in the in the night anyway . project manager: but then it would be charging through the day , I think the point is that it charges through the day and then you've got it charged for the evening . industrial designer: The the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches project manager: Yeah I've seen industrial designer: and you d you don't even notice it .  the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up , I don't think you'd ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work . user interface: And are these like  what are the life of the kinetic battery , it like it runs for long time ? industrial designer:  yeah it's it charges into  some form of it's a smaller cell which it charges into and  the si the size sort of a watch a watch battery , user interface: industrial designer: And that'll that would l would last for  well I do I d I'm not entirely sure how long it would last but I've never seen one run out . user interface: We c project manager: But then if you think about a watch , it's on your wrist so it's on your whole bod it's on your body the whole time industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: so you're walking around , you're doing things , it is moving a lot of the time . If you'd industrial designer: Yeah and project manager:  you switch the T_V_ on , then you put it on the side , then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side . industrial designer: Yeah but then again project manager: Is it really gonna be enough ? industrial designer: I I think it is because if you think about it , the watch , although it's only a tiny amount it's it's  it's always moving for the whole day and they don't run out over night when you leave them on the side . industrial designer: And th for the same the same reason , you're only using it for a v incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you're finished with it project manager: So it's not the draw on it isn't industrial designer: and you put it marketing:  . industrial designer: no no I do I don't think the the draw on it would be marketing: marketing: Could I just ask referring back to solar charging , is that compatible with  standard batteries ? industrial designer:  . marketing: could people put standard batteries in but with a s you know they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging industrial designer: Ye yeah I think I th  g y you could have a dual  power thing marketing: or the two things not compatible ? project manager: Like a dual kind of . industrial designer: but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they because , if you lie on a calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all they all look i identical . What kind of price are we looking at for industrial designer: They're they're expensive , they don't user interface: It's twelve point f project manager: I presume the normal batteries are the cheapest ? industrial designer: Yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest I'd presume then it would actually be the the solar charging ones ,  but the It's i I think they're not very resistant to dropping , project manager: Solar . industrial designer: 'cause if you drop stuff yeah if you if you have y project manager: Well they're not designed industrial designer: the size you'd need to charge a remote wouldn't be that big but  if remotes always get thrown around and stuff , so .  calculators you don't really throw around a lot whereas remotes you do , project manager: You do get a bit of wear industrial designer: they can t project manager: but don't calculators have a battery in them as well ? industrial designer: Yeah they do , they yeah they've got dual things , but they're the batteries are smaller I think . W w which one would last the longest , because we don't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day . user interface: A remote control , like , industrial designer: W m yeah user interface: so we have to s look at the life also . industrial designer: so the Yeah the the s if you if you had something du  using the standard batteries and the solar charging , I don't think you'd I think the it would d well you know how long the standard double A_s would last in or triple A_s would last . marketing: It would just detract from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature , industrial designer: Yeah I think i I think it would , yeah . project manager: Can we think about that ? 'Cause if we're doing the kinetic thing and it's industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because I I personally project manager: Well add it in to think about  marketing: right , okay . project manager: because , where am I ? If it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape and the kinetic is something people don't do kind of industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: we're doing something original and different  but if you wore it if it's something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less , you you wouldn't lose it so much . project manager: But then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: marketing: It's not something that's come up in any of our  focus groups and market research , project manager: No . industrial designer: my second part of my findings  the mo most current remotes use this silicone  P_C_B_ board which pr printed circuit board , which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button , it'll connect the circuit and each each switch is connected to two  different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then  gets translated by the chip into a code and then it's fired out of this L_E_D_ in the sequence of l on and off bursts . project manager: What kind of things do we have to consider there ? Can we what kind of size , does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of industrial designer: Well well this the thi the thing about is  they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can you can print circuit board like that that it's it's simply spaced like that so you can have fit the n the size of the nine buttons in . If you if you see how thin the tracks are , you could you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one , project manager: industrial designer: if you if you wanted to but  the there is an option to do to do it like that , or you could have some sort of array of switches which I'll speak about in the next bit project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so that And then to  yeah , so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used . Now what I was thinking about that was 'cause sometimes when y when you have these things , they've got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are , like on a mobile phone , they do it more often than on a than on a T_V_ remote , project manager: industrial designer: but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and  after like five or ten seconds of not being used I'd have that turned off , if we decided to go for buttons that could light up . industrial designer: the case material , I've a been sent what the factory can actually give us , the there's the plastic which I think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case case housing project manager: industrial designer: and the the main problems with the well you could go for wood but I think it would be a bit impractical . industrial designer: which to make it is expensive , and rubber , well you're saying that people like this  spongy feel this year , so perhaps  some something made of rubber , marketing:  . industrial designer: but I was thinking more of the buttons , because the buttons which they've they've said that they've they've put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it's meant to be anti R_S_I_ . industrial designer: I'm no I'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that's what they said .  the problem with the casing is that  there's quite  there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case . If you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more they can they can do sort of curved shapes . But whether whether or not because we'd have it in two separate units user interface: Second thing is project manager: Hinged , yeah . user interface: yeah and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , you call it a skin or whatever . user interface: So in this case if you're looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red or something like that . user interface: So is that feature available in like  titanium , industrial designer: Yeah I th user interface: or it's like only specific to plastic or industrial designer:  . Yeah in in titanium I don't I don't think it would be available at all really , the ju just marketing: industrial designer: it w well you could make it available in the titanium , it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it , because of the expense of how much titanium is is user interface: industrial designer: it's light and strong but I think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for for a remote . I've got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it . marketing: I was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over , industrial designer: Rubber , yeah . marketing: that would give the spongy feel , that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone . project manager: So instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic , the fascia that comes off would be the rubber , marketing: Like a rubber sleeve almost , yeah . user interface: Something like project manager: like those pens that you get with the grip , that you can you can pull that off . industrial designer: T marketing: Very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one if they want to . project manager: Well that's been really popular with mobile phones so I don't see why not . industrial designer: just just going back to the interface designs with the buttons , the I kno we were planning to do some sort of touch screen . industrial designer: Now what I was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare P_C_B_ circuit board and I'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it'd make the connection over if you had them close enough , that would be one option .  the second option th they offer rubber buttons , but I thought that an L_C_D_ type of screen 'cause one they're incredibly thin  and don't take up much space , two they you can have them in a sort of array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing and you could have them like a touch user interface: Sorry I didn't get the last part , you're talking of industrial designer: display .  what what user interface: Just what you said I I didn't get the  meaning of it completely , you're saying like industrial designer: Oh on the on the L_C_D_ screen you could becau you could fit it user interface: -huh . industrial designer: the problem with it basically is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curve curved things with it , user interface: Okay . industrial designer: but  you can you wouldn't have with the L_C_D_ you'd have the wires coming off , you wouldn't have that with the with the L_C_D_ , you'd only have that with the printed circuit board . industrial designer: With W also with the marketing: I don't s sorry to interrupt , I don't see why the curved thing is a problem , if we for example had a shell , once we open that industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: You could have a flat screen inside , yeah , marketing: yeah , so it'd be f yeah , yeah . industrial designer: but I'm just wondering whether we want an L_C_D_ screen inside . marketing: Have I misunderstood you ? industrial designer: It wouldn't be like full colour , it would just be black and white , marketing: industrial designer: so you wouldn't be pressing down on 'em , w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-R_S_I_ . project manager: I think it would be good to have a contrast between , if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside . project manager: Now how would you distinguish , if you had it bare , how would you distinguish where you had to press ,  industrial designer: Yeah I hadn't I hadn't really thought of that to be honest . project manager:  marketing: I just had another idea , I don't know if it helps with that , but just to do with the R_S_I_ . Is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to . industrial designer: Yeah you could , you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out project manager: Like one of the palm pop thing . user interface: Absolutely , f for somebody who very often , if he would industrial designer: 'cause I had marketing: Yeah . user interface: a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use a industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: and he might spoil the touch-pad very fast compared to a button like , if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever . marketing: Yeah just a thought they wouldn't actually need one and they could use anything they've got , couldn't they ? A pencil or a pen , so they wouldn't really need a project manager: Okay , we'll talk about that so if you finish your industrial designer: Yeah that's project manager: and we'll come back to that . industrial designer: yeah that that's the end of m my project manager: That's you , right okay . user interface: And just one small question before like you are , regarding the circuit , since we are hav having a flip-top , we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing , so we can divide the circuit like you know . industrial designer:  you'd you'd actually have two separate you'd have two separate circuit boards but they'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them , user interface: Okay . marketing: I'll just raise another point while it occurs to me , it kind of applies to both our designers here , so I'm not sure how it would fit in . marketing: If we flip open , now you know how you've got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display , you seen those ? project manager: No . Is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display th  the remote control display thing . project manager: Well it's a remote control , you were sitting watching T_V_ are you gonna want to sort of open it and say oh shit I should go and have a shower and do my hair before I put the T_ marketing: Yeah . I know what you mean , it's with us using the ideas for a mobile ph industrial designer: marketing: it's with us using the ideas for mobile phones I kinda got sidetracked onto that I think , okay . marketing: trying to think of other features we can build in that wouldn't cost too much project manager:  . industrial designer:  you can you could do it , you could have a 'cause if you if you just put the full charge through an L_C_D_ display it'll completely blank it out , marketing:  . industrial designer: but I don't know if you could get any mirror effect on it , I'm not sure about marketing: Oh I think forget about the mirror project manager: Okay , okay . First thing is  basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility . Second is we checked into competitors , the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here . So y you generally see there's not much of variety and like marketing team said  , people need trendy , they are bored of black and white . user interface: Like , some some people have a Here you see this ? This is on a I I I found th that  only common feature is the ch  channel control and  volume control , rest other buttons , they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent th with other models and all . user interface: Okay , and second as already discussed with William , we are going to have m maybe a G_ G_U_I_ interface in the f in the middle of the flip-top industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: and g graphic user interface marketing: Sorry what does that stand for ? project manager: Which means user interface: basically which is what we d do in computer , have icons or touch pad or whatever , marketing: Okay . user interface: which is industrial designer: If you if yeah if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this L_C_D_ screen . user interface: Like you have on a l  icons or something y you have is a good example of G_U_I_ graphic user interface . user interface: So basically not point or click Press any particular device , he just has to click on that particular icon to simplify . user interface: And on the top m repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device , that means the use of button . user interface: So we are having a combination of boards , so f on the s simpler board , on the top we have this button , rubber buttons , to keep frequently changing the channels . project manager: Can we swap that round so th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part ? user interface: project manager: 'Cause if you're thinking about holding it you would be using your thumbs to press , just like a mobile phone . marketing: No you'd hold it you don't if you flip it open then you'd be Wouldn't you ? Isn't that the idea ? You us if we just use the shell as an example again , you open that , you've got your L_C_D_ display there and you've got the buttons there so you're holding it in the palm of your hand , yeah . That's what I was just saying , industrial designer: Yeah , yeah but you can do it with your thumb li user interface: But project manager: and then have the and then have the L_C_D_ at the top user interface: user interface: Okay and you mean to the project manager: so have the  the volume and the programme , things like that , user interface: And the lower distance . Okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition , there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature . We have to check into the for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at a low cost , but for like we had g  s response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it . user interface: So it could be like , where is the remote , and the remote answers I am here . user interface: Some kind of thing or it gives a b bleep sound or some kind of sound marketing:  . user interface: and if this can be incorporated this would be more  you can say trendy also ? And technologically innovative also . My personal preferences would be like , as already  marketing department , they want something to do with fruit so I wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit , but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colours , like the vibrant colours ,  red chilli  marketing:  . user interface: tomato red or whatever and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have , like for example , i if you see the previous slide  industrial designer: Well , yeah we user interface: I think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern , here , so we we we would not change h that particular pattern industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: I can't see that , is that play and stop and things ? user interface: This is central one , the one you project manager: Or is that volume and channel ? user interface: yeah volume and channel . So keep that m that standardised because that's the most common feature across all models , if you look at all the models , it's here .  I'm not sure how long we've got left , but we need to make a decision about  the things we've discussed . project manager: that means that there's no function for li the port , you know that it sits in , then pressing the button then having industrial designer:  . industrial designer: Yeah I think project manager: It's a bi i it's like a g it's a gadget , it's a industrial designer:  if Yeah it is it is qui it's quite a cool feature to have project manager: selling point . industrial designer: and also if they've got it if they've got these parts already in stock , then it won't be cheap to re-manufacture them , user interface: So do you reckon that's a good idea that , where's the remote , I'm here thing ? I think that would be quite fun . project manager: I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else , industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah to s th well it's it's not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour 'cause if we've just got a black and white one , marketing:  . marketing: we've deci seem to have decided on that , did we decide on double A_ or triple A_ batteries ? user interface:  . project manager: Do you want like a back-up ? marketing: No , one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double A_ or triple A_ batteries 'cause they've still got to be charged this way haven't they ? industrial designer: K no the kinetic ones come come with  a sort of w watch a battery that goes in a watch . industrial designer: So it's a lot smaller , so it would marketing: Got you on that okay , didn't realise . The buttons what did you give us as our The bare-board L_C_D_ or industrial designer: Yeah the well I think were we're going for the L_C_D_ on that one , on the buttons , user interface: industrial designer: on the on the on on the top one we're gonna project manager: On the top one okay you've got the touch industrial designer: yeah . project manager: okay and then industrial designer: On the bottom we were gonna have the rubber , the rubber ones , the anti-R_S_I_ ones . marketing: Sorry could you repeat that last part ? industrial designer: okay on we've got the flip the flip-screen , the top one is gonna be the L_C_D_ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons . user interface: For the body design I think plastic ,  w yeah industrial designer: Plastic , user interface: we could use the body , project manager: For the inside . user interface: for the inside and  rubber as a padding or for the grip , something like to add to the design . marketing: - , user interface: marketing: so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell , a variety of designs , user interface: Plast right . and it is just  although it's rubberised and spongy , apart from that we're just going to go for sort of vegetable and fruit colours , we're not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else , like a shell that we discussed , industrial designer:  no . user interface: It's project manager: we don't wanna be tacky if we've got a kind of different shape anyway marketing: Okay . project manager:  the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap , so we could make it red , we could make it  psychedelic , you know , we could make it black and white zebra stripes , marketing: project manager: but that's not really what we're focusing on , what we're focusing on is the m you know marketing: The feel . Is that going to be this image I've got in my head of something kind of shaped like that , maybe about that size , made of plastic , fits into the palm of the hand , rubberised cover that's spongy . Is that really going to fit fancy look and feel which was the major thing that people wanted , market research , user interface:  I it's different . project manager: It's just different marketing: is that fancy ? project manager: it's just different from everything else and  , I'm trying to imagine  clean looking houses , marketing:  . project manager:  so you either want something that goes with that , which is what's on the market anyway , marketing: project manager: or you want something that contrasts as you know like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they're so interesting and industrial designer:  . I'm just kind of pushing at that to see if you came out with anything else , but  I totally agree . marketing: This would definitely be different enough , I just wondered if anybody could come up with something even more project manager: And you would just have an across the b you would have so many different options that you could do , you could have  a plain black one , you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little marketing: Well the thing is the rubberised covers are going to be s relatively cheap to produce , that if in a year's time we we get feedback from the design fairs that show something else is coming  it's so easy for us to just produce that and it can be slipped on , project manager:  . project manager: And ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes marketing: which is another beauty of it . project manager: y you know , you could just go so far with it , industrial designer: You can you can just marketing: user interface: Acupressure , you could talk of acupressures . project manager: like a puffer fish , you could just , you could take it wherever , marketing: project manager: so I think that's quite a flexible thing . user interface: And finally the body should be retouchable , may maybe ch you can change the body or the case casing the case outside , project manager: Yes . user interface: it should be moulded it with the design in such a way you can change it every time . marketing: for the decisions that we've made , kinetic charging , the watch-type batteries ,  L_C_D_ display on th the top side of the flip top , rubberised buttons on the bottom side , we're gonna use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover , the case itself is plastic . That's how far we've got , what else do we have to add to our decisions here ? user interface: Fine ,  we were talking of voice recognition also marketing:  . user interface: because that we are not for how to look it  remote control if it's lost . user interface: So , are we looking at voice ? marketing: Yes , it was just , there was just a cost issue with that , but it's a good idea we just need to check on the cost , user interface: Or maybe like  William was suggesting in the last thing some devices you put on key chains . project manager: Have you user interface:  sorry I didn't mention this , but we'll be incorporating in the design . marketing: 'Cause I took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y from y your report , it's not just a case of having a little R_R_ hidden somewhere , they do want it to be obvious that it's our product project manager: Well they do , marketing: don't they ? project manager: but I think we can you could marketing: Since it's the only one of its kind on the market it's obviously gonna be ours . project manager: Obviously it'll have a logo on it just like everything , but everything else has a logo on it . The point is that it's got to stand out somehow differently but I think it does , without that marketing: Okay . Did we I know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper , I think that was you talked about a beeper for a location , have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then ? project manager: Depending on how i industrial designer: Yeah , depending on the expense of it . project manager:  we've got this memo saying that it's something that the company's looking into , so industrial designer: And they've got in stock , so yeah . project manager:  that seems to make sense , but if it turns out that it's hugely expensive we'd have to cut down somewhere else , then it's worth thinking about .  user interface: Again a questionnaire huh ? project manager: so I think we've probably got it says , closing we have forty minutes marketing: You got to go through . user interface: project manager: It's either that or we only had forty minutes to discuss what we just discussed and don't know how long that took "

        "Query": "Summarize the discussion on the TORRENT schedule, intermediate categorization, and the professor's opinion on the neural net.",
        "Summary": "The professor expressed his frustration with the constant delays in the TORRENT chip schedule. Grad F presented his proposal, focusing on the section on intermediate categories and suggesting the inclusion of features from these categories as a means of reducing error. The professor was particularly interested in understanding the impact of the neural net on older models that lacked pure features. While acknowledging the potential for improvement, he also cautioned against overusing nets.",
        "Article": "grad e: Hello ? professor a: So everybody everybody 's on ? phd d: Today 's professor a: Yeah . professor a: eh e and  I guess Chuck you weren't there either , so the  phd b: I was there . professor a: Oh you were there ? phd b: With Hynek ? professor a: Yeah . professor a: What was the w what was the downsampling problem again ? phd c: So we had professor a: I forget . phd c: So the fact that there there is no  low - pass filtering before the downsampling . phd c: There is because there is LDA filtering but that 's perhaps not  the best w m professor a: Depends what it 's frequency characteristic is , yeah . So we discussed about this , about the  professor a: Was there any conclusion about that ? phd c:  \" try it \" . So again this is th this is the downsampling  of the  the feature vector stream phd c:  . professor a: and  Yeah I guess the the  LDA filters they were doing do have   let 's see , so the the the feature vectors are calculated every ten milliseconds so  the question is how far down they are at fifty fifty hertz . Does anybody know what the frequency characteristic is ? phd c: We don't have yet professor a: Oh OK . And the third point  was the  , yeah , the on - line normalization where , well , the recursion f recursion for the mean estimation is a filter with some kind of delay professor a: Yeah . For this , the conclusion of Hynek was , well , \" we can try it but \" professor a:  - huh . professor a: Try try what ? phd c: So try to   take into account the delay of the recursion for the mean estimation . And so while discussing about these these LDA filters , some i issues appeared , like well , the fact that if we look at the frequency response of these filters it 's  , well , we don't know really what 's the important part in the frequency response and there is the fact that in the very low frequency , these filters don't don't really remove a lot .  and that 's probably a reason why , yeah , on - line normalization helps because it it , professor a: Right . Yeah , but perhaps everything could should be could be in the filter ,  the the mean normalization and Yeah . phd c: And this was this LDA  tuning perhaps and Hynek proposed again to his  TRAPS , so . phd c: Yeah , professor a:  I g I guess the key thing for me is is figuring out how to better coordinate between the two sides phd c:  . professor a:  I was talking with Hynek about it later and the the sort of had the sense sort of that that neither group of people wanted to to bother the other group too much . And and I don't think anybody is , you know , closed in in their thinking or are unwilling to talk about things but I think that you were sort of waiting for them to tell you that they had something for you and and that and expected that they would do certain things and they were sor they didn't wanna bother you phd c:   professor a: and they were sort of waiting for you and and and  we ended up with this thing where they they were filling up all of the possible latency themselves , and they just had hadn't thought of that .  it 's true that maybe maybe no one really thought about that that this latency thing would be such a a strict issue phd c: Yeah . Well professor a: in in  the other phd c: Yeah I don't know what happened really , but professor a: Yeah . Because , well , we discussed about that about this problem and they told us \" well , we will do all that 's possible to have enough space for a network \" but then , yeah , perhaps they were too short with the time and professor a: Then they couldn't . Well maybe we should just   you 're you 're bus other than that you folks are busy doing all the all the things that you 're trying that we talked about before right ? And this machines are busy and you 're busy phd c: Yeah . professor a: Let 's let 's , I think that as as we said before that one of the things that we 're imagining is that  there there will be  in the system we end up with there 'll be something to explicitly   do something about noise phd c:   professor a: in addition to the  other things that we 're talking about and that 's probably the best thing to do . And there was that one email that said that it sounded like   things looked very promising up there in terms of  I think they were using Ericsson 's approach or something and in addition to They 're doing some noise removal thing , right ? phd c: Yeah , yeah . phd c: And phd d: Yeah , I modified it well , modifying I studied Barry 's sim code , more or less . and we have some the feature for Italian database and we will try with this feature with the filter to find the result . phd d: and maybe try another type of spectral subtraction , I don't professor a: When you say you don't have a result yet you mean it 's it 's just that it 's in process or that you it finished and it didn't get a good result ? phd d: No . No , no n we have n we have do the experiment only have the feature the feature but the experiment have phd c: Yeah . So  I suggest actually now we we we sorta move on and and hear what 's what 's what 's happening in in other areas like what 's what 's happening with your investigations about echos and so on . grad f: Oh  Well  I haven't started writing the test yet , I 'm meeting with Adam today professor a:   grad f:  and he 's going t show me the scripts he has for  running recognition on mee Meeting Recorder digits . grad f:  I also  haven't got the code yet , I haven't asked Hynek for for the for his code yet . Cuz I looked at  Avendano 's thesis and I don't really understand what he 's doing yet but it it it sounded like  the channel normalization part  of his thesis  was done in a a bit of I don't know what the word is , a a bit of a rough way  it sounded like he  he he it it wasn't really fleshed out and maybe he did something that was interesting for the test situation but I I 'm not sure if it 's what I 'd wanna use so I have to I have to read it more , I don't really understand what he 's doing yet . Yeah I haven't read it in a while so I 'm not gonna be too much help unless I read it again , phd d: It 's my phd c: Oh yeah ? phd d: I know this is mine here . The  so you , and then you 're also gonna be doing this echo cancelling between the the close mounted and the and the the the what we 're calling a cheating experiment  of sorts between the distant grad f:  I I 'm ho Right . grad f: I I think he 's at least planning to do it for the cl close - mike cross - talk and so maybe I can just take whatever setup he has and use it . Yeah actually  he should  I wonder who else is I think maybe it 's Dan Ellis is going to be doing  a different cancellation . One of the things that people working in the meeting task wanna get at is they would like to have cleaner close - miked recordings . So  this is especially true for the lapel but even for the close close - miked  cases  we 'd like to be able to have  other sounds from other people and so forth removed from So when someone isn't speaking you 'd like the part where they 're not speaking to actually be So what they 're talking about doing is using ec  echo cancellation - like techniques . It 's not really echo but  just   taking the input from other mikes and using   a  an adaptive filtering approach to remove the effect of that  other speech .  what was it , there was there was some some some point where eh  Eric or somebody was was speaking and he had lots of silence in his channel and I was saying something to somebody else  which was in the background and it was not it was recognizing my words , which were the background speech on the close close mike . phd b: Yeah that was actually my I was wearing the I was wearing the lapel and you were sitting next to me , professor a: Oh you it was you I was Yeah . phd b: and I only said one thing but you were talking and it was picking up all your words . So I think I think Dan Ellis or somebody who was working with him was going to  work on that . And  I don't know if we 've talked lately about the the plans you 're developing that we talked about this morning  I don't remember if we talked about that last week or not , but maybe just a quick reprise of of what we were saying this morning . So continuing to  extend phd b: What about the stuff that  Mirjam has been doing ? And and S Shawn , yeah . professor a: But that 's   all that 's is a a certainly relevant  study and , you know , what are the features that they 're finding . professor a:  what are the variables , what we 're calling this one , what are the variables that they 're found finding useful phd c:  . professor a:  for phd b: And their their targets are based on canonical mappings of phones to acoustic f features . And that 's certainly one thing to do and we 're gonna try and do something more f more fine than that but   so  So I guess you know what , I was trying to remember some of the things we were saying , do you ha still have that ? Yeah . professor a: There 's those that  yeah , some of some of the issues we were talking about was in j just getting a good handle on on  what \" good features \" are and phd b: What does what did  Larry Saul use for it was the sonorant  detector , right ? How did he H how did he do that ? Wh - what was his detector ?   professor a: And the other thing you were talking about is is is where we get the targets from . So  , there 's these issues of what are the what are the variables that you use and do you combine them using the soft \" AND - OR \" or you do something , you know , more complicated  and then the other thing was so where do you get the targets from ? The initial thing is just the obvious that we 're discussing is starting up with phone labels from somewhere and then  doing the transformation . But then the other thing is to do something better and eh w why don't you tell us again about this this database ? This is the phd b:  ! professor a: And then tell them to talk naturally ? Yeah , yeah . professor a: Maybe you could go to these parlors and and you could , you know you know have have , you know , reduced rates if you if you can do the measurements . You could what you could do is you could sell little rings and stuff with embedded you know , transmitters in them and things professor a: Yeah . phd b:  ! There 's a bunch of data that l around , that people have done studies like that w way way back right ?  I can't remember where  Wisconsin or someplace that used to have a big database of Yeah . I remember there was this guy at A T - andT , Randolph ? or r What was his name ? Do you remember that guy ?  , researcher at A T - andT a while back that was studying , trying to do speech recognition from these kinds of features . professor a: Do you mean eh but you  Mar phd c: Well he was the guy the guy that was using professor a: you mean when was was Mark Randolph there , or ? phd b: Mark Randolph . phd c: Is it the guy that was using the pattern of pressure on the tongue or ? phd b: I can't remember exactly what he was using , now . But I know I just remember it had to do with you know  positional parameters phd c: What Yeah . So the only the only  hesitation I had about it since ,  I haven't see the data is it sounds like it 's it 's continuous variables and a bunch of them . professor a: I don't know how complicated it is to go from there What you really want are these binary labels , and just a few of them . And maybe there 's a trivial mapping if you wanna do it and it 's e but it I I I worry a little bit that this is a research project in itself , whereas  if you did something instead that like  having some manual annotation by  you know , linguistics students , this would there 'd be a limited s set of things that you could do a as per our discussions with with John before phd b:   professor a: but the things that you could do , like nasality and voicing and a couple other things you probably could do reasonably well .  the other thing you could do is boot trying to to  get those binary variables and take the continuous variables from  the   the data itself there , but I I 'm not sure phd b: Could you cluster the just do some kind of clustering ? professor a: Guess you could , yeah . So anyway that 's that 's  that 's another whole direction that cou could be looked at .  in general it 's gonna be for new data that you look at , it 's gonna be hidden variable because we 're not gonna get everybody sitting in these meetings to wear the pellets and  . phd b: So you 're talking about using that data to get  instead of using canonical mappings of phones . phd b: So you 'd use that data to give you sort of what the the true mappings are for each phone ? grad e:   So wh yeah , where this fits into the rest in in my mind , I guess , is that  we 're looking at different ways that we can combine  different kinds of of rep front - end representations  in order to get robustness under difficult or even , you know , typical conditions . And part of it , this robustness , seems to come from  multi - stream or multi - band sorts of things and Saul seems to have a reasonable way of looking at it , at least for one one  articulatory feature . The question is is can we learn from that to change some of the other methods we have , since  , one of the things that 's nice about what he had I thought was that that it it  the decision about how strongly to train the different pieces is based on  a a reasonable criterion with hidden variables rather than  just assuming that you should train e e every detector  with equal strength towards  it being this phone or that phone . It 's a soft \" AND \" , I guess but in in principle you you wanna get a strong concurrence of all the different things that indicate something and then he \" OR 's \" across the different soft \" OR 's \" across the different  multi - band channels . And  the weight yeah , the target for the training of the \" AND \" \" AND ' ed \" things is something that 's kept  as a hidden variable , and is learned with EM . Whereas what we were doing is is  taking the phone target and then just back propagating from that phd b: So he doesn't have professor a: which means that it 's it 's  i It could be for instance that for a particular point in the data you don't want to   train a particular band train the detectors for a particular band . You you wanna ignore that band , cuz that 's a Ban - band is a noisy noisy measure . professor a: And we don't We 're we 're still gonna try to train it up . In our scheme we 're gonna try to train it up to do as well well as it can at predicting . phd b: So he doesn't have to have truth marks or Ho grad e: F right , and  he doesn't have to have hard labels . professor a: Well at the at the tail end , yeah , he has to know what 's where it 's sonorant . But he 's but what he 's - but what he 's not training up  what he doesn't depend on as truth is grad e: Right . professor a:  I guess one way of describing would be if if a sound is sonorant is it sonorant in this band ? Is it sonorant in that band ? grad e: Right . professor a: Is it sonorant in that band ? i It 's hard to even answer that what you really mean is that the whole sound is sonorant . professor a: then it comes down to , you know , to what extent should you make use of information from particular band towards making your decision . And   we 're making in a sense sort of this hard decision that you should you should use everything  with with  equal strength . professor a: And  because in the ideal case we would be going for posterior probabilities , if we had  enough data to really get posterior probabilities and if the if we also had enough data so that it was representative of the test data then we would in fact be doing the right thing to train everything as hard as we can . But  this is something that 's more built up along an idea of robustness from from the beginning and so you don't necessarily want to train everything up towards the phd b: So where did he get his  his tar his  high - level targets about what 's sonorant and what 's not ? grad e: From  canonical mappings  at first phd b: OK . grad e: and then it 's unclear  eh phd b: Using TIMIT ? or using grad e: using TIMIT phd b:  - huh .  we ha we have a kind of iterative training because we do this embedded Viterbi ,  so there is some something that 's suggested , based on the data but it 's it 's not I think it s doesn't seem like it 's quite the same , cuz of this cuz then whatever that alignment is , it 's that for all all bands . professor a: Well no , that 's not quite right , we did actually do them separate tried to do them separately so that would be a little more like what he did . But it 's still not quite the same because then it 's it 's  setting targets based on where you would say the sound begins in a particular band . Might be closer I guess if we did a soft soft target   embedded neural net training like we 've done a few times  f the forward  do the forward calculations to get the gammas and train on those .  what 's next ? phd b: I could say a little bit about w stuff I 've been playing with . You 're playing ? phd b: I  Huh ? professor a: You 're playing ? phd b: Yes , I 'm playing .  so I wanted to do this experiment to see   what happens if we try to  improve the performance of the back - end recognizer for the Aurora task and see how that affects things . And so I had this  I think I sent around last week a this plan I had for an experiment , this matrix where I would take the  the original  the original system . So there 's the original system trained on the mel cepstral features and then com and then  optimize the b HTK system and run that again . So look at the difference there and then  do the same thing for the ICSI - OGI front - end . professor a: What which test set was this ? phd b: This is that I looked at ? professor a:   phd b: So as far as I 've gotten is I 've  been able to go through from beginning to end the  full HTK system for the Italian data and got the same results that  that  Stephane had . So  I started looking to and now I 'm I 'm sort of lookin at the point where I wanna know what should I change in the HTK back - end in order to try to  to improve it . One of the first things I thought of was the fact that they use the same number of states for all of the models professor a:   phd b: and so I went on - line and I  found a pronunciation dictionary for Italian digits professor a:   phd b: and just looked at , you know , the number of phones in each one of the digits .  you know , sort of the canonical way of setting up a an  system is that you use  three states per phone and  so then the the total number of states for a word would just be , you know , the number of phones times three . And so when I did that for the Italian digits , I got a number of states , ranging on the low end from nine to the high end , eighteen . Now you have to really add two to that because in HTK there 's an initial null and a final null so when they use  models that have eighteen states , there 're really sixteen states . And so  their guess of eighteen states seems to be pretty well matched to the two longest words of the Italian digits , the four and five which  , according to my , you know , sort of off the cuff calculation , should have eighteen states each . So my guess  And then if you I I printed out a confusion matrix   for the well - matched case , and it turns out that the longest words are actually the ones that do the best . So my guess about what 's happening is that you know , if you assume a fixed the same amount of training data for each of these digits and a fixed length model for all of them but the actual words for some of them are half as long you really  have , you know , half as much training data for those models . Because if you have a long word and you 're training it to eighteen states ,  you 've got you know , you 've got the same number of Gaussians , you 've gotta train in each case , professor a:   phd b: but for the shorter words , you know , the total number of frames is actually half as many . phd b: So it could be that , you know , for the short words there 's because you have so many states , you just don't have enough data to train all those Gaussians . So  I 'm going to try to  create more word - specific   prototype H M Ms to start training from . professor a: Yeah , it 's not at all uncommon you do worse on long word on short words than long words anyway just because you 're accumulating more evidence for the for the longer word , phd b:   phd b: Yeah so I 'll I 'll , the next experiment I 'm gonna try is to just  you know create  models that seem to be more w matched to my guess about how long they should be . phd b: And as part of that  I wanted to see sort of how the  how these models were coming out , you know , what w when we train up  th you know , the model for \" one \" , which wants to have nine states , you know , what is the  what do the transition probabilities look like in the self - loops , look like in in those models ? And so I talked to Andreas and he explained to me how you can calculate the expected duration of an  just by looking at the transition matrix professor a:   phd b: and so I wrote a little Matlab script that calculates that and so I 'm gonna sort of print those out for each of the words to see what 's happening , you know , how these models are training up , professor a:   I d I did quickly , I did the silence model and and  that 's coming out with about one point two seconds as its average duration and the silence model 's the one that 's used at the beginning and the end of each of the string of digits . And so the S P model , which is what they put in between digits , I I haven't calculated that for that one yet , but  . So they basically their their model for a whole digit string is silence digit , SP , digit , SP blah - blah - blah and then silence at the end . professor a: Are the SP 's optional ?  skip them ? phd b: I have to look at that , but I 'm not sure that they are . Now the one thing about the S P model is really it only has a single s emitting state to it . phd b: So if it 's not optional , you know , it 's it 's not gonna hurt a whole lot professor a: I see . phd b: and it 's tied to the center state of the silence model so it 's not its own  It doesn't require its own training data , professor a:   phd b: So it , it 's pretty good the way that they have it set up , but  i So I wanna play with that a little bit more . I 'm curious about looking at , you know how these models have trained and looking at the expected durations of the models and I wanna compare that in the the well - matched case f to the unmatched case , and see if you can get an idea of just from looking at the durations of these models , you know , what what 's happening . professor a: Yeah , I think that  , as much as you can , it 's good to d sort of not do anything really tricky . professor a: Not do anything that 's really finely tuned , but just sort of eh you know you t you i z phd b: Yeah . professor a: The premise is kind of you have a a good person look at this for a few weeks and what do you come up with ? phd b:   professor a: And  phd b: And Hynek , when I wa told him about this , he had an interesting point , and that was th  the the final models that they end up training up have I think probably something on the order of six Gaussians per state . And Hynek was saying that well , probably in a real application , you wouldn't have enough compute to handle models that are very big or complicated . But you know , it depends on what the actual application is and it 's really hard to know what your limits are in terms of how many Gaussians you can have . professor a: I I I what I thought you were gonna say i but which I was thinking was  where did six come from ? Probably came from the same place eighteen came from . professor a:  that 's another parameter , right ? that that maybe , you know ,  you really want three or nine or phd b: Yeah , yeah . Well one thing  , if I if if I start  reducing the number of states for some of these shorter models that 's gonna reduce the total number of Gaussians . professor a: how much better can you make it ? And  since they 're only simple things there 's nothing that you 're gonna do that is going to blow up the amount of computation phd b:   professor a: if you found that nine was better than six that would be O K , I think , actually . I really wasn't even gonna play with that part of the system yet , professor a:  -  , OK . phd b: I was just gonna change the the t professor a: Yeah , just work with the models , yeah . So  what 's  I guess your plan for You you you guys ' plan for the next next week is just continue on these these same things we 've been talking about for Aurora and phd c: Yeah , I guess we can try to have some kind of new baseline for next week perhaps . And then do other things , play with the spectral subtraction , and retry the MSG and things like that . I think that after all of this   confusion settles down in another some point a little later next year there will be some sort of standard and it 'll get out there and hopefully it 'll have some effect from something that that has  been done by our group of people but  e even if it doesn't there 's there 's go there 'll be standards after that . phd b: Does anybody know how to  run Matlab sort of in batch mode like you c send it s a bunch of commands to run and it gives you the output . Is it possible to do that ? grad e: I I think  Mike tried it phd b: Yeah ? grad e: and he says it 's impossible so he went to Octave . phd c: What is Octave so ? It 's a free software ? grad e: What 's that ?  , Octave ? phd c: Yeah . phd c: And it does the same syntax and everything eh like Matlab , or ? grad e:  i it 's a little behind , it 's the same syntax but it 's a little behind in that Matlab went to these like  you can have cells and you can you can  implement object - oriented type things with Matlab .  Octave doesn't do that yet , so I think you , Octave is kinda like Matlab  four point something or . phd b: If it 'll do like a lot of the basic matrix and vector stuff grad e: The basic stuff , right <doc-sep>phd a: And what was that , Morgan ? What project ? professor b: the , TORRENT chip . professor b: we went through it Jim and I went through old emails at one point and and for two years there was this thing saying , yeah , we 're we 're two months away from being done . phd a: So , should we just do the same kind of deal where we go around and do , status report kind of things ? OK . phd a: Any objection ? Do y OK , M professor b: All in favor phd a: Do you want to start , Morgan ? Do you have anything , or ? professor b: I don't do anything . I No , I I 'm involved in discussions with with people about what they 're doing , but I think they 're since they 're here , they can talk about it themselves . Why don't you go ahead , Barry ? grad f: you 're gonna talk about Aurora stuff , per se ? phd a: OK . Well , this past week I 've just been , getting down and dirty into writing my my proposal . I just finished a section on ,  on talking about these intermediate categories that I want to classify , as a as a middle step . And , I hope to hope to get this ,  a full rough draft done by , Monday so I can give it to Morgan . phd a: So , is the idea you 're going to do this paper and then you pass it out to everybody ahead of time and ? grad f: Right , right . So , y you write up a proposal , and give it to people ahead of time , and you have a short presentation . phd a: Have you d ? I was just gonna ask , do you want to say any a little bit about it , grad f: Y s phd a: or ? Mmm .  , a little bit about ? phd a: Wh - what you 're what you 're gonna You said you were talking about the , particular features that you were looking at , grad f: Oh , the the phd a: or grad f: Right . Well , I was , I think one of the perplexing problems is , for a while I was thinking that I had to come up with a complete set of intermediate features in intermediate categories to to classify right away .  , build a system that , classifies these ,  these feat  , these intermediate categories using , multi - band techniques . Look at then I would look at the errors produced in the phoneme recognition and say , OK , well , I could probably reduce the errors if I included this extra feature or this extra intermediate category . phd a: So you 're gonna use TIMIT ? grad f: for that for that part of the the process , yeah , I would use TIMIT . grad f: that 's that 's ,  that 's just the ph the phone recognition task . So , I would mov I would then shift the focus to , something like Schw - Switchboard , where I 'd I would be able to ,  to model , intermediate categories that span across phonemes , phd a:   grad f: not just within the phonemes , themselves , and then do the same process there , on on a large vocabulary task like Switchboard .  , and for that for that part I would I 'd use the SRI recognizer since it 's already set up for for Switchboard . phd a: It 's about a month from now ? grad f: It 's a it 's a month and and a week . phd a: So , you want to go next , Dave ? And we 'll do grad e: Oh . And , we we got an improvement , in word error rate , training on the TI - digits data set and testing on Meeting Recorder digits of , six percent to four point five percent , on the n on the far - mike data using PZM F , but , the near - mike performance worsened , from one point two percent to two point four percent . And , wh why would that be , considering that we actually got an improvement in near - mike performance using HTK ? And so , with some input from , Andreas , I have a theory in two parts .  , first of all HTK sorry , SR - the SRI system is doing channel adaptation , and so HTK wasn't .  , so this ,  This mean subtraction approach will do a kind of channel normalization and so that might have given the HTK use of it a boost that wouldn't have been applied in the SRI case . So those finer - grained acoustic models could be more sensitive to the artifacts in the re - synthesized audio . And me and Barry were listening to the re - synthesized audio and sometimes it seems like you get of a bit of an echo of speech in the background . And so that seems like it could be difficult for training , cuz you could have different phones lined up with a different foreground phone , depending on the timing of the echo . So , I 'm gonna try training on a larger data set , and then , eh , the system will have seen more examples o of these artifacts and hopefully will be more robust to them . professor b: I had another thought just now , which is , remember we were talking before about we were talking in our meeting about , this stuff that some of the other stuff that Avendano did , where they were , getting rid of low - energy sections ?  , if you if you did a high - pass filtering , as Hirsch did in late eighties to reduce some of the effects of reverberation , Avendano and Hermansky were arguing that , perhaps one of the reasons for that working was ma may not have even been the filtering so much but the fact that when you filter a an all - positive power spectrum you get some negative values , and you gotta figure out what to do with them if you 're gonna continue treating this as a power spectrum . So if you imagine a a waveform that 's all positive , which is the time trajectory of energy , and , shifting it downwards , and then getting rid of the negative parts , that 's essentially throwing away the low - energy things . And it 's the low - energy parts of the speech where the reverberation is most audible . You know , you have the reverberation from higher - energy things showing up in So in this case you have some artificially imposed reverberation - like thing .  , you 're getting rid of some of the other effects of reverberation , but because you have these non - causal windows , you 're getting these funny things coming in , at n And , what if you did ?  , there 's nothing to say that the the processing for this re - synthesis has to be restricted to trying to get it back to the original , according to some equation . professor b: And one of the things you could do is , you could do some sort of VAD - like thing grad e:   professor b: and you actually could take very low - energy sections and set them to some some , very low or or near zero value .  , I 'm just saying if in fact it turns out that that these echoes that you 're hearing are ,  grad e:  - huh . professor b: or pre - echoes , whichever they are are are , part of what 's causing the problem , you actually could get rid of them . professor b: so that if you made a mistake you were more likely to keep in an echo than to throw out speech . phd g: what is the reverberation time like there ? grad e: In thi in this room ?  phd g: On , the the one what the s in the speech that you are you are using like ? grad e: Y Yeah . professor b: so it 's these are just microphone this micro close microphone and a distant microphone , he 's doing these different tests on . I think it 's I would guess , point seven , point eight seconds f  , R T grad f:  ! professor b: something like that ? But it 's you know , it 's this room . But the other thing is , he 's putting in w I was using the word \" reverberation \" in two ways . He 's also putting in , a he 's taking out some reverberation , but he 's putting in something , because he has averages over multiple windows stretching out to twelve seconds , which are then being subtracted from the speech . And since , you know , what you subtract , sometimes you 'll be you 'll be subtracting from some larger number and sometimes you won't . professor b: So you can end up with some components in it that are affected by things that are seconds away .  , and if it 's a low energy compo portion , you might actually hear some funny things . grad e: O o one thing , I noticed is that , the mean subtraction seems to make the PZM signals louder after they 've been re - synthesized . So I was wondering , is it possible that one reason it helped with the Aurora baseline system is just as a kind of gain control ? Cuz some of the PZM signals sound pretty quiet if you don't amplify them . I don't see why why your signal is louder after processing , because yo grad e: Yeah . professor b: I don't think just multiplying the signal by two would have any effect .  , I think if you really have louder signals , what you mean is that you have better signal - to - noise ratio . phd c: Well , well professor b: So if what you 're doing is improving the signal - to - noise ratio , then it would be better . professor b: But just it being bigger if with the same signal - to - noise ratio grad e: It w i i it wouldn't affect things . phd c: Well , the system is use the absolute energy , so it 's a little bit dependent on on the signal level . professor b: So if the if the if you change in both training and test , the absolute level by a factor of two , it will n have no effect . phd a: Did you add this data to the training set , for the Aurora ? Or you just tested on this ? grad e:   . Did I w what ? phd a: Well , Morgan was just saying that , as long as you do it in both training and testing , it shouldn't have any effect . But I didn't I 'm not sure if it made the clean ti TI - digits any louder . If it 's if it 's like , if it 's trying to find a a reverberation filter , it could be that this reverberation filter is making things quieter .  , there 's there 's nothing inherent about removing if you 're really removing , grad e: Nuh - huh . phd a: I wonder if there could be something like ,  for s for the PZM data , phd c: Eh phd a: you know , if occasionally , somebody hits the table or something , you could get a spike . I 'm just wondering if there 's something about the ,  you know , doing the mean normalization where , it it could cause you to have better signal - to - noise ratio . It it i maybe i If ,  Subtracting the the mean log spectrum is is is like dividing by the spectrum . So , depending what you divide by , if your if s your estimate is off and sometimes you 're you 're you 're getting a small number , you could make it bigger . professor b: So , it 's it 's just a a question of there 's It it could be that there 's some normalization that 's missing , or something to make it grad e:   professor b: y you 'd think it shouldn't be larger , but maybe in practice it is . So , you trained it on TI - digits ? But except this , it 's exactly the same system as the one that was tested before and that was trained on Macrophone . Right ? So on TI - digits it gives you one point two percent error rate and on Macrophone it 's still O point eight . grad e: If you 're talking about the Macrophone results that Andreas had about , a week and a half ago , I think it 's the same system . So you use VTL -  , vocal tract length normalization and , like MLLR transformations also , grad e:   phd c: and professor b: I 'm sorry , was his point eight percent , er , a a result on testing on Macrophone or or training ? phd c: all that stuff . grad e: That 's phd c: It was training on Macrophone and testing yeah , on on meeting digits . I I 've just been text testing the new Aurora front - end with well , Aurora system actually so front - end and HTK , acoustic models on the meeting digits and it 's a little bit better than the previous system . professor b: So , what w ? phd c: And phd g: With the with the HTK back - end ? What we have for Aurora ? phd c: Yeah . phd g: I know in the meeting , like phd c: On the meeting we have two point seven . phd c: we have the new LDA filters , and I think , maybe I didn't look , but one thing that makes a difference is this DC offset compensation .  , eh Do y did you have a look at at the meet  , meeting digits , if they have a DC component , or ? grad e: I I didn't .  , any all of the mikes have the DC removal some capacitor sitting right in that bias it . professor b: typi you know , unless Actually , there are instrumentation mikes that that do pass go down to DC . And you can get , I think it was I think it was in the Wall Street Journal data that that I can't remember , one of the DARPA things . professor b: we didn't we didn't know about for a while , while we were messing with it . And , the interesting thing that I tried was , Adam and Morgan had this idea , since my original attempts to , take the mean of the phase spectra over time and normalize using that , by subtracting that off , didn't work .  , so , well , that we thought that might be due to , problems with , the arithmetic of phases . They they add in this modulo two pi way and , there 's reason to believe that that approach of taking the mean of the phase spectrum wasn't really mathematically correct . So , what I did instead is I took the mean of the FFT spectrum without taking the log or anything , and then I took the phase of that , and I subtracted that phase off to normalize . professor b: You see , all he has to do is go back and reverse what he did before , and he 's really got something . phd a: Well , could you take what was left over and then subtract that ? professor b: Ex - exactly . phd g: Oh , it 's professor b: Just listen very carefully to what I say and do the opposite . I 'm more interested in trying to figure out what 's still the difference between the SRI system and the Aurora system . So , I think I will maybe train , like , gender - dependent models , because this is also one big difference between the two systems .  , the other differences were the fact that maybe the acoustic models of the SRI are more SRI system are more complex . But , Chuck , you did some experiments with this and phd a: It didn't seem to help in the HTK system . professor b: Well , it sounds like they also have he he 's saying they have all these , different kinds of adaptation . phd a: Like they do ,  I 'm not sure how they would do it when they 're working with the digits , phd c: The vocal tr phd a: but , like , in the Switchboard data , there 's ,  conversation - side normalization for the non - C - zero components , phd c: Yeah . phd c: So , it might be it might be better with it might be worse if the channel is constant , phd a: Yeah . phd g: And the acoustic models are like - k triphone models or or is it the whole word ? phd c: SRI it 's it 's tr grad f: SRI . So there 's there 's these kind of , pooled models and and they can go out to all sorts of dependencies . professor b: They have tied states and I think I I I don't real I 'm talk I 'm just guessing here . And maybe see with Andreas if Well , I I don't know how much it helps , what 's the model . phd a: So so the n stuff on the numbers you got , the two point seven , is that using the same training data that the SRI system used and got one point two ? phd c: That 's right . grad e: You know , the the Aurora baseline is set up with these ,  this version of the clean training set that 's been filtered with this G - seven - one - two filter , and , to train the SRI system on digits S - Andreas used the original TI - digits , under U doctor - speech data TI - digits , which don't have this filter . professor b: So is that ?  , are are these results comparable ? So you you were getting with the , Aurora baseline something like two point four percent on clean TI - digits , when , training the SRI system with clean TR digits TI - digits . And , so , is your two point seven comparable , where you 're , using , the submitted system ? phd c: Yeah . grad e: W w it was one one point two phd c: Ye grad e: with the SRI system , professor b: I 'm sorry . professor b: OK , so the comparable number then ,  for what you were talking about then , since it was HTK , would be the  , two point f phd c: It was four point something . Right ? The HTK system with , b grad e: D d professor b: Oh , right , right , right , right . phd c: MFCC features grad e: Do you mean the b ? The baseline Aurora - two system , trained on TI - digits , tested on Meeting Recorder near , I think we saw in it today , and it was about six point six percent . And another thing I I maybe would like to do is to just test the SRI system that 's trained on Macrophone test it on , the noisy TI - digits , professor b: Yeah . But I wonder if it 's just because maybe Macrophone is acoustically closer to the meeting digits than than TI - digit is , which is TI - digits are very clean recorded digits professor b:   phd c: and phd a: You know , it would also be interesting to see ,  to do the regular Aurora test , phd c: f s phd a: but use the SRI system instead of HTK . phd c: So we don't professor b: You 'd have to train the SRI system with with all the different languages . phd a: So , like , comple professor b: It 'd be a lot of work . phd a: I guess the work would be into getting the the files in the right formats , or something . phd a: Because when you train up the Aurora system , you 're ,  you 're also training on all the data . professor b: That 's true , but I think that also when we 've had these meetings week after week , oftentimes people have not done the full arrange of things phd a:   professor b: because on on whatever it is they 're trying , because it 's a lot of work , even just with the HTK . professor b: So , it 's it 's a good idea , but it seems like it makes sense to do some pruning phd a:   professor b: first with a a test or two that makes sense for you , phd a: Yeah . But , just testing on TI - digits would already give us some information about what 's going on .  , the next thing is this this VAD problem that ,  So , I 'm just talking about the the curves that I I sent I sent you so , whi that shows that when the SNR decrease , the current VAD approach doesn't drop much frames for some particular noises , which might be then noises that are closer to speech , acoustically . I They were supp Supposedly , in the next evaluation , they 're going to be supplying us with boundaries . First of all , the boundaries might be ,  like we would have t two hundred milliseconds or before and after speech . professor b: Do we ?  , is there some reason that we think that 's the case ? phd c: And No . professor b: But maybe we 'll get some insight on that when when , the gang gets back from Crete . professor b: And then the thing is if if they really are going to have some means of giving us fairly tight , boundaries , then that won't be so much the issue . phd g: Because w we were wondering whether that VAD is going to be , like , a realistic one or is it going to be some manual segmentation . And then , like , if if that VAD is going to be a realistic one , then we can actually use their markers to shift the point around , the way we want professor b:   phd g: to find a  , rather than keeping the twenty frames , we can actually move the marker to a point which we find more suitable for us . phd g: But if that is going to be something like a manual , segmenter , then we can't use that information anymore , phd c:   phd g: because that 's not going to be the one that is used in the final evaluation . There 's an  , I think it 's still for even for the evaluation , it might still be interesting to work on this because the boundaries apparently that they would provide is just , starting of speech and end of speech  , at the utterance level . phd c: So phd g: with some pauses in the center , provided they meet that whatever the hang - over time which they are talking . professor b: So if you could get at some of that ,  phd c: So professor b: although that 'd be hard . It might be useful for , like , noise estimation , and a lot of other things that we want to work on . So I did I just started to test putting together two VAD which was was not much work actually .  , I im re - implemented a VAD that 's very close to the , energy - based VAD that , the other Aurora guys use . phd c: and , detect detecting the first group of four frames that have a energy that 's above this threshold , and , from this point , tagging the frames there as speech . And it really removes it , still o on the noises where our MLP VAD doesn't work a lot . phd c: professor b: Cuz I would have thought that having some kind of spectral information , phd c: and professor b: you know , in the old days people would use energy and zero crossings , for instance  , would give you some better performance . Right ? Cuz you might have low - energy fricatives or or ,  stop consonants , or something like that . So , your point is will be to u use whatever professor b: Oh , that if you d if you use purely energy and don't look at anything spectral , then you don't have a good way of distinguishing between low - energy speech components and nonspeech . professor b: just as a gross generalization , most nonsp many nonspeech noises have a low - pass kind of characteristic , some sort of slope . And and most , low - energy speech components that are unvoiced have a a high - pass kind of characteristic phd c:   professor b: you know , at the beginning of a of a of an S sound for instance , just starting in , it might be pretty low - energy , phd c:   Whereas , a a lot of rumble , and background noises , and so forth will be predominantly low - frequency .  , you know , by itself it 's not enough to tell you , but it plus energy is sort of phd c: Yeah . professor b: if you look up in Rabiner and Schafer from like twenty - five years ago or something , that 's sort of what they were using then . It it might be that what I did is so , removes like low ,  low - energy , speech frames . Because the way I do it is I just I just combine the two decisions so , the one from the MLP and the one from the energy - based with the with the and operator . So if the energy - based dropped dropped low - energy speech , mmm , they they are they are lost . phd c: But s still , the way it 's done right now it it helps on on the noises where it seems to help on the noises where our VAD was not very good . But but , I guess what you 're saying is that the the MLP - based one has the spectral information . professor b: Well , you can imagine phd c: The way I use a an a \" AND \" operator is So , it I ,  professor b: Is ? phd c: The frames that are dropped by the energy - based system are are , dropped , even if the , MLP decides to keep them . phd a: No professor b: but  , I guess in principle what you 'd want to do is have a  , a probability estimated by each one and and put them together . phd a: Something that that I 've used in the past is ,  when just looking at the energy , is to look at the derivative . phd a: But , I 'm I 'm trying to remember if that requires that you keep some amount of speech in a buffer . phd c: Well , actually if I don't maybe don't want to work too much of on it right now . I just wanted to to see if it 's what I observed was the re was caused by this this VAD problem .  , which I 've just started yesterday to launch a bunch of , twenty - five experiments , with different , values for the parameters that are used . So , it 's the Makhoul - type spectral subtraction which use an over - estimation factor . So , we substr I subtract more , noise than the noise spectra that is estimated on the noise portion of the s  , the utterances . And after subtraction , I also add a constant noise , and I also try different , noise , values and we 'll see what happen . But st still when we look at the ,  Well , it depends on the parameters that you use , but for moderate over - estimation factors and moderate noise level that you add , you st have a lot of musical noise . On the other hand , when you subtract more and when you add more noise , you get rid of this musical noise but maybe you distort a lot of speech . So the next thing , maybe I what I will try to to do is just to try to smooth mmm , the ,  to smooth the d the result of the subtraction , to get rid of the musical noise , using some kind of filter , or phd g: Can smooth the SNR estimate , also . So , to get something that 's would be closer to what you tried to do with Wiener filtering . phd c: It phd g: And it 's phd c: Maybe you can phd g: go ahead . And there are there were some bugs in the program , so I was p initially trying to clear them up . Because one of the bug was I was assuming that always the VAD  , the initial frames were silence . So the it wasn't estimating the noise initially , and then it never estimated , because I assumed that it was always silence . phd c: So , in some cases s there are also phd g: SpeechDat - Car Italian . And , so once it was cleared , I ran a few experiments with different ways of smoothing the estimated clean speech and how t estimated the noise and , eh , smoothing the SNR also . And so the the trend seems to be like , smoothing the current estimate of the clean speech for deriving the SNR , which is like deriving the Wiener filter , seems to be helping . So we 'll have , like , a few results where the estimating the the More smoothing is helping . And , so I 'm I 'm trying a few more experiments with different time constants for smoothing the noise spectrum , and smoothing the clean speech , and smoothing SNR . So , one is fixed in the line , like Smoothing the clean speech is is helping , so I 'm not going to change it that much . But , the way I 'm estimating the noise and the way I 'm estimating the SNR , I 'm just trying trying a little bit . So , that h And the other thing is , like , putting a floor on the , SNR , because that if some In some cases the clean speech is , like when it 's estimated , it goes to very low values , so the SNR is , like , very low . So , I 'm thinking of , like , putting a floor also for the SNR so that it doesn't vary a lot in the low - energy regions . The results are , like So far I 've been testing only with the baseline , which is which doesn't have any LDA filtering and on - line normalization . So it 's just VAD , plus the Wiener filter , plus the baseline system , which is , just the spectral  , the mel sp mel , frequency coefficients . And the other thing that I tried was but I just took of those , Carlos filters , which Hynek had , to see whether it really h helps or not . And it 's it seems to be like it 's not hurting a lot by just blindly picking up one filter which is nothing but a four hertz a band - pass m m filter on the cubic root of the power spectrum . So there must be something that I can that can be done with that type of noise compensation also , which I guess I would ask Carlos about that .  , how how he derived those filters and and where d if he has any filters which are derived on OGI stories , added with some type of noise which what we are using currently , or something like that . So maybe I 'll professor b: This is cubic root of power spectra ? phd g: Yeah . professor b: So , if you have this band - pass filter , you probably get n you get negative values . phd g: So it has , like the spectrogram has , like  , it actually , enhances the onset and offset of  , the the begin and the end of the speech . So it 's there seems to be , like , deep valleys in the begin and the end of , like , high - energy regions , professor b:   phd g: So , those are the regions where there are , like when I look at the spectrogram , there are those deep valleys on the begin and the end of the speech . There are a few very not a lot of because the filter doesn't have a really a deep negative portion , so that it 's not really creating a lot of negative values in the cubic root . So , I 'll I 'll s may continue with that for some w I 'll I 'll Maybe I 'll ask Carlos a little more about how to play with those filters , and but while making this Wiener filter better . professor b: last week you were also talking about building up the subspace stuff ? phd g: Yeah . I I I would actually m m didn't get enough time to work on the subspace last week . phd a: How about you , Carmen ? phd d: Well , I am still working with , eh , VTS . And , one of the things that last week , eh , say here is that maybe the problem was with the diff because the signal have different level of energy . professor b:  ? phd d: And , maybe , talking with Stephane and with Sunil , we decide that maybe it was interesting to to apply on - line normalization before applying VTS . But then we decided that that 's it doesn't work absolutely , because we modified also the noise . I don't hav I don't this is I didn't do the experiment yet to apply VTS in cepstral domain . professor b: The other thing is So so , in i i and Not and C - zero would be a different So you could do a different normalization for C - zero than for other things anyway .  , the other thing I was gonna suggest is that you could have two kinds of normalization with with , different time constants . So , you could do some normalization s  , before the VTS , and then do some other normalization after . phd d: Well , we s decide to m to to obtain the new expression if we work in the cepstral domain . It 's k it 's k It 's quite a lot It 's a lot of work . phd d: And I want to know if if we have some feeling that the result I I would like to know if I don't have any feeling if this will work better than apply VTS aft in cepstral domain will work better than apply in m mel in filter bank domain . Well , you 're I think you 're the first one here to work with VTS , so , maybe we could call someone else up who has , ask them their opinion . phd c: Actually , the VTS that you tested before was in the log domain and so the codebook is e e kind of dependent on the level of the speech signal . phd d: Yeah ? phd c: And So I expect it If if you have something that 's independent of this , I expect it to it to , be a better model of speech . And then you have one number which is very dependent on the level cuz it is the level , phd d:   phd d: Ye phd c: Because it 's like first doing general normalization phd d: Yea phd c: and then noise removal , which is phd d: Yeah . We I was thinking to to to estimate the noise with the first frames and then apply the VAD , professor b:   phd d: We we see Well , I am thinking about that and working about that , professor b: Yeah .  , one of the things we 've talked about maybe it might be star time to start thinking about pretty soon , is as we look at the pros and cons of these different methods , how do they fit in with one another ? Because we 've talked about potentially doing some combination of a couple of them . Maybe maybe pretty soon we 'll have some sense of what their characteristics are , phd d:  -  <doc-sep>OK , so , you 've got some , Xerox things to pass out ? phd a: Yeah , professor d: That are phd a:  .  , lowering the word hour rate is fine , but having big font ! phd a: Next time we will put colors or something . phd a: OK , s so there is kind of summary of what has been done professor d:  Go ahead . So since last week we 've started to fill the column with   features w with nets trained on PLP with on - line normalization but with delta also , because the column was not completely professor d:    phd a: well , it 's still not completely filled , professor d:  phd a: but we have more results to compare with network using without PLP and finally , hhh ,  ehhh PL -  delta seems very important . If you take  , let 's say , anyway Aurora - two - B , so , the next t the second , part of the table , professor d:   phd a:  when we use the large training set using French , Spanish , and English , you have one hundred and six without delta and eighty - nine with the delta . professor d: a And again all of these numbers are with a hundred percent being , the baseline performance , phd a: Yeah , on the baseline , yeah . So professor d: but with a mel cepstra system going straight into the HTK ? phd a: Yeah . So now we see that the gap between the different training set is much   much smaller professor d: Yes . phd a: But , actually , for English training on TIMIT is still better than the other languages . If you take the second set of experiment for Italian , so , the mismatched condition , professor d:   phd a:  when we use the training on TIMIT so , it 's multi - English , we have a ninety - one number , professor d:   phd a: And , yeah , and here the gap is still more important between using delta and not using delta . If y if I take the training s the large training set , it 's we have one hundred and seventy - two , professor d: Yes . Yeah , so the second point is that we have no single cross - language experiments , that we did not have last week .  , so this is training the net on French only , or on English only , and testing on Italian . phd a: And training the net on French only and Spanish only and testing on ,  TI - digits . What we see is that these nets are not as good , except for the multi - English , which is always one of the best . Yeah , then we started to work on a large dat database containing , sentences from the French , from the Spanish , from the TIMIT , from SPINE ,  from  English digits , and from Italian digits . phd a: and  , actually we did this before knowing the result of all the data , so we have to to redo the  the experiment training the net with ,  PLP , but with delta . Well , it 's it 's better than the net using French , Spanish , and English only . The first one , yeah , is combining , two feature streams ,  using and each feature stream has its own MPL . And the third one is to u use a single KLT trans transform features as well as MLP outputs . You know you can you can comment these results , phd b: Yes , I can s I would like to say that , for example , mmm , if we doesn't use the delta - delta ,  we have an improve when we use s some combination . But when phd a: Yeah , we ju just to be clear , the numbers here are  recognition accuracy . phd b: w Yeah , this Yeah , this number recognition acc phd a: So it 's not the Again we switch to another phd b: Yes , and the baseline the baseline have i is eighty - two . phd b: Yeah phd a: So it 's experiment only on the Italian mismatched for the moment for this . phd b: And first in the experiment - one I I do I I use different MLP , professor d:   And I try to combine different type of feature , but the result is that the MSG - three feature doesn't work for the Italian database because never help to increase the accuracy . phd a: Yeah , eh , actually , if w we look at the table , the huge table , we see that for TI - digits MSG perform as well as the PLP , professor d:   phd a: but this is not the case for Italian what where the error rate is c is almost  twice the error rate of PLP . phd a: So , well , I don't think this is a bug but this this is something in probably in the MSG  process that  I don't know what exactly . Perhaps the fact that the the there 's no low - pass filter , well , or no pre - emp pre - emphasis filter and that there is some DC offset in the Italian , or , well , something simple like that . But that we need to sort out if want to  get improvement by combining PLP and MSG professor d:   phd a: And as Carmen said , if we combine the two , we have the result , basically , of PLP . professor d: I  , the  , baseline system when you said the baseline system was  ,  eighty - two percent , that was trained on what and tested on what ? That was ,  Italian mismatched d  , digits , is the testing , phd b: Yeah . professor d: So the \" mismatch \" just refers to the noise and and ,  microphone and so forth , phd a: Yeah . professor d: right ? So ,  did we have So would that then correspond to the first line here of where the training is is the  Italian digits ? phd b: The train the training of the HTK ? professor d: The phd b: Yes . So ,  So what that says is that in a matched condition , we end up with a fair amount worse putting in the  PLP . Now w would do we have a number , I suppose for the matched I I don't mean matched , but  use of Italian training in Italian digits for PLP only ? phd b:  yes ? phd a:  yeah , so this is basically this is in the table . phd a: Fift - So No , it 's it 's the phd b: No . professor d: No , fifty - two percent of eighty - two ? phd a: Of of of  eighteen phd b: Eighty . So  professor d: Oh this is accuracy !  phd a: so we have nine nine let 's say ninety percent . professor d: OK , so even just PLP , it is not , in the matched condition  I wonder if it 's a difference between PLP and mel cepstra , or whether it 's that the net half , for some reason , is not helping . It 's not Do you have this result with PLP alone , j fee feeding HTK ? professor d: So , s phd a: That That 's what you mean ? phd b: Yeah , phd a: Just PLP at the input of HTK . professor d: so adding MSG phd a:  professor d:  Well , but that 's yeah , that 's without the neural net , phd a: Yeah , that 's without the neural net professor d: right ? phd a: and that 's the result basically that OGI has also with the MFCC with on - line normalization . phd b:  phd a: Eighty - two is the it 's the Aurora baseline , so MFCC . Then we can use well , OGI , they use MFCC th the baseline MFCC plus on - line normalization professor d: Oh , I 'm sorry , I k I keep getting confused because this is accuracy . phd a: So what happ what happens is that when we apply on - line normalization we jump to almost ninety percent . If we use n neural network , even if the features are not correctly normalized , we jump to ninety percent . So professor d: So we go from eighty - si eighty - eight point six to to ninety , or something . phd a: Well , ninety No , I  ninety It 's around eighty - nine , ninety , eighty - eight . So ,  So actually , the answer for experiments with one is that adding MSG , if you  does not help in that case . professor d: The other ones , we 'd have to look at it , but And the multi - English , does  So if we think of this in error rates , we start off with ,  eighteen percent error rate , roughly . professor d:  and we  almost ,  cut that in half by  putting in the on - line normalization and the neural net . About ,  sixteen percent or something of the error , if we use multi - English instead of the matching condition . OK ? So then you 're assuming multi - English is closer to the kind of thing that you could use since you 're not gonna have matching , data for the  for the new for the other languages and so forth .  , one qu thing is that ,  I think I asked you this before , but I wanna double check . When you say \" ME \" in these other tests , that 's the multi - English , phd a: That 's it 's a part it 's professor d: but it is not all of the multi - English , right ? It is some piece of part of it . professor d: And the multi - English is how much ? phd b: You have here the information . professor d: Oh , so you used almost all You used two thirds of it , phd a: Yeah . So , it it 's still it hurts you seems to hurt you a fair amount to add in this French and Spanish . grad c: Well Stephane was saying that they weren't hand - labeled , phd a: Yeah , it 's phd b: Yeah . Mmm , with the experiment type - two , I first I tried to to combine , nnn , some feature from the MLP and other feature another feature . phd b: And we s we can first the feature are without delta and delta - delta , and we can see that in the situation , the MSG - three , the same help nothing . phd b: And then I do the same but with the delta and delta - delta PLP delta and delta - delta . And they all p but they all put off the MLP is it without delta and delta - delta . And we have a l little bit less result than the the the baseline PLP with delta and delta - delta . phd b: Maybe if when we have the new the new neural network trained with PLP delta and delta - delta , maybe the final result must be better . phd a: Actually , just to be some more phd b:  phd a: Do This number , this eighty - seven point one number , has to be compared with the professor d: Yes , yeah ,  it can't be compared with the other phd a: Which number ? professor d: cuz this is ,  with multi - English , training . professor d: So you have to compare it with the one over that you 've got in a box , which is that ,  the eighty - four point six . professor d: So phd a: Yeah , but  in this case for the eighty - seven point one we used MLP outputs for the PLP net professor d: Yeah . phd b: No , but they they feature @ @ without phd a: So we use feature out  , net outputs together with features . So yeah , this is not perhaps not clear here but in this table , the first column is for MLP and the second for the features . So you 're saying w so asking the question , \" What what has adding the MLP done to improve over the , phd a: So , just Yeah so , actually it it it decreased the the accuracy . phd a: And even the MLP alone What gives the MLP alone ? Multi - English PLP . So we have our eighty - three point six and now eighty - eighty point six , phd b: But phd a: that gives eighty - seven point one . Eighty - s I thought it was eighty Oh , OK , eighty - three point six and eighty eighty - eight point six . But I don't know but maybe if we have the neural network trained with the PLP delta and delta - delta , maybe tha this can help . professor d: Well , that 's that 's one thing , but see the other thing is that ,  it 's good to take the difficult case , but let 's let 's consider what that means . What what we 're saying is that one o one of the things that  my interpretation of your your s original suggestion is something like this , as motivation . When we train on data that is in one sense or another , similar to the testing data , then we get a win by having discriminant training . professor d: When we train on something that 's quite different , we have a potential to have some problems . professor d: And , if we get something that helps us when it 's somewhat similar , and doesn't hurt us too much when it when it 's quite different , that 's maybe not so bad . professor d: So the question is , if you took the same combination , and you tried it out on ,  on say digits , phd a: On TI - digits ? OK .  , then does that , eh you know maybe with similar noise conditions and so forth , does it does it then look much better ? phd a:   professor d: And so what is the range over these different kinds of  of tests ? So , an anyway . phd b: And , with this type of configuration which I do on experiment using the new neural net with name broad klatt s twenty - seven , d I have found more or less the same result . phd a: So , it 's slightly better , phd b: Little bit better ? phd a: yeah . professor d: And and you know again maybe if you use the , delta there , you would bring it up to where it was ,  you know at least about the same for a difficult case . phd a: It 's either less information from the neural network if we use only the silence output . And then w with the first configuration , I f I am found that work , doesn't work professor d: Yeah . Because I for the del Engli - PLP delta and delta - delta , here I have eighty - five point three accuracy , and with the second configuration I have eighty - seven point one . professor d: by the way , there is a another , suggestion that would apply , to the second configuration , which , was made , by , Hari . And that was that , if you have  feed two streams into HTK , and you , change the ,  variances if you scale the variances associated with ,  these streams  , you can effectively scale the streams . Right ? So , you know , without changing the scripts for HTK , which is the rule here , you can still change the variances phd a:   professor d: And , so , if you do that , for instance it may be the case that , the MLP should not be considered as strongly , for instance . professor d: And , so this is just setting them to be , excuse me , of equal equal weight . professor d: Right ? You know , I I 'm sorry to say that gives more experiments if we wanted to look at that , but but , you know on the other hand it 's just experiments at the level of the HTK recognition . Yeah , you have to change the No , you can just do it in as once you 've done the training grad c: And then you can vary it . professor d: Yeah , the training is just coming up with the variances so I guess you could you could just scale them all . But Is it i th  the HTK models are diagonal covariances , so I d Is it professor d: That 's  , exactly the point , I think , that if you change  , change what they are phd a:  . professor d: It 's diagonal covariance matrices , but you say what those variances are . professor d: So , that you know , it 's diagonal , but the diagonal means th that then you 're gonna it 's gonna it 's gonna internally multiply it and and  , i it im  implicitly exponentiated to get probabilities , and so it 's it 's gonna it 's it 's going to affect the range of things if you change the change the variances of some of the features . phd b: do ? professor d: So , i it 's precisely given that model you can very simply affect , the s the strength that you apply the features . So it could just be that h treating them equally , tea treating two streams equally is just just not the right thing to do . Of course it 's potentially opening a can of worms because , you know , maybe it should be a different number for for each kind of test set , or something , phd a:   professor d: So I guess the other thing is to take you know if one were to take , you know , a couple of the most successful of these , phd a: Yeah , and test across everything . phd a: So , the next point , yeah , we 've had some discussion with Steve and Shawn , about their  , articulatory stuff ,  . phd a: discussion with Hynek , Sunil and Pratibha for trying to plug in their our our networks with their within their block diagram , where to plug in the the network , after the the feature , before as  a as a plugin or as a anoth another path , discussion about multi - band and TRAPS , actually Hynek would like to see , perhaps if you remember the block diagram there is , temporal LDA followed b by a spectral LDA for each  critical band . And he would like to replace these by a network which would , make the system look like a TRAP . Basically , this is a TRAP system kind of TRAP system , but where the neural network are replaced by LDA .  , yeah , and about multi - band , I started multi - band MLP trainings ,  mmh Actually , I w I w hhh prefer to do exactly what I did when I was in Belgium . So I take exactly the same configurations , seven bands with nine frames of context , and we just train on TIMIT , and on the large database , so , with SPINE and everything . So , this would would be something between TRAPS and multi - band because we still have quite large bands , and but with a lot of context also . So  Yeah , we still have to work on Finnish , basically , to make a decision on which MLP can be the best across the different languages .  , well , the next part of the document is , well , basically , a kind of summary of what everything that has been done . We have seventy - nine M L Ps trained on one , two , three , four , three , four , five , six , seven ten on ten different databases . phd a: the number of frames is bad also , so we have one million and a half for some , three million for other , and six million for the last one .  , yeah ! As we mentioned , TIMIT is the only that 's hand - labeled , and perhaps this is what makes the difference . First ,  with respect to the on - line normalization , there are that use bad on - line normalization , and other good on - line normalization . With respect to the features , with respect to the use of delta or no ,  with respect to the hidden layer size and to the targets . s What 's this ? We only have two hundred eighty six different tests And no not two thousand . phd b: I say this morning that @ @ thought it was the professor d: Alright , now I 'm just slightly impressed , OK . but when the M - MLP is trained on the  is not trained on the target task , it increased the error rate compared to using straight features . Except if the features are bad  , actually except if the features are not correctly on - line normalized . In this case the tandem is still better even if it 's trained on not on the target digits . phd a: so the fourth point is , yeah , the TIMIT plus noise seems to be the training set that gives better the best network . professor d: So , on the MSG  problem  , I think that in in the  , in the short time solution  , that is , trying to figure out what we can proceed forward with to make the greatest progress , phd a:   professor d: much as I said with JRASTA , even though I really like JRASTA and I really like MSG , phd a:   professor d: I think it 's kind of in category that it 's , it it may be complicated . professor d: And  it might be if someone 's interested in it , certainly encourage anybody to look into it in the longer term , once we get out of this particular rush  for results . professor d: But in the short term , unless you have some some s strong idea of what 's wrong , phd a: I don't know at all but I 've perhaps I have the feeling that it 's something that 's quite quite simple or just like nnn , no high - pass filter professor d: Yeah , probably . professor d: There 's supposed to well MSG is supposed to have a an on - line normalization though , right ? phd a: It 's There is , yeah , an AGC - kind of AGC . professor d: Yeah , but also there 's an on - line norm besides the AGC , there 's an on - line normalization that 's supposed to be  , yeah , phd a: Mmm . professor d: In fac in fact the on - line normalization that we 're using came from the MSG design , phd a:  . Are your results are still with the bad the bad phd b: Maybe , may No ? With the better phd a: With the O - OLN - two ? phd b: No ? phd a: Ah yeah , you have you have OLN - two , phd b: Oh ! Yeah , yeah , yeah ! With \" two \" , with \" on - line - two \" . professor d: \" Two \" is good ? phd a: And professor d: No , \" two \" is bad . It 's probably something simple  , i if if  someone , you know , wants to play with it for a little bit . professor d: but but my my guess would be that it 's something that is a simple thing that could take a while to find . That 's that what we were concerned about is that if it 's not on the target task If it 's on the target task then it it it helps to have the MLP transforming it . professor d: If it  if it 's not on the target task , then , depending on how different it is ,  you can get  , a reduction in performance . professor d: And the question is now how to how to get one and not the other ? Or how to how to ameliorate the the problems . professor d: because it it certainly does is nice to have in there , when it when there is something like the training data . So , the the reason Yeah , the reason is that the perhaps the target the the task dependency the language dependency , and the noise dependency professor d: So that 's what you say th there . phd a: Well , the e e But this is still not clear because , I I I don't think we have enough result to talk about the the language dependency . Well , the TIMIT network is still the best but there is also an the other difference , the fact that it 's it 's hand - labeled .  , I d I don't think we want to mess with the microphones but it 's  Just  , have a seat . s Summary of the first  ,  forty - five minutes is that some stuff work and works , and some stuff doesn't OK , phd a: We still have  this One of these perhaps ? phd b: Yeah .  professor d: Yeah , I guess we can do a little better than that but I think if you if you start off with the other one , actually , that sort of has it in words and then th that has it the associated results . So you 're saying that  , although from what we see , yes there 's what you would expect in terms of a language dependency and a noise dependency . That is , when the neural net is trained on one of those and tested on something different , we don't do as well as in the target thing . But you 're saying that  , it is Although that general thing is observable so far , there 's something you 're not completely convinced about . What what do you mean ? phd a: mmm , that the the fact that s Well , for for TI - digits the TIMIT net is the best ,  which is the English net . But you have two two effects , the effect of changing language and the effect of training on something that 's Viterbi - aligned instead of hand hand - labeled . professor d: Do you think the alignments are bad ?  , have you looked at the alignments at all ? What the Viterbi alignment 's doing ? phd a: Mmm . Because , that is just looking but  ,  It 's not clear to me you necessarily would do so badly from a Viterbi alignment . But , perhaps it 's not really the the alignment that 's bad but the just the ph phoneme string that 's used for the alignment professor d: Aha ! phd a: Mmm .  professor d: The pronunciation models and so forth phd a:  for We It 's single pronunciation ,  professor d: Aha . phd a: so we asked people to listen to the  the sentence and we gave the phoneme string and they kind of correct them .  , the third The third  issue is the noise dependency perhaps but , well , this is not clear yet because all our nets are trained on the same noises and professor d: I thought some of the nets were trained with SPINE and so forth . professor d: OK , yeah , just don't just need more more results there with that @ @ .  , with respect to the network size , there 's one experiment that 's still running and we should have the result today , comparing network with five hundred and one thousand units . We can , we can tell which training set gives the best result , but we don't know exactly why . professor d: \" Multi - multi - English \" just means \" TIMIT \" , phd a: Yeah . professor d: It 's sort of , yes it 's mul it 's multi -  - purpose . So Yeah , the training targets actually , the two of the main issues perhaps are still the language dependency and the noise dependency . And perhaps to try to reduce the language dependency , we should focus on finding some other kind of training targets . For moment you use we use phonetic targets but we could also use articulatory targets , soft targets , and perhaps even ,  use networks that doesn't do classification but just regression so  , train to have neural networks that  , professor d:   phd a: does a regression and well , basically com com compute features and noit not , nnn , features without noise . phd a:  professor d: Yeah , that seems like a good thing to do , probably ,  not  again a short - term sort of thing . professor d:  one of the things about that is that  it 's e u the ri I guess the major risk you have there of being is being dependent on very dependent on the kind of noise and and so forth . phd a: So , this is w w i wa wa this is one thing , this this could be could help could help perhaps to reduce language dependency and for the noise part  we could combine this with other approaches , like , well , the Kleinschmidt approach . I think Kleinschmidt was using more than fifty different noises to train his network , phd b: Yeah . phd a: and So this is one approach and the other is multi - band  , that I think is more robust to the noisy changes . phd a: So perhaps , I think something like multi - band trained on a lot of noises with  , features - based targets could could could help . professor d: Yeah , if you i i It 's interesting thought maybe if you just trained up  w yeah , one one fantasy would be you have something like articulatory targets and you have  some reasonable database ,  but then which is  copied over many times with a range of different noises , phd a:   professor d: And  If Cuz what you 're trying to do is come up with a a core , reasonable feature set which is then gonna be used  , by the the   system . The future work is , well , try to connect to the to make to plug in the system to the OGI system . professor d: And I guess , you know , the the the real open question , e u there 's lots of open questions , but one of the core quote \" open questions \" for that is  , if we take the  you know , the best ones here , maybe not just the best one , but the best few or something You want the most promising group from these other experiments .  , how well do they do over a range of these different tests , not just the Italian ? phd a: Mmm , professor d:  . professor d: y Right ? And then  then see , again , how We know that there 's a mis there 's a  a a loss in performance when the neural net is trained on conditions that are different than than ,  we 're gonna test on , but well , if you look over a range of these different tests  , how well do these different ways of combining the straight features with the MLP features ,  stand up over that range ? phd b:   And  , take let 's say , just take  multi - English cause that works pretty well for the training . How does that How does that compare between the phd a: So all the all the test sets you mean , yeah . professor d: All the different test sets , phd a: And professor d: and for and for the couple different ways that you have of of of combining them . And perhaps doing this for cha changing the variance of the streams and so on getting different scaling phd b:   Yeah , so thi this sh would be more working on the MLP as an additional path instead of an insert to the to their diagram . Perhaps the insert idea is kind of strange because nnn , they they make LDA and then we will again add a network does discriminate anal nnn , that discriminates , professor d: Yeah . It 's a little strange phd a: or ? Mmm ? professor d: but on the other hand they did it before . And because also perhaps we know that the when we have very good features the MLP doesn't help .  , we we wanna get their path running here , right ? If so , we can add this other stuff . professor d: as an additional path right ? phd a: Yeah , the the way we want to do professor d: Cuz they 're doing LDA RASTA . phd a: The d What ? professor d: They 're doing LDA RASTA , phd a: Yeah , the way we want to do it perhaps is to just to get the VAD labels and the final features . professor d: yeah ? phd a: So they will send us the Well , provide us with the feature files , professor d: I see . phd a: and with VAD  , binary labels so that we can  , get our MLP features and filter them with the VAD and then combine them with their f feature stream . First thing of course we 'd wanna do there is to make sure that when we get those labels of final features is that we get the same results as them . You mean Oh , yeah ! Just re re retraining r retraining the HTK ? professor d: Yeah just th w i i Just to make sure that we have we understand properly what things are , our very first thing to do is to is to double check that we get the exact same results as them on HTK . But ,  just for the testing , jus just make sure that we get the same results so we can duplicate it before we add in another phd a: Mmm . Yeah , so fff , LogRASTA , I don't know if we want to We can try networks with LogRASTA filtered features . But professor d: Oh ! You know , the other thing is when you say comb I 'm I 'm sorry , I 'm interrupting . that u  , when you 're talking about combining multiple features ,  Suppose we said , \" OK , we 've got these different features and so forth , but PLP seems pretty good . We have different languages , we have different different noises ,  If we have some drastically different conditions and we just train up different M L Ps with them . What what What Mike found , for the reverberation case at least , who knows if it 'll work for these other ones . That is , that yes , if you knew what the reverberation condition was gonna be and you trained for that , then you got the best results . But if you had , say , a heavily - reverberation ca heavy - reverberation case and a no - reverberation case , and then you fed the thing ,  something that was a modest amount of reverberation then you 'd get some result in between the two . So you you think it 's perhaps better to have several M L Yeah but professor d: It works better if what ? phd a: Yea professor d: I see . Well , see , i oc You were doing some something that was So maybe the analogy isn't quite right . Here the problem seems to be is that we don't have a hug a really huge net with a really huge amount of training data . But we have s f for this kind of task , I would think , sort of a modest amount . We have a modest amount of of  training data from a couple different conditions , and then  in yeah , that and the real situation is that there 's enormous variability that we anticipate in the test set in terms of language , and noise type  , and  , channel characteristic , sort of all over the map . And so , I 'm just concerned that we don't really have  , the data to train up  one of the things that we were seeing is that when we added in we still don't have a good explanation for this , but we are seeing that we 're adding in  , a fe few different databases and  the performance is getting worse and  , when we just take one of those databases that 's a pretty good one , it actually is is is is is better . And  that says to me , yes , that , you know , there might be some problems with the pronunciation models that some of the databases we 're adding in or something like that . But one way or another we don't have  , seemingly , the ability to represent , in the neural net of the size that we have , all of the variability that we 're gonna be covering . So that I 'm I 'm I 'm hoping that  , this is another take on the efficiency argument you 're making , which is I 'm hoping that with moderate size neural nets , that  if we if they look at more constrained conditions they they 'll have enough parameters to really represent them .  i i e The  I think it 's true that the OGI folk found that using LDA RASTA , which is a kind of LogRASTA , it 's just that they have the  it 's done in the log domain , as I recall , and it 's it  it 's just that they d it 's trained up , right ? That that  benefitted from on - line normalization . So will it be in our case , where we 're using the neural net ?  they they were not not using the neural net . We 've been sort of ignoring that , haven't we ? phd a: Yeah , so I don't know . professor d: But phd a: But we have to address the problem of CPU and memory we professor d: Yeah , but I li Well , I think My impression You you folks have been looking at this more than me . But my impression was that  , there was a a a a strict constraint on the delay , phd b: Yeah . professor d: but beyond that it was kind of that  using less memory was better , and using less CPU was better . We have to get some reference point to where we Well , what 's a reasonable number ? Perhaps be because if it 's if it 's too large or large or @ @ professor d: well I don't think we 're  completely off the wall .  I think that if we if we have  ,  the ultimate fall back that we could do If we find   we may find that we we 're not really gonna worry about the M L You know , if the MLP ultimately , after all is said and done , doesn't really help then we won't have it in . professor d: If the MLP does , we find , help us enough in some conditions , we might even have more than one MLP . professor d: And it 's  We do the other manipulations that we 're doing before that .  , what what are they What are they gonna be working Do we know what they 're gonna be working on while we take their features , phd a: They 're They 're starting to wor work on some kind of multi - band . Sunil , what was he doing , do you remember ? phd b: Sunil ? phd a: Yeah . He was doing something new or ? phd b: I I don't re I didn't remember . phd a: I think they were also mainly , well , working a little bit of new things , like networks and multi - band , but mainly trying to tune their their system as it is now to just trying to get the best from this this architecture . So I guess the way it would work is that you 'd get There 'd be some point where you say , \" OK , this is their version - one \" or whatever , and we get these VAD labels and features and so forth for all these test sets from them , phd a:   We have a certain level we try to improve it with this other path and then  , when it gets to be  , January some point  , we say , \" OK we we have shown that we can improve this , in this way . So now   what 's your newest version ? \" And then maybe they 'll have something that 's better and then we we 'd combine it .  I I I used to work with  folks who were trying to improve a good  ,  system with  with a neural net system and  , it was a common problem that you 'd Oh , and this Actually , this is true not just for neural nets but just for in general if people were working with  , rescoring  , N - best lists or lattices that come came from  , a mainstream recognizer .  , You get something from the the other site at one point and you work really hard on making it better with rescoring . So by the time you have  , improved their score , they have also improved their score phd a: Mmm . professor d: So , I guess at some point we 'll have to phd a: So it 's professor d: I I don't know . I think we 're we 're integrated a little more tightly than happens in a lot of those cases . I think at the moment they they say that they have a better thing we can we e e phd a: Mmm . professor d: What takes all the time here is that th we 're trying so many things , presumably  , in a in a day we could turn around  , taking a new set of things from them and and rescoring it , phd a: Mmm . I think that the most wide open thing is the issues about the  , you know , different trainings . So we we can for we c we can forget combining multiple features and MLG perhaps , professor d: That 's sort of wide open . phd a: or focus more on the targets and on the training data and ? professor d: Yeah , I think for right now  , I th I I really liked MSG . And I think that , you know , one of the things I liked about it is has such different temporal properties . And  , I think that there is ultimately a really good  , potential for , you know , bringing in things with different temporal properties .  , but  , we only have limited time and there 's a lot of other things we have to look at . professor d: And it seems like much more core questions are issues about the training set and the training targets , and fitting in  what we 're doing with what they 're doing , and , you know , with limited time . And then , you know , once we  , having gone through this process and trying many different things , I would imagine that certain things  , come up that you are curious about  , that you 'd not getting to and so when the dust settles from the evaluation  , I think that would time to go back and take whatever intrigued you most , you know , got you most interested  and  and and work with it , you know , for the next round .  , as you can tell from these numbers  , nothing that any of us is gonna do is actually gonna completely solve the problem . professor d: Well I figured that , but That what what what were you involved in in this primarily ? grad c: helping out  , preparing Well , they 've been kind of running all the experiments and stuff and I 've been  ,  w doing some work on the on the preparing all all the data for them to to  , train and to test on . Right now , I 'm I 'm focusing mainly on this final project I 'm working on in Jordan 's class . What 's what 's that ? grad c: I 'm trying to  So there was a paper in ICSLP about  this this multi - band  , belief - net structure . grad c:  basically it was two H M Ms with with a with a dependency arrow between the two H M professor d:  - huh . grad c: And so I wanna try try coupling them instead of t having an arrow that that flows from one sub - band to another sub - band . And  , I 'm just gonna see if if that that better models  ,  asynchrony in any way or  Yeah . OK , so speaking of which , if we don't have anything else that we need You happy with where we are ? phd a: Mmm . professor d: Know know wher know where we 're going ?  phd a: I think so , yeah . grad e: Al - actually I should mention So if  , about the Linux machine \" Swede . grad e: And  Dan Ellis I believe knows something about using that machine so phd a: Mmm . grad e: If people are interested in in getting jobs running on that maybe I could help with that . phd a: Yeah , but I don't know if we really need now a lot of machines . professor d: Right ?  there 's there 's some different things that we 're trying to get at now . Yeah , as far as you can tell , you 're actually OK on C - on CPU  , for training and so on ? Yeah . Well , more is always better , but mmm , I don't think we have to train a lot of networks , now that we know We just select what works fine professor d: OK . to work professor d: And we 're OK on And we 're OK on disk ? phd a: and It 's OK , yeah . Alright , so  , since  , we didn't ha get a channel on for you , you don't have to read any digits but the rest of us will . We didn't  I think I won't touch anything cuz I 'm afraid of making the driver crash which it seems to do , pretty easily . OK , so we 'll  I 'll start off the   connect the phd a: My battery is low "

        "Query": "What were the key points discussed by the group regarding the style, design optimization, design goal, evaluation criteria, features, and use cases of the remote control?",
        "Summary": "The team discussed the integration of remote controls for different appliances into one, but Marketing raised concerns about the excessive number of buttons and suggested incorporating a menu display instead. The Project Manager and User Interface agreed, but insisted on keeping basic buttons as well. However, the idea of a flip top was rejected due to cost considerations. As a temporary solution, lightweight plastic was chosen as the material. The team aimed to create an original, trendy, user-friendly, durable, creative, and characteristic remote control that would be intuitive for users. They also determined the price, cost, and expected profit of the remote control. Creativity was emphasized, with the goal of introducing fashion into electronics without compromising functionality. Marketing emphasized the need for a fashionable, technologically innovative, easy-to-use, customer-friendly, uncomplicated, functional, and ergonomically-friendly remote control. The Project Manager agreed and added that it should be quick to learn how to use. User Interface highlighted the importance of channel switching and suggested keeping the remote control as basic as possible. Marketing proposed that the remote control should be multipurpose to compete with existing products. The Project Manager agreed to explore innovative use cases and suggested operating different devices such as TVs, video recorders, and DVD players with the remote control.",
        "Article": "industrial designer: Is there any time for a cup of coffee ? user interface: We have a slight problem . project manager: Sorry ? industrial designer: Can I get a cup of coffee ? project manager:  no . project manager:  then  the three of you  prepared a presentation , I think ? Sebastian ? industrial designer: I think so too . user interface: industrial designer: project manager: Then we'll do your one   as la  the last .  the top goal of this m user interface: But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe . project manager:  the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group  and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind .  the new project requirements , first of all ,  we didn't speak about it , but we should not  support teletext in the remote ,  because our b  board  feels that  teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext .  the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not  f  feasible , it's not  w user interface: Yeah . project manager:   we we cannot make it because of the time to market  that we have to deal with . project manager:  the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than  forty , which is important for you ,  Ruud , and as well for  Roo .  then for Roo , as well  important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product .  the individual presentations , I th  Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ? user interface: Yeah , I'll start .  the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . user interface: Then I found  two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function  remote control with many possibilities , but  the lack of the feeling I already mentioned  in the previous  discussion . user interface: And the ease-of-use remote control with  the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . My personal preferences were ease of  the easy to use remote control , because  the user-friendliness and  it can be more trendy in in user design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not  in our design . But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is  the best  possi possibility for us . project manager: Okay , so marketing: project manager: the important thing here is user interface: And it's also i indeed   Ruud's  insight in the in the topic . project manager: Yeah , okay , w we will s we all  user interface: Just for  for user desi  user  friendliness I  should choose for the the ease of use remote control .  well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . user interface: industrial designer:  basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by  sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to  implement a picture here , user interface: Energies and  industrial designer: but it's hardly readable . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using  infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . It's almost every piece of equipment  every piece of  every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . And I think that's what we w user interface: The glow in the dark  concept  we discussed . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . industrial designer: and I think we should  we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . industrial designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared , because  otherwise our device cannot  communicate with  almost every T_V_ set . And  if we want to use  a rechargeable design or  a energy-save design , we should really implement them .  for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost  circuit board ,  because most of the production cost are are in this  part of the equipment . industrial designer: And  the money we save on using this we can use  for elaborate fancy lighting  techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . user interface: And what's the  industrial designer: I think our  users will really  will really like that . user interface: if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or industrial designer: No , they're p f  power friendly LEDs also . user interface: For the same costs , it's can be  in our industrial designer:  no , they're  they're a little bit more expensive , but by    making user interface: Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's  industrial designer: We can we can make its I think . project manager: Yeah , but but the question is whether  two or four buttons makes  m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to  include fancy lightning techniques , I guess . user interface: Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , marketing: true . Well , it's not one light , it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . project manager: Okay well , industrial designer: project manager: we ar we are very curio curious to what the market  will feel about such a product . marketing: But  since  the other part is  forty percent of the market , I  thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . The buttons to zap are used the about  fifteen hundred times , when  the power button is only used one time . So user interface: Yeah , well it should just have a design The perfect design for those only those buttons . Just one thing I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? industrial designer: Well marketing: Yeah , that's  a problem . project manager: Well industrial designer: Usually project manager: maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , user interface: It should be   project manager: like  turning on and off the the the lights . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a  kind of weird sound , and your  remote controls then start to beep . project manager: But  th user interface: But but T_V_s don't have all   buttons . marketing: And you project manager: Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home  user interface: But I believe you will have an marketing: Yeah , and usually industrial designer: We do not control the T_V_ set so well . marketing: And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button ,  you would have to walk to your T_V_ , industrial designer: Yes , m yes . S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , marketing: and it's project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so we should think about project manager: So what about the clapping technique ?  because you se user interface: I'm convinced  Sebastian will  find  one solution for us . marketing: And b project manager: Well , you see it a lot in in light  lightning   industrial designer: Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics  the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , project manager: Yeah , a peak . industrial designer: But there are many other sounds  which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . industrial designer: Yes , user interface: But we can have just   a home stat  f a base station next to the T_V_ . user interface: Well if you lost th industrial designer: Well , project manager: Well  industrial designer: is there not something f something more easily user interface: I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . user interface:  that's just  industrial designer: No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and  b  perform a a some kind of  . You do not want another device , which can be  everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . project manager: Yeah , m maybe  w we  we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . project manager:  maybe Sebastian should have  a detailed look later on and  come up with a solution , industrial designer: But  before I do that I w I want to warn you that  by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated project manager: And there are some implepe imp user interface: And do we even  prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning  function ? industrial designer: Well , I I think so , because  when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . user interface: It's a unique item  project manager: Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . project manager: and  I think  it's worth   looking and and probably more i interesting than  than the lights . user interface: And just about  the user interface , I came up with  an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . marketing: Well , t  we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function . project manager: Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players  and all kind of stuff . user interface: So industrial designer: we should save costs  by not implementing a lot of functions and  the money that we can save from that we should use for  having a nice design and  thinking about the user interface project manager: Yeah . Okay , industrial designer: and project manager: Ruud , how do you feel about that ?  do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to  a simple marketing:  well if we  include other  innovative functions  then they  might , project manager: user interface:  just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated ,  because it has many functions . industrial designer: Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very  friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but  nevertheless project manager: But but are we not in in the in the manual   if you have few buttons , no display ,    I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and  one button can  industrial designer: Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . project manager: But but how does how does the remote  report  r  give back to the user w in what state it is ? user interface: Yeah , I don't know yet . There's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . project manager: I know , but but if we use  like a stick , for example ,  industrial designer: W When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe  a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just  pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t  turned up the volume . marketing: And if you use that stick for volume control and channel  selection , you have the m two most important functions in one  button . user interface: But does it  I then should n just use  i instead of the stick ,  like many cell phones , just a round m well , project manager: Yeah , draw draw it on the board . Oh user interface: It's just an easy  way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . user interface: A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down project manager: Yeah , it can break down . marketing: And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it  attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . project manager: Okay , but w we still we're still in the question of    putting in advanced options .  we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , I think . user interface: Yes ? project manager: We need to  have the  the user function  the functions decided and   our target audience . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ?  which  incorporates all function available on the device ? project manager:  well , I do not want a full  it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want  the kind of functions , for example  th the most important are volume and  programme selecting . l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but user interface: Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to  two channels , when you have  something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can  change industrial designer: project manager: Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last  Mielsen . industrial designer: but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . project manager: And and do we want  the ten digits ? user interface: The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so . industrial designer: Well , are are you sure ? marketing: Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . industrial designer: but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think but you should  shou you should know that . industrial designer: Okay , user interface:  and I think the most industrial designer: I can imagine when project manager: I agree actually . user interface: Just elder elder people would would buy it , industrial designer: I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . marketing: Well user interface: but industrial designer: But if you're  a regular T_V_ user , and you just want  to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can  you can use  about ten buttons . industrial designer: Well , marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: but how how often do you watch all these channels ? marketing: and if if we And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . Don't you think ? project manager: Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the industrial designer: The design . marketing: Well project manager: You c you can d make them very fancy marketing: And project manager: by   Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . industrial designer: Okay , so you can experiment by  with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .  it might be expensive and  hard to implement , but it would be a solution  for project manager: Okay , speech . industrial designer: So  when you add  speech recognition to your remote control ,  it's very easy to change  the channel . industrial designer: So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . project manager:  If if we would  drop the ten digits industrial designer: But maybe when we  project manager: but keep the programme and the volume , industrial designer: It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find  find the remote control button  remote control function . industrial designer: There are some  hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . industrial designer: So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . project manager: But But but can we manage it bu  for the costs ? industrial designer: You have to do nothing for it . marketing: And  if we if we could inc  include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be  a big problem . marketing: 'Cause when project manager: Is a cradle very cheap ? industrial designer: It's Oh , it's very cheap .  I would like to hear  maybe maybe you all have th  things not  spoken about , yeah , but that are important .  are there other things about the market we should know ? marketing:  I think we dealt with the most important information . project manager: Sebastian ? industrial designer:  I just want to make a summary of all all things  spoken and  the different possibilities . So on the outside it looks easy , but  we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by  implementing  speech techniques ,  voice recognition , that these kinds of things .  there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement  fancy techniques , which  I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about  the the costs and  the things like  battery lifetime , energy saving . industrial designer:  another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons . If we just add   a chip which does the voice recognition ,  our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another project manager: Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board industrial designer: well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . user interface: But the cheaper the ch  the the chip or th what was it ? industrial designer: project manager: No , it's th industrial designer: The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . user interface: Well it then we should just  take a look at the costs and  especially for the voice recognition . project manager: I'm not sure how how we'll f  determine the costs , I will have a look at it . project manager:  I'm not sure how how that industrial designer: Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will  have a lo  look at it . project manager:  I'm don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out . project manager:  then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work ,  and I'm sure your personal coaches will  assist you with it . project manager: User Interface Designer ,  Roo , I would like to see the user interface c  concept . project manager: And  user interface:  the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis  decisions Sebastian makes . industrial designer: Well project manager: Well , i it should be easy , user interface: Well project manager: that's w w what we concluded . industrial designer: So we drop the voice recognition ? project manager: No no no , we didn't industrial designer: Or project manager: but it shouldn't be integrated industrial designer: Oh . project manager: yeah , it's of course it's user interface , but  i I was talking about really the design of the industrial designer: Okay <doc-sep>And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly . industrial designer: project manager: user interface: industrial designer: Well , I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and  user interface:  . B did you send us an email about this ? project manager: not yet , user interface: industrial designer: project manager: but if you want user interface: Yeah , we we received an email about this  d designs . project manager: Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ? industrial designer: user interface: Ah it's Okay . marketing: I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . user interface: 'Kay , we can project manager: So there are so we have three user interface: So there are three kinds of designs , that's all . project manager: So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? Any any volunteer ? industrial designer: I think our  responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager . user interface: Are you using the you are doing the in industrial designer: Yeah I I'm I'm Well , maybe we have okay so I industrial design . It was a little confusion about my  project manager: user interface: Ah industrial designer: but it's alright . industrial designer: Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done project manager: industrial designer: and what are your ideas about the project manager: About the design or Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ? industrial designer: Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess . industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno I project manager: And of course it should not be very costly . industrial designer: Well I I think that Norman and I would think about  the technical points and  we should discuss it in the next meeting , or user interface: Need to collect information .  , what is most important in a in a remote control ? What is the most important function aspect ?  . project manager: You won't user interface: Or or you can say for example ,  I want  to list all the programme tonight . Y you know , instead of  remote control it's doing the some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . project manager: I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . user interface: No , because no , project manager: S user interface: it's not very a lot . industrial designer: I I think if you want t to choose  from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use  w  I dunno marketing: I'm a okay . marketing:  the main  function of remote control is to have something in the hand project manager: In the hand . marketing: If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog user interface: Yeah . marketing: if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . industrial designer: marketing:  we have some or something , different technology but project manager: This is it's user interface: Yeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that  there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea project manager: industrial designer: but I I think that technically it would be  a little bit   more tricky to to achieve this than just to user interface: No . They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . user interface: And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons . industrial designer: Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to  navigate  through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so project manager: This is good idea . Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? industrial designer: Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen user interface: Good idea . industrial designer: and just  with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f user interface: I think I think that will be revol revolutionary . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: Because all the T_V_  the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . So I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff user interface: Okay . project manager: So we have five minutes to user interface: Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . project manager: Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we industrial designer: user interface: Five minutes . marketing: And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of user interface: Okay . marketing: So , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark  some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . industrial designer: Oh right so user interface: Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: Be before before writing you can  sit and that says what we what we said user interface:  . So so the most functional des  the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . The user can choose w which one they want , right ? industrial designer: Yeah , by content or by channel , user interface: By content or by channel . user interface: Okay , so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content . industrial designer: I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so user interface: Okay . And  industrial designer: I think that's the the things to do user interface: The main thing . user interface: So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get  the funct this is the functional designer ? That's the first aspect . project manager: So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ? And we'll discuss the other other aspects <doc-sep>marketing: user interface: industrial designer: marketing: industrial designer: project manager: user interface:  project manager: industrial designer: user interface: No , no . Not all the small buttons , you don't know project manager: Is this positive or negative , that  big buttons ? industrial designer: Big buttons , positive . industrial designer: All all small buttons like when you have  like a hundred buttons on your remote control , you won't know what they're working for . What are your experiences ? user interface:  well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the T_V_ set . And  I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED   a LED on the corner of the of the remote . And that if you push the button the LED  gives a light , and  and you see that it's working .  project manager: So and do they always have that ? user interface: Yeah , but No no no . marketing:  at home we have a T_V_ , a video  recorder , a D_V_D_ player , and a satellite receiver . But  i it it had a lot of buttons on it , and you didn't know which one was what . So what ideas do you have for it , for the new remote control ? What what does it have to have ? industrial designer: The weight . industrial designer: When you push a but a button on the T_V_ , then you hear some  some sort of bleep . industrial designer: marketing: Yeah I think it  from a marketing point of view , it also has to look nice . So you don't won't have to change the batteries  once a week or  once every two weeks "

        "Query": "Summarize the discussion on the appearance, materials, and desired features of the television remote.",
        "Summary": "The company recommends incorporating its corporate colors and design into the product, including the option for different colors like pink or banana yellow and fun shapes such as animals. They also discussed the idea of using buttons with various shapes, like triangles for volume and squares for channels. It was agreed upon that the text on the remote should be clear and the remote itself should be compact. \n\nDuring the discussion, the group realized that balancing the budget and maintaining quality would be challenging. To save costs without compromising user experience, the Project Manager decided to use high-quality recycled plastic as the material for the remote. However, they were willing to invest in a cutting-edge lithium battery for optimal performance.\n\nThe company's slogan and design target revolve around incorporating fashion into electronics. While the idea of providing user-customizable skins was rejected due to the amount of work involved, they decided to add the company logo on the boot-up screen and introduce a dormant mode. This was because most people prefer a non-flashing remote when the TV is on.\n\nThere were two main reasons behind these design choices. Firstly, the unit price of each remote control was relatively high, at twenty-five Euros. To justify this price point, the features of the remote had to be satisfying and of high quality. Secondly, there was competition in the market from other TV remote controls. Therefore, the new remote controls needed to be special and different in order to attract customers.",
        "Article": "industrial designer: Is there any time for a cup of coffee ? user interface: We have a slight problem . project manager: Sorry ? industrial designer: Can I get a cup of coffee ? project manager:  no . project manager:  then  the three of you  prepared a presentation , I think ? Sebastian ? industrial designer: I think so too . user interface: industrial designer: project manager: Then we'll do your one   as la  the last .  the top goal of this m user interface: But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe . project manager:  the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group  and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind .  the new project requirements , first of all ,  we didn't speak about it , but we should not  support teletext in the remote ,  because our b  board  feels that  teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext .  the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not  f  feasible , it's not  w user interface: Yeah . project manager:   we we cannot make it because of the time to market  that we have to deal with . project manager:  the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than  forty , which is important for you ,  Ruud , and as well for  Roo .  then for Roo , as well  important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product .  the individual presentations , I th  Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ? user interface: Yeah , I'll start .  the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . user interface: Then I found  two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function  remote control with many possibilities , but  the lack of the feeling I already mentioned  in the previous  discussion . user interface: And the ease-of-use remote control with  the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . My personal preferences were ease of  the easy to use remote control , because  the user-friendliness and  it can be more trendy in in user design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not  in our design . But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is  the best  possi possibility for us . project manager: Okay , so marketing: project manager: the important thing here is user interface: And it's also i indeed   Ruud's  insight in the in the topic . project manager: Yeah , okay , w we will s we all  user interface: Just for  for user desi  user  friendliness I  should choose for the the ease of use remote control .  well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . user interface: industrial designer:  basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by  sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to  implement a picture here , user interface: Energies and  industrial designer: but it's hardly readable . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using  infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . It's almost every piece of equipment  every piece of  every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . And I think that's what we w user interface: The glow in the dark  concept  we discussed . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . industrial designer: and I think we should  we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . industrial designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared , because  otherwise our device cannot  communicate with  almost every T_V_ set . And  if we want to use  a rechargeable design or  a energy-save design , we should really implement them .  for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost  circuit board ,  because most of the production cost are are in this  part of the equipment . industrial designer: And  the money we save on using this we can use  for elaborate fancy lighting  techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . user interface: And what's the  industrial designer: I think our  users will really  will really like that . user interface: if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or industrial designer: No , they're p f  power friendly LEDs also . user interface: For the same costs , it's can be  in our industrial designer:  no , they're  they're a little bit more expensive , but by    making user interface: Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's  industrial designer: We can we can make its I think . project manager: Yeah , but but the question is whether  two or four buttons makes  m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to  include fancy lightning techniques , I guess . user interface: Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , marketing: true . Well , it's not one light , it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . project manager: Okay well , industrial designer: project manager: we ar we are very curio curious to what the market  will feel about such a product . marketing: But  since  the other part is  forty percent of the market , I  thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . The buttons to zap are used the about  fifteen hundred times , when  the power button is only used one time . So user interface: Yeah , well it should just have a design The perfect design for those only those buttons . Just one thing I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? industrial designer: Well marketing: Yeah , that's  a problem . project manager: Well industrial designer: Usually project manager: maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , user interface: It should be   project manager: like  turning on and off the the the lights . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a  kind of weird sound , and your  remote controls then start to beep . project manager: But  th user interface: But but T_V_s don't have all   buttons . marketing: And you project manager: Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home  user interface: But I believe you will have an marketing: Yeah , and usually industrial designer: We do not control the T_V_ set so well . marketing: And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button ,  you would have to walk to your T_V_ , industrial designer: Yes , m yes . S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , marketing: and it's project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so we should think about project manager: So what about the clapping technique ?  because you se user interface: I'm convinced  Sebastian will  find  one solution for us . marketing: And b project manager: Well , you see it a lot in in light  lightning   industrial designer: Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics  the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , project manager: Yeah , a peak . industrial designer: But there are many other sounds  which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . industrial designer: Yes , user interface: But we can have just   a home stat  f a base station next to the T_V_ . user interface: Well if you lost th industrial designer: Well , project manager: Well  industrial designer: is there not something f something more easily user interface: I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . user interface:  that's just  industrial designer: No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and  b  perform a a some kind of  . You do not want another device , which can be  everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . project manager: Yeah , m maybe  w we  we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . project manager:  maybe Sebastian should have  a detailed look later on and  come up with a solution , industrial designer: But  before I do that I w I want to warn you that  by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated project manager: And there are some implepe imp user interface: And do we even  prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning  function ? industrial designer: Well , I I think so , because  when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . user interface: It's a unique item  project manager: Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . project manager: and  I think  it's worth   looking and and probably more i interesting than  than the lights . user interface: And just about  the user interface , I came up with  an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . marketing: Well , t  we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function . project manager: Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players  and all kind of stuff . user interface: So industrial designer: we should save costs  by not implementing a lot of functions and  the money that we can save from that we should use for  having a nice design and  thinking about the user interface project manager: Yeah . Okay , industrial designer: and project manager: Ruud , how do you feel about that ?  do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to  a simple marketing:  well if we  include other  innovative functions  then they  might , project manager: user interface:  just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated ,  because it has many functions . industrial designer: Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very  friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but  nevertheless project manager: But but are we not in in the in the manual   if you have few buttons , no display ,    I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and  one button can  industrial designer: Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . project manager: But but how does how does the remote  report  r  give back to the user w in what state it is ? user interface: Yeah , I don't know yet . There's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . project manager: I know , but but if we use  like a stick , for example ,  industrial designer: W When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe  a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just  pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t  turned up the volume . marketing: And if you use that stick for volume control and channel  selection , you have the m two most important functions in one  button . user interface: But does it  I then should n just use  i instead of the stick ,  like many cell phones , just a round m well , project manager: Yeah , draw draw it on the board . Oh user interface: It's just an easy  way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . user interface: A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down project manager: Yeah , it can break down . marketing: And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it  attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . project manager: Okay , but w we still we're still in the question of    putting in advanced options .  we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , I think . user interface: Yes ? project manager: We need to  have the  the user function  the functions decided and   our target audience . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ?  which  incorporates all function available on the device ? project manager:  well , I do not want a full  it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want  the kind of functions , for example  th the most important are volume and  programme selecting . l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but user interface: Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to  two channels , when you have  something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can  change industrial designer: project manager: Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last  Mielsen . industrial designer: but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . project manager: And and do we want  the ten digits ? user interface: The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so . industrial designer: Well , are are you sure ? marketing: Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . industrial designer: but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think but you should  shou you should know that . industrial designer: Okay , user interface:  and I think the most industrial designer: I can imagine when project manager: I agree actually . user interface: Just elder elder people would would buy it , industrial designer: I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . marketing: Well user interface: but industrial designer: But if you're  a regular T_V_ user , and you just want  to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can  you can use  about ten buttons . industrial designer: Well , marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: but how how often do you watch all these channels ? marketing: and if if we And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . Don't you think ? project manager: Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the industrial designer: The design . marketing: Well project manager: You c you can d make them very fancy marketing: And project manager: by   Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . industrial designer: Okay , so you can experiment by  with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .  it might be expensive and  hard to implement , but it would be a solution  for project manager: Okay , speech . industrial designer: So  when you add  speech recognition to your remote control ,  it's very easy to change  the channel . industrial designer: So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . project manager:  If if we would  drop the ten digits industrial designer: But maybe when we  project manager: but keep the programme and the volume , industrial designer: It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find  find the remote control button  remote control function . industrial designer: There are some  hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . industrial designer: So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . project manager: But But but can we manage it bu  for the costs ? industrial designer: You have to do nothing for it . marketing: And  if we if we could inc  include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be  a big problem . marketing: 'Cause when project manager: Is a cradle very cheap ? industrial designer: It's Oh , it's very cheap .  I would like to hear  maybe maybe you all have th  things not  spoken about , yeah , but that are important .  are there other things about the market we should know ? marketing:  I think we dealt with the most important information . project manager: Sebastian ? industrial designer:  I just want to make a summary of all all things  spoken and  the different possibilities . So on the outside it looks easy , but  we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by  implementing  speech techniques ,  voice recognition , that these kinds of things .  there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement  fancy techniques , which  I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about  the the costs and  the things like  battery lifetime , energy saving . industrial designer:  another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons . If we just add   a chip which does the voice recognition ,  our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another project manager: Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board industrial designer: well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . user interface: But the cheaper the ch  the the chip or th what was it ? industrial designer: project manager: No , it's th industrial designer: The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . user interface: Well it then we should just  take a look at the costs and  especially for the voice recognition . project manager: I'm not sure how how we'll f  determine the costs , I will have a look at it . project manager:  I'm not sure how how that industrial designer: Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will  have a lo  look at it . project manager:  I'm don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out . project manager:  then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work ,  and I'm sure your personal coaches will  assist you with it . project manager: User Interface Designer ,  Roo , I would like to see the user interface c  concept . project manager: And  user interface:  the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis  decisions Sebastian makes . industrial designer: Well project manager: Well , i it should be easy , user interface: Well project manager: that's w w what we concluded . industrial designer: So we drop the voice recognition ? project manager: No no no , we didn't industrial designer: Or project manager: but it shouldn't be integrated industrial designer: Oh . project manager: yeah , it's of course it's user interface , but  i I was talking about really the design of the industrial designer: Okay <doc-sep>So basically we've got three things , and we've got forty minutes in which to  for this meeting to  to discuss the various options . industrial designer: We have a I guess we have a presentation each , 'cause I've got one .  so do we want to do the presentation first , or do we want to  W I I got  or or three things basically ,  relating to the remote being only for T_V_ . project manager: So in fact it actually f we won't be forestalled in a sense . user interface: What is it ? industrial designer: I'm not quite sure how it user interface: I think you've got to do  control F_ eight . user interface: Ah there , marketing: Oh hang on , user interface: it's doing something .  I've just got three sections , first is the research I made on the on the remote control itself  . And then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do and how it connects with the television . industrial designer: We then have the user interface , which is basically the like the the buttons on the actual remote . And then the sender , which  is usually , I've found , an infra-red device which sends a signal to the actual television .  and the last part is receiver which is important in the system but is not actually part of the remote itself , because that's obviously found in the television .  I'm gonna have to actually draw on the board because  it was a little tricky on PowerPoint to get this working , so . S   do we have a cloth to wipe this down with , or ? Oh I'll j project manager:  there's the rubber on the right , I think . Okay , so we start off with a  battery suppl  no , a power supply which we'd probably get it's probably gonna be the battery .  we then have a particular button , which may be that's obviously there's lots and lots of different buttons .  that sends after you press that that sends the message to the chip , which  then sends It sort of interprets which button you've pressed and then sends the appropriate message to the sender . That's the remote in itself , that's the components of the remote and how they work together .  this is the chip itself , which then , and that's the that's the infra-red sender . going on to personal preferences , I've said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote , just because of the size . You don't want a a cable attached to the remote otherwise it's not it's not really a remote .  and then the sender , marketing: industrial designer: and infra-red  has been used quite successfully .  so the m basic method of this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set , so that a desired function is performed .  an example of the function could be to change the volume up or down ,  so obviously you need two different buttons for that .  by the look of it they both have  kind of play and fast forward , rewind functions , so I think they incorporate a kind of video function which we won't have to worry about . So , it's got nice big buttons , it's got a very limited number of buttons .  I like the use of the kind of  symbols like the triangles and the squares and the arrows as well as the words on the  kind of play functions and all that . user interface: Will you be presenting that in a bit ? project manager: But  I got  I got an email that basically said to  make sure that  whatever device we come up with at the end of the day had to incorporate  the corporate colour and slogan . So  I'm guessing that   I notice on the bottom there it's got  what's that ? A_P_O_G_E_E_ that might be the corporate colour scheme , although the only the only colour I can see in that is the red . industrial designer: Would you be able to get rid of the the extra buttons here , the the sort of circular section , because that seems to be for a video as well . So we could dispense with that little bit as well and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume . Possibly ? user interface: What do you mean by the circular section ? industrial designer: J yeah yeah yeah j yeah user interface: Like all of that bottom bit ? project manager: industrial designer: just this little bit is that I think that's still  a video remote part , user interface: Yeah . project manager: Well b  w user interface:  how often do you use seven , eight and nine ? I think just one to six and then channel up and down should be enough . project manager: Well th the on the user interface: Like how often do you hit nine ? project manager: Well  for for general television purposes obviously you have channels one to five at this point in time , marketing: But but industrial designer: It's just people are used to seeing that , so if we didn't have them then they might think it's project manager: But , well possibly but the the other thing is that with  the current expansion of  channels  in the process of taking place , certainly the button up and down , but   how many channels do we have to  actual television channels do we have to  prepare for ? I would have thought that  it's forever expanding and at the moment we've got although you've onl you've got the five standard , you've got the B_B_C_ have come up with a further six industrial designer: project manager: and  there's  I don't know exactly how many channels there are on  when you take into account  Sky and various other  various others . project manager: So I would've thought that we wouldn't , you know , rather user interface:  . project manager: Okay , if the time of flicking from one to other , but presumably it'll take a second user interface: project manager: 'cause you have to be able to stop it . Maybe you could have a fast forward on the on the channels that w and then you could dispense with more otherwise . industrial designer: user interface:  some remotes have kind of favourite options where if you always flick from channel one to channel six ,  if that's a favourite you just like by-pass two to five . industrial designer: project manager: Yeah , I s I suppose in a sense you could have  if you've got a hundred channels then if you had sort of an easy way of getting rather than having to go one to a hundred , you could go one to one to ten , ten to twenty industrial designer: user interface:  . project manager: and then have a second button to get you to the actual channel you want marketing: user interface: But I think a lot of  like Cable and Sky and stuff , that would be tuned to one channel , and then you'd have another remote for all of those channels . industrial designer: I suppose with nine you've got the the like the last one which makes the tenth means you  it's like  multiples you can put them together so you can make any number . industrial designer: So with that we'd kind of by-pass any problems with project manager: Yeah Well that's true , yeah , industrial designer: Yeah .  I think that's just for a video , so we wouldn't need any of that at all . industrial designer: So we could get it down to what ? project manager: If it's just for T_V_ , which is what it is at the moment . industrial designer: So we get to How many buttons have we got ? We've just got ten , eleven twelve th We got fourteen that we need . Well we've we've got  that it's remote for T_V_ only otherwise project would become too complex with  which would endanger the time to market was one of the considerations . project manager: I'm I don't know d did you have that information behind the marketing , marketing: project manager: or was I meant to give you that information ? marketing:  I'm not sure . project manager: Right , okay , so basically time to market seems to be important , therefore speed of delivery . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: user interface: Okay , so is everyone happy with that ? industrial designer: Ah yes yes , that seems good . industrial designer: marketing: Right , we've done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control . And first off we should state that th the remote control's for controlling the T_V_ and  how do people use it ? We asked them sort of which buttons were useful for them .  how d how does a remote control look and feel for them , and what improvements would would they like to remote control . And we did that by sort of giving them a questionnaire that we'd prepared and asking them to fill in the answers . And three quarters of them found that remote controls are ugly and that a sort of even higher proportion would spend more for a sort of s  a fancier remote control And that of all the buttons on the remote control , the sort of setting buttons for sort of the picture picture and brightness and the audio settings ,  they weren't used very often at all . And young people were quite receptive to this , but as soon as we got sort of over about into a thirty five to forty age forty five age group and older , people people weren't quite so keen on speech recognition . There's a lot more th there's a lot lot more older people who didn't know whether they wanted it or not as well .  we also asked what frustrated people about remote controls and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that they couldn't find it . And the second second biggest frustration what that if they got a new remote control , it was difficult to learn  all the buttons and all the functions , and to find your way around it . Okay , so My personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some sort of sleek sort of good looking high high-tech A design which looks high-tech , basically .  and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market , and we should sort of concentrate on the channels and sort of power , and also volume and that sort of thing , as as Louisa said .  we could maybe come up with a menu , a sort of a an L_C_D_ menu for other functions on the remote control .  and maybe we could think about speech recognition as well , because  sort of young people are perhaps the ones that are gonna buy buy our new product if we aim it at sort of you know sort of a high-tech design . And we could maybe think about using speech recogniti recognition as a way to find the remote control if it's lost in a room , rather than sort of  having it to speech recognition to change the channels . 'Cause there's a problem with that in that the television makes noise , so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel . project manager: What was that last wee bit there ? user interface: Do a lot of  marketing:  about speech recognition ? project manager: Speech recognition , user interface: marketing: Yeah . marketing: Youn young people pref Yeah , they s they said that they'd be interested in a remote control which offered that possibility and as you go up through the age groups , people got less and less interested in sort of a a remote control that you could talk to , so . industrial designer: No what I maybe think is  it seems the technology would be quite advanced for that and they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for for the speech recognition . industrial designer: And possibly the thing about the about the remote being lost we could have You know with your mobile phone , you lose that and you can ring it . Maybe we can have some kind of sensor which is kept somewhere where you can some kind of buzzer system between the two . Yeah , we'd have t that would mean we'd have to put two products together as well , industrial designer: That is true , yes . user interface: There's key rings  that you kind of whistle at or clap at , I can't remember , and then they whistle back , or something like that . So industrial designer: So I guess it'd be something we could like attach to the or like the same technology could be put inside the inside the remote . project manager: Well if you're trying to avoid having a second product 'cause obviously you could have a second product that gave you the right pitch which would set the remote off to say here I am sort of thing , you know without sound recognition .  I dunno  talking about vo  obviously if you've got voice recognition then you can do it in that way because it'll recognise the voice and you can give it a command , a set command whatever that happened to be . project manager: But you've then got the point if if you're not going with  voice recognition then industrial designer: you could have an option to turn it off . industrial designer: So that would solve the problems with the T_V_ kind of speaking to the remote and changing its own channels . marketing: project manager: So  Any sugges Well , any conclusions ? marketing:  would it take quite a while to sort of develop the speech recognition software in the remote control ? user interface: project manager: Well if it does then we can't . project manager: because we've got  th th three  primary   requisites from  from and email  that was sent to me whereby we had The design logo was one , which we've already mentioned . We've got  the remote was only for the television and not for because that would make it too complex and we have to get it market quickly . project manager: And the  third thing was that  teletext  as far as  the management is concerned ,  is becoming dated  due to the popularity of the internet . project manager: So we're being focused effectively directly at a television and it seems to me that the management is  wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out . project manager: So anything that  is to be added , such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick industrial designer: Has to be simple enough to project manager: because time to market is is critical . S industrial designer: I suppose if we could get something in which was quite quick and simple that would give us an advantage over the other remotes . project manager: Added extras would be nice , but the primary consideration is to get the project finished within  this short time window , which effectively now is sort of four hours .  d d I think I think first and foremost we've gotta get to the end and then get to the end with  added extras if possible . project manager: and how we were planning to proceed so that at the next  meeting each person that's got a a a task to do is clear from this meeting what that task is . And then we can report back at the next meeting and say right okay yes , we've achieved this or we haven't achieved this , this is how far we've progressed . project manager: So we have to come effectively to the decision on the remote functions so that you can decide what you're gonna be doing . And if dur between the time of this meeting finishing and the next meeting starting , if you get any additional information that  only you have at that point in time you'd think would be relevant to other people in terms of their des decision making  process , then we should communicate that as quickly as possible and not wait until the next meeting . project manager: so that rather than coming you know If you get the information just before the next meeting that's fine . Come along with it in the next meeting , we can discuss it then and take whatever action is appropriate . project manager: But if you get it well before the next meeting , let everybody else know 'cause that might have an impact on their  on what they come up with effectively at the next meeting . project manager: Right , is there marketing: So do we need to decide on the functions now ? S project manager: I would guess so . user interface: Well I think it'd be really easy and it'd be a big advantage if we did have some sort of  kind of whistle back kind of function . marketing: Yeah and Yeah and that was that was the number one sort of frustration that people said , so . user interface: marketing: I don't think there's anything else on the market that does that , so . project manager: I w well  i industrial designer: Maybe we should concentrate just on the whistle back function at the moment , project manager: Something simple .  if if our primary consideration is to get it there in time , time's short , industrial designer: and if something comes back project manager: you want something to meet the major concerns of the consumer so that we can have that as a selling point for the product , user interface: user interface: And that wouldn't put off the kind of older generation either , 'cause everyone can whistle or clap , and they wouldn't have to be kind of scared of this new technology . project manager: On the basis that if we've got if we're catering to the whole age range , you want something that's easy to do , industrial designer: project manager: now something that doesn't like whis  marketing: No not everyone can whistle , can they , though ? project manager: Well I I I don't know . Well If you think that more people can whistle than clap then that's fine , then go for that option , user interface: project manager: but if I would have thought that more people could clap rather than whistle , marketing: No , industrial designer: I'd go more marketing: clapping , I think clapping , industrial designer: Yeah , f more for clap . user interface: 'Kay we've already decided that we don't need a teletext button , haven't we ? project manager:  . Ef effectively that's what the that's what they're saying , user interface: Is that one of the project manager: that  if  if people are now using the internet then you don't need teletext , user interface:  . industrial designer: and then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together . I think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Okay , ten numbers user interface: industrial designer: and then some kind of device to allow  marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Did we decide anything about  the other functions ? As in setting the audio and tuning it and stuff like that ? You had an had an idea about the menu ? marketing:  we could possibly put an L_ a sort of a L_C_D_ menu in , but that again is probably an expense that industrial designer: But just thinking  people probably  you don't have you only have to probably tune in the T_V_ once , but you have to be able to tune it that once . industrial designer: So and if finally the T_V_ breaks , you get a new one , you're gonna have to be able to tune it . project manager: But the but that's relying on the television market changing to an automatic industrial designer: So that'll be in marketing: Yeah . But at the moment it's not , so it seems to me that you have to have a device that caters , 'cause otherwise it would make it  your device would become inoperable , or only operable in certain circumstances industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: And it's also m it's the the product we've got is something that's at the I would have said the lower end of the s of the cost scale , so we're not really going for something that's  terribly high-tech . I s I suppose  if people are buying remotes , then they're probably buying it to replace another remote project manager: Possibly . marketing:  we're maybe talking about replacing remotes for slightly older televisions , so we maybe need to keep the the tuning function in . industrial designer: Would you maybe have like one menu button , then you'd use the other buttons , maybe the number buttons to actually do the separate functions . user interface: and it was too dark , so I had to go through it and turn the brightness up . industrial designer: and then a menu function and maybe sort of a slightly more advanced  instruction booklet to come with it , to guide Presu  I think it'd be quite hard just for people to grasp  just off like the menu use different buttons you maybe have to have like some better instructions of how that would actually work . marketing:  I'm not sure whether the sort of having people have a booklet 'cause one the second most annoying thing that people found was having to learn the new one . marketing: So maybe next to each of the buttons , you know each of them could have a number and then also a function written next to it , so you're basically pressing industrial designer: that also goes back to the original design when we saw those two , and there was the one on the left hand side which had all like the double functions and stuff which kind of looked too busy and had too much on it , so . user interface: Well , if we're trying to keep it slee sleek and sexy as well , have you seen those remotes where kind of  the bottom bit slides down , so there's kind of  everything else revealed ? marketing: Okay . user interface: So you don't use it that much , you don't have to see it all the time . project manager: Right we've got five minutes before we wind up this meeting , so I've been told . And that'll be better for the older generation as well 'cause , well my dad doesn't like anything that you've got to kinda flick through a menu , project manager: Ah . industrial designer: So  we're gonna have to have to work out what's gonna be on these other functions as as well . marketing:  sorta project manager: That's right so we're dis So you've got which ones are gonna be on the front and which ones are gonna be on the back . industrial designer: So sh Should we decide in the next couple of minutes , and then marketing: user interface: I know it's probably like  not an issue to raise here , but  the whole thing about not using your standby  because of the like waste of electricity . Have you seen the adverts ? Like if you boil the kettle that's full that's a waste . user interface: If you leave your telly on standby it powers Blackpool for a certain amount of time . project manager: So so are you having the stand-by on the front , then ? marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: We can send out a flier with the device saying that you shouldn't leave it on stand-by . industrial designer:  are we gonna have the channel up and down as well as the number buttons ? marketing:  'cause yeah the market research said there is quite a lot of people do just zap around and flick , so . industrial designer: So we've got ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen there ? project manager: Channel up and down . project manager: What else have we got ? What was that , sixteen ? marketing: Numbers is ten , volume is twelve , project manager: Volume button . industrial designer: Maybe if we're gonna run out of time , one of us should come up with a list of these and then get back at the next meeting just at the start and say what they're gonna be . project manager: anything else ? You're also gonna have the channel tuner , as it were . marketing: And then maybe sort of an enter button for sort of s you know , saying that you want that particular thing tuned in . So you go up and down and then it pick it finds something and then you wanna press enter to select it , yeah . We don't really need any other audio funct  functions because it's just volume up , volume down . user interface: So I think  there's quite a lot of like Dolby surround studio , surround sort of things . industrial designer: Do they have their own do they have their own controls on their actual products , then , marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: or do you have to do it via the remote ? user interface:  I think they've got their own controls in this kind of like hidden panel . industrial designer: Yeah I suppose if we've got their if they've got their own controls then we can avoid it for ours just to keep it simple . user interface: Oh no ,   like there's kind of individual buttons for them , like on the T_V_ remote . industrial designer: Maybe unless something comes up then we should I think project manager: Well you might get some research <doc-sep>And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly . industrial designer: project manager: user interface: industrial designer: Well , I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and  user interface:  . B did you send us an email about this ? project manager: not yet , user interface: industrial designer: project manager: but if you want user interface: Yeah , we we received an email about this  d designs . project manager: Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ? industrial designer: user interface: Ah it's Okay . marketing: I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . user interface: 'Kay , we can project manager: So there are so we have three user interface: So there are three kinds of designs , that's all . project manager: So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? Any any volunteer ? industrial designer: I think our  responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager . user interface: Are you using the you are doing the in industrial designer: Yeah I I'm I'm Well , maybe we have okay so I industrial design . It was a little confusion about my  project manager: user interface: Ah industrial designer: but it's alright . industrial designer: Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done project manager: industrial designer: and what are your ideas about the project manager: About the design or Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ? industrial designer: Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess . industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno I project manager: And of course it should not be very costly . industrial designer: Well I I think that Norman and I would think about  the technical points and  we should discuss it in the next meeting , or user interface: Need to collect information .  , what is most important in a in a remote control ? What is the most important function aspect ?  . project manager: You won't user interface: Or or you can say for example ,  I want  to list all the programme tonight . Y you know , instead of  remote control it's doing the some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . project manager: I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . user interface: No , because no , project manager: S user interface: it's not very a lot . industrial designer: I I think if you want t to choose  from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use  w  I dunno marketing: I'm a okay . marketing:  the main  function of remote control is to have something in the hand project manager: In the hand . marketing: If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog user interface: Yeah . marketing: if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . industrial designer: marketing:  we have some or something , different technology but project manager: This is it's user interface: Yeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that  there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea project manager: industrial designer: but I I think that technically it would be  a little bit   more tricky to to achieve this than just to user interface: No . They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . user interface: And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons . industrial designer: Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to  navigate  through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so project manager: This is good idea . Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? industrial designer: Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen user interface: Good idea . industrial designer: and just  with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f user interface: I think I think that will be revol revolutionary . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: Because all the T_V_  the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . So I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff user interface: Okay . project manager: So we have five minutes to user interface: Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . project manager: Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we industrial designer: user interface: Five minutes . marketing: And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of user interface: Okay . marketing: So , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark  some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . industrial designer: Oh right so user interface: Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: Be before before writing you can  sit and that says what we what we said user interface:  . So so the most functional des  the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . The user can choose w which one they want , right ? industrial designer: Yeah , by content or by channel , user interface: By content or by channel . user interface: Okay , so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content . industrial designer: I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so user interface: Okay . And  industrial designer: I think that's the the things to do user interface: The main thing . user interface: So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get  the funct this is the functional designer ? That's the first aspect . project manager: So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ? And we'll discuss the other other aspects "

        "Query": "What is the current status of the digits data and what additional assignments were proposed?",
        "Summary": "The test set of digits data, which is almost finished and spans two hours, is nearing completion. Currently, digit extraction has been carried out on approximately half of this data. Moving forward, there are plans to explore the reading of digits in various prosodic groupings as part of future work.",
        "Article": " , why don't we s again start off with with , Yeah , I 'll get it . And then , given that , Liz and Andreas are gonna be ten , fifteen minutes late , we can try to figure out what we can do most effectively without them here .  , what else ? grad f:  professor d:  What 's SmartKom ? SmartKom ? grad f: we wanna talk about if w if we wanna add the data to the mar Meeting Recorder corpus . professor d: What what what are we collecting here ? phd e: Data ? grad f: So why don't we have that on the agenda and we 'll we 'll get to it and talk about it ? phd e: The SmartKom data ? professor d: Yeah , right . I think it was Andreas wanted to talk about segmentation and recognition , and update on SRI recognition experiments . professor d:  grad f: And then if ti if there 's time I wanted to talk about digits , but it looked like we were pretty full , so I can wait till next week . I think the a certainly the segmentation and recognition we wanna maybe focus on when An - Andreas is here since that was particularly his thing . phd e: And also the SmartKom thing should b professor d: SmartKom also , Andreas . professor d:  So , I think they 'll be inter I 'll be interested in all this , but but , probably , if we had to pick something that we would talk on for ten minutes or so while they 're coming here . Or I guess it would be , you think , reorganization status , or ? grad f: Yeah . phd b: maybe I said maybe we said this before just that we met and we talked about it and we sort of have a plan for getting things organized and postdoc a: And I and I think a crucial part of that is the idea of of not wanting to do it until right before the next level zero back - up so that there won't be huge number of of added , phd b: Right . Not not much @ @ grad f: Although Dave basically said that if we wanna do it , just tell him and he 'll do a d level zero then . phd b: Oh , so maybe we should just go ahead and get everything ready , and grad f: Yep . So , I think we do need to talk a little bit about Well , we don't need to do it during this meeting . So , naming conventions and things like that , that I 've been trying to keep actually up to date . postdoc a: I 'm sorry , you 've been what ? Showing them ? professor d: OK . Well , maybe  , since that that was a pretty short one , maybe we should talk about the IBM transcription status . So , we ,  we did another version of the beeps , where we separated each beeps with a spoken digit . Chuck came up here and recorded some di himself speaking some digits , and so it just goes \" beep one beep \" and then the phrase , and then \" beep two beep \" and then the phrase .  , I think they 'll have a b easier time keeping track of where they are in the file . grad f: And we did it with the automatic segmentation , and I don't think We ne we didn't look at it in detail . phd b: And grad f: I sorta spot - checked here and there and it sounded pretty good . grad f: And , we 'll just hafta see what we get back from them .  phd b: And the main thing will be if we can align what they give us with what we sent them . phd b: And I think we 'll be able to do that at with this new beep format . grad f: so the problem wi last time is that there were errors in the transcripts where they put beeps where there weren't any , or and they put in extraneous beeps . phd b: Yeah , one interesting note is  , or problem I dunno if this was just because of how I play it back , I say , SND - play and then the file , every once in a while , @ @  , like a beep sounds like it 's cut into two beeps . phd b: Yeah , and I I dunno if that 's an , artifact of playback phd e: Yeah . But with this new format , that hopefully they 're not hearing that , and if they are , it shouldn't throw them . grad f: Well , maybe we better listen to it again , make sure , but , certainly the software shouldn't do that , phd b: Yeah . phd b: I it 's probably just , you know , mmm , somehow the audio device gets hung for a second , phd e: Yeah . phd e: Yeah ? postdoc a: As long as they have one number , and they know that there 's only one beep maximum that goes with that number . postdoc a: Well , you know , actually , are we having them phd b: So th grad f: \" Seven four eight beep seven beep eight three two \" . postdoc a: Yeah , but are we having them do digits ? grad f: Yes . Because , we don't we didn't In order to cut them out we 'd have to listen to it . phd b: We can we can ignore it when we get it back , grad f: Although we could tell them we could tell them , if you hear someone reading a digits string just say \" bracket digit bracket \" phd b: huh . That 'd be what I 'm having the transcribers here do , cuz it can be extracted later . And then I wanted to talk about but as I said I we may not have time what we should do about digits . professor d: Le - let 's talk about it , because that 's that 's something that I I know Andreas is less interested in than Liz is , grad f: OK . It 's good grad f: Do we have anything else to say about transcription ? About IBM stuff ? phd b: Brian I I sent bresset sent Brian a message about the meeting and I haven't heard back yet .  , how 're we doing on the on the rest of it ? postdoc a: We 're doing well . postdoc a: And , I 've prepared , a set of five which I 'm which I 'm calling set two , which are now being edited by my head transcriber , in terms of spelling errors and all that . She 's also checking through and mar and and monitoring , the transcription of another transcriber . postdoc a: And , I 've moved on now to what I 'm calling set three . I sort of thought if I do it in sets groups of five , then I can have , like , sort of a a parallel processing through through the the current . postdoc a: And and you indicated to me that we have a g a goal now , for the for the , the , DARPA demo , of twenty hours . So , I 'm gonna go up to twenty hours , be sure that everything gets processed , and released , and and that 's that 's what my goal is . Package of twenty hours right now , and then once that 's done , move on to the next . But I guess the other thing is that , that that 's kinda twenty hours ASAP because the longer before the demo we actually have the twenty hours , the more time it 'll be for people to actually do cool things with it . And and I don't think it 's possible , really , to do this full - time , but , that what it shows is motivation to do as many hours as possible . professor d: Yeah , I guess the So the difference if if , if the IBM stuff works out , the difference in the job would be that they p primarily would be checking through things that were already done by someone else ? postdoc a: Again . We 'll we 'll expect that they 'll have to move some time bins and do some corrections . postdoc a: And I you know , I 've also d  , discovered So with the new transcriber I 'm  So  , lemme say that my ,  So ,  At present , the people have been doing these transcriptions a channel at a time . And , that sort of , is useful , and t you know , and then once in a while they 'll have to refer to the other channels to clear something up . Well , I realize that , w i we we 're using the pre - segmented version , and , the pre - segmented version is extremely useful , and wouldn't it be , useful also to have the visual representation of those segments ? And so I 've  , I , I 've trained the new one  , the new the newest one , to , use the visual from the channel that is gonna be transcribed at any given time . Because what happens then , is you scan across the signal and once in a while you 'll find a blip that didn't show up in the pre - segmentation . postdoc a: And that 'll be something like I it 's ver it 's interesting . A backchannel , or postdoc a: Once in a while it 's a backchannel . postdoc a: Sometimes it seems to be , similar to the ones that are being picked up . postdoc a: And they 're rare events , but you can really go through a meeting very quickly . You just you just , you know , yo you s you scroll from screen to screen , looking for blips . And , I think that we 're gonna end up with ,  better coverage of the backchannels , professor d: Yeah . postdoc a: but at the same time we 're benefitting tremendously from the pre - segmentation because there are huge places where there is just absolutely no activity at all . phd b: So they can they can , scroll through that pretty quick ? postdoc a: Yeah . So I think that that 's gonna , also eh , you know , speed the efficiency of this part of the process . grad f: so , we have a whole bunch of digits that we 've read and we have the forms and so on , but only a small number of that ha well , not a small number only a subset of that has been transcribed . And , Liz and Andreas actually they 're not here , but , they did say at one point that they thought they could do a pretty good job of just doing a forced alignment . And , again , I don't think we 'll be able to do with that alone , because , sometimes people correct themselves and things like that . But so , I was just wondering what people thought about how automated can we make the process of finding where the people read the digits , doing a forced alignment , and doing the timing . What about just actually doing recognition ? grad f: Well , we we know what they read , because we have the forms . phd b: Right , Morgan ? professor d:  phd b: Is that what you 're ? professor d: Yeah , I 'm I 'm not quite sure what I 'm talking about . And , there 's the issue that that they we know what what was said , but do we ? grad f: so one option i professor d: Because people make mistakes and stuff . I was just asking , just out of curiosity , if if with , the SRI recognizer getting one percent word error , would we would we do better ? So , if you do a forced alignment but the force but the but the transcription you have is wrong because they actually made mistakes , or false starts , it 's it 's much less c it 's much less common than one percent ? grad f: But that 's pretty uncommon . grad f: Well , I guess yeah , I guess if we segmented it , we could get one percent on digits . I 'm not saying it should be one way or the other , but it 's If grad f: But , Well , there there 're a couple different of doing it . You know , they 're doing it anyway , and unless we tell them different , they 're gonna transcribe it . professor d: Well grad f: And my my tendency right now is , well , if IBM comes back with this meeting and the transcript is good , just let them do it . professor d: Yeah , it 's Y you raised a point , kind of , euphemistically but , m maybe it is a serious problem . Ho - what will they do when they go hear \" beep seven beep seven three five two \"  , you think they 'll we 'll get ? grad f: It 's pretty distinct . postdoc a: Well it it well , it 'd be preceded by \" I 'm reading transcript so - and - so \" ? phd b: Yeah . postdoc a: So , I think if they 're processing it at grad f: it 'll be it will be in the midst of a digit string . grad f: So  it sure , there there might be a place where it 's \" beep seven beep eight beep eight beep \" . But , you know , they they 're they 're gonna macros for inserting the beep marks . We 'll have to see , but I don't think it 's gonna be a problem . Well , I I I dunno , I I think that that 's if they are in fact going to transcribe these things , certainly any process that we 'd have to correct them , or whatever is needs to be much less elaborate for digits than for other stuff . grad f: We have so many of them , and it 'd be nice to actually do something with them . Yeah , I phd i: You mean there 're more than ten ? grad f: Anything else ? Your mike is a little low there . So ,  You you have to go a little early , right ? At twenty phd i: Well , I can stay till about , three forty . professor d: So there was some  In in Adam 's agenda list , he had something from you about segmentation this last recognition ? phd i: Well , yeah . phd i: so , we had a discussion Don and Liz and I had discussion last week about how to proceed with , you know , with Don 's work , phd e: Ch phd i: and and and , one of the obvious things that occur to us was that we 're since we now have Thilo 's segmenter and it works , you know , amazingly well , we should actually basically re - evaluate the recognition , results using you know , without cheating on the segmentations . phd e: So phd i: And , that should be fairly phd e: And how do we find the transcripts for those so that ? Yeah . So , there 's actually phd e: It 's not that phd i: Why do you ask ? grad f: I could phd i: No , actually , NIST has ,  m a fairly sophisticated scoring program that you can give a ,  a time , grad f: Hand ones . phd i:  You know , you basically just give two time - marked sequences of words , and it computes the  the ,  you know , the the th phd b: It does all the work for you . phd i: So , it we just and we use that actually in Hub - five to do the scoring . phd e: So , basically you give some time constraints for for the references and for for the hypothesis , phd i: So , we ha Yeah . phd g: Maybe the start of your speech and the end of it , phd i: So do phd e: OK .  , so that was the one thing , and the other was that ,  What was the other problem ? Oh ! That Thilo wanted to use the recognizer alignments to train up his , speech detector . phd i: so that we could use ,  you know there wouldn't be so much hand labelling needed to ,  to generate training data for for the speech detector . phd i: So , you can you can phd b: It 'll give you a lot more data , too . So , it 's basically s I think , eight meetings or something which which I 'm using , and , it 's before it was twenty minutes of one meeting . phd i: That won't be perfect the alignments aren't perfect , phd e: Yeah . But phd i: but , it 's probably still better to have all this extra data , than phd g: Yeah . If you find that you can lower the false alarms that you get where there 's no speech , that would be useful for us to know . So , r right now you get f fal you know , false false , speech regions when it 's just like , breath or something like that , phd e: OK . phd g: and I 'd be interested to know the wha if you retrain  , phd e: Yeah . I 'll can make an can , like , make a c comparison of of the old system to the to the new one , and then phd g: Yeah , just to see if by doing nothing in the modeling of just having that training data wh what happens . professor d:  another one that we had on Adam 's agenda that definitely involved you was s something about SmartKom ? grad f: Right . So , Rob Porzel eh , Porzel ? and the ,  Porzel and the , SmartKom group are collecting some dialogues . grad f: Basically they have one person sitting in here , looking at a picture , and a wizard sitting in another room somewhere . And , it involves starting I believe starting with a It 's it 's always the wizard , but it starts where the wizard is pretending to be a computer and it goes through a , speech generation system . And they wanted to use this equipment , and so the w question came up , is well , here 's some more data . Should this be part of the corpus or not ? And my attitude was yes , because there might be people who are using this corpus for acoustics , as opposed to just for language . So , I just wanted to understand it , cuz I I 'm  , hadn't quite followed this process . So , it 's wizard in the sen usual sense that the person who is asking the questions doesn't know that it 's , a machi not a machine ? phd i: Right . phd i: Actually actually , w w the the We do this I dunno who came up with it , but I think it 's a really clever idea . We simulate a computer breakdown halfway through the session , and so then after that , the person 's told that they 're now talking to a ,  to a human . grad f: But of course they don't know that it 's the same person both times . phd i: So , we we collect we collect both human - computer and human - human data , essentially , in the same session . professor d: You might wanna try collecting it the other way around sometime , saying that th the computer isn't up yet postdoc a:  . professor d: and then so then you can separate it out whether it 's the beginning or end kind of effects . \" phd b: It 's a lot more believable , too , grad f: \" No ! \" phd b: if you tell them that they 're the computer part is running on a Windows machine . grad f: Abort abort , retry , fail ? phd g: So did they actually save the far - field data ? phd e: Yes . phd g: Cuz at first they weren't they weren't sa phd i: Yeah . grad f: and I said , \" well that 's silly , if if we 're gonna try to do it for a corpus , there might be people who are interested in acoustics . professor d: S phd e: We wer we just wanted to do phd i: No , the the question is do we save one or two far - field channels or all of them ? phd g: Right . professor d:  grad f: That that if we have someone who is doing acoustic studies , it 's nice to have the same for every recording . phd i: It 's to be traini to b training data and development data for the SmartKom system . phd b: Where does this ? professor d:  phd g: Maybe we can have him vary the microphones , too , professor d: Well , phd e: B phd g: or they 're different s speakers . grad f: Right ? phd e: But but I 'm not sure about the legal aspect of of that . phd e: What they or , is is that our data which we are collecting here , professor d: We 've never signed anything that said that we couldn't use anything that we did . professor d: I L look , it seems to me that if we 're doing it anyway and we 're doing it for these these purposes that we have , and we have these distant mikes , we definitely should re should save it all as long as we 've got disk space , phd i:   professor d: So should we save it ? grad f: And then professor d: Now th Yeah . professor d: anybody who 's training something up could choose to put it eh , to u include this or not . But it 's some other data we have , and if somebody doing experiment wants to train up including that then they can . grad f: So it 's It it I guess it the begs the question of what is the meeting corpus . So if , at UW they start recording two - person hallway conversations is that part of the meeting corpus ? professor d: I think it 's I I think I th think the idea of two or more people conversing with one another is key . phd g: What if we just give it a a name like we give these meetings a name ? professor d: No , it doesn't . phd g: And then later on some people will consider it a meeting and some people won't , postdoc a: Well this professor d: Yeah . So so s so part of the reason that I wanted to bring this up is , do we wanna handle it as a special case or do we wanna fold it in , phd g: and Just give it a title . professor d: I think it is a s grad f: we give everyone who 's involved as their own user ID , give it session I Ds , let all the tools that handle Meeting Recorder handle it , or do we wanna special case it ? And if we were gonna special case it , who 's gonna do that ? phd e: So . phd i: Well , it it makes sense to handle it with the same infrastructure , since we don't want to duplicate things unnecessarily . phd e: It it it postdoc a: I think phd i: But as far as distributing it , we shouldn't label it as part of this meeting corpus . phd i: We should let it be its own corp postdoc a: Well it 's it well , because grad f: I don't see why not . professor d: It 's scenario - based , it 's it 's human - computer interface it 's really pretty different . professor d: But I I I have no problem with somebody folding it in for some experiment they 're gonna do , but I don't think i it it doesn't match anything that we 've described about meetings . professor d: Whereas everything that we talked about them doing at at UW and so forth really does . So w so what does that mean for how we are gonna organize things ? postdoc a:  . professor d: You can you can Again , as as I think Andreas was saying , if you wanna use the same tools and the same conventions , there 's no problem with that . It 's just that it 's , you know , different directory , it 's called something different , it 's you know . Right ? grad f: Yeah , but those are folded in , phd i: It might also be potentially confusing . grad f: and just simply in the file you mark somewhere that this is this type of interaction , rather than another type of interaction . phd i: Yeah , I th professor d: Well , I don I wouldn't call reading digits \" meetings \" . Right ?  , we we we were doing grad f: Well , but but , I put it under the same directory tree . professor d: Well grad f: You know , it 's in \" user doctor speech data MR \" . phd g: Can we just have a directory called , like , \" other stuff \" ? grad f: Other . My preference is to have a single procedure so that I don't have to think too much about things . professor d: O - You you can use whatever procedure you want that 's p convenient for you . grad f: If we do it any other way that means that we need a separate procedure , and someone has to do that . professor d: All I 'm saying is that there 's no way that we 're gonna tell people that reading digits is meetings . And similarly we 're not gonna tell them that someone talking to a computer to get travel information is meetings . But if it makes it easier for you to pu fold them in the same procedures and have them under the same directory tree , knock yourself out . phd b: There 's a couple other questions that I have too , professor d: You know ? phd b: and and one of them is , what about , consent issues ? And the other one is , what about transcription ? Are ? phd e: Transcription is done in Munich . phd i: That 's a that 's another argument to keep it separate , because it 's gonna follow the SmartKom transcription conventions and not the ICSI meeting transcription conventions . But I 'm sure no one would have a problem with our folding it in for some acoustic modeling or or some things . Do we h do we have , American - born folk , reading German German , pla  , place names and so forth ? Is that ? phd e: Yeah . professor d: Heidelberg grad f: So phd i: Exactly grad f: Disk might eventually be an issue so we might we we might need to , get some more disk pretty soon . grad f: We 're probably a little more than that because we 're using up some space that we shouldn't be on . So , once everything gets converted over to the disks we 're supposed to be using we 'll be probably , seventy - five percent . phd b: Well , when I was looking for space for Thilo , I found one disk that had , I think it was nine gigs and another one had seventeen .  grad f: Were those backed - up or non - backed - up ? phd b: Those were non - backed - up . The non - backed - up , phd b: I haven't looked to see how much of that we have . So , pretty much anytime we need a disk , we can get it at the rate that we 're phd i: You can I shouldn't be saying this , but , you can just you know , since the back - ups are every night , you can recycle the backed - up diskspace . professor d:  Yeah , I me and there 's been this conversation going on about getting another file server , and and we can do that . professor d: We 'll take the opportunity and get another big raft of of disk , I guess . phd i: Well , I think I think there 's an argument for having you know , you could use our old file server for for disks that have data that is very rarely accessed , and then have a fast new file server for data that is , heavily accessed . It 's the back it 's the back - up capaci grad f: It 's the back - up system . phd b: I think I think the file server could become an issue as we get a whole bunch more new compute machines . phd b: And we 've got , you know , fifty machines trying to access data off of Abbott at once . phd i: I think I think we 've raised this before and someone said this is not a reliable way to do it , but the What about putting the stuff on , like , C - CD - ROM or DVD or something ? grad f: Yeah . The the th phd i: But they wear out just from sitting on the shelf ? grad f: Yep . grad f: But the r the write once , and the read - writes , don't last . postdoc a: Would it be ? professor d: Year or two ? grad f: Yep . phd i: But if that then you would think you 'd hear much more clamoring about data loss phd e: Yeah . phd i: and professor d: yeah , all the L grad f: I I don't know many people who do it on CD .  , they 're the most fo professor d: LDC - all the LDC distributions are on CD - ROM . grad f: They 're on CD , but they 're not tha that 's not the only source . But if you go if you go k phd i: But , you know , we have phd g: But we have like thirty you know , from ten years ago ? professor d: We have all sorts of CD - ROMs from a long time ago . grad f: The the pressed ones last for phd g: usually they 're grad f: well , not forever , they 've been finding even those degrade . grad f: But , the burned ones  , when I say two or three years what I 'm saying is that I have had disks which are gone in a year . phd g: That 's what I grad f: On the average , it 'll probably be three or four years . But ,  I I you don't want to per p have your only copy on a media that fails . phd i: So how about ? So so how about putting them on that plus , like on a on on DAT or some other medium that isn't risky ? grad f: I think th  , we can already put them on tape . Well , if if if you if they last Say , they actually last , like , five years , huh , in in the typical case , and and occasionally you might need to recreate one , and then you get your tape out , but otherwise you don't . Can't you just you just put them on ? grad h: So you just archive it on the tape , and then put it on CD as well ? phd i: Yeah . phd b: What 'd be nice is a system that re - burned the C Ds every year . professor d: Well grad f: Well , the C Ds are are an op phd e: Yeah . professor d: You know I would think grad f: So for archiving , we 'll just use tape . phd i: One one thing I don't understand is , if you have the data if if you if the meeting data is put on disk exactly once , then it 's backed - up once and the back - up system should never have to bother with it , more than once . grad f: Well , regardless Well , first of all there was , a problem with the archive in that I was every once in a while doing a chmod on all the directories an or recursive chmod and chown , because they weren't getting set correctly every once in a while , phd i:   grad f: and I was just , doing a minus R star , not realizing that that caused it to be re - backed - up . phd i: But but this back - up system is smart enough to figure out that something hasn't changed and doesn't need to be backed - up again . professor d: The b I think th the at least the once tha that you put it on , it would it would kill that . grad f: Sure , but we still have enough changed that the nightly back - ups are starting to take too long . So , what if we buy , what what do they call these ,  high density ? grad f: Well , why don't you have this have a this conversation with Dave Johnson tha rather than with me ? phd i: No , no . Because this is maybe something that we can do without involving Dave , and and , putting more burden on him . How about we buy , one of these high density tape drives ? And we put the data actually on non - backed - up disks . And we do our own back - up once and for all all , and then and we don't have to bother this @ @ up ? grad f: Actually , you know , we could do that just with the tape with the current tape . What kind of tape drive is it ? grad f: I dunno but it 's an automatic robot so it 's very convenient . phd i: Is it is ? professor d: Wh The o the one that we have ? grad f: You just run a program to restore them . phd i: But it might interfere with their back - up schedule , phd g: But professor d: No , we have s we Don't we have our own ? phd i: eh . professor d: Something wi th that doesn't that isn't used by the back - up gang ? Don't we have something downstairs ? postdoc a: Well they phd b: What kinda tape drive ? professor d: Just in ? Yeah . So your your point is , and I think it 's a good one , that we could just get more disk and put it there . professor d: Yeah , that 's basically what I was gonna say , is that a disk is is so cheap it 's es essentially , you know , close to free . professor d: And we can take care of that by putting it on non - back up drives and just backing it up once onto this tape . phd g: So , who 's gonna do these back - ups ? The people that collect it ? grad f:  Well , I 'll talk to Dave , and and see what th how what the best way of doing that is . phd b: It 's probably gonna n grad f: There 's a little utility that will manually burn a tape for you , and that 's probably the right way to do it . That 's what I 'm wondering , if grad f: Well we 're g we 're gonna automate that . phd g: you don't have to physically put a tape in the drive ? grad f: No . phd i: Yeah , but then you 're effectively using the resources of the back - up system . phd i: Yeah , just give a dedi grad f: It we already have it there and it it 's phd i: Well , I 'm saying is @ @ i if you go to Dave , and and and ask him \" can I use your tape robot ? \" , he will say , \" well that 's gonna screw up our back - up operation . He 'll say \" if if that means that it 's not gonna be backed - up standardly , great . phd g: What about if the times overlap with the normal back - up time ? grad f: it 's it 's just it 's just a utility which queues up . grad f: And then you can tell it to then remove it from the disk or you can , you know , do it a a few days later or whatever you wanna do , after you confirm that it 's really backed - up . grad f: NW ? postdoc a: You saying NW archive ? grad f: NW archive . postdoc a: Yep And if you did that during the day it would never make it to the nightly back - ups . phd i: Well , it if he you have to put the data on a on a non - backed - up disk to begin with . postdoc a: Well , but you can have it NW archive to you can have , a non - backed - up disk NW archived , grad f: Right . phd i: So that so that otherwise you don't you postdoc a: and it 'll never show up on the nightly back - ups . grad f: So , that means we 'll probably wanna convert all all those files filesystems to non - backed - up media . professor d: another , thing on the agenda said SRI recognition experiments ? What 's that ? phd i: SRI recognition ? Oh . Chuck , do you have any any updates ? phd b: N I 'm successfully , increasing the error rate . So ,  I 'm just playing with , the number of Gaussians that we use in the the recognizer , and phd i: Well , you have to sa you have to tell people that you 're you 're doing you 're trying the tandem features . It sai because  , the meeting before , you said \" OK , we got it down to where they 're they 're within a tenth of a percent \" . phd i: So so , when So I I had I ha grad f: That was a quick response . phd i: So , we had reached the point where phd g: I 'm well rehearsed . phd i: we had reached the point where , on the male portion of the development set , the ,  or one of the development sets , I should say the ,  the male error rate with , ICSI PLP features was pretty much identical with , SRI features . phd i: So , phd g: Is there less training data ? phd i:  phd g: we don phd i: No , actually there 's more training data . So ,  so then  Oh , and plus the the vocal tract length normalization didn't actually made things worse . phd i: So So professor d: So but you see , now , between between the males and the females , there 's certainly a much bigger difference in the scaling range , than there is , say , just within the males . And what you were using before was scaling factors that were just from the the m the SRI front - end . professor d: but now you 're looking over a larger range and it may not be so fine . phd i: Well ,  So I just d so the one thing that I then tried was to put in the low - pass filter , which we have in the So , most most Hub - five systems actually band - limit the  , at about , thirty - seven hundred , hertz . So ,  And I 'm now , trying the Oh , and suddenly , also the v the vocal tract length normalization only in the test se on the test data . So , you can do vocal tract length normalization on the test data only or on both the training and the test . phd i: And you expect it to help a little bit if you do it only on the test , and s more if you do it on both training and test . phd i: And so the It now helps , if you do it only on the test , and I 'm currently retraining another set of models where it 's both in the training and the test , and then we 'll we 'll have , hopefully , even better results . So But there 's It looks like there will still be some difference , maybe between one and two percent , for the females . phd i: And it is true that the ,  that the you know , we are using the But it can't be just the VTL , professor d:  - huh . phd i: because if you don't do VTL in both systems , you know , the the females are considerably worse in the with the PLP features . phd g: Well , what 's the standard ? Yeah , so I thought the performance was actually a little better on females than males . phd i: that ye overall , yes , but on this particular development test set , they 're actually a little worse . We 're looking at the discrepancy between the SRI system and the SRI system when trained with ICSI features . I 'm just wondering if that if if you have any indication of your standard features , grad f: What 's Are the freq ? phd g: you know , if that 's also different or in the same direction or not . professor d: You 're This is lemme ask a q more basic que phd g: Cuz professor d: is this , iterative , Baum - Welch training ? phd i:   professor d: Or is it Viterbi training ? Or ? phd i: It 's Baum - Welch training . And how do you determine when to to stop iterating ? phd i:  Well , actually , we we just basically do a s a fixed number of iterations .  , which Eh , we used to do only three , and then we found out we can squeeze And it was basically , we 're s we 're keeping it on the safe side . It might be that one more iteration would would help , but it 's sort of professor d: Or maybe or maybe you 're doing one too many . professor d:  it 's it 's phd i: No , but with Baum - Welch , there shouldn't be an over - fitting issue , really . grad f: Well , you can try each one on a cross - validation set , phd i:  . professor d: It d if you if you remember some years ago Bill Byrne did a thing where he was he was looking at that , grad f: can't you ? professor d: and he showed that you could get it . We can Well , that 's that 's the easy one to check , professor d: Yeah . phd i: because we save all the intermediate models grad f: Do you ? phd i: and we can professor d: And in each case , ho grad f: What ? professor d: I 'm sorry in each case how do you determine , you know , the the usual fudge factors ? The ,  the , language , scaling , acoustic scaling ,  phd i:  I  I 'm actually re - optimizing them . And the pru the question he was asking at one point about pruning ,  Remember that one ? phd i: Pruning ? professor d: Well , he was he 's it looked like the probabil at one point he was looking at the probabilities he was getting out at the likelihoods he was getting out of PLP versus mel cepstrum , and they looked pretty different , phd i: Pruning in the ? phd b: Yeah , the likelihoods were lower for the PLP . professor d: And so , there 's the question phd i: I you mean did you see this in the SRI system ? phd b:   Well , the likelihoods are phd b: and phd i: You can't directly compare them , because , for every set of models you compute a new normalization . professor d: But , still it 's a question phd i: So professor d: if you have some threshold somewhere in terms of beam search or something , phd b: Well , yeah .   phd b: if you have one threshold that works well because the range of your likelihoods is in this area phd i: We prune very conservatively .  , as we saw with the meeting data ,  we could probably tighten the pruning without really So we we basically we have a very open beam . professor d: Right ? Here we 're - we 're saying that we there gee , there 's this b eh , there 's this difference here . Right ? But but but but , let 's suppose just for a second that , we 've sort of taken out a lot of the the major differences , between the two . professor d: we 're already sort of using the mel scale and we 're using the same style filter integration , and and , well , we 're making sure that low and high phd i: Actually , there is the difference in that . grad f: And what 's the top frequency of each ? phd i: Well , now it 's the same . But professor d: Before we i i th with straight PLP , it 's trapezoidal also . phd i: Well But professor d: But then we had a slight difference in the in the scale . phd i: Since currently the Feacalc program doesn't allow me to change the filter shape independently of the scale . phd i: And , I did the experiment on the SRI front - end where I tried the y where the standard used to be to use trapezoidal filters . So , it 's not I don't think the filter shape by itself will make a huge difference . professor d: So , f i We 've always viewed it , anyway , as the major difference between the two , is actually in the smoothing , that the that the , PLP , and and the reason PLP has been advantageous in , slightly noisy situations is because , PLP does the smoothing at the end by an auto - regressive model , phd i:   So one thing I haven't done yet is to actually do all of this with a much larger with our full training set . So right now , we 're using a I don't know , forty ? I i it 's it 's eh it 's a f training set that 's about , you know , by a factor of four smaller than what we use when we train the full system . phd i: And the Baum - Welch should be much less of a factor , if you go full whole hog . phd i: And so , w so , just  so the strategy is to first sort of treat things with fast turn - around on a smaller training set and then , when you 've sort of , narrowed it down , you try it on a larger training set . professor d: Now the other que related question , though , is is , what 's the boot models for these things ? phd i: Th - th the boot models are trained from scratch . So we compute ,  So , we start with a , alil alignment that we computed with the b sort of the best system we have . So we com we do a , you know , w  We collect the  , the observations from those alignments under each of the feature sets that that we train . And then , from there we do ,  There 's a lot of , actually The way it works , you first train a phonetically - tied mixture model . And then from that you you do the you you go to a state - clustered model , professor d: Yeah . This it migh Th - the thought is is is possible another possible partial cause is if the boot models used a comple used a different feature set , that phd i:   phd i: Yeah , but professor d: you know , they they will find boundaries a little differently , though You know , all th all that sort of thing is actually slightly different . I 'd expect it to be a minor effect , phd i: But but but , what I 'm what I 'm saying is professor d: but phd i: So , we e w f w For a long time we had used boot alignments that had been trained with a with the same front - end but with acoustic models that were , like , fifteen percent worse than what we use now . phd i: And with a dict different dictionary with a considerably different dictionary , which was much less detailed and much less well - suited . phd i: And so , then we switched to new boot alignments , which which now had the benefit of all these improvements that we 've made over two years in the system . phd i: So , what I 'm saying is , the exact nature of these boot alignments is probably not a big factor in the quality of the final models . But it it I st still see it as  , there 's there 's a history to this , too , phd i: Yeah . professor d: but but I I I th I think it could be the things that it the data is being viewed in a certain way , that a beginning is here rather than there and so forth , phd i: Yeah . Anyway , I I I should really reserve , any conclusions until we 've done it on the large training set , and until we 've seen the results with the with the VTL in training . At some point you also might wanna take the same thing and try it on , some Broadcast News data or something else that actually has has some noisy noisy components , so we can see if any conclusions we come to holds across different data . grad h:  ! professor d: So , is there something quick about Absinthe that you ? phd i: With this said . Just what we were talking about before , which is that I ported a Blass library to Absinthe , and then got got it working with fast - forward , and got a speedup roughly proportional to the number of processors times the clock cycle . grad f: I 'm in the process of doing it for Quicknet , but there 's something going wrong and it 's about half the speed that I was estimating it should be , and I 'm not sure why . But the what it means is that it 's likely that for net training and forward passes , we 'll Absinthe will be a good machine . phd i: A few more processors ? How many are you shooting for ? grad f: There 're five now . grad f: And it 's also five - fifty megahertz and you can get a gigahertz . phd i: Can you mix t  , processors of different speed ? grad f: I don't think so . grad f: We 'd have to get a almost certainly have to get a , Netfinity server . And , so , these are the demos for the  , July , meeting and ,  DARPA mee grad f: July what ? Early July ? Late July ? professor d: Oh , I think it 's July fifteenth . So , we talked about getting something together for that , but maybe ,  maybe we 'll just put that off for now , given that But I think maybe we should have a a sub - meeting , I think , probably , Adam and and , Chuck and me should talk about should get together and talk about that sometime soon . Gets our grad f: Which is gonna be a little hard for a couple people because we have different digits forms . So , the idea is just to read each line with a short pause between lines , grad c: Alright . grad f: not between And , since we 're in a hurry , we were just gonna read everyone all at once <doc-sep>What are we talking about today ? phd e: well , first there are perhaps these  Meeting Recorder digits that we tested . professor a: And for one thing that that sure shows the difference between having a lot of  training data or not , phd e: Of data ? Yeah . professor a: the  The best kind of number we have on the English  on near microphone only is is  three or four percent . professor a: And  it 's significantly better than that , using fairly simple front - ends on on the   , with the SRI system . professor a: So I th I think that the  But that 's that 's using  a a pretty huge amount of data , mostly not digits , of course , but but then again Well , yeah . In fact , mostly not digits for the actual training the H M Ms whereas  in this case we 're just using digits for training the H M phd e: Yeah . professor a: Did anybody mention about whether the the SRI system is a is is doing the digits  the wor as a word model or as  a sub s sub - phone states ? phd e: I guess it 's it 's  allophone models , professor a: Yeah . There is one difference Well , the SRI system the result for the SRI system that are represented here are with adaptation . So there is It 's their complete system and including on - line  unsupervised adaptation . phd e: And if you don't use adaptation , the error rate is around fifty percent worse , I think , if I remember . professor a: It 's tha it 's that much , huh ? phd e: Nnn . professor a: But but  what what I think I 'd be interested to do given that , is that we we should  take I guess that somebody 's gonna do this , right ? is to take some of these tandem things and feed it into the SRI system , right ? phd e: Yeah . Our back - end is is fairly simple but until now , well , the attempts to improve it or have fail Ah , well ,   what Chuck tried to to to do professor a: Yeah , but he 's doing it with the same data , right ?  so to So there 's there 's there 's two things being affected . One is that that , you know , there 's something simple that 's wrong with the back - end . professor a:  I I don't know if he got to the point of playing with the  number of Gaussians yet phd e:   So , yeah , we could retrain some of these tandem on on huge professor a: Well , you could do that , but I 'm saying even with it not with that part not retrained , just just using having the H M Ms much better H M phd e: Ah , yeah . But what would be interesting to see also is what what perhaps it 's not related , the amount of data but the  recording conditions . Because it 's probably not a problem of noise , because our features are supposed to be robust to noise . phd e: It 's not a problem of channel , because there is  normalization with respect to the channel . What what is the problem that you 're trying to explain ? phd e: The the fact that the result with the tandem and Aurora system are  so much worse . professor a: I  but I 'm I 'm almost certain that it it  , that it has to do with the  amount of training data . professor a: But but having a huge If if you look at what commercial places do , they use a huge amount of data .  , ordinarily you would say \" well , given that you have enough occurrences of the digits , you can just train with digits rather than with , you know \" phd e:   professor a: But the thing is , if you have a huge in other words , do word models But if you have a huge amount of data then you 're going to have many occurrences of similar  allophones . professor a: So it 's  I I think it has to be that , because , as you say , this is , you know , this is near - microphone , phd e:   Now , some of it could be the fact that  let 's see , in the in these multi - train things did we include noisy data in the training ? phd e: Yeah . Well , actually we see that the clean train for the Aurora proposals are are better than the multi - train , professor a: It is if Yeah . phd e: Well , o I guess what I meant is that well , let 's say if we if we add enough data to train on the  on the Meeting Recorder digits , I guess we could have better results than this . What I meant is that perhaps we can learn something  from this , what 's what 's wrong  what what is different between TI - digits and these digits and professor a: What kind of numbers are we getting on TI - digits ? phd e: It 's point eight percent , so . professor a: So in the actual TI - digits database we 're getting point eight percent , phd e: Yeah . professor a: and here we 're getting three or four three , let 's see , three for this ? phd e:   Sure , but  ,  point eight percent is something like double  or triple what people have gotten who 've worked very hard at doing that . professor a: And and also , as you point out , there 's adaptation in these numbers also . So if you , you know , put the ad adap take the adaptation off , then it for the English - Near you get something like two percent . professor a: It 's , you know , we used a simple HTK system with a modest amount of data . And this is a a , you know , modern  system  has has a lot of nice points to it . professor a: But to me it just it just meant a practical point that  if we want to publish results on digits that that people pay attention to we probably should  Cuz we 've had the problem before that you get show some nice improvement on something that 's that 's  ,  it seems like too large a number , and   people don't necessarily take it so seriously . So the three point four percent for this  is is  So why is it It 's an interesting question though , still . Why is why is it three point four percent for the d the digits recorded in this environment as opposed to the  point eight percent for for for the original TI - digits database ?  . So ignore ignoring the the the SRI system for a moment , phd e: I I I don't I   professor a: just looking at the TI - di the  tandem system , if we 're getting point eight percent , which , yes , it 's high . It 's , you know , it it 's not awfully high , phd e:   professor a: Right ?  , there 's even though it 's close - miked there 's still there really is background noise . And  I suspect when the TI - digits were recorded if somebody fumbled or said something wrong or something that they probably made them take it over . professor a: It was not  there was no attempt to have it be realistic in any in any sense at all . TI - digit is it 's very , very clean and it 's like studio recording professor a:   But professor a: It 's I think it 's it 's the indication it 's harder .  , they 're much much better , but still you 're getting something like one point three percent for  things that are same data as in T TI - digits the same same text . And  , I 'm sure the same same system would would get , you know , point point three or point four or something on the actual TI - digits . professor a: Which I find sort of interesting cause I think this is closer to   it 's still read . But I still think it 's much closer to to what what people actually face ,  when they 're they 're dealing with people saying digits over the telephone . I don't think   , I 'm sure they wouldn't release the numbers , but I don't think that  the  the the companies that that do telephone speech get anything like point four percent on their digits . I 'm I 'm I 'm sure they get  , for one thing people do phone up who don't have   Middle America accents and it 's a we we it 's it 's it 's US . professor a: Did we end up giving up on on , any Eurospeech submissions , phd e: But professor a: or ? I know Thilo and Dan Ellis are are submitting something , but  . I I guess e the only thing with these the Meeting Recorder and , well , So , I think , yeah I think we basically gave up . Now , actually for the for the Aur -  phd e: But professor a: we do have stuff for Aurora , right ? Because because we have ano an extra month or something . professor a: and we have We don't we don't have to flood it with papers . Perhaps the point is that we 've been working on is , yeah , we have put the  the good VAD in the system and it really makes a huge difference . I think , yeah , this is perhaps one of the reason why our system was not not the best , because with the new VAD , it 's very the results are similar to the France Telecom results and perhaps even better sometimes . The problem is that it 's very big and we still have to think how to where to put it and  , professor a:   phd e: because it it well , this VAD  either some delay and we if we put it on the server side , it doesn't work , because on the server side features you already have LDA applied from the f from the terminal side and so you accumulate the delay so the VAD should be before the LDA which means perhaps on the terminal side and then smaller and professor a: So wha where did this good VAD come from ? phd e: So . So it 's the network trained it 's the network with the huge amounts on hidden of hidden units , and  nine input frames compared to the VAD that was in the proposal which has a very small amount of hidden units and fewer inputs . Yeah , but they had to get rid of it because of the space , didn't they ? phd e: Yeah . But the abso assumption is that we will be able to make a VAD that 's small and that works fine .  ,  i if if there 's a if if I I don't know what the thinking was amongst the the the the ETSI folk but  if everybody agreed sure let 's use this VAD and take that out of there phd e:   They just want , apparently they don't want to fix the VAD because they think there is some interaction between feature extraction and and VAD or frame dropping But they still want to just to give some  requirement for this VAD because it 's it will not be part of they don't want it to be part of the standard . But I was thinking that that  s \" Sure , there may be some interaction , phd e: Nnn . professor a: but I don't think we need to be stuck on using our or OGI 's VAD .  I designed a new a new filter because when I designed other filters with shorter delay from the LDA filters , there was one filter with fif sixty millisecond delay and the other with ten milliseconds professor a: Right . phd e: and  Hynek suggested that both could have sixty - five sixty - s I think it 's sixty - five . Both should have sixty - five because professor a: You didn't gain anything , right ? phd e: Yeah . phd e: Yeah , and then we 've started to work with this of  voiced - unvoiced stuff . phd e: And next week I think we will perhaps try to have  a new system with   MSG stream also see what what happens . phd d: No , I w I begin to play with Matlab and to found some parameter robust for voiced - unvoiced decision . And we they we found that maybe w is a classical parameter , the sq the variance between the  FFT of the signal and the small spectrum of time we after the  mel filter bank . So , basically we wa want to look at something like the ex the ex excitation signal and professor a: Right . phd d: The the mix of the two , noise and unnoise , and the signal is this . professor a: Well , I 'm s  There 's None of these axes are labeled , so I don't know what this What 's this axis ? phd d:  this is  this axis is nnn , \" frame \" . professor a: And what 's th what this ? phd d: this is  energy , log - energy of the spectrum . Of the this is the variance , the difference between the spectrum of the signal and FFT of each frame of the signal and this mouth spectrum of time after the f may fit for the two , professor a: For this one . phd d: Pity , but I don't have two different professor a: And presumably when there 's a a phd e: So this should the the the t voiced portions . This is trying to obtain with LPC model the spectrum but using Matlab without going factor and s professor a: No pre - emphasis ? Yeah . So now I wonder  , do you want to I know you want to get at something orthogonal from what you get with the smooth spectrum  . But if you were to really try and get a voiced - unvoiced , do you do you want to totally ignore that ?  , do you do you  , clearly a a very big very big cues for voiced - unvoiced come from  spectral slope and so on , right ? phd e:   phd d: if s @ @ val value is indicative that is a voice frame and it 's low values professor a: Yeah . Well , you probably want  , certainly if you want to do good voiced - unvoiced detection , you need a few features . But , you know , people look at at slope and  first auto - correlation coefficient , divided by power . professor a: Or or   there 's  I guess we prob probably don't have enough computation to do a simple pitch detector or something ?  with a pitch detector you could have a have a an estimate of of what the phd e: Mmm . Or maybe you could you just do it going through the P FFT 's figuring out some  probable  harmonic structure . phd d: you have read up and you have a paper , the paper that you s give me yesterday . But Yeah , but it 's not it 's , yeah , it 's it 's another problem . phd e: What 's this again ? Is it the mel - filters ? phd d: Yeah like this . phd e: and what we clearly see is that in some cases , and it clearly appears here , and the the harmonics are resolved by the f Well , there are still appear after mel - filtering , professor a:   phd e: and it happens for high pitched voice because the width of the lower frequency mel - filters is sometimes even smaller than the pitch . phd e: And so what happens is that this  , add additional variability to this envelope and  professor a: Yeah . phd e: so we were thinking to modify the mel - spectrum to have something that that 's smoother on low frequencies . What I was talking about was just , starting with the FFT you could you could  do a very rough thing to estimate estimate  pitch . professor a: And   , given you know , given that ,  you could   come up with some kind of estimate of how much of the low frequency energy was was explained by by   those harmonics . And and so if you if you just you know subtracted off  your guess of the harmonics then something like this would end up with quite a bit lower energy in the first fifteen hundred hertz or so and and our first kilohertz , even . professor a: And  if was  noisy , the proportion that it would go down would be if it was if it was unvoiced or something . What 's up with you ? grad b:  our t I went to talk with  Mike Jordan this this week professor a:   grad b:  and  shared with him the ideas about  extending the Larry Saul work and  I asked him some questions about factorial H M so like later down the line when we 've come up with these these feature detectors , how do we how do we  you know ,  model the time series that that happens  and and we talked a little bit about factorial H M Ms and how  when you 're doing inference or w when you 're doing recognition , there 's like simple Viterbi stuff that you can do for for these H M and the  the great advantages that  a lot of times the factorial H M Ms don't  don't over - alert the problem there they have a limited number of parameters and they focus directly on on  the sub - problems at hand so you can imagine  five or so parallel  features  transitioning independently and then at the end you you  couple these factorial H M Ms with  with  undirected links  based on based on some more data . grad b: So he he seemed he seemed like really interested in in  in this and said said this is this is something very do - able and can learn a lot and  yeah , I 've just been continue reading  about certain things . grad b:  thinking of maybe using   m modulation spectrum stuff to  as features  also in the in the sub - bands professor a:   grad b: because it seems like the modulation  spectrum tells you a lot about the intelligibility of of certain  words and stuff So ,  . And  so I 've been looking at Avendano 's work and   I 'll try to write up in my next stat status report a nice description of what he 's doing , but it 's it 's an approach to deal with reverberation or that the aspect of his work that I 'm interested in the idea is that  normally an analysis frames are  too short to encompass reverberation effects  in full . You miss most of the reverberation tail in a ten millisecond window and so you you 'd like it to be that  the reverberation responses  simply convolved  in , but it 's not really with these ten millisecond frames cuz you j But if you take , say , a two millisecond  window I 'm sorry a two second window then in a room like this , most of the reverberation response is included in the window and the then it  then things are l more linear . It is it is more like the reverberation response is simply c convolved and  and you can use channel normalization techniques like  in his thesis he 's assuming that the reverberation response is fixed . He just does  mean subtraction , which is like removing the DC component of the modulation spectrum and that 's supposed to d  deal  deal pretty well with the  reverberation and  the neat thing is you can't take these two second frames and feed them to a speech recognizer  so he does this  method training trading the  the spectral resolution for time resolution and  come ca  synthesizes a new representation which is with say ten second frames but a lower s  frequency resolution . I guess it 's these are called \" time frequency representations \" and h he 's making the the time sh  finer grained and the frequency resolution  less fine grained . grad c: s so I 'm I guess my first stab actually in continuing his work is to  re - implement this this thing which  changes the time and frequency resolutions cuz he doesn't have code for me . grad c: Oh , and  , another f first step is  , so the the way I want to extend his work is make it able to deal with a time varying reverberation response  and  we don't really know how fast the  the reverberation response is varying the Meeting Recorder data  so  we we have this  block least squares  imp echo canceller implementation and  I want to try finding the the response , say , between a near mike and the table mike for someone using the echo canceller and looking at the echo canceller taps and then see how fast that varies from block to block . grad c: That should give an idea of how fast the reverberation response is changing . S so  y you do I think you read some of the the zeros as O 's and some as zeros . grad c: Is there a particular way we 're supposed to read them ? phd e: There are only zeros here . \" O \" \" O \" \" O \" \" O \" \" O \" \" O \" and \" zero \" are two ways that we say that digit . professor a: So it 's grad b: Ha ! phd e: But professor a: so it 's i phd e: Perhaps in the sheets there should be another sign for the if we want to the the guy to say \" O \" or professor a: No . professor a:  in digit recognition we 've done before , you have you have two pronunciations for that value , \" O \" and \" zero \" . phd e: But it 's perhaps more difficult for the people to prepare the database then , if because here you only have zeros professor a: No , they just write phd e: and and people pronounce \" O \" or zero professor a: they they write down OH . phd e: Yeah but if the sh the sheet was prepared with a different sign for the \" O \" .  , you 'd have to tell them \" OK when we write this , say it tha \" , phd e: OK . professor a: you know , and you just They just want people to read the digits as you ordinarily would phd e:   Is this a change from the last batch of of  forms ? Because in the last batch it was spelled out which one you should read . It was it was spelled out , and they decided they wanted to get at more the way people would really say things . professor a: That 's also why they 're they 're bunched together in these different groups . Actually , let me just s since since you brought it up , I was just it was hard not to be self - conscious about that when it after we since we just discussed it . But I realized that that  when I 'm talking on the phone , certainly , and and saying these numbers , I almost always say zero . So that that that 's the habit I 'm in , but some people say \" O \" and grad b: Yeah I normally say \" O \" cuz it 's easier to say <doc-sep>grad b: We didn't crash we 're not crashing anymore phd c: One , two , three , four , f grad b: and it really bothers me . phd c: Yeah ? professor a: Oh ! Well maybe it 's just , you know , how many t u u u u how many times you crash in a day . phd g: Or maybe it 's once you 've done enough meetings it won't crash on you anymore . professor a: Do we have an agenda ? Liz Liz and Andreas can't sh can't  , can't come . phd g: Did they send , the messages to you about the meeting today ? grad b: I have no idea but I just got it a few minutes ago . grad b: So , does anyone have any a agenda items other than me ? I actually have one more also which is to talk about the digits . professor a: right , so so I I was just gonna talk briefly about the NSF ITR . professor a: and then , you have postdoc f: Can w professor a: I won't say much , but  , but then , you said wanna talk about digits ? grad b: I have a short thing about digits and then  I wanna talk a little bit about naming conventions , although it 's unclear whether this is the right place to talk about it . So maybe just talk about it very briefly and take the details to the people who for whom it 's relevant . I 've been but but  , well professor a: Well if we Yeah , we shouldn't add things in just to add things in . grad b: So the only thing I wanna say about digits is , we are pretty much done with the first test set . There are probably forms here and there that are marked as having been read that weren't really read . So I won't really know until I go through all the transcriber forms and extract out pieces that are in error . The first is what should we do about digits that were misread ? My opinion is , we should just throw them out completely , and have them read again by someone else . grad b: so it it 's perfectly fine to put a a group together again of errors and have them re - read , just to finish out the test set . postdoc f: Oh ! By throw them out completely ? grad b: the other thing you could do is change the transcript to match what they really said . I know I 've done it , where I say say a grad b: What the transcribers did with that is if they did a correction , and they eventually did read the right string , you extract the right string . phd g: Oh , you 're talking about where they completely read the wrong string and didn't correct it ? phd e: Yeah . grad b: So so postdoc f: Well , and s and you 're talking string - wise , you 're not talking about the entire page ? grad b: Correct . grad b: And so the the two options are change the transcript to match what they really said , but then but then the transcript isn't the Aurora test set anymore . phd g: Well how many are how how often does that happen ? grad b: Mmm , five or six times . professor a: Yeah , it 's five or six times out of thousands ? phd c: Yeah . phd g: Yeah , it 's professor a: Yeah , I would , tak do the easy way , phd g: Yeah . professor a: It it 's kinda nice  , wh who knows what studies people will be doing on on speaker - dependent things phd c: Mmm . phd g: So you  , how many digits have been transcribed now ? grad b: Four thousand lines . phd g: Four thousand lines ? grad b: I didn't I didn't compute the average . grad b: And , Jane , I do have a set of forms which I think you have copies of somewhere . grad b: Yeah , I was just wond I thought I had had all of them back from you . And then the other thing is that , the forms in front of us here that we 're gonna read later , were suggested by Liz postdoc f: No , not yet . And so , I just wanted people to , take a quick look at the instructions phd c:   grad b: and the way it wa worked and see if it makes sense and if anyone has any comments on it . Although we could switch it back and tell them always to say \" zero \" or always to say \" O \" . professor a: that 's the only thought I have because if you t start talking about these , you know u tr She 's trying to get at natural groupings , but it there 's there 's nothing natural about reading numbers this way . grad b: But , the other problem we were thinking about is if you just put the numerals , they might say forty - three instead of four three .  , you can With when you space them out they don't look like , forty - three anymore . grad b: and she felt that it 's very , very natural to do that sort of chunking .  it 's a it 's a it 's an interesting problem  , we 've done stuff with numbers before , and yeah sometimes people If you say s \" three nine eight one \" sometimes people will say \" thirty - nine eighty - one \" or \" three hundred three hundred eighty - nine one \" , or I don't think they 'd say that , phd c: Yeah . professor a: but but th grad b: Not very frequently professor a: no grad b: but , they certainly could . grad b: and , since this was something that Liz asked for specifically , I think we need to defer to her . Well , we 're probably gonna be collecting meetings for a while and if we decide we still wanna do some digits later we might be able to do some different ver different versions , grad b: Do something different , professor a: but this is the next suggestion , grad b: yeah . OK , so  e l I guess , let me , get my my short thing out about the NSF .  , I I sent to what I thought we had , in some previous mail , as the right joint thing to send to , which was \" M MTG RCDR hyphen joint \" . professor a: But then I got some sort of funny mail saying that the moderator was going to grad b: It 's That 's because they set the one up at UW postdoc f:  grad b: that 's not on our side , that 's on the U - dub side . grad b: And , I have no idea whether it actually ever goes to anyone so you might just wanna mail to Mari professor a: No no , th I got I got , little excited notes from Mari and Jeff and so on , grad b: and professor a: so it 's grad b: OK , good . grad b: Cuz I had sent one earlier Actually the same thing happened to me I had sent one earlier . The message says , \" You 'll be informed \" and then I was never informed but I got replies from people indicating that they had gotten it , so . Well , anyway , I guess everybody here Are y are you are on that list , right ? So you got the note ? phd g:   professor a: so this was , a , proposal that we put in before on on more more higher level , issues in meetings , from I guess higher level from my point of view .  , and , meeting mappings , and ,  so is i for it was a proposal for the ITR program , Information Technology Research program 's part of National Science Foundation . They 're they 're a lot of them are some of them anyway , are larger larger grants than the usual , small NSF grants , and . So , they 're very competitive , and they have a first phase where you put in pre - proposals , and we we , got through that . grad b: When 's when 's the full proposal due ? professor a: I think April ninth , or something . And they said end of business day you could check on the reviewer forms , phd g: u grad b: is that phd g: Tomorrow . grad b: I guess that 's a good thing cuz that way I got my papers done early . phd g: It would be interesting professor a: So that 's amazing you showed up at this meeting ! grad b: It is . My favorite is was when when when one reviewer says , \" you know , this should be far more detailed \" , and the nex the next reviewer says , \" you know , there 's way too much detail \" . Or \" this is way too general \" , and the other reviewer says , \" this is way too specific \" . Is that right ? That they didn't reject a lot of the pre - proposals ? professor a: Do you know anything about the numbers ? grad b: No . phd g: Gary Strong 's professor a: I phd g: there was a sentence at the end of one of his paragraphs phd e: Yeah . He said the next phase 'll be very , competitive phd e: Very very , phd g: because we didn't want to weed out much in the first phase . professor a: So , you know , maybe they didn't r weed out as much as usual , but it 's it 's usually a pretty But it Yeah . It 's it 's certainly not I 'm sure that it 's not down to one in two or something of what 's left . professor a: I 'm sure it 's , you know grad b: How how many awards are there , do you know ? professor a: Well there 's different numbers of w awards for different size They have three size grants . This one there 's ,  See the small ones are less than five hundred thousand total over three years and that they have a fair number of them .  , and the large ones are , boy , I forget , I think , more than , more than a million and a half , more than two million or something like that . But , I don't remember , but it 's pr probably along the li I I could be wrong on this yeah , but probably along the lines of fifteen or that they 'll fund , or twenty .  when they Do you do you know how many they funded when they f in in Chuck 's , that he got last year ? phd g: I don't I don't know . grad b: I thought it was smaller , that it was like four or five , wasn't it ? professor a: Well they fund phd g: I I 'm professor a: they phd g: I don't remember . professor a: and this time they came up with a middle one , so it 'll there 'll be more of them that they fund than of the big . phd g: If we end up getting this , what will it mean to ICSI in terms of , w wh where will the money go to , what would we be doing with it ? professor a:  . professor a: You know , it i None of it will go for those yachts that we 've talking about . phd g:  Dang ! professor a: well , no ,  it 's u It phd g: It 's just for the research to continue the research on the Meeting Recorder stuff ? professor a: It 's extending the research , right ? Because the other phd g: Yeah . grad b: Yeah it 's go higher level stuff than we 've been talking about for Meeting Recorder . Yeah the other things that we have , been working on with , the c with Communicator  , especially with the newer things with the more acoustically - oriented things are are are are lower level . And , this is dealing with , mapping on the level of of , the conversation of mapping the conversations phd g:   So it 's all it 's all stuff that none none of us are doing right now , or none of us are funded for , so it 's so it 's it would be new . phd g: So assuming everybody 's completely busy now , it means we 're gonna hafta , hire more students , or , something ? professor a: Well there 's evenings , and there 's weekends , and  . Yeah , there there would be there would be new hires , and and there there would be expansion , but , also , there 's always for everybody there 's there 's always things that are dropping off , grants that are ending , or other things that are ending , so , phd g: Right . professor a: But but there definitely would be new new new , students , phd g: I see . grad b: Are there any students in your class who are expressing interest ? professor a: not clear yet . professor a:  we got we have yeah , two of them are two in the c There 're two in the class already here , and then and and , then there 's a third who 's doing a project here , who ,  But he he he won't be in the country that long , grad b:   professor a: Actually there is one other guy who 's looking that that 's that guy , Jeremy ? I think .  professor a: Anyway , yeah that 's that 's all I was gonna say is that that that 's you know , that 's nice and we 're sorta preceding to the next step , and , it 'll mean some more work , you know , in in March in getting the proposal out , and then , it 's , you know We 'll see what happens . It just ,  we 've been cutting up sound files , in for ba both digits and for , doing recognition . And Liz had some suggestions on naming and it just brought up the whole issue that hasn't really been resolved about naming . So , one thing she would like to have is for all the names to be the same length so that sorting is easier . grad b: same number of characters so that when you 're sorting filenames you can easily extract out bits and pieces that you want . And I don't think we have so many meetings that that 's a big deal just to change the names . So that means , instead of calling it \" MR one \" , \" MR two \" , you 'd call it \" MRM zero zero one \" , \" MRM zero zero two \" , things like that . postdoc f: But , you know , when you , do things like that you can always as long as you have  , you can always search from the beginning or the end of the string . postdoc f: You know , so \" zero zero two \" grad b: Alright , postdoc f: Yeah . grad b: so we we have th we 're gonna have the speaker ID , the session , information on the microphones , postdoc f: Yeah , well , your example was really grad b: information on the speak on the channels and all that . postdoc f: i grad b: And so if each one of those is a fixed length , the sorting becomes a lot easier . So like , the NSA meeting lengths , all filenames are gonna be the same length as the Meeting Recorder meeting names ? grad b: Yep . And as I said , the it 's we just don't have that many that that 's a big deal . grad b: And so , at some point we have to sort of take a few days off , let the transcribers have a few days off , make sure no one 's touching the data and reorganize the file structures . postdoc f: I I would think though that the transcribe the transcripts themselves wouldn't need to have such lengthy names . postdoc f: So , you 're dealing with a different domain there , and with start and end times and all that , and channels and stuff , grad b: Right . So the only thing that would change with that is just the directory names , postdoc f: so , it 's a different set . grad b: So for for m the meetings we were thinking about three letters and three numbers for meeting I Ds .  , for speakers , M or F and then three numbers , For ,  and , that also brings up the point that we have to start assembling a speaker database so that we get those links back and forth and keep it consistent . We want some way of specifying , more than looking in the \" key \" file , what channel and what mike . grad b: that 's gonna become especially important once we start changing the microphone set - up . We have some new microphones that I 'd like to start trying out , once I test them . professor a: since we have such a short agenda list I guess I wi I will ask how how are the transcriptions going ? Yeah . postdoc f: The the news is that I 've I  s So in s  So I 've switched to Start my new sentence . I I switched to doing the channel - by - channel transcriptions to provide , the  , tighter time bins for partly for use in Thilo 's work and also it 's of relevance to other people in the project . And , I discovered in the process a couple of of interesting things , which , one of them is that , it seems that there are time lags involved in doing this , using an interface that has so much more complexity to it . And I and I wanted to maybe ask , Chuck to help me with some of the questions of efficiency . Maybe I was thinking maybe the best way to do this in the long run may be to give them single channel parts and then piece them together later .  , so it 's like , I I know that I can take them apart and put them together and I 'll end up with the representation which is where the real power of that interface is . postdoc f: And it may be that it 's faster to transcribe a channel at a time with only one , sound file and one , set of of , utterances to check through . I thought that that one of the reason we thought we were so much faster than than , the the other transcription , thing was that that we were using the mixed file . But , with the mixed , when you have an overlap , you only have a a choice of one start and end time for that entire overlap , which means that you 're not tightly , tuning the individual parts th of that overlap by different speakers . postdoc f: So someone may have only said two words in that entire big chunk of overlap . postdoc f: And for purposes of of , things like well , so things like training the speech - nonspeech segmentation thing . postdoc f: And w and w and , you know , is a It would be wonderful if , it 's possible then to use that algorithm to more tightly tie in all the channels after that but , you know , I 've th the So , I I don't know exactly where that 's going at this point . But m I was experimenting with doing this by hand and I really do think that it 's wise that we 've had them start the way we have with , m y working off the mixed signal , having the interface that doesn't require them to do the ti  , the time bins for every single channel at a t  , through the entire interaction . postdoc f: I did discover a couple other things by doing this though , and one of them is that , once in a while a backchannel will be overlooked by the transcriber . postdoc f: because when it 's a b backchannel could well happen in a very densely populated overlap . And if we 're gonna study types of overlaps , which is what I wanna do , an analysis of that , then that really does require listening to every single channel all the way through the entire length for all the different speakers . Now , for only four speakers , that 's not gonna be too much time , but if it 's nine speakers , then that i that is more time . So it 's li you know , kind of wondering And I think again it 's like this it 's really valuable that Thilo 's working on the speech - nonspeech segmentation because maybe , we can close in on that wi without having to actually go to the time that it would take to listen to every single channel from start to finish through every single meeting .  especially if they 're really short and they 're not very loud and so it it can it it will always happen that also the automatic s detection system will miss some of them , so . Well so then then , maybe the answer is to , listen especially densely in places of overlap , phd e: Yeah . postdoc f: just so that they 're they 're not being overlooked because of that , and count on accuracy during the sparser phases . postdoc f: Cuz there are large s spaces of the That 's a good point . I I think it 's really interesting data to work with , I have to say , it 's very enjoyable .  , you 're you 're you 're still in the midst of what you 're doing from what you described last time , I assume , phd c: Is true . postdoc f:  professor a: and phd c: I haven't results , eh , yet professor a: Yeah . phd c: but , eh , I I 'm continue working with the mixed signal now , after the the last experience . phd c: And and I 'm tried to to , adjust the to to improve , eh , an harmonicity , eh , detector that , eh , I I implement . phd c: But I have problem because , eh , I get , eh , eh , very much harmonics now . phd c: harmonic possi possible harmonics , eh , and now I 'm I 'm I 'm trying to to find , eh , some kind of a ,  of h of help , eh , using the energy to to distinguish between possible harmonics , and and other fre frequency peaks , that , eh , corres not harmonics . And , eh , I have to to talk with y with you , with the group , eh , about the instantaneous frequency , because I have , eh , an algorithm , and , I get , mmm , eh , t t results similar results , like , eh , the paper , eh , that I I am following . But , eh , the the rules , eh , that , eh , people used in the paper to to distinguish the harmonics , is doesn't work well . phd c: And I I I I not sure that i eh , the the way o to ob the way to obtain the the instantaneous frequency is right , or it 's it 's not right . If if if ,  If I don't have enough time and y you wanna discuss with someone else some someone else besides us that you might want to talk to , might be Stephane . phd c: and , professor a: Yeah , but phd c: they nnn they they they didn't phd e: I 'm not too experienced with harmonics professor a: I see . phd c: they think that the experience is not enough to phd e: and phd g: Is is this the algorithm where you hypothesize a fundamental , and then get the energy for all the harmonics of that fundamental ? phd c: No , no it 's No No . phd g: And then hypothesize a new fundamental and get the energy professor a: Yeah , that 's wh phd c: No . phd c: And The algorithm said that , eh , if you if you change the the the , eh , nnn the X - the frequency \" X \" , eh , using the in the instantaneous frequency , you can find , eh , how , eh , in several frequencies that proba probably the the harmonics , eh , professor a:  - huh . phd c: the errors of peaks the frequency peaks , eh , eh , move around these , eh eh frequency harmonic the frequency of the harmonic . And , eh , if you if you compare the the instantaneous frequency , eh , of the of the , eh , continuous , eh , eh , filters , that , eh that , eh , they used eh , to to to get , eh , the the instantaneous frequency , professor a:   phd c: it probably too , you can find , eh , that the instantaneous frequency for the continuous , eh , eh the output of the continuous filters are very near . phd c: And professor a: It 's it 's it 's I haven't worked with that either so I 'm not sure The way the simple - minded way I suggested was what Chuck was just saying , is that you could make a a sieve . professor a: Let 's let 's hypothesize that it 's this frequency or that frequency , and and , maybe you maybe you could use some other cute methods to , short cut it by by  , making some guesses , phd c: Yeah . professor a: but but    , I would ,   you could make some guesses from ,  from the auto - correlation or something but but then , given those guesses , try , only looking at the energy at multiples of the of that frequency , and and see how much of the take the one that 's maximum . phd g: Do you hafta do some kind of , low - pass filter before you do that ? phd c: I don't use . phd g: Or phd c: But , I I know many people use , eh , low - pass filter to to to get , eh , the pitch . phd g: But i But the harmonics are gonna be , I don't know what the right word is .  , they 're gonna be dampened by the  , vocal tract , right ? The response of the vocal tract . professor a: Yeah ? phd c: Yeah ? phd g: And so just looking at the energy on those at the harmonics , is that gonna ? professor a: Well so the thing is that the This is for , a ,  phd g: I m what you 'd like to do is get rid of the effect of the vocal tract . professor a: But ,  but I but but I don't know that you need to grad b: Open wide ! professor a: but I don't need you know if you need to get rid of it .  that 'd that 'd be nice but I don't know if it 's ess if it 's essential .  ,  cuz I think the main thing is that , you 're trying phd g:  - huh . professor a: wha what are you doing this for ? You 're trying distinguish between the case where there is ,  where where there are more than  , where there 's more than one speaker and the case where there 's only one speaker . professor a: So if there 's more than one speaker ,  yeah I guess you could I guess yeah you 're so you 're not distinguished between voiced and unvoiced , so so , i if you don't if you don't care about that phd c: Yeah . professor a: See , if you also wanna just determine if you also wanna determine whether it 's unvoiced , then I think you want to look look at high frequencies also , because the f the fact that there 's more energy in the high frequencies is gonna be an ob sort of obvious cue that it 's unvoiced . professor a: But , i i   i i but , other than that I guess as far as the one person versus two persons , it would be primarily a low frequency phenomenon . And if you looked at the low frequencies , yes the higher frequencies are gonna there 's gonna be a spectral slope .  that 's that 's w phd c: I will prepare for the next week eh , all my results about the harmonicity and will will try to come in and to discuss here , because , eh , I haven't enough feeling to to u many time to to understand what happened with the with , eh , so many peaks , eh , eh , and I I see the harmonics there many time but , eh , there are a lot of peaks , eh , that , eh , they are not harmonics . phd c: I have to discover what what is the the w the best way to to to c to use them professor a: Well , but yeah I don't think you can  you 're not gonna be able to look at every frame , so  I  I I really I I really thought that the best way to do it , and I 'm speaking with no experience on this particular point , but , my impression was that the best way to do it was however you You 've used instantaneous frequency , whatever . However you 've come up you with your candidates , you wanna see how much of the energy is in that phd c: Yeah . And , if it 's voiced , I guess so so y I think maybe you do need a voiced - unvoiced determination too . professor a: and the ,  e the fraction of the energy that 's in the harmonic sequence that you 're looking at is relatively low , then it should be then it 's more likely to be an overlap . This this is the idea the idea I I I had to to compare the the ratio of the the energy of the harmonics with the eh , with the , eh , total energy in the spectrum and try to get a ratio to to distinguish between overlapping and speech . professor a: But you 're looking a y you 're looking at Let 's take a second with this .  , you 're looking at f at the phase derivative , in in , what domain ?  this is this is in in in in bands ? Or or phd c: No , no , no . professor a: Just just overall phd c: It 's a it 's a o i w the band the band is , eh , from zero to to four kilohertz . And I I ot I professor a: And you just take the instantaneous frequency ? phd c: Yeah . to FFT to to obtain the or to study the harmonics from from the spectrum directly , professor a: Yeah . And another another algorithm I have is the in the instantaneous frequency , based on on on the FFT to to to calculate the the phase derivate in the time . phd c: But , eh , in m i in my opinion the the the instantaneous frequency , the the the behavior , eh , was th it was very interesting . Because I I saw eh , how the spectrum concentrate , eh , professor a: Oh ! phd c: around the the harmonic . But then when I apply the the rule , eh , of the in the the instantaneous frequency of the ne of the continuous filter in the the near filter , the the rule that , eh , people propose in the paper doesn't work . professor a: But the instantaneous frequency , wouldn't that give you something more like the central frequency of the you know , of the where most of the energy is ?  , I think if you Does i does it Why would it correspond to pitch ? phd c: Yeah . phd c: When first I I calculate , eh , using the FFT , postdoc f: Di - digital camera . professor a: Oh , so you scale you s you do a a scaling along that axis according to instantaneous phd c: I use Yeah . phd c: eh , when i I I use these these frequency , eh , the range is different , and the resolution is different . phd c: But , eh , they used , eh , a rule , eh , based in the in the because to to calculate the instantaneous frequency , they use a Hanning window . phd c: And , they said that , eh , if these peak are , eh , harmonics , the f instantaneous frequency , of the contiguous , eh w eh eh , filters are very near , or have to be very near . But , eh , phh ! I don't I I I I don I I and I don't know what is the what is the distance . And I tried to to put different distance , eh , to put difference , eh eh , length of the window , eh , different front sieve , Pfff ! and I I not sure what happened . I 'll probably gonna hafta look at the paper , but which I 'm not gonna have time to do in the next few days , but but I 'm I 'm curious about it . postdoc f: I I did i it did occur to me that this is  , the return to the transcription , that there 's one third thing I wanted to to ex raise as a to as an issue which is , how to handle breaths . So , I wanted to raise the question of whether people in speech recognition want to know where the breaths are . And the reason I ask the question is , aside from the fact that they 're obviously very time - consuming to encode , the fact that there was some I had the indication from Dan Ellis in the email that I sent to you , phd e: Yeah . postdoc f: and you know about , that in principle we might be able to , handle breaths by accessi by using cross - talk from the other things , be able that in principle , maybe we could get rid of them , so maybe And I was I I don't know ,  we had this an and I didn't couldn't get back to you , phd e: Yeah . postdoc f: but the question of whether it 'd be possible to eliminate them from the audio signal , which would be the ideal situation , professor a: I don't know think it 'd be ideal . professor a: We - See , we 're we 're dealing with real speech and we 're trying to have it be as real as possible phd e: Yeah . postdoc f: Well , except that these are really truly  , ther there 's a segment in o the one I did n the first one that I did for i for this , phd e: Yeah . postdoc f: where truly w we 're hearing you breathing like as if we 're you 're in our ear , you know , and it 's like it 's like professor a: Yeah . postdoc f: I y i  , breath is natural , but not professor a: It is but it is if you record it . postdoc f: Except that we 're we 're trying to mimic Oh , I see what you 're saying . grad b: The P D A might not have to , phd e: No i grad b: but more people than just PDA users are interested in this corpus . grad b: So so mean you 're right postdoc f: OK , then the then I have two questions . grad b: we could remove it , postdoc f: Yeah ? grad b: but I I think we don't wanna w remove it from the corpus , in terms of delivering it because the people will want it in there . If if it gets in the way of what somebody is doing with it then you might wanna have some method which will allow you to block it , but you it 's real data . You don't wanna b but you don't postdoc f: OK , well professor a: If s you know , if there 's a little bit of noise out there , and somebody is is talking about something they 're doing , that 's part of what we accept as part of a real meeting , even And we have the f  the  the the fan and the in the projector up there , and , this is it 's this is actual stuff that we we wanna work with . postdoc f: because i it basically has a i it shows very clearly the contrast between , speech recognition research and discourse research because in in discourse and linguistic research , what counts is what 's communit communicative . postdoc f: And breath , you know , everyone breathes , they breathe all the time . postdoc f: and the idea is that the transcripts will that get stored as a master there 'll be a master transcript which has in it everything that 's needed for both of these uses . postdoc f: And the one that 's used for speech recognition will be processed via scripts . Discourse side will have this this side over he the we we 'll have a s ch Sorry , not being very fluent here . But , this the discourse side will have a script which will stri strip away the things which are non - communicative . So then the then let 's let 's think about the practicalities of how we get to that master copy with reference to breaths . So what I would r r what I would wonder is would it be possible to encode those automatically ? Could we get a breath detector ? grad b: Oh , just to save the transcribers time . postdoc f: and just simply the keystrokes it takes to negotiate , to put the boundaries in , to to type it in , i it 's just a huge amount of time . postdoc f: And you wanna be sure it 's used , and you wanna be sure it 's done as efficiently as possible , and if it can be done automatically , that would be ideal . professor a: what if you put it in but didn't put the boundaries ? postdoc f: Well , but professor a: So you just know it 's between these other things , postdoc f: Well , OK . So now there 's there 's another another possibility professor a: right ? postdoc f: which is , the time boundaries could mark off words from nonwords . professor a: Yeah  I 'm think if it 's too if it 's too hard for us to annotate the breaths per se , we are gonna be building up models for these things and these things are somewhat self - aligning , so if so , we i i if we say there is some kind of a thing which we call a \" breath \" or a \" breath - in \" or \" breath - out \" , the models will learn that sort of thing .  , so but you but you do want them to point them at some region where where the breaths really are . But that would maybe include a pause as well , phd g: Well , there 's a there 's postdoc f: and that wouldn't be a problem to have it , pause plus breath plus laugh plus sneeze ? professor a: Yeah , i You know there is there 's this dynamic tension between between marking absolutely everything , as you know , and and and marking just a little bit and counting on the statistical methods . But if there seems to be a lot of effort for a small amount of reward in some area , and this might be one like this Although I I I 'd be interested to h get get input from Liz and Andreas on this to see if they Cuz they 've - they 've got lots of experience with the breaths in in , their transcripts . grad b: They have lots of experience with breathing ? phd g: I professor a: Actually Well , yes they do , but we we can handle that without them here . But but but , you were gonna say something about phd g: Yeah , I I think , one possible way that we could handle it is that , you know , as the transcribers are going through , and if they get a hunk of speech that they 're gonna transcribe , u th they 're gonna transcribe it because there 's words in there or whatnot . But if there 's a big hunk of speech , let 's say on Morgan 's mike where he 's not talking at all , don't don't worry about that . phd g: So what we 're saying is , there 's no guarantee that ,  So for the chunks that are transcribed , everything 's transcribed . So you just somebody can't rely on that data and say \" that 's perfectly clean data \" .  do you see what I 'm saying ? postdoc f: Yeah , you 're saying it 's uncharted territory . phd g: So I would say don't tell them to transcribe anything that 's outside of a grouping of words . phd e: Yeah , and that 's that that quite co corresponds to the way I I try to train the speech - nonspeech detector , as I really try to not to detect those breaths which are not within a speech chunk but with which are just in in a silence region . phd e: And they so they hopefully won't be marked in in those channel - specific files . professor a: u I I wanted to comment a little more just for clarification about this business about the different purposes . professor a: See , in a in a way this is a really key point , that for speech recognition , research , e a it 's not just a minor part . In fact , the I think I would say the core thing that we 're trying to do is to recognize the actual , meaningful components in the midst of other things that are not meaningful . So it 's critical it 's not just incidental it 's critical for us to get these other components that are not meaningful . professor a: if we had only linguistically - relevant things if if we only had changes in the spectrum that were associated with words , with different spectral components , and , we we didn't have noise , we didn't have convolutional errors , we didn't have extraneous , behaviors , and so forth , and moving your head and all these sorts of things , then , actually speech recognition i i isn't that bad right now . professor a: The the the reason we still complain about it is because is when when you have more realistic conditions then then things fall apart . I guess , I  , what I was wondering is what what at what level does the breathing aspect enter into the problem ? Because if it were likely that a PDA would be able to be built which would get rid of the breathing , so it wouldn't even have to be processed at thi at this computational le well , let me see , it 'd have to be computationally processed to get rid of it , but if there were , like likely on the frontier , a good breath extractor then , and then you 'd have to professor a: But that 's a research question , you know ? And so postdoc f: Yeah , well , see and that 's what I wouldn't know .  so so the thing is it 's it right now it 's just raw d it 's just data that we 're collecting , and so we don't wanna presuppose that people will be able to get rid of particular degradations because that 's actually the research that we 're trying to feed . So , you know , an and maybe maybe in five years it 'll work really well , postdoc f: OK . professor a: and and it 'll only mess - up ten percent of the time , but then we would still want to account for that ten percent , so . postdoc f: I guess there 's another aspect which is that as we 've improved our microphone technique , we have a lot less breath in the in the more recent , recordings , so it 's in a way it 's an artifact that there 's so much on the on the earlier ones . phd g: One of the  , just to add to this one of the ways that we will be able to get rid of breath is by having models for them . phd g: And so in order to build the model you need to have some amount of it marked , so that you know where the boundaries are . phd g: So  , I don't think we need to worry a lot about breaths that are happening outside of a , you know , conversation . We don't have to go and search for them to to mark them at all , but , if they 're there while they 're transcribing some hunk of words , I 'd say put them in if possible . postdoc f: OK , and it 's also the fact that they differ a lot from one channel to the other because of the way the microphone 's adjusted "

What is the most important function aspect ?  . project manager: You won't user interface: Or or you can say for example ,  I want  to list all the programme tonight . Y you know , instead of  remote control it's doing the some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . project manager: I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . user interface: No , because no , project manager: S user interface: it's not very a lot . industrial designer: I I think if you want t to choose  from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use  w  I dunno marketing: I'm a okay . marketing:  the main  function of remote control is to have something in the hand project manager: In the hand . marketing: If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog user interface: Yeah . marketing: if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . industrial designer: marketing:  we have some or something , different technology but project manager: This is it's user interface: Yeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that  there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea project manager: industrial designer: but I I think that technically it would be  a little bit   more tricky to to achieve this than just to user interface: No . They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . user interface: And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons . industrial designer: Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to  navigate  through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so project manager: This is good idea . Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? industrial designer: Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen user interface: Good idea . industrial designer: and just  with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f user interface: I think I think that will be revol revolutionary . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: Because all the T_V_  the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . So I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff user interface: Okay . project manager: So we have five minutes to user interface: Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . project manager: Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we industrial designer: user interface: Five minutes . marketing: And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of user interface: Okay . marketing: So , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark  some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . industrial designer: Oh right so user interface: Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: Be before before writing you can  sit and that says what we what we said user interface:  . So so the most functional des  the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . The user can choose w which one they want , right ? industrial designer: Yeah , by content or by channel , user interface: By content or by channel . user interface: Okay , so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content . industrial designer: I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so user interface: Okay . And  industrial designer: I think that's the the things to do user interface: The main thing . user interface: So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get  the funct this is the functional designer ? That's the first aspect . project manager: So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ? And we'll discuss the other other aspects <doc-sep>industrial designer: Is there any time for a cup of coffee ? user interface: We have a slight problem . project manager: Sorry ? industrial designer: Can I get a cup of coffee ? project manager:  no . project manager:  then  the three of you  prepared a presentation , I think ? Sebastian ? industrial designer: I think so too . user interface: industrial designer: project manager: Then we'll do your one   as la  the last .  the top goal of this m user interface: But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe . project manager:  the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group  and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind .  the new project requirements , first of all ,  we didn't speak about it , but we should not  support teletext in the remote ,  because our b  board  feels that  teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext .  the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not  f  feasible , it's not  w user interface: Yeah . project manager:   we we cannot make it because of the time to market  that we have to deal with . project manager:  the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than  forty , which is important for you ,  Ruud , and as well for  Roo .  then for Roo , as well  important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product .  the individual presentations , I th  Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ? user interface: Yeah , I'll start .  the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . user interface: Then I found  two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function  remote control with many possibilities , but  the lack of the feeling I already mentioned  in the previous  discussion . user interface: And the ease-of-use remote control with  the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . My personal preferences were ease of  the easy to use remote control , because  the user-friendliness and  it can be more trendy in in user design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not  in our design . But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is  the best  possi possibility for us . project manager: Okay , so marketing: project manager: the important thing here is user interface: And it's also i indeed   Ruud's  insight in the in the topic . project manager: Yeah , okay , w we will s we all  user interface: Just for  for user desi  user  friendliness I  should choose for the the ease of use remote control .  well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . user interface: industrial designer:  basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by  sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to  implement a picture here , user interface: Energies and  industrial designer: but it's hardly readable . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using  infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . It's almost every piece of equipment  every piece of  every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . And I think that's what we w user interface: The glow in the dark  concept  we discussed . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . industrial designer: and I think we should  we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . industrial designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared , because  otherwise our device cannot  communicate with  almost every T_V_ set . And  if we want to use  a rechargeable design or  a energy-save design , we should really implement them .  for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost  circuit board ,  because most of the production cost are are in this  part of the equipment . industrial designer: And  the money we save on using this we can use  for elaborate fancy lighting  techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . user interface: And what's the  industrial designer: I think our  users will really  will really like that . user interface: if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or industrial designer: No , they're p f  power friendly LEDs also . user interface: For the same costs , it's can be  in our industrial designer:  no , they're  they're a little bit more expensive , but by    making user interface: Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's  industrial designer: We can we can make its I think . project manager: Yeah , but but the question is whether  two or four buttons makes  m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to  include fancy lightning techniques , I guess . user interface: Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , marketing: true . Well , it's not one light , it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . project manager: Okay well , industrial designer: project manager: we ar we are very curio curious to what the market  will feel about such a product . marketing: But  since  the other part is  forty percent of the market , I  thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . The buttons to zap are used the about  fifteen hundred times , when  the power button is only used one time . So user interface: Yeah , well it should just have a design The perfect design for those only those buttons . Just one thing I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? industrial designer: Well marketing: Yeah , that's  a problem . project manager: Well industrial designer: Usually project manager: maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , user interface: It should be   project manager: like  turning on and off the the the lights . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a  kind of weird sound , and your  remote controls then start to beep . project manager: But  th user interface: But but T_V_s don't have all   buttons . marketing: And you project manager: Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home  user interface: But I believe you will have an marketing: Yeah , and usually industrial designer: We do not control the T_V_ set so well . marketing: And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button ,  you would have to walk to your T_V_ , industrial designer: Yes , m yes . S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , marketing: and it's project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so we should think about project manager: So what about the clapping technique ?  because you se user interface: I'm convinced  Sebastian will  find  one solution for us . marketing: And b project manager: Well , you see it a lot in in light  lightning   industrial designer: Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics  the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , project manager: Yeah , a peak . industrial designer: But there are many other sounds  which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . industrial designer: Yes , user interface: But we can have just   a home stat  f a base station next to the T_V_ . user interface: Well if you lost th industrial designer: Well , project manager: Well  industrial designer: is there not something f something more easily user interface: I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . user interface:  that's just  industrial designer: No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and  b  perform a a some kind of  . You do not want another device , which can be  everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . project manager: Yeah , m maybe  w we  we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . project manager:  maybe Sebastian should have  a detailed look later on and  come up with a solution , industrial designer: But  before I do that I w I want to warn you that  by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated project manager: And there are some implepe imp user interface: And do we even  prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning  function ? industrial designer: Well , I I think so , because  when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . user interface: It's a unique item  project manager: Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . project manager: and  I think  it's worth   looking and and probably more i interesting than  than the lights . user interface: And just about  the user interface , I came up with  an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . marketing: Well , t  we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function . project manager: Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players  and all kind of stuff . user interface: So industrial designer: we should save costs  by not implementing a lot of functions and  the money that we can save from that we should use for  having a nice design and  thinking about the user interface project manager: Yeah . Okay , industrial designer: and project manager: Ruud , how do you feel about that ?  do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to  a simple marketing:  well if we  include other  innovative functions  then they  might , project manager: user interface:  just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated ,  because it has many functions . industrial designer: Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very  friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but  nevertheless project manager: But but are we not in in the in the manual   if you have few buttons , no display ,    I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and  one button can  industrial designer: Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . project manager: But but how does how does the remote  report  r  give back to the user w in what state it is ? user interface: Yeah , I don't know yet . There's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . project manager: I know , but but if we use  like a stick , for example ,  industrial designer: W When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe  a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just  pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t  turned up the volume . marketing: And if you use that stick for volume control and channel  selection , you have the m two most important functions in one  button . user interface: But does it  I then should n just use  i instead of the stick ,  like many cell phones , just a round m well , project manager: Yeah , draw draw it on the board . Oh user interface: It's just an easy  way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . user interface: A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down project manager: Yeah , it can break down . marketing: And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it  attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . project manager: Okay , but w we still we're still in the question of    putting in advanced options .  we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , I think . user interface: Yes ? project manager: We need to  have the  the user function  the functions decided and   our target audience . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ?  which  incorporates all function available on the device ? project manager:  well , I do not want a full  it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want  the kind of functions , for example  th the most important are volume and  programme selecting . l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but user interface: Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to  two channels , when you have  something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can  change industrial designer: project manager: Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last  Mielsen . industrial designer: but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . project manager: And and do we want  the ten digits ? user interface: The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so . industrial designer: Well , are are you sure ? marketing: Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . industrial designer: but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think but you should  shou you should know that . industrial designer: Okay , user interface:  and I think the most industrial designer: I can imagine when project manager: I agree actually . user interface: Just elder elder people would would buy it , industrial designer: I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . marketing: Well user interface: but industrial designer: But if you're  a regular T_V_ user , and you just want  to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can  you can use  about ten buttons . industrial designer: Well , marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: but how how often do you watch all these channels ? marketing: and if if we And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . Don't you think ? project manager: Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the industrial designer: The design . marketing: Well project manager: You c you can d make them very fancy marketing: And project manager: by   Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . industrial designer: Okay , so you can experiment by  with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .  it might be expensive and  hard to implement , but it would be a solution  for project manager: Okay , speech . industrial designer: So  when you add  speech recognition to your remote control ,  it's very easy to change  the channel . industrial designer: So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . project manager:  If if we would  drop the ten digits industrial designer: But maybe when we  project manager: but keep the programme and the volume , industrial designer: It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find  find the remote control button  remote control function . industrial designer: There are some  hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . industrial designer: So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . project manager: But But but can we manage it bu  for the costs ? industrial designer: You have to do nothing for it . marketing: And  if we if we could inc  include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be  a big problem . marketing: 'Cause when project manager: Is a cradle very cheap ? industrial designer: It's Oh , it's very cheap .  I would like to hear  maybe maybe you all have th  things not  spoken about , yeah , but that are important .  are there other things about the market we should know ? marketing:  I think we dealt with the most important information . project manager: Sebastian ? industrial designer:  I just want to make a summary of all all things  spoken and  the different possibilities . So on the outside it looks easy , but  we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by  implementing  speech techniques ,  voice recognition , that these kinds of things .  there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement  fancy techniques , which  I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about  the the costs and  the things like  battery lifetime , energy saving . industrial designer:  another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons . If we just add   a chip which does the voice recognition ,  our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another project manager: Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board industrial designer: well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . user interface: But the cheaper the ch  the the chip or th what was it ? industrial designer: project manager: No , it's th industrial designer: The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . user interface: Well it then we should just  take a look at the costs and  especially for the voice recognition . project manager: I'm not sure how how we'll f  determine the costs , I will have a look at it . project manager:  I'm not sure how how that industrial designer: Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will  have a lo  look at it . project manager:  I'm don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out . project manager:  then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work ,  and I'm sure your personal coaches will  assist you with it . project manager: User Interface Designer ,  Roo , I would like to see the user interface c  concept . project manager: And  user interface:  the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis  decisions Sebastian makes . industrial designer: Well project manager: Well , i it should be easy , user interface: Well project manager: that's w w what we concluded . industrial designer: So we drop the voice recognition ? project manager: No no no , we didn't industrial designer: Or project manager: but it shouldn't be integrated industrial designer: Oh . project manager: yeah , it's of course it's user interface , but  i I was talking about really the design of the industrial designer: Okay <doc-sep>project manager:  for the aim of this meeting now is to to make presentation about  the work for each one . user interface: project manager: And take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote control . project manager: and I think we don't need lighting adaptive , so the remote control should be only used for the the television . industrial designer: So  Well I have a PowerPoint pr presentation stored in my in my personal folder project manager: Here . project manager: industrial designer: Right , so  I will talk about the the w working design and user interface: F_ five . industrial designer: And  well I I will present my my first idea on how to build the our new remote control for television . So I think the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve  what we want to do . user interface: industrial designer: So   I'm thin  I think  I I'll do a survey about what is  what is available on the market and what what is the the cheapest possible things we hav we can use . Then  I will try with the technical team to to build a prototype and to see  with  h how this little box would  look look like . user interface: industrial designer: And how an and we can  start troubleshooting first  com communication problems or things like that . user interface: industrial designer: And when we are ready with this first prototype I I think we can add some software functionalities on a programmable chip like browsing by content or  things like that . Okay so can you go down  So , wha what I think for now is we don't want to have a remote control w which is wired user interface: project manager: industrial designer: so  I think we u we can use a battery for the . And the communication with the T_V_ set is  made through  infrared communication So  this is the the schema of the o of the future  remote controls user interface: Did you draw it ? marketing: project manager: Wow . industrial designer: so  you can you can see the components ,  battery and  the two chips goes to the infrared  connection to the T_V_ set . industrial designer: The one on top is for the  well the functionali the functionalities user interface: marketing: One is a communication . industrial designer: and the the th red  sorry the green one is is to well , putting things together ,  f transform the data into  qu into the format to to  to communicate with the T_V_ set . I think we should use a F_P_G_A_ for for the functionalities which is easy to to t user interface:  . What is F_P_G_A_ ? industrial designer: It's field programmable  something array . user interface: So why's it how is it different from the Bluetooth ? industrial designer: Well ,  a F_P_G_A_ is just a chip you can  you can pr programme it  wi with wh whatever you want . industrial designer: And  well the Bluetooth chip is just responsible to  make the communication  between  the two devices .  So this are the they have to work together ? Or ? Do they have to work together or two separate choice industrial designer: No . marketing: Or it's something like isn't hardware the first one ? And the second one is for the software . marketing: Okay , and how about the battery power ?  you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared ? industrial designer:  no no no no , I think  we have  to to  have  embedded  b batteries in in the project manager: . user interface: industrial designer: And  I I don't think it will need  very  much power to make it run , so user interface:  . user interface: Because you are using because you are using Bluetooth , if some people have P_D_A_ they can use their P_D_A_ to control the T_V_ if they want to , right ? industrial designer: That's a good idea . marketing: project manager: Ma industrial designer: Also , but but I I I think  the the goal is to sell our remote control . So the the purpose is to to find  the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have . user interface: and  and I found that  the function of remote control is to send messages to television set . user interface: For example switch on , switch off , switch the next channel and so on and so on . marketing: G user interface: So I found two very good prototypes for for this interface from our competitors industrial designer: user interface: so can you industrial designer: project manager: This are usual functionality . industrial designer: user interface: But then  loo but then I found if you look at you see on the left one there are too many buttons industrial designer: project manager: And they are small . O on the right I tried to play with the problem is that  if I have hundred channels I have  I have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and I have to compose the number industrial designer: Yeah . And then I I look at the user manual they are a hundred pages thick , so we don't want that . You can navigate on T_V_ screen and we can the user's preference and we need to have the T_V_ connected to internet so we end in order to access the T_V_ programmes by X_M_L_ and we need some to do some preprocessing . From the technical aspect , the processing should be done on the T_V_ set than on the on the remote controller , right ? industrial designer: user interface: And then we the speech recognition as  Harry says we may just put in we may K_I_V_ . project manager: What do you mean by the pa pa processing will be done on the T_V_ user interface: Yeah , all the processing is done the T_V_ is a compu has some processing power the project manager: than the industrial designer: So we have to t project manager: So we should have specific T_V_ ? Or ? We can use this . project manager: Yeah , we don't marketing: user interface: Yeah because are you just wondering what controller okay . industrial designer: I think there there is there is al there there is a a technology like show view who is already available on most of the T_V_ set on recorders or thing like that user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and we can try t to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because user interface: Okay . user interface: So i the processing on on the remote controller project manager: Yeah , user interface: so it can u be used in any T_V_ , any conventional T_V_ sets ? project manager: we . project manager: Keep the navigation industrial designer: We d we don't we we don't need really much buttons to i if we have a screen to navigate on on the T_V_ so  project manager: but user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: It's easy to build , user interface: industrial designer: it does not consume much power . marketing: Oh , but you have a catch there ,  assume that  if you want to go to if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine , then . user interface: industrial designer: Well , then y you you go to the main menu and  you have  go to channel user interface:  . No , because you choose by channel , so you choose by T_V_ program industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: but  I I think i i if you if you want to to make  well a a big jump but  well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could marketing: But project manager: So you are user interface: Ah . user interface: A mouse or industrial designer: Well , not a mouse but  something that that says more clearly that  right , left , up , down , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: well , the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator , maybe directly , or marketing:    . So it'll beep if you wanna find it marketing: too small that it goes under the sofa and we can't find it . project manager: user interface: you just  shout y h just it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device . user interface: And responds to you , and industrial designer: marketing: Yeah , that's right . marketing: Okay , after having the inputs from industrial design and user interface , I think most of the points which I want to are already covered here . user interface: marketing: And to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested , then what we have done is we have put a feedback forms in all the magazines , and the users send the feedbacks , and based on that These are the findings which we got and yeah adding of a speech interface is always good for a T_V_ remote but the technology We already know that as discussed earlier industrial designer: Well I I think it will be a , yes , a bit complicated to  make a speech recognisers runs on the small  ts user interface: project manager: marketing: An it does how feasible it is . I if you just recognise  numbers is a limited you have limited vocabulary marketing: Oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones . industrial designer: And this can allow to choose the the program , for instance without  adding  buttons user interface: Yeah . And of course most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive , project manager: marketing: so this is an important criteria here is user interface: But project manager: But do you think what they sug suggested s possibility . user interface: I no I I think that  i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with  reasonable cost . marketing: user interface: Maybe not less , but they may be willing to pay little bit more for comfort , marketing: Little bit more if it's with extra features . industrial designer: Well ,  project manager: There is in the marketing: for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes . industrial designer: marketing: Or they say movie name or I don't go for movie names but only for the numbers on the channel , or volume up , volume down , brightness , contrast . industrial designer: we we just have to find a mean how to to add a m a a a microphone or  well yes a microphone into the the remote control , so marketing: I think user interface: industrial designer: I well project manager: I think i industrial designer: it will be alright . project manager: What about lighting adaptive options ? marketing: Yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting , but I think  not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required . user interface: So you need s special T_V_ sets to do that ? Or it's it's done via this remote controller ? It's very complex . marketing:  industrial designer: Yeah , I think it's a bit complex too user interface: marketing:  yeah , it's for the  industrial design and users interface designers to decide if it's going to be working or not . industrial designer: For our next product , our new T_V_ set with  automatical  sound adjustment light marketing: I think project manager: user interface: Yeah , then we can conclude that . So any things to to discuss ? Or any suggestions ? user interface: marketing: I think as I discussed th that four points would be good for  marketing . And regarding the teletext  these are the subtitl these are the text information which you got on the televisions . marketing: And  if you are a French guy watching an English movie you would like to have it in French . industrial designer: marketing: So , the remote it should have some it should give me some flexibility of choosing the ch languages . industrial designer: Yeah , but well what about the the new project's requirement ? I I I think we should give up with teletext , no ? project manager: I think we we can we is the . Well , so maybe we we can j we can already think  about a way to to access the internet via the television . industrial designer: Because if user interface: Using the T_V_ to access the internet ? Or what ? I didn't quite understand industrial designer: Yeah , but  we can think that in a few years there will be T_V_ set that can access the internet . industrial designer: So it's a good idea if i i if we i if if we  think about how to to to build up our remote  control w with this functionality in a w which will c which will come in a few years . industrial designer: So if we already have it in our remote control project manager: So you have to anticipate the the future ? industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: well , not not to implement it , but to well , to find a way to to add to add this functionality in a yeah , in an in an easy manner , if is possible "

        "Query": "Summarize the discussions and debates surrounding the government's response to Covid-19, including the delay, companies laying off workers, transparency of information, contact tracing apps, and eligibility for art funding.",
        "Summary": "The Prime Minister responded to the opposition party's concerns by highlighting the government's swift implementation of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and their support for small businesses through the Canada Emergency Business Account. However, the opposition party expressed dissatisfaction, believing that the government did not reach out to enough businesses. They also criticized the rigidity and difficulty of the rent relief program. The Prime Minister reiterated that the government's priority has always been to support workers in need and prevent job losses across all organizations and companies. The Minister of Canadian Heritage emphasized the government's commitment to transparency during the crisis, but the opposition party questioned the allocation of $35 billion in infrastructure funds, suspecting that it may have been used for personal salaries. The government assured that they have been actively exploring ways to enhance contact tracing capabilities in collaboration with provinces, territories, and volunteer organizations, while also addressing concerns raised by the Privacy Commissioner regarding privacy and ethical considerations. Additionally, the Minister of Canadian Heritage announced a funding of $500 million to support Canada's arts, sports, and cultural sectors, with further details to be released in the coming days.",
        "Article": "anthony rota (nipissingtimiskaming, lib.)): I call this meeting to order. Welcome to meeting number 22 of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. A reminder to all members that in order to avoid issues with sound, members participating in person should not also be connected to the video conference. For those joining via video conference, I would like to remind you that, when speaking, you should be on the same channel as the language you are speaking. I understand we don't have any ministerial announcements today, so we'll proceed to presenting petitions. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. For members participating in person, we ask that they please come and drop the signed certificate off at the table once the petition is presented. Chair, it's an honour to rise in meeting number 22 of the COVID-19 committee, otherwise known as something like the House of Commons. I'm here to present two petitions containing hundreds of signatures on the issue of the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners by the People's Republic of China, particularly the practice that's alleged of involuntary organ harvesting. The petitioners ask the Government of Canada to condemn this practice and to publicly call for an end to the persecution of Falun Gong in the People's Republic of China. The second petition is from residents throughout SaanichGulf Islands concerned about what was, at the time this petition was submitted, a future problem. It remains an issue, and I present it on behalf of petitioners who wish the Government of Canada not to put public funds into purchasing or maintaining the Trans Mountain pipeline or towards any expansion of the pipeline. The petitioners note the pandemic is having a devastating impact on many Canadians nationwide, especially those who have low to modest income, small business gig workers, freelancers, artists, film industry workers, non-salaried workers and individuals on fixed incomes such as seniors and those on disability. It further notes that rent, mortgage and utility payments are due at the end of each month, putting countless Canadians at risk of losing their housing. To that end, the petitioners are calling for the government to immediately enact a nationwide rent freeze, eviction freeze, mortgage freeze and utility freeze, enforce mortgage deferrals for homeowners without penalty or interest charges from financial institutions and provide direct assistance in the form of a monthly, universal, direct payment of $2,000 per month for all, with an additional $250 per child immediately. Trans Mountain, in building the pipeline, brings massive environmental and economic risk with no substantial benefit to British Columbia or to local residents. Approximately 40,000 barrels of oil have already leaked from existing Kinder Morgan pipelines, including two major spills in Burnaby since 2007. Chair, that just this past weekend there was yet another spill to the tune of 1,195 barrels here in British Columbia. There is no known scientific technology to clean up the bitumen when there is a spill, and the number of tankers would go from eight to 34 per month into the Burrard Inlet. I want to remind all members in the House that when presenting a petition, the idea is to be as concise as possible. The petitioners are calling for the government to immediately act to prevent this new oil pipeline from proceeding through British Columbia. The first petition reflects the outrage of my constituents at the ever-expanding order in council from the government banning more and more firearms. In particular, the petitioners highlight the failure of the government to act on the issue of illegal guns. The petitioners note that virtually all violent crimes committed in Canada, including the recent shooting in Nova Scotia, involve illegal firearms in the hands of those who are already not permitted to possess them. First of all, it asks that we reverse the order in council banning certain firearms, but also that we propose measures that will effectively address the illegal use of firearms by criminals while respecting the rights of law-abiding citizens. It also asks that we ensure that substantial changes to firearms laws in future actually be made by Parliament, not by the government acting in an unaccountable manner. The second petition deals with Bill C-8, which is the government's bill around conversion therapy. They're asking the government to support amendments to fix the definition to address the issue of conversion therapy and ensure that the definition is correct and doesn't criminalize certain forms of counselling that individuals may voluntarily enter into. The third petition is regarding Bill S-204, a bill in the Senate that seeks to make it a criminal offence for a person to go abroad to receive an organ without consent, dealing especially with the horrific practice of forced organ harvesting and trafficking in China. There's been much discussion in this House about the need to do better in terms of long-term care. Rather than working to do better in long-term care, unfortunately we've seen the government removing vital safeguards in the area of euthanasia. I think our focus should be on assisting life rather than removing safeguards that are required in association with the euthanasia regime. The petitioners are particularly concerned about the government's plan to remove a 10-day reflection period that normally takes place. That period can already be waived under certain circumstances, but Bill C-7 proposes to remove it entirely as well as reduce the number of witnesses involved. The petitioners are quite concerned about what's going on in Bill C-7 and call for it to be stopped or amended. Racialized and marginalized communities have been disproportionally affected by the pandemic. We need to do the same for the climate crisis, because humanity and our planet are too big to fail. At risk of neglect and assault, many of the most vulnerable older persons reside in our long-term care facilities. They are the seniors who have built our country and shaped our communities, who have shown us resilience, courage and selflessness, who have made us stronger, and whose work and teachings continue to inspire us. We have not been there for them in the same way they've been there for us throughout their lives. The Canadian Forces report, alongside the climbing disproportionate death toll in our long-term care facilities, has reconfirmed the ugly, indefensible reality of elder abuse and neglect in Canada. In my community, we mourn the deaths of 68 seniors from one long-term care facility alone, Camilla Care. the chair: Before proceeding, I just want to bring up to the members in the background that we want to keep it as simple and as parliamentary as possible in keeping it neutral. michael barrett (leedsgrenvillethousand islands and rideau lakes, cpc): During these trying times, the residents of LeedsGrenvilleThousand Islands and Rideau Lakes have risen to the challenge. They've made sacrifices and gone above and beyond to make the lives of their neighbours better and to keep our communities safe. It would be impossible to list everyone who has emerged as a community hero, but I'd like to highlight a few, like Lily, an eight-year-old from Elgin who raised funds for her local food bank by building and selling squirrel picnic tables, and Louise Boardman from Spencerville who's making masks for long-term care facilities and selling others in support of the Breast Cancer Action centre. The Knights of Columbus in Prescott raised funds and are distributing some $27,000 in support of charitable groups throughout the region. Who can forget our top-notch health care workers like Hannah and Mary at the Brockville COVID-19 testing centre? It is the people of LeedsGrenvilleThousand Islands and Rideau Lakes that make it so great. Chair, the Indian Act enshrined racism into Canadian law in 1876, and, through residential schools, the child welfare system, our legal system and our police, we criminalized and tore apart indigenous peoples. The deaths of Chantel Moore and Rodney Levi and the assault on Chief Allan Adam are recent examples of systemic racism within the RCMP. Anti-black racism has resulted in more young black men being jailed, children being streamed or excluded from schools and negative police interaction due to profiling. It is now time to reimagine and rework our institutions, starting with our police, to ensure that all Canadians can achieve their truest potential. andranne larouche (shefford, bq): Thank you, Mr.Chair. That's why the increase in the old age security benefit and the guaranteed income supplement must be extended beyond the pandemic. In three weeks, our seniors will receive their first cheque, when they should be receiving their second. A date must also be announced for the new horizons for seniors program, which helps several groups develop projects to break the isolation of seniors. In closing, I would like to mention the organization Justice alternative et mdiation that during the pandemic, along with other organizations in Shefford, has set up the project Une histoire pour la tienne, which also serves to mark this day. It's a virtual meeting between young people and seniors, allowing them to exchange some inspiring life experiences. Since age prejudice is very much present, I applaud this project, which aims to make us understand each other better and judge each other less. Chair, in the time of this terrible crisis affecting all Canadians, when we are all thinking about how best to deal with it, let's all think about the people around us. Let's show our representation not only to those in the sector of sanctioned workers, but also to all those Canadians who day by day stand up and make a difference. I want to acknowledge and celebrate all the contributions made by the people of Brampton Centre, all religious institutions, civil society and community organizations like Knights Table in my riding. Chair, whether graduating from elementary school, high school, Georgian College or graduating from colleges or universities across the country, I am proud of the accomplishments of all the graduates across BruceGreyOwen Sound. I would also like to congratulate and thank all the teachers and parents who have adapted to teaching online or from home and who have supported these graduates over the course of their academic careers. I'd like to extend special congratulations to Cameron Lovell, who just graduated from grade eight, as well as to Neebeesh and Neebin Elliott, originally from the Nawash unceded first nation on the Bruce Peninsula, who will be headed to Michigan State University, and to Jared Lumley from Owen Sound, who just graduated from my alma mater, the Royal Military College of Canada. The college motto of Truth, Duty, Valour is something all Canadians should aspire to live by. serge cormier (acadiebathurst, lib.): Today I pay tribute to RichardLosier, an entrepreneur, visionary and builder who died on June9, 2020, surrounded by his family. In1968, he co-founded St.Isidore Asphalte, a company that now has more than 200employees. He was unifying and generous, a philanthropist who cared about young people and never missed an opportunity to improve their lives. I met Mr.Losier when I was 14years old, and I can say that he has been a positive influence in my life. Every time I met him, he gave me a lot of advice and encouragement, which I've never forgotten. I offer my most sincere condolences to his children, Richard Jr., Ronald, Nathalie, Caroline and Stphane, and to his family and friends. julie dabrusin (torontodanforth, lib.): Hello from my community in east end Toronto. People talk about how a city the size of Toronto can be cold, but that's far from the truth in my community. Wong of Earl Grey Senior Public School, who delivered home-baked cookies and handwritten notes to all of his students, or Monsieur Steve, who's offering online French classes, or the teachers of Riverdale Collegiate, who paraded through our streets to celebrate our graduates. Our local Michael Garron Hospital put out a call for community members to sew masks and received over 60,000 masks, including those made by Lisa Tancre of Chartwell Avondale Retirement Residence. Restaurants, even while facing adversity, have been generously donating food, like the members of the Leslieville BIA or Mezes. There are so many more stories of generosity that I could share, but I'm out of time. Chair, on Saturday night, Calgarians, particularly those in the northeast, in my riding of Calgary Skyview, witnessed a devastating storm, the likes of which I have not seen in my lifetime. Homes, vehicles, community buildings and structures suffered significant damage due to large hail, floods and high winds. My heart aches for those who have been impacted by the storm in an already incredibly difficult time, but we are resilient. We know that in the coming weeks there will be a lot of cleanup required, both to personal property and in the community. I'd like to express my sincere gratitude to the people of West Nippissing who organized Pride activities to celebrate the LGBTQ community in June. I thank the public servants for their dedication to the Nickel Belt community and the Valley East and Rayside-Balfour areas. Chair, when COVID-19 began spreading across Ontario, Markham, like many other communities, was unprepared. When Markham residents heard about these shortages, my office was flooded with calls from people who had PPE and wanted to donate. Since then my office has been able to deliver tens of thousands of PPE supplies to front-line health care workers and five masks to each family in need. This pandemic has shown that no matter what the challenge is, the Markham community will overcome it. As we start to see local businesses reopen, it is important for all of us to remember to follow best practices outlined by local public health. It is important for all of us to respect social distancing, to protect all workers and their families. the chair: Again, my apologies for skipping over there, but now we'll to to Ms. Chair, in commemoration of Italian Heritage Month, I would like to pay tribute to the Colombo Lodge and Italian Cultural Centre in Kamloops, British Columbia. Recently they began Colombo Cares take-home dinners with proceeds distributed to different non-profit organizations throughout the region. Last month they very generously gave away hundreds of dinners to Royal Inland Hospital staff and paramedics for their tireless work throughout the pandemic. In their own words they say, Colombo Lodge is very proud of the Italians that have made Kamloops their home. Community members of Italian ancestrypast and presenthave helped and continue to help Kamloops prosper as a giving, welcoming and inclusive community. People are worried about what will happen when the CERB runs out in two weeks' time, and the coming tourism season looks very grim. The province itself is in serious financial crisis due to the pandemic and the decline in oil prices. The federal government must overhaul and enhance the fiscal stabilization program to help Newfoundlanders and Labradorians and other oil-producing provinces through this crisis. This is a challenge and an opportunity to transition to a sustainable energy future, but it will require significant investment and support by government to keep the industry strong and make this a just transition for workers. marie-hlne gaudreau (laurentideslabelle, bq): Mr.Chair, all 44elected municipal officials in the riding of LaurentidesLabelle and I have sent a letter to the government asking that cellular and high-speed Internet networks be made available to all. The territorial complexity of the Laurentians means that there are areas where the signal is weak, unstable or non-existent. Also, because of the lockdown, Internet failures are being felt, and they prevent distance learning, telemedicine and teleworking, among other things. How can our municipalities develop economically if they can't provide their community with adequate communication tools? We are therefore calling on the government to put the interests of its people first by investing massively right now in the construction of high-speed Internet and cellular infrastructure. kevin waugh (saskatoongrasswood, cpc): I rise today to pay tribute to Sir Winston Churchill, the former prime minister of Great Britain and one of the greatest leaders history has ever known. In what can only be called a lifetime of service, Churchill's contributions to the Commonwealth and to the world are without equal. During the Second World War he led the allied forces in Europe against the tyranny and fascism of Adolph Hitler and his Nazi regime. When our world was in its darkest hour, Churchill's leadership was a beacon of hope and freedom. I am reminded of something he once said, All the greatest things are simple, and many can be expressed in a single word: freedom, justice, honour, duty, mercy, hope. Sir Winston Churchill himself embodied all of these great things and will forever be a symbol of freedom, democracy and hope. Chair, I would like to add my voice to the recognition and celebration of Pride Month, which is celebrated annually during June. However, I know the ongoing pandemic will not stop us from showing our love and support for the LGBTQ+ community. To celebrate Pride Month this year, my office distributed 3,000 pride maple leaf pins across the country; whoever asked received one. Although the majority was sent to constituents in my riding, over 500 pins were sent to the neighbouring ridings of LanarkFrontenacKingston, LeedsGrenvilleThousand Islands and Rideau Lakes, and HastingsLennox and Addington. Please note that we will suspend the proceedings twice to allow employees who provide support for the sitting to substitute for each other safely. grard deltell (louis-saint-laurent, cpc): Mr.Chair, I am very pleased to take part in today's meeting of this parliamentary committee. chrystia freeland (deputy prime minister and minister of intergovernmental affairs): Mr.Chair, I thank the hon. I agree with him that Canada and Canadians are doing an excellent and difficult job in the fight against coronavirus. As for the economy, our government is there for Canadians, for workers and for businesses, and it will continue to be. chrystia freeland: Mr.Chair, Canadians know that the government is there to support them. grard deltell: Canadians and Quebeckers also know that the Government of Quebec will table its economic update this week. members and to Canadians what the government is doing for the economy the chair: We return to Mr.Deltell. Chair, it is a real pleasure for me to explain to the minister and everybody in the House of Commons that today the Saskatchewan government will table its economic update. Chair, I'm delighted to have the opportunity to share with Canadians what our government is doing to support workers, businesses and the economy. We see governments acting correctly for their people, except for the Liberal government, which cannot table an economic update. When will the Liberal government table an economic update, which Canadians would like to see? the chair: The honourable Deputy Prime Minister. Chair, I am delighted to share with the member opposite and with Canadians what we are doing practically that has meaning for Canadians. Everybody is working hard in Canada, and the business community would like to know where the Liberal government is going. I've spoken about the CEBA, and let me point out that more than $26 billion of support has been given through that essential program. grard deltell: Mr.Chair, this is starting to get interesting; the minister is revealing some of these expenses. chrystia freeland: Mr.Chair, I will continue in French by explaining what our government is doing for Canadians and workers the chair: Mr.Deltell. Chair, this is a little bit concerning for all Canadians, because this government cannot say when they will table the economic update, cannot identify how much money they have spent in the last three months and cannot say what is the deficit of Canada. christine normandin (saint-jean, bq): Mr.Chair, there are times when Quebec and the provinces are not just two solitudes, but they get along and speak as one, such as when the time comes to tell the government to mind its own business. On reading section91 of the Constitution Act, 1982, which sets out the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government, nowhere do I find that the federal government must meddle by attaching conditions to health transfers. Will the government do the only thing within its authority, which is to take the cheque, sign it and put it in the mail? hon. We fully understand the importance of federal support for the provinces, especially in our national fight against the coronavirus. I would also like to point out the importance of the support of the Canadian Armed Forces, who are doing an important and excellent job in Quebec and Ontario today, right now. christine normandin: Mr.Chair, I am glad to see that there is recognition of the importance of transferring this money. My question is whether it can be transferred unconditionally; that's what I'm asking. In the past, we have seen that it takes a long time to negotiate conditions with the federal government. We saw it in the case of the Quebec City tramway, and we are still seeing it now in the case of transfers for housing in Quebec, for which there is no agreement and, therefore, no transfer of money. member said in her first question that the only thing the federal government had to do on health care was to sign the cheques. I can't agree because, today, at this time, at the request of the Premier of Quebec, the men and women of the Canadian Armed Forces are in Quebec today; they're there to save the lives of seniors the chair: We now return to Ms.Normandin. What I'm saying is that, at present, the provinces are unanimously asking that there be no conditions. This is where there should be negotiations so that we can work, among other things, to send money to people living with disabilities, to make sure we fight CERB fraud and to make sure that court time limits are effective in the current crisis. Can the government focus on the issue in order to respect the provinces and transfer money for health care? hon. member that the women and men of the Canadian Armed Forces are in Quebec today at the request of the Province of Quebec. member will agree with me that being there for Quebec's seniors, that saving the lives of Quebec's seniors, is much more than simply signing cheques. I think we all should thank these people who are working for Canada, for Quebec, and who are doing an important and excellent job. christine normandin: Mr.Chair, I think the Deputy Prime Minister misunderstood me when I was talking about the importance of acting quickly. Negotiations between the government and the provinces take an awfully long time because the federal government decides to place conditions where there shouldn't be any. Right now, the only important thing is to transfer the money quickly so that it can be used in our hospitals and our long-term care facilities, where the need is desperate. chrystia freeland: Mr.Chair, I would like to point out the extent to which the federal government is there to support the provinces, including Quebec. We have increased funding to the provinces and territories by $500million to help them prepare for COVID-19 outbreaks. This funding is in addition to the $40billion that we already provide annually to the provinces and territories. Chair, I thank the member opposite for the extremely important question, and I'll take this opportunity to acknowledge the work that he has done for many years fighting racism in Canada. Chair, I thank the Deputy Prime Minister very much for the response, but there are some specific actions we need to take. When someone is in need of a wellness check or a mental health check, money, financing and support should go to mental health workers and health care workers, not the police. Chair, the member quite rightly began his questions by speaking about systemic racism against indigenous people in Canada, and I would like to speak about that for a moment. Chair, will the Liberal government commit to a review of the use of force as outlined for the RCMP? Will the Liberals commit to that change? hon. Chair, the Prime Minister and the Minister of Public Safety had many conversations last week with the RCMP. Will the Prime Minister or the Liberal government commit to something simple and ensure that at the federal level, racial profiling, street checks and carding are expressly prohibited? hon. Chair, sadly, I can't agree that rooting out systemic racism is going to be simple, but I can agree that racial profiling is absolutely inappropriate. jagmeet singh: Well, I'm going to try to get another commitment from the government, because they don't seem able to commit to something as clear as ending racial profiling. We know that millions of Canadians in a couple of weeks are going to be faced with the reality of their CERB ending. These families are worried about how they're going to put food on the table, because they can't return to a job. Will the Liberal government commit today so that those families will have some concrete support, yes or no? hon. Chair, let me be clear, as I was in my previous answer, that our government clearly is opposed to racial profiling. We know that Canadian workers, Canadian families, continue to need the chair: We'll now pause for a short time to allow staff to change within the safety parameters for the COVID-19 virus, and as we resume, we will go to Ms. Chair, the Prime Minister has mandated his ministers, and I quote, to govern in a positive, open and collaborative way. Opposition parties have little opportunity to hold the ruling party to account, private members' bills cannot be tabled and legislation cannot be debated. Trudeau himself, help us understand how all of this fits into his definition of so-called open government? the honourable pablo rodriguez (leader of the government in the house of commons): Well, Mr. Chair, we're here, right? We're here, and the opposition is asking questions. They have more time than before, so I don't know why they're not happy about it. rachael harder: That's like when I'm asking for a full meal and your handing me a few jellybeans and saying, Why aren't you happy with that? Mr. It's like switching a light on and off when it's convenient for the Prime Minister and for the Liberal Party. Trudeau do the right thing, turn the lights on and get back to work for Canadians? hon. Chair, on this side of the House, we're all actually working very hard and we're answering the questions from the opposition. On the Liberal Party website, under the platform commitment, it says that Parliament works best when its members are free to do what they have been elected to do, and that is be the voice for their communities and hold the government to account. The thing is, I think we've reached a balance whereby MPs can come from different places, mostly around Ottawa, and ask questions; but also we can have colleagues from across the country asking questions. rachael harder: Does the Prime Minister value democracy, or does he still look up to China's basic dictatorship? hon. Chair, we're answering all the questions from the opposition, not only from the people in this room, but we're answering the chair: It's back to Ms. I'd like to know from her why it is not important to her that her colleagues participate directly. Trudeau wrote to his ministers and said to them that they continue to raise the bar on openness, effectiveness and transparency. Trudeau has shut it down and has prevented us from being able to do to the good work that Canadians expect us to do. Chair, do they want to talk about shutting down Parliament? How about the time they prorogued Parliament twicenot only once, but twice? The Conservative government shut down Parliament twice. I want to remind honourable members that questions and answers are being given, and we want to hear both sides. rachael harder: In 2014, the leader of the Liberal Party developed a policy resolution entitled Restoring Trust in Canada's Democracy. At the time, the Prime Minister said, Canadians want their Members of Parliament to be effective voices for their communities in Ottawa, and not merely mouthpieces in their communities for an all-too-powerful Prime Minister. Chair, I'd like to know why my colleague wants to shut down the voices of her colleagues who could not speak and could not participate in this room. Chair, how would we vote on private members' bills, for example? As you know, it is not a government vote or a party vote; it's per row. Chair, through youthat we have electronic voting, yes or no? the chair: We'll go on to Mr. Chair, we know that the Minister of Foreign Affairs has champagne tastes and London flats, but it's his champagne mortgages that Canadians are concerned about. Specifically, why did the minister only disclose the complete extent of his personal debt to the Chinese government on June 4 of this year? hon. Chair, as you know, since the minister entered politics, his two mortgages and other liabilities and assets have been fully disclosed to the Ethics Commissioner and placed on the online public registry. We're in the middle of a pandemic here, trying to help Canadians, and the best they can do is ask questions about the chair: We will go back to Mr. garnett genuis: When the minister owes over a million dollars to the Chinese government, people have a right to ask him questions. I still don't know why they ask the chair: We'll now go back to Mr. Where is the minister? Why is he hiding? Why won't he answer questions about his personal debt to the Chinese government? hon. What is the impact on the decision-making? Three-quarters of Canadians don't want Huawei involved in our 5G network. Will the minister put the interests of Canadians ahead of the interests of his creditors and say no to Huawei? hon. We have been absolutely clear with allies and with Canadians that we never have and never will compromise Canadians' national interests. Chair, that is not an answer, and it is completely out of step with what our allies have already recognized. Reports are emerging of multiple deadly viruses exported from Winnipeg's microbiology laboratory to the Wuhan Institute of Virology right before scientists were expelled for policy breaches. In spite of that, scientific co-operation between Canadian institutions and the military-affiliated Wuhan Institute of Virology is continuing. Why hasn't the government put in place new guidelines to prevent the export of sensitive pathogens and information to China? hon. Chair, he's right that in 2019 the National Microbiology Laboratory shared lab samples with the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The National Microbiology Laboratory routinely shares samples with other labs to help advance the international community's understanding of viruses and the research that is ongoing around those viruses. There are strict protocols in place for these transfers, and these samples were transported according to Canadian laws and regulations. Chair, I think Canadians would be concerned to hear that it's routine to transport viruses to Chinese military-affiliated labs. When Champagne was the parliamentary secretary for finance, the government decided to give hundreds of millions of dollars to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, bankrolling Chinese state-controlled development projects in Asia with weak standards in labour, human rights and environment. Will the minister put Canadian taxpayers ahead of his personal creditors and support a pullout from the Communist Party-controlled development bank? hon. Chair, my colleague is trying to connect the dots, and I don't know exactly where he is going from here, but everything is public. I'm sure this exchange will also be available on Google, and the public can draw their own conclusions. We have failures on 5G, failures when it comes to the transport of deadly viruses and failures when it comes to giving over $400 million to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. It's time for the minister to settle his debt with the Communist government and not settle it on the backs of Canadians. michael barrett: Canada's ambassador to the United Nations sent a letter last week to all member states of the UN promising that Canada would consider providing more funding for UNRRA, the same UNRRA that is a front for Hamas, which allows weapons of terror to be stored in schools and provides textbooks that call for the destruction of Israel. Do these Liberals have no shame when it comes to their quest for a seat on the UN Security Council? hon. More than ever, Canada is playing a positive role by being a champion in diversity and inclusion, supporting the global fight against COVID-19, addressing climate change, leading peace and security efforts and helping the most vulnerable. A seat on the Security Council will allow Canada to be a strong voice for a fairer, more inclusive and prosperous the chair: We'll go back to Mr. Chair, I received a letter from Bob Anderson this week, who's advocating for his neighbours like Jean Grevelding, who owns a cottage at Butternut Bay. Of course, our priority is and always has been and always must be the protection of the health and safety of Canadians. That's why we put in place these restrictions for non-essential travel and have required, through the Public Health Agency of Canada, a 14-day quarantine. I don't know the specifics of the person for whom you advocate, but we want to make sure that if they come into Canada, it is for an essential purpose and that they do it safely and respect the quarantine that has been put in place. michael barrett: With nine branches throughout my riding, the Royal Canadian Legion offers a great deal to veterans and rural communities alike. They have been experiencing hardship and a loss of revenue, to the point where they may be forced to shut their doors. The Zone G2 commander and local mayors such as Roger Haley have reached out to me expressing their dire need. Will the government offer support to Legions across the country so they can continue to carry out their vital work for our veterans? hon. Indeed, we're doing everything we can to make sure that we help the Legions and other groups that do so much to help veterans right across the country. michael barrett: On May 21, the minister stated that her team was working as quickly as it could to fill the gaps in CEBA. It has now been three weeks, and many business owners, such as mortgage broker Corinna Smith-Gatcke, are still left in the lurch amid the delays, which are pushing businesses closer to shutting their doors for good. Those businesses can absolutely have access to the loan at their financial institution this Friday, and I would encourage them to go and see their bank or credit union. I want businesses to know that nothing is more important for us than making sure they get the support they need during this difficult time. michael barrett: The County Road 43 expansion project is critical for my riding and the region as a whole. This project will widen the road, increasing safety for the 18,000 motorists who travel the road every day. It's been 334 days since the provincial and local governments announced funding, but there has been nothing from this Liberal government. Today, there is still nothing, and for the last month the minister's team has not even found the time to respond to my request for an update. We're always happy to work with members of Parliament, but they must also work with provinces and territories so that projects are advanced by them to our office. MacAulay read ombudsman Dalton's May 2020 report, Financial Compensation for Canadian Veterans: A comparative analysis of benefit regimes? hon. Wagantall, we'll freeze the time so that there's no extra time taken. MacAulay has read ombudsman Dalton's May 2020 report, Financial Compensation for Canadian Veterans: A comparative analysis of benefit regimes. I've done everything and worked with him in order to make sure that we bring the proper compensation to veterans the chair: We'll go back to Mrs. cathay wagantall: As a result of that study, are the financial outcomes Canada seeks to provide for ill and injured veterans now clearly defined within the Department of Veterans Affairs? hon. Chair, as the member would know, I am to bring a report to the veterans affairs committee, and there are a number of things done in order to make sure that report is the chair: We'll go back to Mrs. cathay wagantall: Then I would suggest that we get our committee up and going as it should be. lawrence macaulay: Well, of course, lockdown, but just under $90 million that the government put in supplementary estimates to make sure we address the backlog for Veterans Affairs. cathay wagantall: Minister, are Canadian Armed Forces members provided with a copy of this document? hon. In Ombudsman Dalton's recent report, did any one of these three provide the best compensation in all nine scenarios that were studied? hon. lawrence macaulay: Of course, as she knows, there's been a lot of work done in order to make sure that we provide the proper compensation to veterans. cathay wagantall: In the undisclosed settlement of Sean Bruyea's legal case against Seamus O'Regan and the Liberal government, a joint statement says ...Canadians, especially all Veterans and their families, are encouraged to enter the public debate about policies and programs that affect our Veterans and their families. lawrence macaulay: I can assure you that anybody is welcome to enter any discussion on compensation of veterans. We're always open to what we can do in order to make sure that we provide appropriate compensation. I don't think the term would be appropriate, but it would provide some compensation to veterans who truly deserve it.  Ms.Larouche, did I understand correctly that the interpretation didn't work for both speakers? ms. andranne larouche: The sound didn't allow the interpreters to do their job. the chair: In that case, I would ask both members to maybe put their mike a little bit close to their mouth. cathay wagantall: On a point of order, quite often while I'm trying to speak, there are lots of other voices in the background. the chair: I would ask everyone to please be on mute, as well as for anyone in the chamber to please refrain from speaking loudly. cathay wagantall: You said next question, so we're not going backwards, Chair? the chair: Did we have an answer from Minister MacAulay? No? We'll go to Minister MacAulay to finish up the answer. Then, because of all of the confusion, we'll start at one minute and 45 seconds when we get going again. cathay wagantall: Should I repeat the question, sir? the chair: Please do. In the undisclosed settlement to Sean Bruyea's legal case against Seamus O'Regan and the Liberal government, a joint statement says, Canadians, especially all Veterans and their families, are encouraged to enter the public debate about policies and programs that affect our Veterans and their families. Anybody is quite open to indicate whatever they wish in order to make sure we provide as appropriate a compensation as possible. You can never totally compensate veterans truly for what they deserve, but we want to make sure we provide the best compensation possible. cathay wagantall: If that's the case, is Minister MacAulay aware of the practice of red-flagging veterans' files? hon. cathay wagantall: Since the deputy minister has indicated that he runs the department, will the minister ask him for the names of veterans and the dates and the reasons that they are, or have been, red-flagged by VAC? hon. I will do anything I can to make sure that the veterans the chair: We'll go back to Ms. cathay wagantall: Do the most ill and injured still receive from the pension up to $300,000 less for life? hon. Chair, as you know and as the Prime Minister indicated when the pension for life was put in place, it was stated that if anybody receives lessthe Prime Minister himself indicated it quite clearlythat must be adjusted. cathay wagantall: For veterans in similar circumstances, should the date of their application for compensation be a factor in determining whether they're treated equitably? hon. Retired Major Mark Campbell in my riding of Sturgeon RiverParkland lost both legs in the line of duty in Afghanistan. He is an avid sport shooter, but understandably, due to his disability, he is very limited in the kinds of firearms he can use, and all of these firearms have now been banned under the Liberal OIC. My question to the Minister of Public Safety is this: Did their department do a legal analysis and consider the section 15 charter rights of disabled Canadians not to be discriminated against when they passed their OIC? hon. bill blair: Yes, there was a very thorough analysis done by the justice department to ensure that the prohibitions we put in place were, in fact, charter compliant. We have prohibited them, and we believeand this has been echoed by many people across the countrythat this will make Canadians safer. Chair, is the minister aware that the AR-15 is the most popular sporting rifle in Canada, and is he aware that disabled veterans like Major Mark Campbell are unable to participate in the sport of sport shooting because of his OIC? hon. bill blair: I can assure the member that what I am aware of is that the AR-15 and other weapons like them have been used in mass killings in Canada on many occasions, such as at cole Polytechnique, at Dawson College, again at the Quebec mosque and in Moncton. The AR-15s in particular were also used at the terrible tragedy in places like Sandy Hook, where a bunch of kids were killed, so there is no place for the chair: We will go to Mr. Chair, it has been months since the Liberals shut down this Parliament and months since the Minister of Finance should have presented a budget or at least an economic update to Canadians. Well, that didn't stop Stephen Harper and the Conservatives from tabling a budget in the depth of the last great recession. We're working for Canadians and bringing forward supports to make sure that businesses, workers and Canadians can put food on the table and pay their rent. We will continue to support Canadians, and when we have a clear projection to present, we will do that. Chair, the results are in, and businesses aren't happy with the so-called support programs from these Liberals. When is the government going to recognize that their business support plans have been an absolute failure with only a fraction of the billions promised being accessible to businesses? hon. We had the BCAP, which is critically important to providing liquidity to support the SMEs that make up 85% of the jobs in our sector. We are helping hard-working Canadians, small businesses and large businesses right across the country, but in particular in our energy sector. He tweeted recently to praise the Alberta Carbon Trunk Line and the North West Redwater Partnership refinery in my riding. Can the minister tell us what, if any, support they have given to the innovative carbon capture and sequestration technology in this country? hon. Chair, we see carbon capture and sequestration as an integral part of lowering emissions, making emissions more competitive and making our oil and gas industry more competitive. dane lloyd: I note that the minister couldn't name a single example of government support for carbon capture, utilization and sequestration technology. We have spent a lot of time talking about the COVID-19 pandemic, but Canadians are living with another horrific reality, that being the intensifying opioid overdose epidemic. Reports indicate that in the past four years, 14,000 Canadians have died, and the numbers during COVID-19 have been skyrocketing, with British Columbia seeing a 39% increase this year alone. When is the government going to take this scourge seriously and take action to save the lives of Canadians? hon. Chair, I share the member's deep sadness about the number of lives we've lost to opioid overdose. Our government has been steadily making it easier for people who live with substance use to access medications to treat substance use, such as prescription Suboxone and methadone. We have made it easier to rapidly establish safe injection sites in communities and have supported community-based projects that work with people who are using substances. We need to understand that this is a complex issue, and we need to support people to get the help they need. carol hughes (algomamanitoulinkapuskasing, ndp)): The hon. louise chabot (thrse-de blainville, bq): MadamChair, I will come back to the bill introduced last week. As parliamentarians, we felt like we were watching a very bad play, as I imagine the public did. However, the government did not see fit to negotiate with the opposition parties, even though it is in a minority position. One of the things we proposed was to split the bill so that we could give this support to people with disabilities, but the Conservatives did not want to do that. We came back and asked for time to negotiate and give support to people with disabilities, but the government defeated the motion. We asked that the House be recalled today so that we could pass this part of the bill concerning support for people with disabilities, but we are still in the dark. We know this pandemic has deeply affected the lives and health of all Canadians and has disproportionately affected Canadians with disabilities in particular. From the very beginning, we've taken a disability-inclusive approach to our emergency response to ensure that Canadians with disabilities get the support they need. That is why we announced a one-time payment of $600 for persons with disabilities to address these expenses. We're confident that this measure, along with other investments, will benefit Canadians with disabilities, and we hope to get the support of the other parties very soon. louise chabot: MadamChair, I remind you that this measure wasn't passed because we weren't allowed to do so. We've tried here, in the House, to provide the means to give that support, so I ask again, can the government be counted on to give a response to people with disabilities? hon. It contained assistance for the disabled, of course, but it also contained assistance for our seasonal workers, as well as a number of other measures that the Bloc Qubcois opposed. They refused to debate and, when the question of splitting the bill came up, the Conservatives refused to do that. This bill proposed changes to the wage subsidy program, it was supposed to make the CERB more flexible, it proposed fines for fraudsters and, since there was a little section about a benefit for the disabled, the government took it for granted that we would support it without any negotiations with the parties. However, we set one very important condition: that the Liberal Party must get its hands out of taxpayers' pockets in terms of the wage subsidy. pablo rodriguez: MadamChair, as we listen to the Bloc Qubcois members, we might think that they invented peanut butter and apple pie. This bill contained a number of measures that all Quebeckers and all Canadians needed, but the Bloc Qubcois refused to debate it. No, we did not follow the Bloc Qubcois' example in splitting the bill; we had thought of it a long time previously. louise chabot: We asked on a number of occasions for the House to be able to sit starting today to pass the part of the bill dealing with those with disabilities. pablo rodriguez: MadamChair, my colleague knows very well that things are not as simple as that. I hope that, one day, we will be able to pass this bill and be able to provide assistance for those living with disabilities. yasmin ratansi (don valley east, lib.): Thank you, Madam Chair. Several measures have been implemented for phasing out coal, making polluters pay, providing climate incentives, investing in green technologies and much more, which all together have created a climate plan that is doing more to cut pollution than any other in Canada's history. One area of particular interest is our government's work to protect 25% of Canada's land and 25% of its oceans by 2025. Could the minister update this House on the new conservation projects announced on June 5, World Environment Day, and on how our government is protecting our environment? hon. seamus o'regan: Madam Chair, protecting nature is an important part of how we will address climate change and the very real challenges it presents. That's why on June 5, World Environment Day, our government announced over 60 conservation projects under development across Canada. They'll conserve Canadian nature and biodiversity and protect species at risk, enhance ecological integrity and connectivity, and enhance the size of Canada's vast network of protected areas. Nearly half of these projects are indigenous-led, with the aim of creating indigenous-protected conserved areas. Madam Chair, projects like these move us closer to our goal of protecting 25% of Canada's lands and oceans by 2025. By working together in partnership with the provinces, territories, municipalities, indigenous peoples and Canadians, together we can protect our natural environment for generations to come. Ratansi, since you have 25 seconds left, we will go to the honourable member for Surrey Centre. randeep sarai (surrey centre, lib.): Madam Chair, there are many small and medium-sized businesses in my riding of Surrey Centre. They saw a decrease in business or needed to close their doors completely in order to adhere to public safety measures to manage the spread of COVID-19. These measures helped keep our most vulnerable citizens safe and ensured that our hospital and health care providers did not become overwhelmed with a sharp spike in cases. Thanks to our government's COVID-19 emergency response, many of these businesses have been able to keep their employees and access important liquidity through the Canada emergency business account, which provides loans to small businesses and non-profits, and the Canada emergency wage subsidy, which is helping businesses to keep and rehire their employees while their revenues are down by providing up to 75% of wages for up to 24 weeks. As we begin to reopen the economy and Canadians across the country return to the job market, those benefits will be even more important to help businesses and industries rehire their staff and make important adjustments to align with public health guidelines to gradually increase their operations. Can the minister please update the committee on how many Canadian businesses have taken advantage of CEBA and CEWS since applications for each have been opened? hon. mary ng: Madam Chair, I want to begin by thanking the member for Surrey Centre for all the work he does to support his constituents and small businesses. Canadians across the country need to know our government has been working tirelessly and will continue to work tirelessly on their behalf. This is why we put in place the important programs to help them get through this crisis during this difficult time, programs such as the wage subsidy program. The wage subsidy has helped these businesses keep their employees on the payroll and are now helping in their rehiring as they slowly and safely restart. There are 348,000 businesses being helped with the wage subsidy program, and this means that 2.6 million workers are being helped. Businesses are also being helped through the interest-free $40,000 loan they can access through CEBA to help stay afloat and pay their expenses during this crisis. I'm pleased to inform this House that to date more than 669,000 the acting chair (mrs. Madam Chair, with so many recent reports and videos of police using force, sometimes deadly force, and violence against indigenous and black people in Canada, I've called for the public safety committee to reconvene. If the members agree, will the minister come to the committee and provide concrete answers as to how the government intends to address racism inherent in Canada's law enforcement, and in particular the RCMP? hon. Madam Chair, indigenous people, black Canadians and other racialized people are far too often experiencing systemic racism and disparate outcomes within the entire criminal justice system. In order to respond appropriately, I think it's necessary to begin by acknowledging the lived experience of people who've known bias and discrimination at the hands of the police and our courts and within our prisons. We remain committed to working with all racialized people and all of the members of this House to ensure that we work toward social justice for all Canadians, and I look forward to discussing the member's motion further with him. jack harris: Will the minister and the government commit to facilitating such a meeting of this committee virtually? hon. bill blair: Madam Chair, the decisions of the committee are the committee's, so I'm sure that this will be a discussion within the committee, but if called, I will certainly be pleased to come with my officials to provide the committee with whatever support and information it needs to contribute to this very important discussion. jack harris: In light of what we've seen with Chief Adam in Fort McMurray and the RCMP accepting that the actions were reasonable, will the minister commit to a full review of the use of force by the RCMP, in particular the philosophy, tactics and training that is given to RCMP officers in dealing with the public? hon. bill blair: I thank the member and I want to assure him, first of all, that this is work that is ongoing, not just in the RCMP but throughout the police community. May I also take this opportunity, Madam Chair, to say that I think all police training has to begin with one very important principle, and that's the preservation of all life and the respect for all Canadians. We're committed to continuing to work with indigenous communities, racialized communities and with police services and all participants in the criminal justice system to make sure that it is fair for all Canadians. lindsay mathyssen (londonfanshawe, ndp): Madam Chair, we need more justice for black, indigenous and racialized people in Canada. This government recognizes that systemic racism exists but refuses to collect race-based data that would allow us to quantify and truly address this injustice. bardish chagger (minister of diversity and inclusion and youth): Madam Chair, our government agrees that it's important that we collect data, and that's exactly why, in the anti-racism secretariat and the anti-racism strategy, there is a commitment to have money go to Statistics Canada to collect race-based data. lindsay mathyssen: Madam Chair, we know that Statistics Canada will start to collect job numbers based on race. This will allow us to identify systemic racism where it is and where we need to ensure a fair and more equal job market for black, indigenous and racialized people in Canada. Why is this government refusing to follow suit so we can tackle systemic racism everywhere, in every sector? hon. navdeep bains: Madam Chair, I'd like to thank my honourable colleague for her question. She's absolutely correct in her assessment that we need to collect more data, reliable data, data that will help us deal with some of the challenges we're seeing with systemic discrimination, but, more broadly, we want to make sure that we continue to engage with an anti-racism strategy that will allow us to collect that disaggregated data. That is why we allocated $6.2 million to that initiative through Statistics Canada, but we know we must do more and we will do more. lindsay mathyssen: We know that all people are susceptible to catching COVID-19, but health authorities are clear that parts of cities like Montreal and Toronto have been more impacted than others. For black and racialized people living in these cities, this data is a matter of life and death. Will the government collect and share disaggregated data so we can identify and erase systemic racism, yes or no? hon. bardish chagger: Madam Chair, making decisions based on science and evidence is essential for our government. It is exactly the step we will take moving forward and that's why we are making those investments to ensure that data exists. I look forward to continuing to work not only with all ministers, departments and agencies, but all allies and all parties to get this work done. carol hughes): Mr.Blaney, the honourable member for BellechasseLes EtcheminsLvis, has the floor. steven blaney (bellechasseles etcheminslvis, cpc): Thank you, MadamChair. Last week, my plumber told me that, each time Justin Trudeau comes down the steps to make announcements totalling several billion dollars, he feels like someone is rifling through his pockets. My question is simple and goes to the Minister of Finance: where is this money coming from? hon. steven blaney: The answer I would have liked is simple: we are borrowing the money and we are going to have to pay it back one day. That is another Liberal craze: they borrow money, they make campaign promises, and off they go. Under the Conservative government, the Chantier Davie in Lvis had 1,700workers for the supply ship Asterix. david lametti (minister of justice and attorney general of canada): MadamChair, we are very proud of the Chantier Davie and we completely understand its role in the system. We are going to establish the process for the polar ice-breaker, which is essential for the work of the Coast Guard in northern communities, and we are going to make sure that the acting chair (mrs. There is money in the Canada summer jobs program: in my constituency alone, $150,000has been approved. What is the minister waiting for in order to confirm those positions? In my constituency, and everywhere else in the country, our young people want to work. What is the government waiting for in order to send some cash to the Canada summer jobs program? hon. We are introducing flexibilities into the system to enable employers to be able to hire summer students. The money is available; where is the announcement? MadamChair, our young people are not the only ones who want to work. Let me use Jessie Gito as an example; he has been working at Plate2000 in Saint-Anselme for years. When the time came to renew his work permit, he found out that he has to have some biometric tests. Is the minister going to allow Jessie Gito and the thousands of other temporary foreign workers who want to work to be able to do so until the government biometric testing centres reopen? hon. ahmed hussen: Madam Chair, it is important for the honourable member to recognize that we are in the early recovery stage of the pandemic. We will ensure that we support both our students and our temporary foreign workers to make sure we get the recovery right. We've introduced flexibilities into the program to ensure that employers are able to take advantage of the program and give opportunities to young people. Then, when the government's biometric testing centres are open again, he will gladly go to one. Young people want to work in agriculture as well, and the minister has told us that the government wants young people working and that their files will be processed as quickly as possible. She wants to create 700positions and she knows that people can fill in an application on a first-come first-served basis. Of those 700positions, how many have been confirmed to date? The good weather has arrived, the corn is starting to grow, and this is the time when farmers need the young workers. marie-claude bibeau (minister of agriculture and agri-food): MadamChair, the program for young workers in agriculture is open. This is a program that is not only intended to provide summer jobs, but also to interest young people in making a career in agriculture. doug shipley (barriespringwateroro-medonte, cpc): Thank you, Chair. Over the course of the pandemic, has the government been using all avenues possible to source much-needed PPE in Canada? hon. navdeep bains: Madam Chair, we have been very clear that we have a made-in-Canada initiative that has engaged companies across the country. Over 700 companies have retooled and scaled up their operations for personal protective equipment to help front-line health care workers. doug shipley: Madam Chair, I need to ask very quickly which ministry and minister are responsible for the sourcing of PPE in Canada. I work with the Minister of Health and the minister for procurement , and we coordinate with the provinces and territories to make sure there are appropriate levels of PPE to help front-line health care workers and essential workers across the country. For over 37 years, it has provided front-line health care workers with an extensive line of PPE and other essential products required when dealing with respiratory illnesses. Southmedic currently employs over 700 people, and it has been recognized as one of Canada's best-managed companies by Deloitte on numerous occasions. Since the beginning of the pandemic, both I and the member for BarrieInnisfil have been attempting to obtain some assistance for Southmedic from the federal government. I received a letter back from the minister dated May 27 indicating that this issue of Southmedic falls under the mandate of the Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada. When will the federal government reach out and help this great Canadian company and therefore ensure that all front-line workers will have the proper PPE they require? hon. navdeep bains: Madam Chair, I'd like to thank my honourable colleague for his question. Since then, we've seen over 6,000 companies step up to offer solutions and ideas, and over 700 companies have retooled their efforts. I acknowledge that some companies are still engaging with the government, and we'll continue to explore all possible options to make sure we continue to procure the necessary levels of personal protective equipment to protect Canadians and to protect front-line health care workers. Moving on to a different issue, while walking to my office this morning, I stopped at my local small family-run coffee shop and was discussing the current economic situation with the two owners of the establishment. The only thing keeping them hopeful is that soon the public service will start returning to work, and therefore their business will begin to return. Could the government please give us some indication as to what the plans are for returning the civil service back to work safely, and when? hon. This is a very important topic, but I'd like to take the opportunity first to thank our public servants, who have worked very hard in the last few weeks, both personally and professionally. In fact, today is a wonderful day to say that, because today is the start of National Public Service Week. They've been at work for the last few monthsin different circumstances, but they have been working very hard to deliver the services and the support Canadians need and deserve. carol hughes): Next we'll go to the honourable member for SelkirkInterlakeEastman, Mr. james bezan (selkirkinterlakeeastman, cpc): Thank you, Madam Chair. First of all, I want to thank the great men and women of the Canadian Armed Forces for the fantastic job they're doing in Operation LASER, serving on the front lines battling COVID-19. Can the Minister of National Defence give the House an update on exactly where we are at with the number of Canadian Armed Forces members who have been infected with COVID-19? hon. sajjan (minister of national defence): Madam Chair, I want to echo the member opposite's comments in thanking our Canadian Armed Forces members. Currently, we have 13 active cases in the Canadian Armed Forces, but in the long-term care facilities we currently have 50 cases. james bezan: Through you, Chair, Minister Sajjan, does that number of active cases include the active cases that are in long-term care facilities right now in Operation LASER? hon. sajjan: Madam Chair, as I stated, the 50 cases are strictly from the long-term care facilities. Sajjan say how many of those cases in long-term care facilities are active and how many are recovered? hon. What I can say to break it down further is that in Quebec we currently have 36 and in Ontario we have 14. The President of the Treasury Board has said, The Canadian Armed Forces will be present as long as their presence is needed in Quebec. This contradicts what Prime Minister Trudeau is saying, which is that we have a hard deadline of June 26 for the withdrawal of our troops for Operation LASER. We've been in very extensive discussions with the Province of Quebec, with my counterpart Minister Guilbault, and we are working very diligently to ensure we have a sustained, appropriate response to the request from Quebec for assistance. That response will result in a transition from the currently deployed Canadian Armed Forces to the deployment of paid volunteers, trained personnel who will take on the important role of providing services to those Canadians who need our help in Quebec. The Department of National Defence auditors have called out the Liberal government for mismanagement over the $553-billion investment in our Canadian military through the defence policy. This is a $553-billion investment in our armed forces, and only three people are managing it. Could the minister tell us how that is even possible? Is this the reason that over 100 projects are currently behind schedule? hon. sajjan: Madam Chair, first of all, I want to highlight the unprecedented investment that we're making in defence. When it comes to the management of this, it's conducted by me and the minister of procurement . Are we going to see more cuts because you have been unable to actually roll out these dollars? hon. carol hughes): Before I go to the next speaker, I want to remind members that they are to address their questions and comments directly through the chair. david yurdiga (fort mcmurraycold lake, cpc): Madam Chair, the Canada summer jobs program has many challenges. I've seen many indigenous communities in my riding rejected for funding even though they had received funding in previous years. Here are a few examples of communities that were rejected: Beaver Lake Cree Nation, Buffalo Lake Mtis Settlement and the Mtis Nation of Alberta, Region 1. Could the Prime Minister explain why so many indigenous communities have been denied funding from the Canada summer jobs program? hon. ahmed hussen: Madam Chair, we recognize the important role that the Canada summer jobs program plays in supporting employers and young workers in our community across the country every year. We're working very hard to help employers adapt to the realities of the COVID-19 pandemic and are supporting young Canadians as they begin to look for summer employment. We are introducing increased flexibilities into the Canada summer jobs program to hire youth, while also providing more supports to employers that deliver essential services to Canadians. Why are so many indigenous communities left out of the Canada summer jobs program? This is very important to my community and to communities throughout the province. ahmed hussen: Madam Chair, I want to assure the honourable member that we, of course, value the important role that the Canada summer jobs program plays in all communities, including indigenous communities in Canada. I will certainly have an off-line conversation with the honourable member, if he so wishes, about a particular issue, but I can assure him that in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have had to assist employers to introduce flexibilities the acting chair (mrs. david yurdiga: Madam Chair, in my riding, the City of Cold Lake has been in dispute with the federal government for many years over payment in lieu of taxes. Could the Minister of Public Services and Procurement give me a rough estimate of when I will receive a response from the minister's office to my first letter, from 2017, and my letters from 2018, 2019 and 2020? hon. david lametti: Madam Chair, I can assure the honourable member that I will go to the minister, and we will come back with an answer to his question. david yurdiga: How much longer does the minister intend to perpetuate the ongoing PILT dispute, which is in excess of $11 million, with the City of Cold Lake? hon. david lametti: Madam Chair, once again, I can assure the honourable member that I will speak with the minister and get an answer to his question. david yurdiga: Well, do you know what? I've been writing letters to the department for many years. When you say you're going to get back to me, I really have a hard time believing that. Will the minister agree to follow the prior recommendations of the dispute advisory panel that were accepted by the minister? hon. david lametti: Madam Chair, I can assure the honourable member that I will check with the minister and that she will return to the member in due course. david yurdiga: Madam Chair, the drug Trikafta has been proven to increase the quality of life for 90% of cystic fibrosis patients. Two weeks ago, my office sent a letter to the Minister of Health about the boy in my riding named Cael, who through the special access program is able to get Trikafta in Canada. I requested that the minister use her powers to fast-track Trikafta for commercial use, but I have yet to receive a response back. patty hajdu: Madam Chair, I'm glad to hear that Cael was able to access Trikafta through the special access program. In fact, that program is very helpful for people who are seeking access to medication that's not currently marketed in Canada. As the member opposite knows, Vertex has not applied to market Trikafta in Canada, but we look forward to their application, and I encourage him to write a letter to the manufacturer to also encourage them. I was very troubled to hear that a CBC radio host in the Yukon felt compelled to resign because, as an indigenous person, she could not speak her truth. While we know the Broadcasting Act states that the Canadian broadcasting system should reflect the linguistic duality and multicultural and multiracial nature of Canadian society and the special place of indigenous peoples, it would seem there are some challenges. Therefore, does the Minister of Heritage share the concern of some journalists that problems of systemic racism in Canada are still existing within the institution of the CBC, and will the government now acknowledge the need to recognize the jurisdiction of indigenous governments? hon. steven guilbeault (minister of canadian heritage): Thank you, Madame Chair; and I thank the member for this important question. As stated by the Prime Minister on numerous occasions, our government recognizes that systemic racism exists in Canada, and we have made a commitment to do everything we can to combat it in whichever organization of the Canadian government. I understand these issues to be ones that challenge societal norms, that are not politically expedient to address because they can lose you votes, even though addressing them is morally right and a smart thing to do. In the justice system, examples include mandatory minimum penalties, defunding police, and even investing in restorative justice. Surely now these issues are politically less of a consideration than the tragic reality of even more slain indigenous Canadians at the hands of police, or thousands of indigenous people still incarcerated or living in poverty. Will this government please finally commit to the necessary work originally promised in 2015 and repeal in the justice system the vast majority of mandatory minimum penalties, assuring the necessary discretion for judges, and meaningfully invest in restorative justice measures? hon. david lametti: Madame Chair, I thank the honourable member for her question, as well as for her work as Minister of Justice, and indeed my predecessor. This is a time when we recognize systemic over-incarceration of indigenous peoples, of black peoples, in our criminal justice system. This is a time when we need to look at all potential options to reduce what is a shameful overrepresentation in our criminal justice system. Too often racialized peoples and indigenous peoples have experienced prejudice and systemic discrimination in our justice system, and that has to change. Many of the deaths are related to COVID-19 measures that have prevented people from accessing supervised consumption sites, so they are overdosing alone. While the provinces welcomed the federal backing of safe supply exemption back in March, it is to expire in September of 2020. Will the government provide the necessary supports to the province and help support safe supply initiatives in the provinces? hon. patty hajdu: It's been a pleasure to work with the Province of British Columbia on innovative ways to work on the tragic situation of opioid overdose. I remain committed to working with the province and in fact any province that wants to work towards solutions that treat people who use substances with the dignity they deserve. We're working closely with our partners to make sure that we can prevent more lives from being lost. carol hughes): We will go to the honourable member for South OkanaganWest Kootenay, Mr. richard cannings (south okanaganwest kootenay, ndp): Thank you, Madam Chair. They've been serving great food for 40 years, but now they're struggling, because they don't qualify for the emergency wage subsidy. The new owner can't use a year-to-year comparison to apply for the wage subsidy because he didn't own the restaurant last spring. He is forced to use receipts from January and February, the darkest doldrums of the restaurant year, to compare with the results from May, traditionally one of their best months. When will the government fix this inequity and let Theo's compete and survive? hon. mona fortier: Madam Chair, the Canada emergency wage subsidy is supporting over 2.5 million workers across the country. To help even more businesses support their workers and rehire people as they reopen, our government is extending the CEWS, and we will continue to extend the CEWS for an additional 12 weeks to August 29 to ensure that Canadian workers continue to have the support they need during these very difficult times. By extending eligibility, our government is ensuring that more Canadian workers in more sectors have the support they need. richard cannings: The owner just wants to be able to apply for the wage subsidy, and right now he cannot, and he will not be able to. Canada's forest sector has been declared essential during this pandemic, but it's been hit hard after a very difficult 2019. Despite soft markets and thousands out of work, government support programs have left many Canadian forest product companies behind. In my riding, the pulp mill in Castlegar is closing for the month of July because local sawmills aren't producing enough wood chips. What is the government going to do to finally support Canadian forestry workers and communities? the acting chair (mrs. carol hughes): The time is almost up, but I will allow for the answer from the honourable minister. In fact, in Quebec, partnering with Les Bois Francs DV Inc., we have widened market access to our products and updated technology systems. In Vancouver we're working with FPInnovations to create the indigenous forest sector technical support program. carol hughes): Now we go to the honourable member for SkeenaBulkley Valley, Mr. taylor bachrach (skeenabulkley valley, ndp): Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm going to pick up where my colleague left off, with B.C.'s forest industry. are multiple rounds of mill shutdowns and start-ups, and in some cases this has made it difficult for forestry workers to qualify for EI. My question to the minister is this: Will the minister work to make the EI program more flexible for forestry workers, similar to what this government has done for oil and gas workers? hon. That has been key in the inactive and orphan well program, which we are working on with the provincial governments of Saskatchewan, British Columbia and Alberta. The focus on workers has assured that success, and we will continue to focus on workers in all the industries, particularly our natural resource industry, as they go through this extraordinarily difficult time. taylor bachrach: Madam Chair, reforestation is a very important part of the forest industry in the riding I represent, and people were keenly interested to hear this government's plan to plant two billion trees in the next 10 years. I'm wondering if the minister could tell us how many trees are going to be planted under this program by the end of this season. We are working with forestry associations, the industry and with individual companies to ensure this tree-planting season will be one of the largest the country has ever seen. rhal fortin (rivire-du-nord, bq): MadamChair, last week, the government introduced BillC-17 and the Minister of Justice sent us briefing notes in which he said that it was important to suspend a number of time limits and to extend others, and that the failure to do so could have important repercussions on Canadians, their families, their situations, their finances and their ability to exercise their rights. We have addressed the mandatory time limits in federal legislation as well as certain time limits that courts may not be able to handle. The minister's briefing notes say that, among other things, when it comes to divorcewhich means children are involved people are waiting on custody rights, child support and visitation rights. The minister pointed out that the national security review would require consultations if no decision is made in the prescribed time frame. rhal fortin: MadamChair, what a coincidence, because I beseech my colleague opposite to debate it with us. Last week, the leader of the Bloc Qubcois asked the Liberal government to debate BillC-17 today. Richard Wagner, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, who is hardly a dimwit or greenhorn, told us that the justice system needs to be modernized. As recently as this past Saturday in LaPresse, Justice Wagner said that it is essential that the Criminal Code be amended to address the backlog of court proceedings. When will the Liberal government opposite pull up its socks, do its job, govern the federation, sit down with the opposition and discuss the vital matters in BillC-17? hon. pablo rodriguez: MadamChair, if I were my colleague, I would be a little embarrassed, because the bill was sent to the Bloc Qubcois several days in advance. When we asked for the support of the Bloc Qubcois and the other parties to debate itwe were not even asking them to vote in favour of the billthey refused. For example, we asked the Liberals to put the money back into the wage subsidy fund and to commit to dip into it no longer. pablo rodriguez: Can my colleague explain to me what the emergency wage subsidy has to do with a bill about justice? This is an absolutely fundamental piece of legislation. rhal fortin: MadamChair, I would like nothing better than to explain it to him, but I must remind him that he is the leader of the party in power, the party that is supposed to govern the country. I am thinking of families, child support, child custody, labour law disputes in Federal Court, marine transportation, interprovincial transportation, aviation, banks, and those with grievances waiting for a Federal Court ruling. The whole system, the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal, everything is on hold because nobody in the government wants to do their job. However, when we asked the Bloc Qubcois if they wanted to debate the bill, they said no, instead of doing what they usually do and saying yes. When the CERB runs out, many workers in my riding of Essex will not have sufficient hours to collect their EI benefits. Because of the shutdown, a mom-to-be who had just returned to work in January, and several hundred of her fellow employees, may not have the 600 hours required for regular or EI parental benefits. ahmed hussen: Madam Chair, the Canada emergency response benefit has been providing much-needed help to Canadian workers across the country who have stopped working due to COVID-19. We know that there is still a lot of uncertainty for many Canadian workers, and we know that many will be exhausting their benefits in the weeks to come. We will have more to share soon, as early as this week, on our continuing efforts to support Canadian workers and make sure that help is available during this the acting chair (mrs. We will continue to make sure that we make the necessary investments in the EI delivery system and modernize it to continue to meet the acting chair (mrs. mary ng: Madam Chair, today we are seeing small businesses that have been helped, whether it is getting access to the small business loan, which some are also using in the restart as they are safely restarting, or getting help with their payroll, helping them keep their employees the acting chair (mrs. How will the government incentivize workers to return to their jobs when recalled? the acting chair (mrs. mary ng: The Canada emergency wage subsidy is an excellent program to help those employees stay employed and for those employers who are looking at rehiring them right now during this restart process. chris lewis: Madam Chair, many of my constituents are in a committed cross-border relationship and have not been able to see their partners in quite some time. bill blair: Madam Chair, as we said from the outset, we've implemented restrictions at the U.S. border on non-essential travel with a single purpose in mind: to protect the health and safety of Canadians. As the member is aware, just last week we introduced new measures that allow people in family relationships to stay together as long as they commit to the necessary 14-day period of quarantine. chris lewis: Madam Chair, with regard to child care, as our economy continues to open, parents are facing a stark choice: Who will care for their children? What's the plan to provide access to child care so parents can confidently return to work? hon. ahmed hussen: Madam Chair, we are of course committed to continuing to make the record investments that we've been making in child care. We're committed to creating an additional 250,000 before-school and after-school child care spaces. It sounds as though this government has a desire to force parents to choose between their job and care for their child<doc-sep>anthony rota (nipissingtimiskaming, lib.)): I call this meeting to order.  Welcome to the 23rd meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic.  A reminder to all members that in order to avoid issues with sound, members participating in person should not also be connected to the video conference. For those of you who are joining via video conference, I will remind you that when speaking you should be on the same channel as the language you are speaking, and please use your headsets. I remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of this special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. For members participating in person, I ask that they please come and drop their signed certificates off at the table once the petition is presented. I would ask members to be very brief and concise, and to summarize the exact content of the petition. The residents of SaanichGulf Islands are calling on the government to simplify the process for protection of marine protected areas. The marine protected area first proposed in the 1970s for the southern Strait of Georgia, now called the Salish Sea, has been awaiting designation for so long that it was originally endorsed by Jacques Cousteau. The second petition is from petitioners who are very concerned about our obligations under the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and our commitments under the Truth and Reconciliation Commission calls to action. They specifically reference the RCMP violation of UNDRIP in its actions on Wet'suwet'en territory and ask the government to commit to actually living the principles embodied in UNDRIP. I am presenting a petition on behalf of the one in a million Canadians who suffer severe and adverse effects from vaccinations. GuillainBarre syndrome is very debilitating, and this petition seeks the setting up of a no-fault accident or compensation system to help offset the loss of work, the loss of wages and the loss of quality of life that many of these people suffer. denis trudel (longueuilsaint-hubert, bq): Mr.Chair, culture is the soul of a people. Over the past 20years or so, culture, especially music, has never been as accessible as it is now. The advent of digital technology has completely overturned the system for distributing the wealth generated by creators for the benefit of various Web stakeholders, many of whom are billionaires. The third is for Internet and cell phone providers who sell their services as direct access to culture to share their profits with artists. Six thousand people have already signed the first version of this petition, launched last month by musician JordanOfficer and supported by singer BarbaraSecours. As an artist, I am proud to present this petition today because the issues it raises are fundamental to the survival of Quebec culture. garnett genuis (sherwood parkfort saskatchewan, cpc): Thank you very much, Mr. I will be as brief as you suggested, although I will observe that if some members are going on longer during petitions than they normally do, it might be because the government has taken away so many of the tools that opposition members normally have for raising important issues in the House. The petitioners are concerned that instead of focusing on improving medically assisted life, something that we know is a major issue in light of recent revelations, the government has put so much time and legislative energy into efforts to continually further expand euthanasia in Canada and remove vital safeguards. The reality of the way that bill applies is that people from certain backgrounds who wish to practise their faith are not able to fully participate in Canadian society if they are employed in the public service. This petition asks the government to provide a response on that issue, something it hasn't done in response to past petitions on this. The petitioners want to see the government take a strong response in dealing with illegal guns and gun smuggling. At the same time, the petitioners are concerned that the government has the wrong focusthat is, harassing law-abiding firearms ownerswithout putting in place substantial measures to deal with illegal guns. The petitioners want to see the reversal of the order in council from May 1 and strong measures to deal with illegal firearms. The fourth and final petition deals with Bill S-204, a bill that would make it a criminal offence for a Canadian to go abroad and receive an organ from a person who has not consented to giving that organ. It would also create a mechanism by which someone could be deemed inadmissible to Canada if they were involved in organ harvesting and trafficking. The petitioners are supportive of Bill S-204 and of similar bills in previous parliaments and would like to see us pass that bill as soon as possible. These residents have signed a petition asking the Government of Canada, and in fact all members of Parliament, to put a high priority on assisting our poorest seniors. The increases to the GIS by $200, and $300 to the OAS, have been well received. They just want to highlight how important it is to support our seniors, in particular the poorest of our seniors. the chair: For members present in the Chamber, a reminder that they are asked to bring their petitions to the table. June 21 is National Indigenous Peoples Day, a day of acknowledgement and a day of celebration of the beautiful diversity of indigenous peoples across Turtle Island. I wish to recognize the leadership of Chief Shelley Sabattis of the Welamukotuk First Nation in Oromocto, New Brunswick. Each year she and her council, volunteers and staff go above and beyond to show appreciation for their members and to demonstrate pride and culture while promoting well-being. We gather in an event where all are welcome to take part, from traditional hand drum-making with elders to moose meat and tacos. This year we will celebrate a bit differently, but we will still stay connected, virtually and in spirit, to the vast network of indigenous peoples and allies. Chair, COVID-19 is an unprecedented challenge for all communities across Canada, but as we do our part to flatten the curve, I often think about those who suit up every morning to serve on the front lines of our health care system. Even before the crisis, they would often share the hardships they faced on a day-to-day basis. Share this message and say thanks to our front-line workers, participate in the 7 p.m. doug shipley (barriespringwateroro-medonte, cpc): Thank you, Mr. Slowly, we are getting back to some resemblance of normalcy, although unfortunately not soon enough for some of our great summer festivals. It will not be normal in BarrieSpringwaterOro-Medonte this summer without the iconic Boots and Hearts weekend music festival, Kempenfest, Oro World's Fair, the Elmvale Fall Fair, or the Midhurst Autumnfest. Because of the lack of Canada Day celebrations, I've created Happy Canada Day lawn signs that are available through my constituency office, free to all residents of BarrieSpringwaterOro-Medonte. I'm also hosting a drive-through party on Canada Day at the Royal Canadian Legion on St. Among the countless ordinary Canadians who have stepped up to do extraordinary work during COVID-19, I wish to draw attention to our teachers. My father was a teacher, and my daughter-in-law, Kelly Webb, is one now. I'm certain that my colleagues can all easily remember a teacher in their past who played an important role in helping them achieve their potential. This is not the school year anyone imagined, and what the next one will look like is unclear, but our teachers in London West and across Canada have shown that no matter what, they will be there to help our next generation shine. the chair: Before proceeding to the next presenter, I just want to remind the honourable members in the chamber that I realize that the six-foot limit makes it harder to whisper to each other, but we're hearing a bit of rumble, so I just want you to try to whisper at your best. stphane bergeron (montarville, bq): Mr.Chair, on July1st, we will be celebrating one of the most important events for the riding of Montarville: the 175thanniversary of the city of Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville. The theme Proud of our traditions will be the focus of this celebration for the people of Montarville. This is a good illustration of the rich history of this municipality nestled in the western foothills of Mont-Saint-Bruno. The seigneury of Montarville was granted in1710 to the illustrious former governor of Trois-Rivires, PierreBoucher. The parish of Saint-Bruno, which took root there and in which a village grew, became a municipal corporation in1845. To this day, it is one of the most prosperous localities, with a strong sense of belonging, a very dynamic community life and jealously preserved natural environments. A whole program had been drawn up for the celebration, but the current health crisis has taken over some of the planned activities, which has in no way diminished the pride and festive spirit of the people of Montarville. Chair, thank you for allowing me to take a moment to highlight an initiative that I started early on during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Heroes of EtobicokeLakeshore is an opportunity for citizens in my riding to recognize the contributions of those in their community who make life a bit easier. I'm pleased with the number of nominations I received that honour everyone from front-line workers to businesses that are innovating in these difficult times to volunteers who are finding new ways to reach out. I think of Daniel Lauzon who set up Food for Now, a mobile service that helps take care of the homeless. I think of Toni Varone, who helped his business clients by forgiving their rents, or young Lucas, who wanted to thank his teachers. I've been moved and inspired by the countless stories of generosity, strength, resiliency, kindness, incredible character and creativity. Chair, it gives me great pleasure to thank a local Richmond-based charity, the Social Diversity for Children Foundation, SDC, for its hard work both in raising funds for the purchase of personal protective equipment and in distributing this PPE to long-term care facilities and individual seniors' homes in the lower mainland of B.C. The COVID-19 relief fund is supported by a dozen other non-profits, businesses and community groups. It is amazing to have witnessed how the younger generation have gotten involved in caring for the elderly at this very challenging time. Chair, June is ALS Awareness Month, and 79 years after Lou Gehrig died from ALS little has changed. On June 21, Canadians will gather virtually to raise funds for ALS Canada in the Walk to End ALS. In Halton, normally we meet each year at Bronte Creek Provincial Park on the May long weekend to raise funds for ALS Canada. This year I will virtually join Tim's Titans, a team formed to honour Tim Robertson, my friend who died in 2016 after living with ALS for 13 years. I have a T-shirt, with a picture of Lou Gehrig, that says, Great Player...Lousy Disease and Tim's Titans...Great Team! ALS...Still a Lousy Disease. Join me on June 21 for the virtual Walk to End ALS to raise funds to support patients and their families and for ALS research. The peaceful protests that we're seeing across the country and around the world were not triggered by an isolated incident. They are fuelled by decades of ineffective action against something that is so insidious and deeply entrenched in our history, systems and institutions. It exists when a shocking report exposes the Peel District School Board's failure to work fairly with the black community. It exists when D'Andre Campbell, who was fighting mental illness, loses his life at the hands of the police. We need to dismantle the systems that allow this privilege and oppression to take form, and address the unconscious bias plaguing our institutions. Chair, a few months ago I rose in the House on the eve of our closure due to COVID-19. I told Canadians we must not give in to fear, that we would carry on and get through this crisis stronger than ever. Businesses are reopening, jobs are returning and our lives are starting to feel a bit normal again. Canadians pulled together, and because of that we did not see the devastating death toll that many had predicted. Life may be returning to normal, but unfortunately, here in this chamber of democracy, the people's voices continue to be shut down. In the words of my grandfather, it's time for the Liberals to get with the program and bring back the House. Chair, from in-person learning to virtual classrooms, COVID-19 has drastically changed the lives of students across the country, especially those in post-secondary education who are worried about covering costs like tuition or rent this coming fall. Our government recognized that students should not have to worry or put their futures on pause during this difficult time. If you're a high school student headed to a post-secondary school, or a current post-secondary student or a recent graduate, you can receive the Canada emergency student benefit every four weeks and have the financial support that you need to save for school. We also doubled Canada student grants and loans, enhanced the student loan program, increased supports for indigenous post-secondary education and introduced the Canada student service grant for those who wish to pursue it. I wish them all the very best, and I wish all of you, my colleagues and those across Canada, a very happy National Indigenous Peoples Day, which is coming up on June 21. the chair: I want to remind the honourable members to keep to their 60 seconds so that we don't go over the time. Chair, I rise today to once again implore the government to do something about the horrible lack of access to and crazy cost of rural Internet service. Right now, too many areas of my riding have no access to rural Internet service at all, and those who can get service are paying through the nose. I've even heard constituents say that during this pandemic, they are having to choose between feeding their kids and educating them. Is that too much to ask of the government? the chair: We'll now go to Mr. Chair, these last few months have been incredibly challenging for the residents of CowichanMalahatLangford, who have been forced to deal with the economic and social consequences of COVID-19. The pandemic has laid bare the inadequacies of our social safety net, the weakness in our supply chains and the dependence of our society on essential workers, who often work long hours for low wages, putting themselves and their families at risk. We've also been forced to confront the systemic inequality, poverty and racism that continue to hold so many people back from achieving their full potential. I will not dishonour the sacrifice that so many have made during this time by allowing us to go back to the status quo that got us here in the first place. I will not apologize for demanding that the most vulnerable in our society get the supports and opportunities they need to live with dignity, and I will not relent from pushing my political colleagues to summon the courage necessary to implement policies that lead to environmental, economic and social justice. steven blaney (bellechasseles etcheminslvis, cpc): Mr.Chair, here is a beautiful story, the story of a woman from Bellechasse, a courageous young mother from Saint-Malachie, Marie-ChristineGoupil. With three children, including the eldest daughter with a disability, and realizing that her daughter with a disability had special clothing needs, she decided to go into business to meet the needs of other parents who, like her, were facing their child's clothing challenges. Marie-ChristineGoupil has discovered a passion for entrepreneurship and has moved and inspired many people with her passionate and courageous attitude. yves-franois blanchet (beloeilchambly, bq): Thank you, Mr.Chair. I lend my voice to the Chief of the Assembly of First Nations of Quebec-Labrador, GhislainPicard, whose message is as follows:     There have been no fewer than 14reports and conclusions of commissions of inquiry since1967 highlighting major problems in relations between law enforcement agencies and indigenous people. Are you going to respond, as you too often do, by moving on to the next one, or are you going to do what we expect you to do, which is to recognize that the justice system discriminates against indigenous people and that we have no less right to security than the rest of the population? In three months, police interventions have claimed more victims among our members than the pandemic. rachael harder (lethbridge, cpc): Over the last few months, Canada's democracy has been disregarded and an autocracy has been resurrected in its place. In 2014, he professed that Canadians want their Members of Parliament to be effective voices for their communities in Ottawa, and not merely mouthpieces for an all-too-powerful Prime Minister. A government that does not allow for effective opposition is not functioning in the best interest of Canadians; it is operating in the best interest of itself and, even more so, the interest of the Prime Minister. Canadians deserve to flourish in a democracy, not merely survive under the autocracy that this Prime Minister has created. Chair, I would like to recognize the work of Agincourt Community Services Association and its tireless executive director, Lee Soda, who have been serving our community during the COVID-19 pandemic. Under more pressure than ever, their staff and volunteers continue to serve a community whose need was great even before the crisis. They have opened outdoor washrooms and hand-washing stations for vulnerable communities and are delivering groceries and other essentials to vulnerable seniors. ACSA is a bridge between those who can help and those who need help, and they are just one example of how our community has come together to meet this challenge. There are restaurants and businesses donating meals to front-line workers, residents answering the call to stock the food bank shelves and neighbours looking in on the vulnerable and isolated. Please note that we will suspend the proceedings twice in order to allow employees who provide support for the sitting to replace each other safely. Chair, for months Conservatives have been pointing out flaws in Liberal government programs that are preventing Canadians from getting the help they need. The Prime Minister has refused to make these very technical changes to get more help to Canadians who need it. For example, on the wage subsidy, more than two-thirds of the money allocated for that program has lapsed because businesses don't qualify. Will the Prime Minister change the program to allow companies who have made acquisitions to access the wage subsidy to keep more people working? right hon. Chair, from the very beginning we knew that as we rolled out measures, we would need to improve them and tweak them, and that's exactly what we've been doing over the past three months. But we continued to improve them, to make additions and amendments so that more people could get the help they needed, including with the proposed legislation last week that expanded the reach of the wage subsidy to more businesses. Chair, it was the Liberals who said no to the motion to allow this Parliament to sit to debate that motion, and even in that legislation they refused to allow businesses who have made acquisitions to access the program. Now, when we look at the rent relief program, it is so difficult to apply for it that many landlords are refusing to bother, leaving even more small businesses to fall through the cracks. In fact, of the $3 billion allocated to the rent relief program, only $39 million has been paid out. It's now June and he has refused to fix these programs and has successfully talked out the calendar on the days that the House of Commons could meet to discuss these programs. We recognize, in conversations with the premiers, how important it is to make sure that we're working together, the provinces and the federal government, on issues like rent subsidies where commercial rent is indeed a provincial jurisdiction. Many provinces have moved forward with the eviction bans that are necessary to go along with this, and we'll continue to work with provinces to make sure that we're getting Canadians the help they need. He has run down the clock on parliamentary sittings and he still refuses to make these changes to get more help to Canadians. Some of these sites are very near sensitive government institutions, like government departments, the National Research Council, RCMP headquarters and the Bank of Canada. How long has the Prime Minister known that Huawei technology has been installed in the Ottawa area? right hon. Chair, first off, on the issue of Parliament, it has been meeting four times a week over the past many weeks, and members of the opposition have been able to continue to ask questions on COVID-19 and a broad range of subjects. Moreover, every two weeks the finance department puts forward at the finance committee the full transparent measures that we've taken, so that parliamentarians can study them. justin trudeau: in regard to Huawei technology there are strict rules for companies to follow and we assume they will all follow those. I want to remind the honourable members who are joining us virtually that heckling really does disrupt the whole session. Your face does come up and we do see who it is, so I just want to make sure that you're aware of that. Chair, throughout this unprecedented pandemic, we have been open and transparent about all of the measures we've put forward. Chair, the Prime Minister has pursued a policy of appeasement in pursuit of a personal vanity product at the UN. He's abandoned Israel and committed funding to UNRWA, an organization whose schools have been used as storage facilities for Hamas rockets against Israeli civilians, and whose facilities have served as breeding grounds for racism and anti-Semitism. He has apologized for the Iranian regime when it shot down a plane full of Canadian citizens, and he refuses to list the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist entity. What's the point of having a seat at the table if you have to sell out Canadian principles to get there? the chair: The Right Honourable Prime Minister. That's why, when we took office five years ago, we demonstrated the kind of leadership on values that Canadians expected. elizabeth may: This being a committee, we can have a point of order during what would have been question period. I am not sitting that far away from the Prime Minister, and I'm sorry, but Andrew Scheer used to be the Speaker of the House and should show better decorum. Chair, on the same point of order, it is disgusting for the leader of the Green Party to use decorum as an excuse to interrupt the Leader of the Opposition in the middle of critical lines of questioning. The leader of the Green Party knows the rules of the House and shouldn't be abusing them to advance a partisan agenda. andrew scheer: I appreciate the honourable leader of the Green Party, Elizabeth May, for that reminder. I just want to say to the member, and to all members, that the reason that I cannot control myself is that the Prime Minister used the word embarrassment in answering a foreign affairs question, and it just made me think of the India trip. yves-franois blanchet: Mr.Chair, while the Greens and the Conservatives are saying that they'll be waiting outside after the meeting, I will ask a question. The Prime Minister has extended the Canada emergency response benefit, and that's good news, but it's not enough. For us, it was also urgent to adjust the CERB to the needs of the tourism, arts and agriculture sectors. So what happened to the urgency of reforming the CERB? Why is the government refusing to talk to the opposition parties? right hon. We have unequivocally proposed to extend the debate to reach an agreement, which brings me to my second question. Last week, the issue of assistance to people with disabilities was also a pressing concern, and it's even more so a week later. The Bloc proposed to extend the discussions and split the government's bill in two to help people with disabilities. Why is the government refusing this assistance to people with disabilities, when it could have been debated with the opposition in a civilized and proper way in a Parliament in which it has a minority? right hon. justin trudeau: That was exactly what we wanted, but unanimous consent of the Chamber was required to debate this matter, and the Conservative Party of Canada voted against it. yves-franois blanchet: If the idea is so good and wonderful, why not start over and open the dialogue now? What's stopping the Prime Minister from being a rallying point and inviting us to take to each other and resolve the problem, rather than saying that he is going to pack up his toys and go home? The people with disabilities are the ones who will pay the price. Where was the Prime Minister on October21,2019? He received a minority mandate from Quebeckers and Canadians. Why is he behaving like something between a prime minister with a majority and a monarch by divine right? right hon. justin trudeau: I've heard the Conservative Party and the Bloc Qubcois throw their accusations around. They don't point out that the House of Commons did indeed give its consent to extend the mandate of the Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic until the end of June. Unfortunately, they too are part of a minority Parliament and must respect the voice of the majority of parliamentarians, just as we do. yves-franois blanchet: I might have been tempted, but that's unlikely to happen because the Prime Minister isn't me, he's him. In addition, the government wants to buy the right to interfere in provincial and Quebec jurisdictions for $14billion. However, Quebec and a number of provinces are refusing to allow it to interfere in their jurisdictions and are asking that this money be paid to them unconditionally. Is the Prime Minister trying to take advantage of the crisis or is he trying to create a constitutional crisis? right hon. justin trudeau: Mr.Chair, the safety of Canadians is the responsibility of all levels of government. That's why we have proposed a $14billion agreement to ensure that all Canadians across the country experience a safe re-opening of the economy. This is a proposal that we are working on with the provinces because we know that there are needs across the country, including early childhood centres, screening and support for municipalities. Indigenous leaders have expressed a lack of confidence in the RCMP commissioner's ability to tackle full-scale systemic racism, but the Prime Minister has expressed his confidence in the commissioner. Chair, over the past two years, Commissioner Lucki has made significant strides forward on an issue where there is still much more to do. We know that systemic racism exists in all of our institutions across this country the chair: We'll now go back to Mr. jagmeet singh: This is the same RCMP commissioner who just recently said that they couldn't explain what systemic racism was. Why does the Prime Minister believe that the RCMP commissioner can tackle systemic racism in the RCMP? right hon. Chair, recent events have made it abundantly clear that to tackle the systemic racism at the level of the RCMP, we need a full-scale overhaul of the RCMP. Is the Prime Minister committed to a full-scale overhaul of the RCMP to root out systemic racism? right hon. Chair, I am committed to addressing systemic racism in this country and taking significant, bold actions to reduce the amount of discrimination that indigenous peoples, that racialized Canadians face on a daily basis. What it's saying is that we need to be better at where we spend our money, investing in communities and not policing. Will the Prime Minister commit to a review of the RCMP budget to allocate resources to community services and not to policing? right hon. Chair, over the past years we have been investing more directly and more money in community organizations, in the black community, and working with indigenous partners on the path to reconciliation. We have been investing in the kinds of community-based programs and solutions that are part of the solution. We know there is much more to do, and we will continue to look at all of our expenditures to make sure we're doing the right things. Chair, over the past few years, while the Prime Minister has been in office, the RCMP budget has increased by 31%. In recent events we've seen people who needed a health care response to a health care crisis been killed by the RCMP. Does the Prime Minister believe that we need to be investing in a health care response instead of a police response for people who are faced with a crisis? right hon. We need to make sure that our systems across the board, from our police systems to our judicial systems, to our health care systems, to our community systems, are actually addressing the systemic discrimination issues that are embedded within them That is exactly what we are going to continue to do in the coming years. Chair, with regard to the CERB extension, can the Prime Minister guarantee that everyone who is receiving CERB payments now will continue to do so without any gaps throughout the summer? right hon. Chair, I am happy to highlight that many Canadians who were on the CERB are now returning to work. We know that as the economy gets back to work, people will want to the chair: We will go back to Mr. jagmeet singh: Can the Prime Minister assure people who need it that they will continue to receive the CERB over the summer, yes or no? right hon. justin trudeau: We are very pleased to point out that we are going to extend the Canada emergency response benefit for at least another eight weeks, because a lot of people are going to need it. the chair: We're going to pause and suspend proceedings just for a few moments to allow our support staff to substitute for one another in a healthy and safe way. Chair, it was really a surprise in the middle of a pandemic to see the Prime Minister at his first campaign stop last week in Ottawa. He has a daily report show and he wants to sideline Parliament, dominate the news cycle and keep everyone in the dark about the state of the economy. According to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, there is no reason that he cannot provide the fiscal update during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the PBO has published a number of reports himself. Why won't the Prime Minister provide a fiscal update so we can all understand the state of our economy, or is that just not part of his campaign playbook? hon. mona fortier (minister of middle class prosperity and associate minister of finance): Thank you, Mr. We will continue to be open and transparent about the actions that we are taking to support families, businesses, workers, our health care system and our economy. cathy mcleod: Chair, Canada's economy was in trouble prior to the COVID, with some of the worst numbers since 2009. Government revenues in March dropped by 7.2%, and it's shameful and, quite frankly, it's outrageous that they refuse to provide Parliament and Canadians with an economic update. Households during this challenging time know how much money is coming in and they know how much money is going out. mona fortier: The Canadian economy is going through a period of extraordinary uncertainty due to COVID-19. We've continued to be open and transparent about the measures we've put in place for Canadians, workers and businesses. In fact, we have reported biweekly to Parliament on the total cost and status of our plan's measures. As soon as it's possible to provide clear economic projections, we will provide a comprehensive update to Canadians the chair: We go back to Ms. cathy mcleod: Other governments have managed to provide updates for their citizens and carry out their responsibilities, but of course this government has sidelined Parliament with simply a question-but-no-answer period. The forestry industry was in crisis even before the pandemic, with mills closing down and thousands of jobs lost. Eight weeks ago, Minister Freeland said, I have had many discussions with leaders in our forestry sector and the provinces about what we can do to support the industry today. Meanwhile, we've had support going to the arts and we've had support going to fisheries, just to name a few, but arguably for the industry that was having some of the most numerous challenges, it has been radio silence. Can the government at least commit to releasing an updated softwood lumber transition plan before we rise? hon. Chair, we remain committed, of course, to the forestry industry and seeing it through this pandemic and this very uncertain time. The expanding market opportunities program, for instance, has helped Canada's forestry sector diversify, create jobs and open new markets. We've had new construction projects that are active today, using Canadian wood in key markets like Korea, Japan, China and the United States. Tomorrow this House will vote on our government's investment of $20.97 million for this program. It's part of our budget 2019 commitment to invest $251 million over three years, and I hope the opposition will support us in that. cathy mcleod: It was stated in a major newspaper this morning that this government is like a sexy sports carvroom, vroom, vroombut with a history of breakdowns and major repairs. The sector is also an essential link in the medical equipment supply chain, and we thank them for all the work they're doing. We're aware of the immense pressures faced by this sector, especially at this time, and Deputy Prime Minister Freeland and others are taking that seriously and working through this issue. duties on Canadian softwood lumber are unfair and unwarranted, and we will pursue all means in order to the chair: Before continuing, I want to remind honourable members who are at home to make sure that the boom on their headsets is down. grard deltell (louis-saint-laurent, cpc): Mr.Chair, before I ask my question, I'd like to pay tribute to the Minister of Justice, particularly to his versatility. I like Mr.Lametti very much, but I'd like Mr.Morneau to answer my question. Yesterday, in a Senate parliamentary committee, the Minister of Finance half-opened the door to an economic update. Based on what he said, it seems that, as we speak, a committee of the Department of Finance is working on an economic update. mona fortier: Mr.Chair, as we know, the Canadian economy is going through a period of extraordinary uncertainty. As soon as it's possible to provide clear economic projections, we will provide a full update to Canadians. Right now, we can say that we have supported workers, businesses and Canadians with the emergency measures we have put in place. We will continue to do so, because we need to be sure that Canadians can get through this crisis. We don't know when the economic update will take place, yet all across Canada, provinces are doing economic updates. mona fortier: Mr.Chair, since the beginning of the crisis, we have implemented the economic action plan to respond to COVID-19, and we've provided immediate assistance to Canadians, businesses and workers. In addition, 8.4million Canadians the chair: We are returning to Mr.Deltell. grard deltell: Mr.Chair, next Friday, the Quebec minister of finance, EricGirard, will give an economic update. If EricGirard can give one for Quebec, why can't BillMorneau give one for Canada? hon. mona fortier: Mr.Chair, once again, we have been open and transparent from the outset. grard deltell: Mr.Chair, I cannot judge the quality of the work done by the provinces, but what I do know is that Quebec, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland have also made efforts to support their residents economically. We have reported biweekly to Parliament on the total cost and status of the measures in our economic response plan. Once again, as soon as clear economic projections can be provided, we will provide an update the chair: Mr.Deltell has the floor. So I ask the question: so far, over the past three months, how much has the pandemic cost Canadians? hon. mona fortier: As I said earlier, it is important to note that we have put forward measures, including the wage subsidy, which have helped more than 2.5million the chair: Mr.Deltell has the floor. grard deltell: Mr.Chair, I have been trying for four minutes to get anything remotely resembling an answer, and I'm getting absolutely nothing. Why are the government and the Minister of Finance, Bill Morneau, not able to table an economic update when some provinces are able to? hon. We have continued to support businesses and Canadians during this time the chair: Mr.Deltell, you have time for a very brief question. grard deltell: The only thing that distinguishes the provinces that table economic updates and the current government is political will. As soon as it is possible to provide clear economic projections, we will provide Canadians with a full update. The difference between our government and the previous government is that we will actually consult with Canadians, including black Canadians, including Asian Canadians, to respond to the challenges, including with an anti-racism secretariat and an anti-racism strategy. Chair, this program was made possible by working with the provinces, and we will continue to encourage landlords and tenants to work together to make sure they have relief for this very difficult time in which they're living. We're continuing to monitor the CECRA program and we will make it possible for businesses to have access to the program. What is it going to take for the government to admit that the program is a disaster and needs changes? hon. Chair, we know our government has been working closely with the provinces and territories to deliver the Canada emergency commercial rent assistance. Although the tenant-landlord relationship is ultimately the responsibility of the provinces and territories, our government has stepped up to provide support through the tools we have and through CMHC so that small businesses can get the rent relief they need. At committee, we were told only around 5,500 of them are receiving COVID-19 rent relief. We will continue to monitor this program closely and ensure that Canada's small businesses are supported during this challenging time. Chair, I want to assure the honourable colleague that we are doing everything and will continue to do everything to help small businesses in our country. Chair, on May 27 the CBSA seized 65 small handguns at Pearson airport, the largest firearms seizure on record. Chair, I would point out that gun violence in any of our communities is unacceptable, and it's important that governments and communities take steps to prevent guns from getting into the hands of criminals. That's why we do important work at our border to keep guns from being smuggled into our country, but it also necessitates additional work. That's why our government has taken a very strong position and will strengthen gun control to keep Canadians safe. We know the Liberals' gun ban won't change anything, but a focus on smuggled guns and criminals will. Chair, stronger gun control laws are an effective tool, and that's been told to us by police leadership and communities across the country. is a strong partner of Canada, as is the European Union, and we're looking forward to continuing that strong relationship the chair: We'll now go back to Mr. With respect to the negotiations with the U.K., when will the minister publish her goals and objectives for this agreement? hon. Chair, we're going to continue to work to ensure that any future agreement is going to be based on the best interests of Canadians, and we will the chair: We will go back to Mr. randy hoback: Can the minister confirm whether they've entered into negotiations with the U.K. mary ng: Our government is analyzing the most-favoured-nation tariff regimes schedule the U.K. Chair, during the CUSMA negotiations, a deal was struck between the Liberal Party and the NDP that the government would notify this House 90 days before it starts any negotiations on any trade agreement. Right now, we are analyzing the most-favoured-nation tariff regimes schedule put out by the U.K. Has the minister discussed a WTO reform with the USTR, the United States trade representative? hon. mary ng: The Ottawa Group is a consensus-based group limited to WTO members who are committed to bringing forward ideas and proposals the chair: We'll go back to Mr. randy hoback: Just as with any other trade agreement, the minister has committed to this House that she will publish the list of goals and responsibilities for the negotiations. Chair, I'm thrilled that we had an excellent meeting of the Ottawa Group yesterday where, as a group, we agreed to take concrete action. randy hoback: Will the minister be releasing a list of Canada's objectives we would like to see the new WTO's director-general pursue prior to the upcoming DG election? hon. I would remind the member that we have access to a billion and a half customers through our very robust mr. randy hoback: A billion and a half customers is fine if you have a functioning WTO, but if you don't have a functioning WTO, then a billion and a half customers may not be fully accessible to our suppliers, manufacturers and agriculture producers. Chair, I want to assure the honourable member that nothing is more important than standing up and helping create markets for our Canadian businesses and to help our small businesses get more export-ready so that they can grow into the international marketplace. This is work that we've committed to do, and we will keep working on it, particularly the chair: We'll go back to Mr. Not only did they present the budget, but they'll also actually debate the budget and pass the budget in Parliament. Chair, the House is sitting in this hybrid format so that people can participate in the House on the screens. I'm sure my colleague is happy to see that his own colleagues are able to ask questions and participate. New Brunswick families and businesses are rapidly making adjustments to manage and live with the coronavirus pandemic. Chair, our government is committed to ensuring that Canadians continue to have access to the benefits that they rely on through Service Canada. We have redeployed over 3,000 additional staff to ensure that Canadians continue to have access to their benefits. We've established a 1,500-agent call centre to make sure that people can get access to the phone lines to get the help they need. Provincial governments are working hard to adjust to Canada's new normal by opening up businesses and front-line government services. Chair, we're currently working with our world-class public health experts to determine how best to reopen the Service Canada network for the public. Make no mistake: Our Service Canada employees have gone above and beyond to ensure that Canadians continue to have access to the services that they rely on and the benefits that they need. john williamson: Please don't hide behind health experts when the Prime Minister is appearing in the middle of large protests, yet is afraid to bring back the Parliament of Canada to do its business. Bills are being studied, opposition input is being heard and MLAs are voting on legislation, not rubber-stamping government bills. When will the government table an economic update so taxpayers understand what was spent, what is owed by our kids and grandchildren, and what the government's fiscal footing looks like? hon. The only reason my colleague is able to ask a question and I'm able to answer his question is that he's right there on the screen. We have this hybrid format that cares for MPs across the country, not only the ones sitting in the House. When will the government table an economic update so that taxpayers understand what was spent, what is owed by our kids and grandchildren, and what the government's fiscal footing looks like in today's environment? hon. We have been open and transparent about the measures we have been providing to support families, businesses and workers. Again I will ask when the government will table an economic update so that we can have an understanding of what the government's fiscal footing looks like. Chair, we have included biweekly reports to Parliament on the full cost and status of our economic response plan measures since the beginning. I have said, and I will continue to say, that when it is possible to provide a clear economic projection, we will provide an update. john williamson: What is the full cost to date of the government's COVID-19 relief measures, as the minister just claimed the government has provided to Parliament? hon. Chair, we have provided support for workers, and 2.5 million Canadians have been helped through the Canadian wage subsidy. stphane bergeron: Mr.Chair, as the leader of the Bloc Qubcois mentioned a few moments ago, the government promised $14billion to Quebec and the provinces, but in targeted transfers. But Quebec and the provinces don't just want this money to be transferred unconditionally, they also want a real discussion on a permanent increase in health care transfers. The federal government, which does not manage any hospitals or long-term care centres, must stop playing armchair quarterback and transfer the money to the only governments with jurisdiction over health, that is, Quebec and the provinces. Will it do so without delay and without nitpicking? the honourable patty hajdu (minister of health): Mr.Chair, we know that the Government of Quebec is working hard to ensure the safety of Quebeckers and we are here to support them. As part of this co-operation, we have developed health and safety recommendations for workplaces, we have purchased medical equipment for workers and we have supported the province in developing its reopening program. stphane bergeron: The co-operation is so effective that the money is staying in the federal government's coffers. We see it with housing, for which Quebec has not received a dime of the $1.4billion it is owed. pablo rodriguez: I am pleased to confirm to my colleague that there is no messing around, no quibbling, nothing of the kind. There is a clear willingness on the part of the federal government to co-operate with Quebec and all the provinces. stphane bergeron: We don't want to bicker, we want the money to be paid out. There is $1.4billion that should be paid to Quebec for social housing and is sitting in the federal government's coffers. We are waiting for money for water treatment and water systems, but it is sitting in the federal government's coffers. What is the government waiting for to pay out the money so that we can get our economy rolling? hon. stphane bergeron: MadamChair, things are definitely at a standstill, because the money is owed and has not been paid out. We need more flexibility in the gas tax program and Quebec's contribution to allow municipalities to undertake work on city halls, community centres and fire stations. We need the federal government to contribute to funding public transit operations, which have become a real financial drain because of the drop in ridership. pablo rodriguez: When it comes to just talking, the Bloc Qubcois has a lot of experience, I admit. iqra khalid (mississaugaerin mills, lib.): Madam Chair, I'll be splitting my time with the member for GlengarryPrescottRussell. During a consultation with the business community in Mississauga, the concerns of businesses, big and small, included the need for stable, affordable and safe child care. With the lack of such child care spaces, an economic recovery plan post-COVID cannot be effective until and unless we make sure that people are able to get back to work. I've heard from parents across Mississauga that they're being forced to stay home because of inadequate child care and that they have to choose between putting food on the table and keeping family safe. More and more employers are realizing that good employees are unable to contribute to their business growth because of this challenge. Now more than ever, we need to find long-term sustainable solutions for Canadians who face challenges with regard to child care. I ask our Minister of Families, Children and Social Development this: What is our strategy to tackle this ever-growing need for a national child care plan? hon. ahmed hussen: Madam Chair, I thank the honourable member for her question and for her important advocacy and work on this important issue. That is why we're committed to continuing to work with provinces and territories to renew our agreements on early learning and child care, and to provide, at the earliest opportunity, $400 million in support. In addition to that, the Prime Minister has already indicated that child care will be part of the $14-billion pledge to provinces and territories to assist them with respect to COVID-19 recovery efforts. Over the next decade, we will continue to invest $7.5 billion, and together we have achieved the goal of over 40,000 affordable child care spaces. We are also committed to continuing to create over 250,000 before-school and after-school child care spaces for kids under the age of 10. We will continue to work with our partners in the provinces and territories to ensure that Canadians can continue to have access to safe, quality and affordable child care. francis drouin (glengarryprescottrussell, lib.): MadamChair, small businesses play a fundamental role in the Canadian economy. In an article in LaPresse, the Minister of Economic Development warned us that the economic crisis caused by severe lockdown measures could have more serious consequences in small municipalities than in large cities. Based on discussions with the chambers of commerce in my riding, it is clear that federal government assistance will be essential for the reopening of the economy, specifically for the rural economy. In fact, I would like to acknowledge the work of the Prescott-Russell community development corporation , under the leadership of John Candie. After announcing almost $57million to help SMEs adopt e-commerce, how does the minister plan to help SMEs and the business community in our rural areas? hon. mlanie joly (minister of economic development and official languages): MadamChair, I also thank my colleague from GlengarryPrescottRussell for his important question. It is also why we have doubled the budget of CFDCs and Community Futures organizations across the country.  In southern Ontario we have reinvested over $260million in the regional economic development agency FedDev. In the great riding of GlengarryPrescottRussell, which I am particularly fond of and where there is a very good member of Parliament, there is an additional $1million for entrepreneurs in the region. carol hughes): The honourable member for GlengarryPrescottRussell has 36seconds left. daniel blaikie (elmwoodtranscona, ndp): Thank you very much, Madam Chair. She has been working from home since late March, taking care of her child, who is out of school, and caring for her father, who is living with her and vulnerable to COVID-19. As a parent and a care provider to a vulnerable person, she's not comfortable with physically returning to work. Service Canada won't give Krystal a straight answer as to whether going on leave and collecting CERB would count as refusing a reasonable job offer. With Bill C-17 looming in the background, Krystal is worried about jail time and fines if she does right by her child and her father by applying for CERB. Can Krystal reasonably refuse to go back to work and collect CERB, or will she be considered a fraudster? That's my question for the minister that is specific to Krystal's case. As well, what is the minister doing to provide clear direction to Canadians and to Service Canada agents so that people can get a clear answer before making their decision about returning to work? hon. We recognize that Canadian workers will face various different situations, including those who are ineligible for the Canada emergency support benefit. We'll continue to work with workers to make sure they're able to be supported throughout this pandemic. daniel blaikie: Madam Chair, that answer is really not good enough, because the problem here is that Krystal needs to know whether she can continue receiving CERB or not. That's a federal government decision, and she needs to know whether the federal government is going to accuse her of fraud and put her in jail or assess fines against her if she refuses to go back to work because she wants to take care of her child and her father. ahmed hussen: Madam Chair, I can assure the honourable member that if a Canadian has to take care of a loved one due to circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, they are indeed eligible to receive the CERB and remain receiving that benefit. laurel collins (victoria, ndp): As we deal with the global pandemic, we cannot lose sight of the ongoing climate emergency. Canada has missed every single climate target it set, and we need to break the cycle of empty promises. Canadians want their government to be accountable, and environmental groups such as Ecojustice, CAN-Rac, Environmental Defence and West Coast Environmental Law, as well as the government's own climate institute, are all calling for legally binding climate targets. When will the government put its climate targets into law with legally binding milestones so we never miss another target again? hon. navdeep bains (mississaugamalton, lib.): Madam Chair, I thank my honourable colleague for her question. It is a priority not only for us as a government, but it should be a priority for all Canadians. That is why we have a comprehensive plan that also includes significant investments in clean technology, which will help reduce our carbon footprint. I am confident that these measures will enable us to not only meet but exceed our 2030 target and also allow us to achieve our net-zero 2050 target. navdeep bains: Madam Chair, I think the fundamental issue here is having a plan when it comes to the environment. I'm confident that the measures that we have takenputting a price on pollution, investing in clean technology, and other key measures to reduce our carbon footprint, including the investment in infrastructureunderpin a plan the acting chair (mrs. laurel collins: This government is not meeting its targets, but it is meeting with oil and gas lobbyists. Are we going to choose a just recovery with good, sustainable jobs for Canadian workers, or are we going to keep subsidizing oil and gas companies to the tune of billions, subsidies that we know are ending up in the pockets of CEOs and shareholders? the acting chair (mrs. navdeep bains: Again, Madam Chair, this is the fundamental difference between us and the NDP. We fundamentally believe that the entire economy needs to work together, including the energy sector, to enable us to achieve those 2030 and 2050 targets. We are going to work together to support our workers, including in the energy sector, to reduce our carbon footprint. When I was last here in May, I was on my way back to Saskatoon from Toronto, and there was actually someone on my flight who tested positive for COVID-19. Why hasn't the government put rules in place requiring airlines to reach out to individuals like me who may have been exposed to COVID on their flights? hon. patty hajdu: Madam Chair, it's hard to speculate on what happened from such a vague description of his experience, but I will say that we have every confidence in local public health, which is doing the hard and heavy lifting of contact tracing and working very closely with all kinds of different sectors, including airline sectors, to make sure that close contacts of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 are found, are traced and are isolated. I assume that the member took appropriate precautions on the flight and I hope that he continues to do so. kevin waugh: Madam Chair, it was reported that the individual on my plane who had COVID was actually connecting in Toronto from an international flight. The Prime Minister announced last week that they would begin mandating temperature checks for those bound for Canada in July. Will international travellers be tested when they land in Canada, or will they be relying on the tests that take place in other countries? hon. bill blair: Madam Chair, this is a very important question, because the protection and safety of all Canadiansin particular, Canadian travellersis a high priority for our government. That will initially be done primarily by the airlines that are in the best position to do it at this point in time. We are also now going to be including CATSA, the people who do the security screening, so that when people enter the airport, they will also be screened. kevin waugh: Madam Chair, last week five of the largest professional sports leagues in North America put out a statement of support for my private member's bill, the safe and regulated sports betting act. Given the struggles that clubs and leagues are facing due to COVID-19, including having no fans at all in the stands for the foreseeable future, the legalization of sports betting would be a welcome opportunity not only to engage fans but to generate much-needed revenue. Will the government commit now to supporting the sports and gaming industries by supporting my private member's bill, Bill C-218? hon. bill blair: Madam Chair, I've had the opportunity on many occasions to speak to members of Parliament and also to mayors and councillors and people living in border communities where there are casinos. I would like to advise the member that I look forward to the opportunity for a careful examination of his bill. At the same time, we will examine his bill with all of the necessary attention to make sure it's given full consideration. kevin waugh: Madam Chair, it's the first time in history that we've had the five professional leagues in this country joining together for this bill. I've heard major concerns from a number of newspapers in this country about competition they're receiving today from Canada Post, which is offering massive free postage services. In fact, I have one of their ads here, which says that the first 6,000 pieces of postage are 100% free. If the government is genuine about wanting to ensure that newspapers and journals can succeed in this country, why are you allowing Canada Post to use its monopoly power to actually threaten local newspapers in this country? hon. steven guilbeault (minister of canadian heritage): Thank you, Madame Chair, and I thank the member opposite for his question. As you well know, a healthy news and media sector in Canada is a priority for our government, which is why we have put in place a number of measures before COVID-19 and during COVID-19, and we will continue to be there for them after this crisis has gone by. carol hughes): Before we go on, we will be taking a break to do a bit of a changeover. Blair stated yesterday here in the House that the AR-15 has been used in mass killings in Canada on many occasions. Blair, please provide just one specific instance in which an AR-15 was used in a mass killing in Canada. I think this is an excellent opportunity to point out to the member opposite how important it is to actually listen to what was said. If you go back and review that tape, and I would invite you to do so, you'll see that I said the AR-15 and other weapons like themreferring of course to military-style assault weaponshave been used in mass killings, and I actually cited a number of examples. Madam Chair, I think it would be very useful if the member's questions were based on facts. Blair that I actually have watched the video a couple of times, and he specifically states that the AR-15 was used in mass killings in Canada, yet he has yet to provide one. Out of the recently banned firearms on May 1, how many have been or are still currently in use by the Canadian Armed Forces? hon. bill blair: That's an excellent question, Madam Chair, because it's very important to provide Canadians with clarity. I asked him a question on whether any of them is being or ever has been used in the Canadian Armed Forces. Are any of the recently banned firearms still in use, or have they ever been in use, in any military in the world? hon. bill blair: Madam Chair, I think it's important to also recognize that the basic origin, the provenance of the weapons that we have prohibited, was in their original design. As I've said previously, they were designed for soldiers to use in combat to kill other soldiers. alex ruff: As someone who has used many military-style firearms and who is actually involved in helping define what we purchase in the military, I would use none of the ones that are currently prohibited. Can he please confirm whether Veterans Affairs has a plan to address the claims backlog, yes or no? hon. lawrence macaulay (minister of veterans affairs): Madam Chair, I appreciate my honourable colleague's question, and yes, we've indicated that it's a major priority. That's why I'm so pleased that the supplementary estimates contained just under $90 million to address hiring more staff, improving the process and making sure that we attack the backlog in an appropriate manner. lawrence macaulay: Well, Madam Chair, I can assure you that it's in the supplementary estimates, and of course, this money is the acting chair (mrs. lawrence macaulay: Madam Chair, I can tell my honourable colleague that the money is in the supplementary estimates, and with the money we're able to attack this problem in an appropriate manner, and that's what is important for our veterans. alex ruff: The deputy minister committed on March 10 that a written plan would be provided to the Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs within a month and made public. lawrence macaulay: Madame Chair, I'm sure my honourable colleague wants an appropriate plan and he would be fully aware this just under $90 million would make a big difference in the plan to attack the backlog. Therefore, my question is, if the deputy minister in the department provided him with an appropriate plan or a written plan, why is he questioning how appropriate that plan is? I have complete confidence in the deputy minister's ability to produce a written plan. lawrence macaulay: I can assure my honourable colleague that with the appropriate funding, we will address the backlog in Veterans Affairs. carol hughes): We will go now to the honourable member for Parry SoundMuskoka, Mr. Three weeks ago, I asked this government if the finance minister would meet with the beleaguered summer camp sector. Summer camps, which are a social and economic mainstay in Parry SoundMuskoka and all of northern Ontario, have been crippled by the global pandemic. Aside from a brief follow-up conversation over the phone with the junior minister, there has still been no action from this government. ahmed hussen: Madam Chair, I recognize the honourable member's important question and his focus on summer camps. We will continue to engage with them, as we have, to ensure and find ways in which we can get their feedback and find ways in which we can support them. That work is ongoing, and I assure the honourable member that our focus is on the kids and on ensuring that they have access to summer camps for this year. The summer camps association has given lots of feedback and my office has given lots of feedback, so I don't see what's confusing about this. However, I've become accustomed to not really getting answers to questions, so I will go to the next one. The Ontario government's regional reopening plan permits cruise boats to resume on Georgian Bay, yet the federal government is refusing to allow these vessels to operate until July 1. Therefore, small businesses such as the Island Queen cruiser in Parry Sound, which has only a very few precious weeks to operate in the first place, is losing yet another two weeks because of federal inaction. Will the Minister of Transport take a regional approach himself by lifting the federal ban on Georgian Bay, just like the Province of Ontario has done? the acting chair (mrs. There have been a number of very important discussions with the provinces, in particular with the Province of Ontario, around provisions regarding pleasure craft. We're working very closely with our provincial counterparts to address this issue, but we want to ensure that it will be done safely. scott aitchison: Madam Chair, I actually gave the minister a heads-up that I would be asking that question. He sent me an email today saying he was not going to be able to be in the House, and it's great of him to do that. He said that whoever was going to fill in for him would have an answer, but again, that was not really an answer. The next issue I would like to bring this government's attention to is the deplorable state of rural Internet service in Parry SoundMuskoka. Quite simply, there are too many gaps in service, and what is available is generally way too expensive. We have families trying to work and teach their kids from home on unreliable and outrageously expensive Internet service, and we have too many small businesses that either cannot access or afford reliable Internet services. Today Greg Rickford, the Ontario energy minister, and Laurie Scott, Ontario Minister of Infrastructure, announced $2.3 million for seven northern Ontario broadband projects. Minister, will when your government get serious and become a reliable partner for the Government of Ontario and the private sector to deliver this crucial modern-day infrastructure to rural Canadians? the acting chair (mrs. carol hughes): I remind the member that he needs to address the questions and comments to the chair. maryam monsef (minister for women and gender equality and rural economic development): Madam Chair, in the best of times, life without access to high-speed Internet is hard. Our government's unprecedented investments are already connecting a million more Canadian households to this essential service, but until we achieve universal access our work is not done. We will work with our partners, including provinces across the country, to connect every Canadian household to high-quality Internet access that is affordable and reliable. I'm wondering, then, Madam Chair, since the Province of Ontario has used the Northern Ontario Heritage Corporation Fund to make this announcement, what about using FedNor to make the same kind of announcement, and partner with the province? the acting chair (mrs. mlanie joly: Obviously we believe in the importance of northern Ontario; that's why we nearly doubled the budget of FedNor. We will continue to invest in businesses and people all around Parry Sound, Muskoka and northern Ontario. If my colleague has specific projects in mind, please come and see me and let's have a conversation. carol hughes): The honourable member for Montmagny-L'Islet-KamouraskaRivire-du-Loup, Mr.Gnreux, has the floor. bernard gnreux (montmagnyl'isletkamouraskarivire-du-loup, cpc): Thank you, MadamChair. During this pandemic, we are realizing the extent to which reliable high-speed Internet service is needed for Canada's economy. There are still places where telework is not possible today because of the lack of adequate coverage. Benot Pilotto, who is the mayor of Saint-Onsime-d'Ixworth, in my riding, wrote to me a few days ago. That is why I am asking you what concrete results the government plans to achieve for our rural areas by the end of the year. maryam monsef: At the best of times, life without high-speed Internet access is difficult. bernard gnreux: MadamChair, I am simply asking the minister to tell me when the mayor of Saint-Onsime-d'Ixworth will be able to tell his residents when the Internet will be available in his municipality. What does the government plan to do so that rural municipalities across Canada can have access to the Internet as soon as possible? What is its plan? hon. maryam monsef: We are working with partners across the country to ensure that every Canadian household is connected to a high-quality, accessible and affordable high-speed Internet service.  Madam Chair, I assure my colleagues that we share the same goal, and we will work with all our partners across the country to ensure every Canadian household has access the acting chair (mrs. According to the government's plan, when will rural Canadian businesses and households be connected? the acting chair (mrs. maryam monsef: Madam Chair, those plans are under way, and we will have more to share in the coming days. bernard gnreux: It seems that the Minister of Rural Economic Development plans to announce a new plan this week. Can she tell us how this program will differ from the Connect to Innovate program, which is already in place? Can the minister tell us whether her program will solve the problem of the 25square kilometre hexagonal zones, which unfortunately make many projects ineligible for the CRTC's broadband fund? hon. maryam monsef: Madam Chair, I'm pleased to share with my colleague that the model he's referring to, the hexagon model, is no more. bernard gnreux: MadamChair, this year, the Canada summer jobs program is a real fiasco. On May13, 100jobs were announced in my riding; on May20, 16jobs were announced; on May27, 13jobs were announced; on June3, 12jobs were announced; and on June10, only one job was announced. Can we have an announcement, once and for all? Let's stop the piecemeal announcements and finally confirm the remaining jobs today so that our organizations can have young people before the summer starts on the weekend. We recognize the important role that the Canada summer jobs program is playing in supporting employers and young workers in communities right across the country. Our government is working very hard to help employers adapt to the realities of the COVID-19 pandemic, and at the same time is supporting young Canadians as they begin to look for summer employment. We've introduced flexibilities into the program to ensure that more young workers have opportunities to get employed. The honourable member also has to understand that we're in the COVID-19 pandemic, and as such it will take some time for businesses to equip themselves to hire students. Addiction is a health and social issue, but criminalization creates stigma, so people hide their drug use and die alone. Access to a safe supply of drugs and safe injection sites saves lives and puts addicts in daily contact with people who can help them. Will this government end the war on drugs by decriminalizing them, providing a safe supply and reallocating resources from policing addicts to providing treatment for them? hon. patty hajdu: Madam Chair, I think it's really important we make sure that when we speak about people who use substances, we remove stigmatizing language like the word addict. We can stand together, as this government has, with people who use substances and their families to ensure a range of options for people who are struggling with addiction, who are using substances in a way that is harming their health and their communities. Madam Chair, we're working with communities to make sure there are more community-based approaches to treating the acting chair (mrs. paul manly: Madam Chair, the Geneva Convention considers both tear gas and pepper spray to be chemical weapons and prohibits their use in war, yet our police forces use these weapons on Canadian civilians. Will the government prohibit the use of these weapons and require police to use de-escalation techniques to keep legal protests peaceful? hon. bill blair: Madam Chair, the right to peaceful protest in this country is a constitutionally protected right. At the same time, Madam Chair, we recognize that the use of even less than lethal force can have significant impacts on people's safety. It's prohibited for non-police use, and for the police it is and should be highly regulated. paul manly: Madam Chair, in 2012 the RCMP spent $14 million on 18 armoured personnel carriers. Will the government rein in the RCMP budget and end wasteful spending on militarizing our civilian police forces? hon. bill blair: Madam Chair, it's a very important tradition that our Canadian police are not militarized. At the same time, we've seen a number of tragedies when police have responded to situations in which people were armed with weapons designed for soldiers to kill soldiers, and they've been used to kill police officers. The militarization of our society, so strongly promoted by some, is the direct consequence of the militarization of the police. As we remove these weapons from our society and prohibit them, we'll make it safer for everyone and we can then move away from such a model of policing. paul manly: Madam Chair, the government spent $4.5 billion to buy an old, leaky pipeline. How much is this spill going to cost Canadian taxpayers to clean up? How much contingency funding has been budgeted to repair the environmental destruction from spills? hon. navdeep bains: Madam Chair, I want to thank the honourable colleague for his question. He full well knows that the acquisition that we made with regard to the TMX initiative is a reflection of the fact that we want this initiative to move forward in a sustainable manner and in a manner that protects the environment. I'll continue to work with my colleagues to endeavour to make sure that we have the appropriate processes in place to protect the environment and at the same time create good-quality, middle-class jobs for Canadians. carol hughes): The honourable member for RosemontLa PetitePatrie, Mr.Boulerice, has the floor. alexandre boulerice (rosemontla petite-patrie, ndp): Thank you, MadamChair. In Montreal, the city and the police department have recognized this, and measures will be put in place. Although it spends $10million a day, we see no attempt to reform or change the RCMP. If the Prime Minister really wants to act, why is he delaying the action plan in response to the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls? hon. bill blair: Let me assure this House and the member opposite that we're not dragging our feet. Indigenous people, black Canadians and other racialized people are far too often experiencing systemic racism and disparate outcomes through the criminal justice system. It's incumbent upon all of us who work within the criminal justice system to take the steps and actions necessary to produce more equitable outcomes. All police services, including the RCMP, must be committed to ensuring that the people they're sworn to serve and protect are always treated with dignity and respect. alexandre boulerice: MadamChair, why are the Liberals taking indigenous children to court to challenge the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruling in their favour? hon. marc miller (minister of indigenous services): Madam Chair, as the honourable member knows full well, a number of cases are pending, and we are currently negotiating with the parties. We are making progress, and I would be delighted to tell the member and the House about it in response to a later question. alexandre boulerice: We've been asking questions about it for months, and as I see it, we should keep doing so. The Prime Minister's new pipeline, which taxpayers were forced to buy with their hard-earned money, has leaked. Some 190,000litres of oil spilled, and we can't even make the company pay for it because the Liberals bought the pipeline. Trans-Mountain, KeystoneXL and the resumption of gas exploration and development off the coast of Newfoundland and Labradorare these the projects the Liberals had in mind for their green recovery? hon. Our priority was to protect the health and safety of Canadians throughout the pandemic, especially when it comes to the environment. That's why environmental and climate change laws aimed at protecting the environment, human health and conservation will remain in force. Unions, associations, artists and creators have all taken part in public demonstrations recently to condemn the lack of a specific plan for the living arts, performing arts and festival sector. alexandre boulerice: Well, that wasn't at all what the artists and creators who were out demonstrating in the streets a few days ago thought. The CERB extension announced by the government only brings us to September, but the cultural community is expecting the worst in the fall. steven guilbeault: I'm not so sure those who were protesting last week had issues with our government, but we'd certainly be happy to speak with them. As for a long-term plan, we are currently consulting arts and culture stakeholders to contemplate together how the government can help the sector in response to the ongoing crisis. We are working on finding solutions, but until we have long-term solutions, we have seen to it that our artists and organizations have access to funding until September. carol hughes): The honourable member for BeauportLimoilou, Mrs.Vignola, has the floor. julie vignola (beauportlimoilou, bq): Madam Chair, I will be sharing my time with the member for Montcalm. According to the latest news, Seaspan Shipyards will be spending an additional $1.5billion to build two ships. anita anand (minister of public services and procurement): I'd like to thank the member for her question. Davie is certainly a strong and trusted partner that works very hard to help our government get results for Canadians. Building a new class of ships is highly complex, and it's not unusual for cost estimates to change throughout the procurement project. It's important to make sure additional funding is available for the joint support ships project to ensure the navy's vessels are delivered. In the beginning, eight years ago, the project was supposed to cost $2.6billion. Why haven't the ships been delivered yet? Why is Davie still not seen as a trusted partner? the acting chair (mrs. anita anand: Once again, I would point out that building a new class of ships is highly complex, and it's not unusual for the cost estimate to change for a procurement project as large as this one. carol hughes): It is now over to the honourable member for Montcalm, Mr.Thriault. luc thriault (montcalm, bq): Madam Chair, in Quebec, 12,000people have begun their training to work in residential and long-term care centres. The dedication of the members of the armed forces is paramount, and I want to extend my heartfelt thanks. What does the army have to do right now that is more important than helping our caregivers save lives? hon. pablo rodriguez: Madam Chair, I'm glad my fellow member recognizes the fundamental role the men and women of the Canadian Armed Forces have played and continue to play in residential and long-term care centres and many other areas in support of our seniors. luc thriault: We are short 12,000people, so if the Red Cross wants to help us, all the better. I repeat my question: What does the army have to do 10days from now that is more important if it's not to help caregivers save lives? hon. The people at the Canadian Red Cross are well-trained paid workers who can perform the same work in partnership with the members of the armed forces, who can stay in Quebec as well. Right now, we are working with the Quebec government and discussing how we can keep the measure in place until September15. What does the army have to do that is more important than helping caregivers save the lives of those who built Quebec? the acting chair (mrs. carol hughes): The Leader of the Government in the House of Commons is asked to keep his answer brief. pablo rodriguez: Madam Chair, the Government of Canada is there and will continue to be there to help the people who built Quebec. Madam Chair, on May 14 I asked the Minister of Agriculture when the Liberal government would put aside its usual campaign rhetoric and recognize the very detrimental impact the carbon tax is having on farmers across this country. Minister Bibeau proudly noted that according to their data, the average cost of the carbon tax per farm across Canada is $210 to $819. The fact is that the Liberal government's own Parliamentary Budget Officer has estimated that at $25 per tonne, the cost for an 855-acre crop farm in Alberta is well over $6,000. When will this Liberal government come clean with Canadians and recognize the disastrous impact the carbon tax is having on Canada's critical agriculture and agri-food sector? hon. marie-claude bibeau (minister of agriculture and agri-food): Madam Chair, our pollution pricing policy is designed to grow a clean economy. Farm fuels and fuels from cardlock facilities are exempt, and there is a partial rebate for propane and natural gas used in commercial greenhouses. We will do a review of our pollution pricing system in 2020, focused on competitiveness issues in trade-exposed industries such as agriculture. It is also important to remember that this is about tackling climate change and that 100% of the revenues stay in the province. earl dreeshen: Madam Chair, Minister Bibeau keeps talking about wanting to protect Canadians' environment. Well, the truth is that Canada's farmers, ranchers and processors have for years demonstrated their ability to deliver meaningful reductions in emissions and to safeguard the environment through the adoption of new technologies, education and innovative management practices, but the government ignores these efforts. Will the minister at the very least admit to Canadians that Canadian farmers are unable to pass on the cost of the carbon tax to consumers and instead have to absorb those extra costs out of their own pockets? hon. marie-claude bibeau: Madam Chair, allow me to explain again our government's position on pollution pricing. Madam Chair, Minister Bibeau has repeatedly asked stakeholders to send her data about the impacts of the carbon tax on farmers, so this is exactly what they have been doing. The Atlantic Grains Council, the Grain Farmers of Ontario, Producteurs de grains du Qubec and the Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association issued a joint statement at the beginning of this year in which they estimated that the cumulative indirect inflation of carbon tax on farm costs will be $14.50 an acre this year, with that cost escalating by more than double by 2022 to almost $30 an acre. Why does the Liberal government continue to ignore the facts presented to it and continue to misrepresent the truth to Canadians? hon. marie-claude bibeau: Madame Chair, I can assure you that we have paid close attention to all the information that has been provided to us and that our calculation was also based on this information provided by provinces and different stakeholders. Marie-Claude Bibeau:as well as the 2019 agricultural tax data to estimate the average cost of pollution pricing associated with grain drying at up to 0.4% of overall operating costs. Dreeshen, I am watching the time, and the minister is allowed to answer for the same amount of time that you used to ask the question<doc-sep>I've received apologies for absence from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian, and I'm very pleased to welcome Helen Mary Jones, who is substituting for Si\u00e2n today. Can I ask whether Members want to declare any interests, please? Can I just, then, place on record that I have got a son who was about to do A-levels, so is affected by the exam decision? We'll move on, then, to our substantive item today, which is an evidence session with the Welsh Government around the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on education in Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams, Minister for Education; Steve Davies, who is director of the education directorate; Huw Morris, who is the group director, skills, higher education and lifelong learning; and Rob Orford, who is the chief scientific adviser for health. We know that this is a really difficult and pressurised time for everyone, and we appreciate your attendance. As you know, it's not usually my practice to do that, but I think it is important today. COVID-19 coronavirus is one of the most significant issues that the Welsh Government and the people of Wales have dealt with in recent times. But I would like to assure you that our aim, and my aim, and my main concern as the education Minister is to protect all staff and pupils in our schools and other educational settings. Public health is clearly the priority here, but that does not change our belief that no child should miss out on any education, unless absolutely necessary. So, the decision to close all schools from tomorrow for statutory education provision was not taken lightly, but I believe it was necessary, given the advice and recommendations that we had received from a public health perspective and the situation that was developing on the ground. They will help support those most in need, including people involved in the immediate response to the coronavirus outbreak, and I'm working with my colleagues in the Cabinet, with Government officials and our partners in local government to develop and finalise these plans. The key areas that we're looking at are supporting and safeguarding the vulnerable and ensuring continuity of learning. I can confirm that all maintained schools in Wales already have access to a range of digital tools that can support distance learning through the world-class Hwb\u00a0digital learning platform, including virtual classrooms and video-conferencing facilities. A guide on what tools are available and how schools can use them has been developed and is being promoted widely. Yesterday, I announced that, whilst there are no easy choices, we have agreed that the best way forward is not to proceed with the summer exam series. Learners due to sit these exams will be awarded a fair grade to recognise their work, drawing on a range of information that is available, and I will announce further details shortly, but I felt it necessary to give early certainty to students and to staff. I would like to put on record my thanks to everyone working in education settings for the hard work that they have put in over the last few months in dealing with the virus and ensuring that pupils have been able to continue to learn. We need to continue to do this work together, as we face the continuing challenges posed by the coronavirus. We'll go to questions from Members now, and I've got some questions from Dawn Bowden. Can I thank you, Kirsty, for your statement and the really difficult decisions that you've been having to make? You've already indicated in your statement this morning that these decisions are not taken lightly, and we understand that that is the case across Government. You've outlined a little bit further there in your statement to us this morning about the new purpose. I take from what you're saying that you haven't really developed that yet in terms of exactly what that is going to look like. Is there anything else you can tell us about that at the moment and how you might staff the schools in those particular areas? kirsty williams am: Thank you, Dawn. So, you're\u00a0absolutely right, our priority now is to operationalise, with colleagues in local government and schools, a practical response. And I have to say, we're working to timescales that I would have hoped to have avoided, but given the fact that we're having to make these decisions quite quickly, I hope that you will understand that perhaps where we start on Monday might change when we have more time and more opportunities to develop programmes going forward. Steve will be able to give you more details of the practical work that has already been going on, but our expectation will be that schools will be playing an important part in providing safe and secure places for children of those on the front-line response to dealing with the coronavirus to attend, and work is already under way with local authorities and individual schools on what that will look like for the emergency situation on Monday. Our other priority is indeed free school meals, and, again, where we eventually end up might be a different place to where we are on Monday. Again, we're responding to the emergency situation that there will be families that were expecting a free school meal on Monday, and, again, individual schools and local authorities are developing those plans at pace to be able to provide an emergency response as we work out a longer term plan to deal with the situation. The same thing also goes for additional learning needs, and attending to the needs of that particular group of learners. I had the opportunity to meet with the First Minister and Andrew Morgan, the leader of the Welsh Local Government Association, yesterday to talk about what local government could do, and what they were already doing. Those plans in some places are already quite developed, and are now working at pace, but I hope you will understand that where we start on Monday is the emergency response, and that work will develop as we go forward. But, Steve, perhaps you could\u2014? Because Steve was the one making all those phone calls and doing the practical operational stuff, rather than me. steve davies: In short, the new purpose is to meet the needs of particular groups of children and young people. In some cases, some of the response to supporting free school meals, in the short term in particular, we may use the schools as part of that, and I'm certain that will happen in some cases. Now, there is still work to be done on identifying exactly the categories of key workers, but I think it's really encouraging that in my discussions yesterday\u2014I spoke with all 22 directors of education, and the examples we're picking up in their work with schools is they're already ahead of the curve in working with schools. They're vulnerable sometimes in terms of education other than at school, vulnerable in terms of mental health, and for those children, as well as having an experience that we want to be planned, some have compared it to a snow day, particularly on Monday, when you're putting something together in the short term, but it will not be a formal curriculum that those children would normally go through. So, the range of activities\u2014some will be focused on educational activities, some will be cultural, some will be sporting, and that plan will be developed on the basis of the age range of children, which in some cases may go from extremely young children up to those at the age of 16 in our all-through schools, but there will be a planned set of activities to cater for those children. What we are doing currently\u2014I have staff back at Cathays Park who are in touch and working with directors of education to ensure that schools over the next two days will have been able to identify, at least at the earlier stage, in terms of health workers, the type and numbers of people. There are already schools who have informed us, and local authorities, of their plans for these activities to be starting next week, which is quite amazing, actually, given where we are. But we are expecting, and we're writing to schools today, that during the course of next week, headteachers to be in schools, and with their staff, taking into consideration the health guidance as to which staff should or should not be in, and in that period from next Monday through the two-week period, to Easter, we expect staff to be both planning for delivery post Easter, but also, as I said, building on and reflecting the good practice that's already in place for schools that have engaged in activities, and I'm sure a number of them will be inviting and enabling those children to come in on Monday. So, Monday will be a challenge for some, and not all will be delivering it, but we will be working so that we can get as much as possible delivered for those groups over the next two weeks, and particularly to have resilient programmes post Easter for the groups of children in those three categories that I said. Can I just clarify one thing? One of the identified vulnerable groups would clearly be children on the at-risk register. kirsty williams am: In our discussions, we have asked local government to be working with the social services departments and individual schools to identify those children who may be in that situation. We know that, for some children, being at school is part of their safeguarding arrangements, and obviously we will need to be able to respond to those needs. steve davies: I wrote specifically yesterday to all directors of education to be assured that, for those children, the register is up to date and the plans are in place. I'm working with Albert Heaney my colleague, the director for social services, who is meeting with the 22 directors of social services today to look to ensure that we are joined up in ensuring none of these children fall through the gap. hefin david am: A very quick and simple question: how are you going to communicate this to parents? There's a bigger picture and it's changing all the time, as you said. The most helpful thing I've seen is that Public Health Wales have a single website with information regarding the wider issue of the virus. How will this then be cascaded to schools, because there's obviously a time lag? So, have you considered how this is going to be communicated directly to parents? kirsty williams am: We're using all of our platforms of communication to get these messages across. So, we're using the more informal methods of communication, but are relying on a systematic approach via individual directors and through to individual schools. We're looking, as quickly as we can, to have a frequently asked education questions page that we can update. It is impossible for the communications team here to be able to respond individually to every single person that is sending Facebook messages and sending tweets, so the best way we can do that is to collate the types of questions people are asking and then to be able to have a frequently updated question and answer page to try to respond to that. With regard to parents, for instance, we're aware of schools that have already sent a questionnaire out last night to parents saying, 'Do you consider yourself to be a key worker? Do you work in the NHS? Please let us know by tomorrow so we can put arrangements in place for your children.' So, schools are already taking the initiative and having those conversations with parents about what their needs will be. It won't be perfect by Monday, because we're working to such constrained timescales. We also have to think about systems that look at what might the epidemic do and have systems of resilience that may work next week, given the situation we find ourselves in with public health advice at the moment. Therefore, have we got a system that will be resilient in those circumstances? These are some of the challenges that we're having to grapple with. So, as I said, what happens on Monday might look very different to where we are if schools are still off in May. suzy davies am: Yes, just on this question of vulnerable children, I'm just wondering how much discretion teachers are going to have in including individual children who may not be obviously under social services' care or on a risk register or whatever. Teachers know their pupils and, very sensitively, they could include people who may not be obviously in need. kirsty williams am: We would absolutely respect the professional judgment of individual headteachers to be able to have those conversations with their directors. As you said, quite rightly, they are the individuals who know their children best and know which children, perhaps, will need this extra support. The second part of my question is: there were going to be Easter holidays anyway, weren't there? What was going to happen about free-school-meal children during that period? Has that gone out of the window now, the normal holiday provision for children? Because that's not there normally, is it, except in separate\u2014 kirsty williams am: We do find ourselves in a strange situation. My understanding is what we're trying to work to is that we would have ongoing provision and not to make some strange, 'You get this for two weeks, then you don't get it for two weeks, and then you're back in.' My understanding is, in England, that is what they're going to do. We're trying to create a system where it will be seamless and it will not necessarily matter that two of those weeks were formally holidays. It won't matter to those nurses and doctors who will need to be in work during those weeks. helen mary jones am: Just briefly, building on Suzy's question, one particular group of children and young people that I hope will be eligible to be included in the potentially vulnerable category is young carers. For some of them, they may not be able to come into school because the people they're caring for may have to be excluded because of their conditions. But I think that, for other young carers, coming to school is an absolute lifeline, because they're working at home. So, I don't know if it's appropriate for you to specifically mention those in discussions with local authorities, but it's a group of young people who, again, may not be vulnerable in other ways, but because of their caring responsibilities they may need school. And the other group\u2014and this, I suppose, goes back to Suzy's point about teachers knowing their young people\u2014is the children who may be living in situations where they're at risk of witnessing domestic abuse. Again, these may very well not be children who are in any formal contact with social services, but being at home may be really not a good place for them to be. So, again, I'd put in an appeal for that to be something that perhaps can be raised with schools. If a teacher is worried about what a child's circumstances are like at home, whether they can be, as you said, Kirsty, included as one of the\u2014. They may not be formally identified, but if the teacher knows that they're at risk, or there is an instinct that they're at risk, they might be able to be included in children who are allowed to take advantage of this special provision you're making at this difficult time. We have to do that in the context of what is deliverable, and we also have to do that in the context of the public health advice that we are receiving as well. We know that the ability for school closures to make a contribution to that diminishes if we have significant children in school still. So, we will take these issues into consideration, but remembering this is part of an epidemic mitigation plan. This is a rapidly-evolving problem and the scale is something that we haven't seen in 100 years, and so we're having to evolve and iterate things as we go. We've all got a role to play, and schools certainly have a significant role to play in breaking those chains of transmission. We need to send a really clear message that you're all part of the solution, and the things that you do by distancing yourselves from your friends and your family are really important for us to get on top of this outbreak. helen mary jones am: I'm sure that that's true, but I'm sure that we wouldn't be wanting a child who's in a very pressured environment with perhaps a very difficult relationship between mum and dad\u2014. janet finch-saunders am: Thank you, Chair, and good morning, Minister, and your team. Can I just put on record my thanks for all that you're having to endure at this moment? I think it's fair to say you have the support of Assembly Members and, indeed, our communities. Now, the question I have: if Cylch Meithrin have to close, where will they get money from to pay their staff? Because, currently, thankfully, there's support for businesses. lynne neagle am: Janet, we're not doing Cylch Meithrin at the moment; we are sticking with schools, as we discussed in advance. dawn bowden am: Can I just get some clarity, Steve, around what you were saying in terms of next week? Because I think the practical applications of this\u2014and I understand that you don't know all of this yet, I understand that\u2014the practical applications are what is coming to us, obviously, with constituents saying, 'Well, what's going to happen to that?' Just so that I can be clear, are you saying that, at this stage, every headteacher will be in school on Monday, as will all their staff? steve davies: Within the scope of the guidance in terms of their health, the expectation\u2014and this will be conveyed in letters by the Minister today, to be made clear\u2014is that they are closing for the majority of pupils, but our expectation within the guidance is that the headteacher with their staff will be coming in; for some to start the delivery of what we just described, but that will probably be small numbers, but more importantly to plan to ensure that, after the formal Easter period, which is school holidays, the schools are geared to cater for the range of pupils that we've been discussing. dawn bowden am: So, would you anticipate\u2014again, I know this is all a bit 'if and when', and it depends on the changing nature of the advice, but from what you're saying, I think we can probably anticipate that, as we go forward, there will probably be fewer schools opening and operable\u2014that we may be moving those children on to fewer sites. So, we already know that one of our local authorities already has identified a strategic pattern of schools that they will want to operate in this way. That local authority has already chosen those locations, and is already having communications with how they will then staff those centres. That, I expect, in the longer term, will be the nature of the provision that we will get to. The local authorities are best placed to understand what is the best, pragmatic use of the resources that they have available; and of course those resources, primarily, are human beings. So, we've talked a lot this morning in the context of teaching staff, teaching assistants, but we're also having discussions with local authorities, and I met with the Council for Wales of Voluntary Youth Services this week, to look at deploying youth workers, to look to be deploying other staff that the local authority may employ, like sports development officers. Welsh Government will be talking with a range of our partners who perhaps their normal activities can't continue at the moment, but actually have personnel who want to add to this effort, who want to be able to be part of a provision going forward in the longer term, to be able to provide a great place for children to be. Let's think about it, in these worst of times, we're asking parents to leave their children so that they can go and do essential work, and some of that essential work is putting themselves at risk, potentially. And we want to give those parents confidence that, when they leave their child with us, that child will receive something really worthwhile, and they can direct all of their attention to doing their job. Janet, have you got a supplementary on schools now, not on early years settings? janet finch-saunders am: I lost the signal before, so it's a little bit confusing at this end, so bear with me. Just in terms of the closure of schools, I have been asked by teachers what does new purpose\u2014you may have covered it, but bear in mind [Inaudible.]\u2014mean in practice. And also, they're already asking what will next\u2014? I know you said earlier that next week could look and probably will look significantly different than this week, but what can they expect to be happening next week in terms of this new purpose work? lynne neagle am: We've covered that, Janet. kirsty williams am: First of all, Janet, I just want to say thank you very much for your kind comments. lynne neagle am: I think you're having trouble hearing us, aren't you, so I think\u2014? janet finch-saunders am: No, I heard that loud and clear. lynne neagle am: But I think you missed the earlier comments, when we went into some detail on the new purpose of schools. dawn bowden am: Just in relation to special schools and how they will fit into this new purpose arrangement. We know, again, that some of these children are our most vulnerable and they are some of our most pressurised families. We'll be having discussions about what arrangements can be made for those children within their own usual settings. Can I give a shout out to the work of Rhondda Cynon Taf in this regard, who are already doing some excellent work with regard to how they can keep in touch with their children who usually would attend their special schools. steve davies: I think special schools have already been hit by this challenge, because a significant proportion of their children, because of their conditions, have not been coming to school, they've been isolated. But the principle we've used there is, actually, even if it's a minority of children who go to those schools and are vulnerable, they deserve and need that support through the school. But similarly, even in special schools, there will be children whose parents will be key workers, so we would expect them to apply that same principle. Just quickly in response to the earlier question, while we may bring some groups of children into separate schools, we\u2019ll have to continue with the principle of keeping social distance and any provision for a child in a special school in a different setting would be unlikely, given the nature of the special school, so we would look to cater for that within the original school. It\u2019s likely, because I know it has already happened, that some schools might actually close before Monday. Are you quite happy that headteachers still have the discretion to do that, if they feel that\u2019s the right thing to do? kirsty williams am: In this situation, the discretion of the head still remains. As I said, we will be communicating with all schools today about our expectations, if at all possible, to have schools open for staff to do some of this planning and to be able to respond to these priority needs that we've just talked about. steve davies: The rationale of headteachers for closing schools up to now has been that they can't cope with the safety of the children. I think, moving forward, it's unlikely that that would be a rationale that headteachers would want to use for not engaging and planning for the future. dawn bowden am: We're only talking about one more day, now, anyway, aren't we? So, just in terms of confirmed cases in schools, is your view at this stage that, if there is a confirmed case in a school, once that school has been deep-cleaned, it can reopen again? kirsty williams am: If we had a confirmed case in a school, then all the usual mechanisms arranged by Public Health Wales would kick in at that point. I know that kind of crosses over into somebody else's portfolio as well, but I think we know that. Certainly what I've seen, and I'm sure this is true elsewhere as well, we've seen nurseries closing down because the parents are actually taking the children out of those nurseries. I've got one in particular, there are kids from the ages of 6 to 12 years in there, and the parents are taking them out. They've got 30 staff there, catering for 200 children and no children to care for and the organisation, at this stage, is unable to claim on their insurance for the ongoing payment of those staff wages. Is there any advice that we can give to people in that situation at this stage? kirsty williams am: Sure. As you say, many of these settings are businesses\u2014people's businesses and they play a hugely important role and it's a very worrying time for them. We have said that we will continue to pay for childcare, delivered under the childcare offer even when a child is unable, or a parent is unwilling, to take up that place. So, if that setting is receiving a childcare payment from the Welsh Government as part of our childcare offer, that will be paid, regardless of whether that child attends or not. And I know that we're also working with local authorities to ensure a similar position on Flying Start childcare and early education. It's also important that childcare settings will be able to apply for the various packages of support that are being made available by my colleague, Ken Skates. hefin david am: Yes, I'd just like to turn that around from the parents' point of view. With schools closing, there are a lot of parents then losing 10 hours of free childcare, but from a settings point of view, they'll continue to be able to receive, for the time being, the nursery care. kirsty williams am: Yes, so the decision that has been taken by my colleague, Julie Morgan, is that settings should stay open at the moment unless public health changes. Again, the issue is that we know that that childcare is vital to many families, especially\u2014and we're particularly concerned about those individuals who are trying to help us overcome and solve these problems. If you have any specific questions about that, we'll be happy to take them back to Julie Morgan. janet finch-saunders am: Is this the Cylch question? lynne neagle am: Yes, please. Yes, just basically, Cylch Meithrin, there are concerns\u2014[Interruption.] lynne neagle am: We've lost Janet. kirsty williams am: I think if the issue is about funding for Cylch Meithrin, these are not normal circumstances. As a Welsh Government, we will take every step to provide continuity of funding, if at all possible. We will overcome this, and when we overcome this situation we find ourselves in, we will need those childcare settings, we will need those private businesses and we will need our Cylch Meithrin to be there to respond and to be able to go on doing the job that they usually do for us. And if there is any way that we can, as a Government, ensure that that happens by carrying on funding things, even if they are not able to run, all usual\u2014[Inaudible.]\u2014 around service-level agreements are off. [Laughter.] But, you know, we will not undermine businesses and voluntary provision like Cylch by withdrawing Welsh Government funding. lynne neagle am: If we can move on to talk about exams, obviously you made the announcement yesterday. I completely understand that everything is a very fast-moving situation, but, as you know, there are a lot of questions that people have about young people who've put a lot of work in. Are you able to tell us any more today? In particular, have you got any idea about timescales now for setting out what the approach will be to handling the lack of summer exams? kirsty williams am: Yes, it is a devastating decision to have to have been taken, but I have done so on the very, very clear and unambiguous advice from Qualifications Wales. What was most important to them was that I made an early decision and I did not equivocate on what would happen for the exams. I was able to make an informal decision at that meeting, and then, of course, there is a formal process that we have to go through. That, now, allows Qualifications Wales and the exam board to operationalise that decision, and they will be communicating with schools as quickly as possible about what schools will need to do to ensure that the systems that they will now put in place can work. We are trying, as far as we can, as I understand it, to be able to mirror as closely as possible the usual results day, for instance. It might not be possible, because, of course, we're dealing with a situation that requires human beings to be involved in it, and those human beings could find themselves unwell. So, our best attempts will be to maintain the normal rhythm of an exams day in August, but that has to be caveated by the fact that we're dealing with difficult circumstances. But, the WJEC and Qualifications Wales will be making urgent communications to exam centres to explain what will need to happen next. janet finch-saunders am: Yes, I think I raised it yesterday, Kirsty, but you were receiving loads of questions. I'd just ask for some further clarification about coursework, because only 30 per cent of that is done. Years 11 and 13, typically, in my case they're what's been raised with me\u2014do you have any advice for them? kirsty williams am: Okay, so, all exams are cancelled, but year 11 and year 13 will be given a grade\u2014I think that's a distinction that people need to be aware of. That is because those years and those grades are gateway qualifications, and they are points of movement in the education system. So, it's really important for those students that they are not disadvantaged in any way by not being able to receive a grade that helps them to make a decision as a qualifying step into what they will do next, whether that be university, whether that be a degree apprenticeship or whether that be going into sixth form, into a college, into an apprenticeship or into some work-based learning opportunities. That's why we have to focus on those children, because for them, it is absolutely critical that we do. We are at an advantage in Wales, can I say? Because of the nature of our examination system, those students already have a lot of externally assessed work that we can use as a basis to move forward on. Our year 11s, if they're doing triple science, they've already done 40 per cent of their paper, so we're very fortunate. Because of the structures that we have got in our qualification system, there is already lots and lots of externally-verified work that we can use, alongside, potentially, teacher evaluation of students as well. What will also be important is that these children have confidence in those qualifications, and so we will be looking at a modulated arrangement within Wales, and I know that Qualifications Wales are discussing with their counterparts across the UK a modulated system across the UK. So, actually, we can make sure that our standards are maintained by actually having that modulation across the UK. So, we know that those children never have to worry about the rigour that has gone into determining that grade. You'll know that the National Union of Students has suggested that black and minority ethnic children and children from the working class, on the whole, don't do as well, in terms of their assessment by their own teachers. We also know, of course, that boys tend to do better in exams, and girls tend to do better at coursework, for whatever reason\u00a0that is. So, just to ask you at this early stage to build in those considerations around potential unconscious bias into that overall system that you're talking about. And, of course, you are right to say that, because we have got some elements of external moderation here, those factors may be less for us in Wales than they might for colleagues in England. kirsty williams am: Yes, I think we are starting at a different base, thank goodness. As I said, students will have done unit 1 papers last year if they're GCSE students. I have every confidence that they and the WJEC will come up with a very comprehensive way of establishing those grades, but I have to say, in some ways, I have to step back now, because you would not expect me, in normal circumstances, to dictate to the WJEC how much percentage goes for that, and how much percentage is allocated for that; that would not be appropriate for a Minister. My job is to make the decision on the examinations on the basis of having confidence that what can be put in place is fair and is equitable, and I have confidence that that will be the case. One is, obviously, pupils are being asked to work at home as well now, some of whom will be doing GCSE and A-level courses. So, there's just a question, generally, from me\u2014 because we're encouraging these kids to carry on working\u2014how that will be accommodated by Qualifications Wales, I guess, in this modulation process. It may be that your at-home work will be of a higher standard or a lower standard than a teacher would be expecting. Secondly, you mentioned the AS-levels, of course, as being of value at the moment, but we've got people in Year 12 who now won't be doing their ASs. Is there any steer at this stage about what they will be expected to do? Will they be doing two sets of exams next year, for example? Or is AS just off the table? In which case, how are the A2s going to be calculated in due course? And then, finally from me, we do have some vocational qualifications that are up for examination as well\u2014your BTECs, and I think it's the Association of Accounting Technicians, which is a lot of computer-based learning\u2014which is due to be examined within three weeks. I appreciate that you may not have the answer just at the moment, but are they off as well is the question, I guess? kirsty williams am: With regard to\u00a0AS-levels\u2014no final decision has been made for exactly how those students will be treated. There are a range of options that could be used, but again, we will want to be thinking about student well-being, fairness and equity in that regard, and I will update Members as soon as I have received definitive advice from Qualifications Wales around that, and that hasn't happened yet. With regard to other types of qualifications, as you will be aware, the vast majority of BTECs is a modular, continually-assessed piece of work, and we would have every expectation that BTECs will be able to be awarded, but clearly, those conversations are with awarding bodies\u2014they tend to be UK awarding bodies, rather then necessarily our WJEC exam board\u2014and those conversations are ongoing. But I have every expectation that those qualifications will be awarded and, of course, because of their nature there's even more evidence of continued assessment. Huw, I don't know if there's anything else that you would like to add about those types of qualifications. I don't have a definitive answer for the ATT qualification, but we can look into that and come back to you. suzy davies am: Well, I've just had a constituent ask, so that would be very helpful. suzy davies am: \u2014is that going to count towards the assessments, overall assessments? kirsty williams am: Well, potentially, as I said. What will be absolutely necessary is that Qualifications Wales and the WJEC will be able to give absolute clarity and simplicity around how those grades will be arrived at, because parents, teachers and students will want to know that, and my expectation is on them to be able to clearly communicate what elements will and will not be taken into consideration when awarding those grades. lynne neagle am: And, just before we move on, have the universities across the UK indicated that they are content with this approach going forward\u2014content to accept students on this basis? kirsty williams am: Certainly. There have been discussions with universities and UCAS, of course, that this also has a bearing on. And the views of university and how university terms might be impacted is one of the ways and one of the reasons that we've factored in to making these decisions. Those discussions with universities are ongoing, aren't they, Huw? huw morris: Yes. So, we've been in regular conversation with Universities Wales and through them with Universities UK and we've received every indication that the approach that's been adopted here has been welcomed by the institutions. Those conversations will continue as we work through the practicalities of how the gradings that are awarded are going to feed through into university admissions decisions and enrolment. Well, we've got some questions now from Suzy on the potential closures of colleges and universities. I appreciate you've already indicated there are lots of ongoing conversations, but my understanding is whether colleges or universities close is pretty much still at their own discretion. We're going to be asking some questions on emergency legislation shortly, which may impact on the answer you can give today, but what sort of conversations are you having with FE and HE at the moment about how they decide? kirsty williams am: Well, you're absolutely right. As we often say in this committee, universities are autonomous institutions\u2014a status that they guard jealously and we would never want to question. Universities have been making the decision to move as much of their learning online as they possibly can and we continue to have conversations with them. Colleges are in a similar position, looking to do as much as they can to be able to provide continuity of learning via distance learning methods, and the Bill, potentially, does give us more powers of intervention in both the FE and the HE sector. suzy davies am: I might ask you about that in a minute, because I don't even know what the Bill says yet. kirsty williams am: Huw, I don't know if there's anything you want to add. huw morris: No\u2014just to confirm what's been said and also to add in that independent training providers, similarly autonomous, like colleges and universities, have been moving in the same direction. We've been very impressed with the maturity and forward-planning that's been adopted by all of those institutions and their representative bodies. We've got consistency in the approach and a common desire, and investment in moving towards online support for students. Certainly, colleges have indicated, as with schools, that, for the most vulnerable learners, they'll have something in place that might permit attendance on an individual basis. huw morris: That's my understanding, yes, and, again, we've been in regular conversation with them about that. My understanding is that they're going to spend the next week working through the detail of how that will work for the institutions. You indicated that any Welsh Government support's going to stay, whatever the circumstances are\u2014in your portfolio. helen mary jones am: Just further to EMA, of course, at the moment, that has an attendance qualification, doesn't it? And you don't get your EMA if you don't turn up. Should we take from your last answer that that attendance qualification doesn't apply anymore? kirsty williams am: Yes. They can't turn up if the institution is not open, and that's not their fault. helen mary jones am: No, but that is something that's been a worry, so that's really encouraging to hear. Thinking about students in higher education, can you give an assurance that student maintenance payments will continue as normal? Is that the intention? kirsty williams am: Yes. And have you given any special ministerial instruction to Student Finance Wales on processing applications for support or changes of circumstances, or is that something that's kind of ongoing at the moment? kirsty williams am: Those conversations are ongoing with the Student Loans Company. Individual student circumstances could well change and our expectation would be that the Student Loans Company would respond to that. All I would say is, just to remind people: people who work for the Student Loans Company are no more able to resist this disease than anybody else. There will undoubtedly in some cases be really practical challenges to service delivery, simply because organisations could be losing staff because of illness or the need to self-isolate or because they are reacting to social-distancing messages from the Government. So, I think we just need to bear that in mind: that these organisations are doing their best, but, if they are badly affected by staff numbers being off because of the virus, then I hope people will give them due consideration. helen mary jones am: Yes, that makes sense, of course, because we've been told that universities won't be able to entirely close, because there will be students who can't go home\u2014 kirsty williams am: It is their home. What discussions have you been having with the sector to make sure that those students' basic needs are met, that there's still food, shelter, whatever they need? kirsty williams am: Well, obviously, universities have a duty of care to those students that find themselves in those circumstances, and every conversation that Huw's been having would suggest that universities are well aware of their need to do that. huw morris: We instituted a monitoring process very early on in the onset of the disease, not least because a number of institutions have campuses and activities in China and other parts of south-east Asia. And so, as the disease has progressed, we've seen lessons being learned from the support for students who are in isolation coming from there to the UK, and I am assured that the universities here in Wales have got processes in place that support those learners. And on this specifically\u2014last question from me\u2014 have you considered whether students might need to be refunded some of their tuition fees, should the academic year not be completed? huw morris: So, as the institutions move more and more of their material and some of their assessment online, clearly, there are lessons that will need to be taken on board. There are established quality assurance and enhancement procedures in institutions to enable the tutors and other supporters to make sure that that material meets their needs. There are appeals mechanisms and feedback mechanisms through the students union and through course committees and other things within institutions to make sure that any concerns or incomplete work are addressed. Failing those institutional mechanisms, there is a UK-wide system through the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for students to take forward any concerns that they have. So, we're confident that that system will be robust and will make sure that the students are getting a course of learning that meets their needs. But thinking just a little bit more broadly about the mental health and well-being of staff and learners across a range of educational settings, or, indeed, young people who can't access educational settings, what considerations are you giving to how that mental health and well-being might be supported through what is an incredibly difficult time for everyone? kirsty williams am: Yes, that is correct. So, our expectation would be that during a prolonged period of closure\u2014which I think, if we're honest, we have to acknowledge is what we're looking at\u2014we would expect school staff\u2014well-being staff, for instance in school\u2014to be doing check-ins\u2014phone check-ins, potentially, or FaceTime check-ins, with students, just to keep in touch with them as we go forward. We'll be looking to promote amongst young people\u00a0a range of online facilities that are available\u2014so, for instance, Meic website\u2014so, looking to use a variety of platforms. I'm concerned, of course, that for some children their access to their counsellor is\u00a0via their school. We know that, and we're just double checking the capacity of online counselling that already exists\u2014online counselling tools that children already use because they don't want to go to the counsellor in the school and be seen in the school corridor going to the counsellor. They're already using those online methods and we expect to be able to continue, as far as possible, those kinds of mechanisms where children can have their mental health needs and their questions answered, and their worries. One of the reasons, again, that we wanted to keep schools going as long as possible\u2014and teachers have been working so hard to do that\u2014is because that routine of going into school and that normality is one that we've needed and wanted to maintain. Children will have worries about their own health; they'll have worries about the health of their parents and their grandparents; they will be consuming potentially media and news stories that have empty supermarket shelves. So, we need to understand, and I think we will also have to recognise, that this support will have to be ongoing once we're back to normal, and we will have to continue to look to support children in the longer term who will have lived through this experience. They are incredibly resilient, and they have been the champions of some of our public health messages. They are so much better and so much more compliant on the whole 'washing your hands' and things like that than even adults have been. So, they are incredibly resilient, but we also have to recognise that it can be a really worrying time for them. helen mary jones am: Can I just\u2014? Just a supplementary to that\u2014you've mentioned already, Kirsty, the importance of youth services, and, particularly thinking voluntarily youth services, you've given the commitment, when were talking about Mudiad Ysgolion Meithrin earlier, that services that are part-funded by grants through the Welsh Government, for example, thinking of the national youth voluntary service\u2014will those be able to be maintained even if settings have had to be shut as well? Obviously, local authorities will have to make their own decisions about whether youth settings are kept open, but, in terms of the direct support from Welsh Government, can organisations that receive it rely on that through this time? kirsty williams am: No formal decision has been made, but if people are in receipt of a Government grant from my department to run a service and that service can no longer run because of the public\u2014 helen mary jones am: Because it's not safe. kirsty williams am: \u2014because it's not safe to do so, I do not foresee that we will be turning around and saying, 'We'll have our money back, thank you very much.' lynne neagle am: Okay, thank you. The normal rules of engagement have to change and, those organisations, we'll need them to be providing youth services for children when we are back to normal, and we wouldn't want to do anything that would undermine their ability to do that. When we're trying to maintain services for vulnerable children and for front-line staff children, they have a valuable role to play and I know that local government and the Council for Wales of Voluntary Youth Services are already in discussion about how youth services\u2014. Those traditional youth clubs, because of austerity, are not necessarily there anymore, so they are well used to being out and about and doing outreach work, and they will have an important part to play in the services that we talked about earlier. Hefin, briefly, and then we're going to take one final question from Suzy on emergency legislation. I'll declare an interest as a parent of a child with additional learning needs, although the question I'm about to ask doesn't reflect her interests. Additional learning needs pupils who are waiting outcomes of referrals\u2014if they're currently waiting an outcome of a referral, will that process will be suspended or will it continue as normal? And, if it is suspended, will it pick up where it left off from this point? kirsty williams am: I think we have to recognise that the ability to deliver business as usual has been massively compromised. I'm sure people will try and continue to do their normal activities and their normal jobs, but that might not be possible. I don't want to give you any false assurance if, actually, the intelligence on the ground is that that simply will not be able to happen. But we don't\u2014 hefin david am: Can we have a clear line on that? kirsty williams am: We don't want to jeopardise anybody, but as I said, some of the normal services are simply not available as everybody turns their attention to trying to respond to the pandemic. Final question\u2014because I know that the Minister's got a lot of things that she needs to get on with\u2014from Suzy on emergency legislation. suzy davies am: I'm not going to ask you if you'll use any powers you get under the emergency legislation, but are you able to give us some indication of what they might be? kirsty williams am: Sure. For instance, the Bill will provide Welsh Ministers with powers to temporarily close schools or other educational institutions, childcare premises; powers to give temporary continuity direction\u2014so, actually, the other way around, force things to be open\u2014and to be able to direct resources. So, that includes, as I said, I could direct something to stay open if that institution was trying to close down. The powers also give flexibility to maybe be able to direct staff to other institutions that they would not normally work in, if that was part of our resilience needs. We'd also be looking at, for instance, relaxing requirements around ratios in childcare settings, or we might be wanting to do things around food. If there is a continuing role for schools in providing food, we might have to be a bit more flexible about what that might look like. So, those kinds of flexibilities\u2014to be able to suspend things, direct things\u2014that we would not normally have in normal circumstances. And just to finish this one off\u2014you may not be able to answer this one, in all fairness\u2014in those situations where it's the Government who says 'no' to various things, does that then help people in the situation of Dawn's nursery, and insurance claims suddenly become more likely? kirsty williams am: I'm not an expert on insurance, and I don't know if anybody here can help me. But what my understanding is, is that even where Government has given a direction that does not necessarily mean that you will be covered by your insurance. What we're finding in the private sector is that insurance companies are not paying out, because even when a Government has directed it, they do not regard this as a disruption to business. kirsty williams am: It's not my area of expertise, but from what I understand from discussions around the Cabinet table, this is particularly problematic. Let me give you an example about how we've been trying to overcome some of this\u2014it feels like an awfully long time ago now\u2014 you'll be aware that we gave directions earlier around cancellation of school trips abroad. Trying to make sure that that direction came from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, rather than the Department for Education was a real battle, because again there were fears that, unless that advice came from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, insurance would not kick in, and that was a two-day discussion. kirsty williams am: So, these are the kinds of things that we're grappling with. But, as I said, thinking about it, that was only last week, but it feels like an aeon ago. suzy davies am: I'm not holding you to that, but it helps us manage the questions we get asked. kirsty williams am: Yes, but as I said, insurance is not my area of expertise. Can I thank you for attending this morning, and your officials? We do recognise what an incredibly challenging time this is, and we'd like to place on record our thanks to all of you for the work that you're doing to try and see us through this crisis. Item 3, then, is a motion under Standing Order 17.42 to resolve to exclude the public for the remainder of the meeting"

        "Query": "What were the team's decisions and solutions regarding the remote control's visibility, ease of finding, and prevention of loss during the discussion of technical issues, market interests, and the function of \"glow in the dark\"?",
        "Summary": "The team discussed various options for the remote control design. User Interface suggested a base station next to the TV, but it was deemed technically complicated and costly. Marketing proposed implementing an audio signal, which was ultimately adopted. There were debates about where to place the logo on the remote. Project Manager suggested printing it on a button, but User Interface was concerned about wear and tear. Industrial Designer suggested putting it on the back, but visibility was an issue. User Interface proposed a two-piece remote, but it didn't align with the cover design. Finally, it was agreed to leave a cut-out space on the latex covers to display the logo. The team decided on a beeping feature for when the remote gets lost and a fixed charger to prevent loss. Marketing suggested additional features like beeping or blinking lights when clapping, and a signal when in a dark spot. However, voice and clapping were deemed insufficient, and the team settled on glow-in-the-dark material combined with speech recognition for easy location. This choice was cost-effective and believed to boost market sales.",
        "Article": "industrial designer: Is there any time for a cup of coffee ? user interface: We have a slight problem . project manager: Sorry ? industrial designer: Can I get a cup of coffee ? project manager:  no . project manager:  then  the three of you  prepared a presentation , I think ? Sebastian ? industrial designer: I think so too . user interface: industrial designer: project manager: Then we'll do your one   as la  the last .  the top goal of this m user interface: But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe . project manager:  the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group  and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind .  the new project requirements , first of all ,  we didn't speak about it , but we should not  support teletext in the remote ,  because our b  board  feels that  teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext .  the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not  f  feasible , it's not  w user interface: Yeah . project manager:   we we cannot make it because of the time to market  that we have to deal with . project manager:  the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than  forty , which is important for you ,  Ruud , and as well for  Roo .  then for Roo , as well  important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product .  the individual presentations , I th  Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ? user interface: Yeah , I'll start .  the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . user interface: Then I found  two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function  remote control with many possibilities , but  the lack of the feeling I already mentioned  in the previous  discussion . user interface: And the ease-of-use remote control with  the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . My personal preferences were ease of  the easy to use remote control , because  the user-friendliness and  it can be more trendy in in user design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not  in our design . But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is  the best  possi possibility for us . project manager: Okay , so marketing: project manager: the important thing here is user interface: And it's also i indeed   Ruud's  insight in the in the topic . project manager: Yeah , okay , w we will s we all  user interface: Just for  for user desi  user  friendliness I  should choose for the the ease of use remote control .  well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . user interface: industrial designer:  basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by  sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to  implement a picture here , user interface: Energies and  industrial designer: but it's hardly readable . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using  infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . It's almost every piece of equipment  every piece of  every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . And I think that's what we w user interface: The glow in the dark  concept  we discussed . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . industrial designer: and I think we should  we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . industrial designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared , because  otherwise our device cannot  communicate with  almost every T_V_ set . And  if we want to use  a rechargeable design or  a energy-save design , we should really implement them .  for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost  circuit board ,  because most of the production cost are are in this  part of the equipment . industrial designer: And  the money we save on using this we can use  for elaborate fancy lighting  techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . user interface: And what's the  industrial designer: I think our  users will really  will really like that . user interface: if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or industrial designer: No , they're p f  power friendly LEDs also . user interface: For the same costs , it's can be  in our industrial designer:  no , they're  they're a little bit more expensive , but by    making user interface: Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's  industrial designer: We can we can make its I think . project manager: Yeah , but but the question is whether  two or four buttons makes  m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to  include fancy lightning techniques , I guess . user interface: Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , marketing: true . Well , it's not one light , it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . project manager: Okay well , industrial designer: project manager: we ar we are very curio curious to what the market  will feel about such a product . marketing: But  since  the other part is  forty percent of the market , I  thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . The buttons to zap are used the about  fifteen hundred times , when  the power button is only used one time . So user interface: Yeah , well it should just have a design The perfect design for those only those buttons . Just one thing I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? industrial designer: Well marketing: Yeah , that's  a problem . project manager: Well industrial designer: Usually project manager: maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , user interface: It should be   project manager: like  turning on and off the the the lights . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a  kind of weird sound , and your  remote controls then start to beep . project manager: But  th user interface: But but T_V_s don't have all   buttons . marketing: And you project manager: Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home  user interface: But I believe you will have an marketing: Yeah , and usually industrial designer: We do not control the T_V_ set so well . marketing: And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button ,  you would have to walk to your T_V_ , industrial designer: Yes , m yes . S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , marketing: and it's project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so we should think about project manager: So what about the clapping technique ?  because you se user interface: I'm convinced  Sebastian will  find  one solution for us . marketing: And b project manager: Well , you see it a lot in in light  lightning   industrial designer: Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics  the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , project manager: Yeah , a peak . industrial designer: But there are many other sounds  which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . industrial designer: Yes , user interface: But we can have just   a home stat  f a base station next to the T_V_ . user interface: Well if you lost th industrial designer: Well , project manager: Well  industrial designer: is there not something f something more easily user interface: I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . user interface:  that's just  industrial designer: No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and  b  perform a a some kind of  . You do not want another device , which can be  everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . project manager: Yeah , m maybe  w we  we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . project manager:  maybe Sebastian should have  a detailed look later on and  come up with a solution , industrial designer: But  before I do that I w I want to warn you that  by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated project manager: And there are some implepe imp user interface: And do we even  prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning  function ? industrial designer: Well , I I think so , because  when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . user interface: It's a unique item  project manager: Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . project manager: and  I think  it's worth   looking and and probably more i interesting than  than the lights . user interface: And just about  the user interface , I came up with  an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . marketing: Well , t  we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function . project manager: Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players  and all kind of stuff . user interface: So industrial designer: we should save costs  by not implementing a lot of functions and  the money that we can save from that we should use for  having a nice design and  thinking about the user interface project manager: Yeah . Okay , industrial designer: and project manager: Ruud , how do you feel about that ?  do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to  a simple marketing:  well if we  include other  innovative functions  then they  might , project manager: user interface:  just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated ,  because it has many functions . industrial designer: Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very  friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but  nevertheless project manager: But but are we not in in the in the manual   if you have few buttons , no display ,    I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and  one button can  industrial designer: Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . project manager: But but how does how does the remote  report  r  give back to the user w in what state it is ? user interface: Yeah , I don't know yet . There's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . project manager: I know , but but if we use  like a stick , for example ,  industrial designer: W When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe  a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just  pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t  turned up the volume . marketing: And if you use that stick for volume control and channel  selection , you have the m two most important functions in one  button . user interface: But does it  I then should n just use  i instead of the stick ,  like many cell phones , just a round m well , project manager: Yeah , draw draw it on the board . Oh user interface: It's just an easy  way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . user interface: A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down project manager: Yeah , it can break down . marketing: And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it  attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . project manager: Okay , but w we still we're still in the question of    putting in advanced options .  we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , I think . user interface: Yes ? project manager: We need to  have the  the user function  the functions decided and   our target audience . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ?  which  incorporates all function available on the device ? project manager:  well , I do not want a full  it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want  the kind of functions , for example  th the most important are volume and  programme selecting . l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but user interface: Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to  two channels , when you have  something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can  change industrial designer: project manager: Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last  Mielsen . industrial designer: but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . project manager: And and do we want  the ten digits ? user interface: The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so . industrial designer: Well , are are you sure ? marketing: Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . industrial designer: but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think but you should  shou you should know that . industrial designer: Okay , user interface:  and I think the most industrial designer: I can imagine when project manager: I agree actually . user interface: Just elder elder people would would buy it , industrial designer: I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . marketing: Well user interface: but industrial designer: But if you're  a regular T_V_ user , and you just want  to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can  you can use  about ten buttons . industrial designer: Well , marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: but how how often do you watch all these channels ? marketing: and if if we And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . Don't you think ? project manager: Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the industrial designer: The design . marketing: Well project manager: You c you can d make them very fancy marketing: And project manager: by   Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . industrial designer: Okay , so you can experiment by  with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .  it might be expensive and  hard to implement , but it would be a solution  for project manager: Okay , speech . industrial designer: So  when you add  speech recognition to your remote control ,  it's very easy to change  the channel . industrial designer: So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . project manager:  If if we would  drop the ten digits industrial designer: But maybe when we  project manager: but keep the programme and the volume , industrial designer: It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find  find the remote control button  remote control function . industrial designer: There are some  hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . industrial designer: So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . project manager: But But but can we manage it bu  for the costs ? industrial designer: You have to do nothing for it . marketing: And  if we if we could inc  include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be  a big problem . marketing: 'Cause when project manager: Is a cradle very cheap ? industrial designer: It's Oh , it's very cheap .  I would like to hear  maybe maybe you all have th  things not  spoken about , yeah , but that are important .  are there other things about the market we should know ? marketing:  I think we dealt with the most important information . project manager: Sebastian ? industrial designer:  I just want to make a summary of all all things  spoken and  the different possibilities . So on the outside it looks easy , but  we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by  implementing  speech techniques ,  voice recognition , that these kinds of things .  there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement  fancy techniques , which  I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about  the the costs and  the things like  battery lifetime , energy saving . industrial designer:  another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons . If we just add   a chip which does the voice recognition ,  our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another project manager: Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board industrial designer: well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . user interface: But the cheaper the ch  the the chip or th what was it ? industrial designer: project manager: No , it's th industrial designer: The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . user interface: Well it then we should just  take a look at the costs and  especially for the voice recognition . project manager: I'm not sure how how we'll f  determine the costs , I will have a look at it . project manager:  I'm not sure how how that industrial designer: Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will  have a lo  look at it . project manager:  I'm don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out . project manager:  then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work ,  and I'm sure your personal coaches will  assist you with it . project manager: User Interface Designer ,  Roo , I would like to see the user interface c  concept . project manager: And  user interface:  the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis  decisions Sebastian makes . industrial designer: Well project manager: Well , i it should be easy , user interface: Well project manager: that's w w what we concluded . industrial designer: So we drop the voice recognition ? project manager: No no no , we didn't industrial designer: Or project manager: but it shouldn't be integrated industrial designer: Oh . project manager: yeah , it's of course it's user interface , but  i I was talking about really the design of the industrial designer: Okay <doc-sep>And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly . industrial designer: project manager: user interface: industrial designer: Well , I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and  user interface:  . B did you send us an email about this ? project manager: not yet , user interface: industrial designer: project manager: but if you want user interface: Yeah , we we received an email about this  d designs . project manager: Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ? industrial designer: user interface: Ah it's Okay . marketing: I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . user interface: 'Kay , we can project manager: So there are so we have three user interface: So there are three kinds of designs , that's all . project manager: So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? Any any volunteer ? industrial designer: I think our  responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager . user interface: Are you using the you are doing the in industrial designer: Yeah I I'm I'm Well , maybe we have okay so I industrial design . It was a little confusion about my  project manager: user interface: Ah industrial designer: but it's alright . industrial designer: Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done project manager: industrial designer: and what are your ideas about the project manager: About the design or Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ? industrial designer: Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess . industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno I project manager: And of course it should not be very costly . industrial designer: Well I I think that Norman and I would think about  the technical points and  we should discuss it in the next meeting , or user interface: Need to collect information .  , what is most important in a in a remote control ? What is the most important function aspect ?  . project manager: You won't user interface: Or or you can say for example ,  I want  to list all the programme tonight . Y you know , instead of  remote control it's doing the some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . project manager: I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . user interface: No , because no , project manager: S user interface: it's not very a lot . industrial designer: I I think if you want t to choose  from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use  w  I dunno marketing: I'm a okay . marketing:  the main  function of remote control is to have something in the hand project manager: In the hand . marketing: If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog user interface: Yeah . marketing: if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . industrial designer: marketing:  we have some or something , different technology but project manager: This is it's user interface: Yeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that  there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea project manager: industrial designer: but I I think that technically it would be  a little bit   more tricky to to achieve this than just to user interface: No . They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . user interface: And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons . industrial designer: Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to  navigate  through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so project manager: This is good idea . Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? industrial designer: Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen user interface: Good idea . industrial designer: and just  with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f user interface: I think I think that will be revol revolutionary . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: Because all the T_V_  the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . So I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff user interface: Okay . project manager: So we have five minutes to user interface: Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . project manager: Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we industrial designer: user interface: Five minutes . marketing: And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of user interface: Okay . marketing: So , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark  some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . industrial designer: Oh right so user interface: Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: Be before before writing you can  sit and that says what we what we said user interface:  . So so the most functional des  the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . The user can choose w which one they want , right ? industrial designer: Yeah , by content or by channel , user interface: By content or by channel . user interface: Okay , so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content . industrial designer: I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so user interface: Okay . And  industrial designer: I think that's the the things to do user interface: The main thing . user interface: So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get  the funct this is the functional designer ? That's the first aspect . project manager: So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ? And we'll discuss the other other aspects <doc-sep>project manager:  and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that are particularly bothering you ? N user interface:   .  in this meeting I I'm going to discuss about the trend watching ,  how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this . The met methodology to find out the trend was incl  was done in a way We have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey , but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market , because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit . So what are our findings ? In our  in our findings we have seen that when we did our remote control market survey we found that  people l  people do have preference for tho fancy mobi  f remote controls which look and feel very good , rather than having a functional look and feel  good . So we should take into  we should consider this factor as the most important factor , because this factor is twice as important , the second factor which is further ti twice the as important as the sec as  the third factor . So this factor becomes the most important factor in our surv   in our mark  means in take in designing our rem  remote controls . user interface: The last one is the most important one , is it ? marketing: No the first one is the user interface: Oh , sorry . marketing:  the outlook of the mobile , the it should have a fancy outlook , project manager: user interface: Okay . marketing: the fancy design  rather than just having a functional look and feel good , it should have a fancy look and foo feel good . We must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo  remote controls are . So it  should be technologically innovative like glow-in-the-dark or speech recognition , something like that . And the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use , user interface: marketing: there shouldn't be too many buttons on this mobi  remote control , it shouldn't be too complicated  like this way . And it should be  and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language , something . marketing: Y yeah  yeah , we have to , because  d you can see how people have related their clothes , shoes , and everything with fruits and vegetables , project manager: user interface: marketing: because the g world is now changing it's trend towards organic , becoming more and more organic , user interface: Okay . industrial designer: We should make a big sponge lemon , marketing: becoming industrial designer: and then it'd be it would be yellow . marketing: And people  the f feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look , hard look . marketing: So user interface: Okay , the spongy , not real spongy , you can marketing: No it ca y a user interface: Do you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel kind of stuff ? marketing: The rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable that we can take into co user interface: Okay . 'Cause we It shouldn't be have any harm to the environment also , user interface: Okay . marketing: because our company is very well for taking all these concerns into consideration , project manager: Alright , okay . marketing: so we don't want to have any harm to the society , user interface: -huh . marketing: user interface: And were there any factors that weren't important in the survey , that they said we don't want ? marketing: S  we didn't find out any such point . marketing:  yes , there could be , but we couldn't find out any , so project manager: --  so the method , we looked at existing designs , what are the what's good about them , what's bad about them ,  I looked at their flaws , so we're going to look at their flaws , everything . Okay , so most remote controls use graphical interface , where you  have got s buttons and you point it rather than having the output as a a stream of text or something . So I think for our remote control There is some inconsistency already in ec existing in between remote controls , but I think standard kind of  shape and  play and those kind of but buttons like the the top right for on and off or something , project manager: Right , okay . user interface: I think , people find that important,'cause then it's easy to use . project manager: user interface: And we've got some pictures of some  new remote controls to show you . user interface: Do I press Escape F_ five ? Or just project manager:  no just escape should  user interface: Escape , okay . user interface: There's  an L_C_D_ thing , which we thought could I thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us . user interface: This one is got a kind of scroll like a mouse , project manager: - , like the middle button . user interface:  and But I'm not exactly sure how you'd use that , industrial designer: project manager: Ah it's kinda like scrolling user interface: like would the computer come project manager:  right , well , if I s if I'm thinking of the right one , I've got the same thing in front of my monitor , you scroll it and the when you reach the sort of  menu item that you require , you press the middle of the scroll . user interface: -huh , that's like the L_C_D_ one , project manager: Right , okay . user interface: is it ? But the one below that has got like a little scroll function on the side . Again that's just quite boring shape , grey , looks quite space-agey , but too many buttons , I think on that one . industrial designer: user interface: You can put it in there , it's for your kids , and it's quite an organic shape and the little circle around there is pretty cool . user interface: And that's really easy to use , bright , so I like this one lot for our design . project manager: Yeah , I m  the one thing I think about about these ones is  these kl  secured areas  , I've seen a lot of them with the the cover missing .  so maybe that could be built into one of the things and it comes up on the T_V_ or something . And this one , the over-sized one , I don't know about you , but I think it's a bit too gimmicky . project manager:  is that not sort of to assist the blind or something , is it ? user interface: I guess so . I like some of these things  the the raised symbols and everything , but pointing out  that this one the volume it is kind of pressing down , but it would actually go up , because of the shape .  but the buttons on this I think are it's just showing you how you can have different different  buttons . project manager: 'Kay but people tend to recognise certain shapes to do certain things anyway , don't they ? user interface: Yeah , exactly . So we need to combine those ones  industrial designer: user interface: and I've just got an e-mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in . user interface: It's you program it like you say , record ,  and then , play , and then , record , play machine , and stuff like that , so that's And it's much Yeah .  personal preferences just some imagination , the raised symbols I thought were good , the L_C_D_ , it does look smart , but I think maybe for our budget , do you think that would be a bit too expensive to have the industrial designer: The L_C_D_ user interface: Yeah . user interface: And the speech recognition , 'cause I think we're definitely going for the speech recognition , marketing: But in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more , user interface: are we ? marketing: but they want the quality , they want f fancy look , they want some new design , something new . But our budget , we've project manager: It's still it's still got to get within our twelve fifty , you know . marketing: So even if we increase our cost little bit , within  some limits , and we give something new technological advancement as well as new design with fancy outlook , I think we will meet the requirements and we will be able to have a good sales in the market . user interface: I'm not sure if the if for twenty five Euros  per  twelve Euros fifty m manufacturing cost , . I can't see tha Although , th  to be to be sure they have got  they are going crazy with the L_C_D_ technology now , industrial designer: user interface: The L_C_D_ . project manager: so that you've got your L_C_D_ T_V_s and everything so maybe the small industrial designer: project manager: But  like I I the black and white , I guess , it just doesn't look funky enough . industrial designer: project manager:  but , like even mobile phones or whatever have now have colour L_C_D_ screens , user interface: No . industrial designer: But  price price not withstanding  , is it too complicated , is it gonna be too much just overload ? marketing: And the project manager: Twelve fifty . marketing:  i it will be easy because there will be , on L_C_D_ s screen , there will be different frent icons , they can just click ok okay , whatever they wa project manager: Possibly . user interface: Yeah , that's the thing , because industrial designer: But but the thing is when you use a remote control , you never look at it , right ? You're looking at the T_V_ project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: It just seems kind of like a a needless th user interface: And one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use , so I think I'm not sure about the L_C_D_ . user interface: It's a it's great , it's a good idea , but for our budget and for the thing we're trying to go for eas easy to use , it's not the thing we should go for , I think . Child-friendly , I thought this was good , as you pointed out the  the bit , it often goes missing especially with children , but it's a good shape and the organic is kind of we could make a vegetabley kind of round shape , I think . industrial designer: So which vegetable ? project manager: Well  we could make a user interface: Yeah , I know , carrot . project manager: Well , si since we're going for the  the k the sort of company colours , I think your lemon wasn't that far s industrial designer: The the lemon . project manager: And if it doesn't work you know , we've just made a lemon . And the mouse one , I thought it was a good idea , because people use mo mice mouses now with the scrolling thing . So they'd be able to use that  , as I said I think i I'd presume it would come up on the screen . project manager: And that means tha that means you get to bump that bit to the T_V_ maker , so user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: I guess there are a lot of options that we're gonna have to choose from among , project manager: Yeah , looks like it . industrial designer: and I'll I'll give you the  , I guess , technical considerations for those . project manager:  user interface: industrial designer: And I'm gonna use the whiteboard , just 'cause we haven't used it . So , the way I'm gonna do this is  we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls , see how they work ,  reuse the the vital kind of  essential pieces of it , project manager: industrial designer: and then we'll throw in our new innovations  and keep it all within budget . project manager: industrial designer:  you open it up , there's a circuit board inside , project manager: industrial designer:  and there's a a chip , a processor , the T_A_ one one eight three five , which  receives input from the buttons , and ch project manager: So this is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip , is it ? industrial designer: Right , it's very they're very cheap remote .  so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier , which is made of some transistors and amplifiers , op-amps , and then that gets sent to the  to the L_E_D_ light , which I can kinda see is that little red light bulb at the end , user interface:  so this is kind of the the bear essentials that we need to have in our remote control , because it it defines the  project manager: Okay . So can we make them to pretty much any size we like or is there a minimum or ? industrial designer: R  no ,  this is a very old one , so now with the new technology this is a a minimally small and cheap thing to make . So you know , as we said , we got the outer casing , which we have to decide , you know , what's it gonna be ,  the board we have to use basically  the same set-up , processor ,  we'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had , amplifier and transmitter are all standard .  so for the casing ,  this an e-mail I got from our manufacturing team  , you know , we have a bunch of options from wood , titanium , rubber , plastic , whatnot ,  latex , double-curved , curved . industrial designer: what do we think ?  or sponge , I guess , isn't on there , right . project manager: Well ,  like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it , doesn't it . industrial designer: Yeah so project manager:  so maybe s  a sort of  plastic initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath ? industrial designer: Okay so , here are a a plastic ,  latex user interface: I like the rubber , the stress balls , I think , project manager: Oh right , okay . user interface: you know , that could be a bit of a gimmick like it's good to hold and industrial designer: Oh right . industrial designer: and the colour is yellow , right ? user interface: Yeah , project manager: Or at least incorporating , yeah . project manager:  I forgot i we're sort of  I don't know what other standard silver kind of user interface: I think project manager: Other parts or  user interface:  . Yeah , the buttons w like , 'cause there's gonna be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours project manager: user interface: or i if we're having buttons actually , industrial designer: So yellow for the body , user interface: I don project manager:  . industrial designer: and then what colour for the buttons ? project manager:  I quite like the multi-coloured buttons myself . user interface: You do have ones like  play could be green or on and off is red , and stuff like that , yeah . industrial designer: project manager: Yeah or yeah a limit  maybe even just a limited multi-colour so it it doesn't look too childish , perhaps .  if we are gonna make it a novel  double-curved sounds good to me if we're talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use , industrial designer: Okay . industrial designer:  'kay so the shape we wanna go  how exactly ? Maybe double user interface: Like  an hour glass kind of figure , is that what you're thinking of , project manager: Yeah it's  , yeah , that that'd be that's sort of comfortable to hold , easy to hold so you don't drop it . user interface: or just like a It's not industrial designer: What about a banana ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah ? Okay , like we could have a big banana shaped remote control , project manager: Well , yeah ,  like industrial designer: 'cause it's yellow fruit , user interface: industrial designer: right ? project manager: Yeah , yeah . user interface: How would you point it ? industrial designer: Oh i it doesn't matter which end you point , I guess . user interface: What industrial designer: We could have a little L_E_D_s on each end . user interface: industrial designer: marketing: because then this this will help us in our advertisement also project manager: marketing: and we can relate with fruits and vegetables , the people's choices . project manager: Huh ? user interface: y I'm I'm not sure about the banana idea . industrial designer: So a spongy banana re marketing: project manager:  that that th user interface: Rubber banana . And what else did you say about fashions ? What was trendy ? marketing:  the fashion trend shows that fruits and vegetables , project manager: S industrial designer: See marketing: like people  now project manager: And sponginess . industrial designer: So maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable user interface: And spongy , yeah . user interface: Like what's what's that , I don't even know the name of it , some kind of , you know where it's like looks like a little snowman kind of thing . industrial designer: Like a gourd almost , or a squash of some sort ? project manager:  . project manager: user interface: 'Cause that you can hold it in like the bottom bit industrial designer: Yeah , user interface: and industrial designer: and it has a a clear top and bottom so y so you could say , you know , it transmits from this end . Well , I guess it's kind of dra  you don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape , user interface: No . industrial designer: Okay , so double-curved , single-curved , what do we feel ? project manager: Yeah . marketing: Or we can do something , we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey , let the public choose what they want . And buttons would , did we say ?  different shapes of buttons ? industrial designer: project manager:  I l I su  for the specific functions , you know , up and down ,  play , stop . industrial designer: Okay , so project manager: They've got , they've got standard sort of intuitive  industrial designer: so buttons . industrial designer: With the scroll-wheel or no ? user interface: Yeah , what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition ? project manager:  speech recognition , I think , so we need a microphone presumably . industrial designer: Where should I put the microphone ? project manager:  ho h h wel are we sure that scroll wheel does give ease of use ? user interface: Yeah , I'm not sure . industrial designer: Okay , well we can do some user test with scroll-wheels , right ? user interface: I couldn Yeah . project manager: And  I think if this this new software for the sound recognition is the microphone industrial designer: Okay . industrial designer: So should the microphone be just anywhere on it or project manager: I would put it sort of sub-centrally , so it's Yeah . industrial designer: project manager: We really need really gonna need to hold it , if it's gonna be voice recognition . user interface: And  so what else was there ?  the industrial designer: project manager: user interface: What about the glow-in-the-dark thing , the strip around it ? project manager: I s I still like it . project manager: 'Cause  like  if we  how good is the speech recognition thing ? Do we want to go for buttons at all , do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit ? user interface: Then you put it in the fruit bowl ? industrial designer: They can work from a project manager: Yeah , you know , and then you just tal industrial designer: You don't have to hold it . project manager:   some  I user interface: Yeah , do we need buttons ? project manager: l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like  , I dunno , an apple . I quite like the design of that ,  'cause that could sit on its own and it's quite got a quite steady base . user interface:  project manager: user interface: and as we say we n we don't wanna be too ridiculous with the fruit things you know . industrial designer: But yeah , about the speech thing , it doesn't have to be hand held or close . marketing: we can do one thing , we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes , different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece . marketing: So whatever people want , like if somebody want it in banana shape , we will put that casing onto that mobile phone , okay , user interface: In that w project manager: It kind of fi it fits with f fits with marketing  user interface: Yeah , 'cause you said about disposable , marketing: S s sorry ? user interface: didn't you ? You said about disposable earli people want disposable things marketing:  like if this is a like if this is a mobile phone  we will design casing in such a way like half of , we need not to have a full cover , we will just have a half of cover , project manager: user interface: so we could do that , like have a choice . marketing: okay ? If somebody wants it i in banana shape , we will fit banana shape casing onto that , so it will give a banana shape look . marketing: If somebody wanted in apple shape we will design that , we will put we will put apple shape casing on that . user interface: We still need the buttons in the same places thought , marketing: Yeah , button will be on the upper side , buttons will be the on the upper side . user interface: marketing: Yeah , buttons will be on the upper side , lower side we will just put the casing , user interface: Oh , that's the other side . So from lower you can , it means while you are holding of from this side you c you can have banana look or apple look , whatever . marketing: So in that way we need not to d have different different shape mobiles everything , we will just design casings fruit shape . marketing: And project manager: I think tho I think if you're gonna have a facia then you'd want to have it so that it does go over the buttons , user interface: Okay . project manager: 'cause when if you think about it if they're wanting it , 'cause they want to look at it , if they're using it , and what they want to look at is facing away from them . project manager: You know 'cause that'd be in the palm of their hand and they wouldn't be able to see it , user interface: Yeah . project manager: unless you have sort of you got the buttons options on one side , and you get the facia on the other side with a microphone so that you can place it face down . And you've got the facia , and you can just talk at the user interface: industrial designer: Okay ,  so marketing: project manager: So you've narrowed it down to half a dozen options . industrial designer: Yeah , marketing: industrial designer: s I guess we decided on material , right ? So that that spongy latex rubber everything feel , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and the shape , maybe we'll just make it kinda mix and match type of shape or project manager: Yeah . Well ,  because Well , I I'm not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing , because I think we should maybe just take the inspiration from the fruit and  because what project manager: Okay , so we stick with what we've got there . user interface: Yeah , w I think wh wha would we're trying to get to twenty five , thirty five year olds who want it quite trendy as well they said . They wanted something that looks fancy and I think maybe fruit could be a bit of a too much of a gimmick , but something ergonomically shaped and organic , like good to hold , based on fruits and natural things like that , project manager:  'kay . user interface: because al already we're going a bit gaudy with the yellow , you know . project manager: So again  like we could have , we could quite easily have the the main body be a different user interface: Okay . project manager: colour , but have user interface: Maybe we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow with , you said , the logan the slogan . project manager:   e even if user interface: Because project manager:  not necessarily that the  the whole body has to be of the company colour , so you know  blue and yellow tend to go to we well together . project manager: So you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing .  as for the energy source  , you know , almost every remote control uses just batteries , but we don't have to be limited by that .  I don't know what that means , we crank it ? project manager:  It's I think it's basically the more you move i it , it's got a wee thing inside that just kinda powers it . industrial designer: So , this might be an idea for something that people really wanna grab , you can shake it if it's out of power . So if it if it's not working , I guess people's natural reaction anyway is to just shake the thing . marketing: But but do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo , tha these type of cells ? project manager: Yeah . marketing: Because then people have to , well like if the cell is out of bat project manager: It does leave them with an obligation to marketing: Yeah , to mo Yeah . marketing: because most of the people project manager: Then if it's just sitting on the user interface: Yeah , then they have to pick it up and then activate it and then Yeah . marketing: solar power will w also not be a good idea , because then they have to keep m their mobiles outside in solar energy , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: and the days when there is no sola sunlight project manager: I'm I'm with  Raj on that , industrial designer: Okay , so probably just marketing: Yeah . project manager: I think , you know , marketing: What we w project manager: I've got I've got no I've got a north facing house , there's not really ever sun coming in my window . project manager:  I w I w  user interface: project manager: that idea that I thought  just on the basis of like ridding them of batteries and that kind of bother industrial designer:  . project manager: is having a , user interface: And we're a very environmentally friendly company , aren't we as well ? project manager: yeah , marketing: Yeah . project manager: having a rechargeable stand , so that not only it doubles as a stand , but  for using it as  recharging it , but also for using it as sound recognition . What's chip on print ? What's industrial designer:  ? project manager: Sorry , never mind . So the more features we add the fancier chips we need to buy and put in , user interface: So  yes , so the speech thing you said our our techno our research and development department came up with some break-through . project manager: Yeah , and if we if we're just having buttons and the speech then we're getting our cheapest option of chipping . project manager: Okay , we're we're kind of  we're kind of  Excuse m I've just deleted that whole thing . Was that you ? industrial designer: Huh ? project manager:  that was your bit's covered , industrial designer: Oh yeah that was that was it . project manager: and what I would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in clay . project manager:  yeah , I hope I can recover this , 'cause I've accidentally deleted it . project manager: Yeah , can you save that  send that last one again , please , Raj , marketing: Yeah . project manager: as I still can't find it on the marketing:  it was under a different name . project manager: that's that's the that it goes there automatically if you put it in Project Documents . But I cou can't open that , because it w asks  for some username or password . project manager: Yeah , I don't know if y it it just ca it just came up on my  on my agenda .  okay , still didn't manage to get down all the last bits so we had rechargeable and  .  no , I think that's us our discussion over unless anybody's got questions or confusions , marketing: user interface: No I'm good . project manager:   we'll probably get questionnaire in a minute , it's a user interface:  "

        "Query": "Summarize the discussion and opinions on choosing a stylish fruit for remote design.",
        "Summary": "The market research conducted by the Marketing department suggested that the ideal design for the remote should be spongy and resemble a fruit or vegetable. After considering options like banana, apple, and pear, the banana was chosen due to its appealing color and recognizable shape. The Marketing team believed that the current trend of incorporating fruits and vegetables into fashion in Milan and Paris indicated that a remote with a similar style would be both fashionable and technologically innovative. They also considered the pear as a potential shape for the remote, as it is easy to hold and preferred a spongy material for its durability. The Project Manager supported the use of spongy material and prioritized the inclusion of a wheel, as it would set their remote apart from competitors. Additionally, the Project Manager agreed that the banana would be a suitable choice due to its ease of identification.",
        "Article": "project manager: Hello ,  this meeting we are it's fo should be focused on the conceptual design of the remote control . project manager:  the goal of this meeting is to reach a decision at the end on the concept and I think the last time we talked about an a lot and we had a rough idea of what is going to be , but  in th at the end of this meeting we have to to reach a decision . So ,  we will have again three presentation , from all of you , and  I hope it will be fast because I would like to have time to for long discussion and and decisions .  so basically I just want to presented to you present to you some recent results we've had from  looking at   some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world .  the fashion trends we got from talking to our our contacts in the fashion industry based in Paris and Milan .  so f from our market research basically we've come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel ,  as opposed to a functional look and feel , is our number one priority .  and third thirdly the easiness of use is is the  is is important as well , but again two times less important as the technologically innovativeness of the remote control . From our f fashion people in Paris and Milan ,  we've discovered that this year  fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in in clothes , shoes and furniture . marketing:  so in conclusion , we need a our remote control needs to be something that's really fancy ,  has lots of technolog tech technology in it . user interface: marketing: And that it's easy to use and from our last meeting our you know Fabian told us that w you know one of the requirements is that we have to reflect the look and feel of our of th the Real Reaction company . marketing: So  fanciness first and then two ti you know , half as important as that is technology technology , project manager: Okay . So I am going to talk about a little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use . I think  I think the feature easy to use is more important than being fancy , but okay , we can discuss about it  later .  generally , generally  this remote control   should be should be something , in my opinion ,  the first feature is just to be easy to use . So , the more frequent buttons should be larger , they should be placed in a good position   inside the remote control . And  s  I can conclude like this , that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it . It should be we shouldn't need to es open a a t book and  start reading and  learning how to use this  this  remote control . So what I found out that  as I said  I think it's better to put  more frequent    ke  buttons which are used more in the middle of the remote control , and they should be bigger in size . user interface: And maybe  just like some toys , some joystick which is easier to take inside the hand . And  also f   m because because customers doesn't like to buy lots of battery , it should not  consume lots of energy . And my personal p  preference is  , as I said ,  just putting this buttons in a special places and covered some buttons which are not used  that much like settings button , like mobile phone . Usually some mobile phone cover the dialling number part , so we can cover these buttons which are not used or  number buttons for the for the for the can channels , and just put  volume change or s ch can  channel change buttons   in the remote control . And if the user needed to do some more complex task  he he can open the cover and then change settings or something like this . And also  I think if we put some some some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier . For example , a sliding or rolling   d  stuff , if we put it inside then we can easily manipulate with  thumb . And  I dunno but  I think usage of a speech recogn  r recogniser can be good . I know that it consumes lots of energy , but if we do it in some way that it asleeps when there is no sound and when it detects some sound it may consume less energy . And I think it's good because it's something new and usually young people like something new . industrial designer:  okay , so good news from me   for me from Hamed , but bad news from Bob obviously , because spongy design , I don't like it as marketing: project manager: industrial designer: Okay , so could you please , Fabien , open it . I Most of the things I have to write myself on the board , but project manager: This one , yeah . This this is just  one thing I wanted to mention and show you that I just  I just found this , that our company  developed a s a seven f seven fingers or I'll just marketing: Inch . industrial designer: Yeah , seven seven inch T_ T_F_T_ screen , which is good news for us , since we wanted to include a display there . industrial designer: Okay , so the this will be like the overall scheme or overall requirements from the engineering point of view .  first thing is  this will be the overall shape , no  I'm not speaking about the real shape of the device , but the shape of the inside of the device .  the main energy will be taken from batteries that we can   And if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there , we must use additional source of energy , which I found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can  supply everything . I was computing all the all the things related to the speech recognition , and it's okay to use just  two batteries and solar cells , so .  the main board with all the circuits will take at least seven to seven centimetres , so this is my like hard requirement for the guys from the design . It depends where you put your screen , because the screen is  seven inch , so it depends on you where where you put it . Then the graphical card  for the T_F_T_ and the third unit is the I_R_ . The good news is that we can  we decided to use the infra-red unit because our company has also developed the chip for communication by the infra-red , including all the stuff inside , so it will be very cheap for us . So the once again the overall requirements , seven to seven centimetres for the board , which has to be which can be spongy but has to be this size , and the T_F_T_ which is seven inches .  I have to check what I wanted to  from my point of view I don't care about the about the material used for the overall des  ov all the device . project manager: Can you fit any  for example a T_F_T_ or any electronic device in a spongy thing , or is there any problem for that ? For example , put electronic card on a spongy thing , I can I can imagine it could be a problem . industrial designer: A all these things in in  in this box are okay to put in in any shape , basically . Maybe it a good feature , since it takes if it's around the T_F_T_ then it's good , because it's just keeps it safe , project manager: Okay . user interface: Well maybe it can have two shells , a hard shell inside and a spongy shell outside . marketing: This seven inch T_F_T_ screen , industrial designer: Yeah ? marketing: how big is it in reality ? industrial designer: Well , seven to seven inches . industrial designer: marketing:   have we decided that we're gonna use this T_F_T_ screen ? project manager: No , I don't think it's seven by seven , industrial designer: Yeah but project manager: I think it's seven the diagonal is seven . industrial designer: To be honest , I was project manager: Usually when they say seven inch I think it's the diagonal . industrial designer: Yeah , honestly speaking I was thinking that it was seven centimetres initially , marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , no no problem , user interface: industrial designer: because because because then the size of the graphic card will be one fourth . industrial designer: So marketing: industrial designer: Yeah , but no problem to to me to cut the screen . marketing: So , what's the size of the device ? industrial designer: Ah well this is like this is almost nothing . marketing: Even from my perspective seven t seven centimetres by seven centimetres is still industrial designer: Yeah , but we wanted the big buttons and stuff like that , you know . marketing: Is it Can you hold that , or ? industrial designer: Because if it's t too small we can we can lose it , at home , you know . project manager: A sm industrial designer: marketing: But is something that's seven centimetres square e easy to hold ? user interface: industrial designer: W I I think so . I if the roller buttons are on the side you don't have to catch it like that , but just like this , and you know follow follow Well , that's that's no task for me , but well seven to seven at least yeah , project manager: So maybe you can finish your presentation , user interface: project manager: and afterwards we will discuss about all this .  , so I think we have a lot We have to take decision today , so I think we have to do some work to finalise our idea and take decisions .  first I think energy it's a key problem because  it depend what can we have as feature if we use only batteries , for example , or something like that . Because can we have L_C_D_ and speech recognition with battery , and it's also r related to the size of the of the devi of the device ? industrial designer: Not J  just a point to the energy th things . If we use the batteries , and the additional so solar cell , then it's okay for L_  speech recognition and L_C_D_ , project manager: Okay . project manager: but using how many batteries , for example ? Are are what Maybe what is the size of the battery industrial designer: Yeah I was thinking just common A_A_ cells . marketing: So if we use s solar cells ,  where is the sun if someone's watching T_V_ inside ? industrial designer: S  d doesn't need to be sun . industrial designer: Yeah well I I suppose that I suppose that  that this remote control won't be in the in the room like this , where there is light only when when there are people , but . project manager: At least when there is T_V_ you can get light from the T_V_ . industrial designer: Ah it's a it's a compromise , no ? marketing: project manager: At least it's new and maybe technology New technology . industrial designer: Yeah , that's why I wanted to to include the speech recognition , because you wanted all the new things . user interface: project manager: So I think before talking about the other thing , it's important thing it's the case . industrial designer: project manager:  what what are gonna be the size , because its weight drives the other what we are going to use as features and so on . For example for the for the L_C_D_ , if we choose to have a small device , we cannot use this  a such a a a screen . Well what what would you guess as a shape ? Or what what would be the shape ? user interface:  . And I prefer to is it shouldn't have a uniform shape , so in the middle it should be a little bit thinner , maybe maybe . You can take  some some joystick you can take inside hand easier because it's it's designed for your f  taking into account your finger shape and your palm shape . So  seven not seven but let's say five by ten it's I think it's that's my opinion . industrial designer: Yeah , I think it's feasib Well one   How could we do it ? We could put the board next to , well , under the L_C_D_ and for example make the L_C_D_ be totally unrelated to the thing that you hold in your hand . industrial designer: Like holding something , and the L_C_D_ to be just on top of it , you know somehow . I've I s I think the easiest thing would be to to have a smaller L_C_D_ , if it's possible . industrial designer: Okay , so five to ten , I I think it's it's feasible . user interface: but I don't want to now invent something new , because we didn't discuss about it . So using some L_C_D_s we can touch , so we can remove  keys and just  having  , I dunno the name , L_C_D_ responding to fingers . user interface: So But for now if we don't want to use such kind of screens I I think we using a a smaller screen is better , project manager: Yeah . user interface: because project manager: The problem is we have a limit in a month of time , so we cannot do something very new . user interface: project manager: So let's go for a small L_C_D_ . marketing: So industrial designer: Okay , so Yeah , so so just just give me the the the five by ten numbers that you find the best and send it me user interface: A smaller s project manager: Yeah okay .  something easy to use , you said something easy to use but how does that fit in a fashion way , like with fruit and vegetable , and about the colour and logo of the of the company and so on , now , can we do that ? My first idea is because our colour is more yellow , and the it should be easy to take in a hand , I thought about banana , or something like that , which is fruits , and industrial designer: Seven to ten banana . marketing: Well it's it's definitely the obvious choice , with the colour of our company . user interface: marketing:  what other what other fruit and vegetables project manager: But it's just an idea . I dunno what you think about , but marketing: Do you know of any any other fruit and vegetables that are yellow ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: industrial designer: Well , but If it's If it If the banana is big enough . Well user interface: project manager: Yeah , and industrial designer: user interface: I think this is not good . project manager: The screen has to be square ? Or it can be like a a shape , quite ,  with curves . industrial designer: But if it's square then we get four screens out of one by cutting just . But if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches , so . I think that's more important than saving a bit of money on on the T_F_T_ screen . industrial designer: Yeah , m maybe the banana could be like a bit  fatter than than the c c common one . Yeah , it should remember banana , but it's not doesn't have to b to be   really the size and exactly the shape of a banana . project manager: So we are agree with the banana thing ? industrial designer: Well it we'll stick to banana , or ? user interface: Okay . project manager: So , the last point we decided it's infra-red , I guess . You have other thing to add to this point , or  no ? So ,  about the user interface , so we are going to use L_C_D_ . You talked about the buttons on the side industrial designer: Like like peeling of the banana you s user interface: Yeah , peeling of the banana . marketing: industrial designer: First layer obviously spo Yeah , project manager: So industrial designer: w It's it's like silly , but the people will really appreciate it , yeah I think . project manager: Is it is it possible to do that ? It would be a great idea , but is it possible technically ? user interface:  project manager: Like doing a spongy layer of the banana , and you open it . marketing: I think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that , project manager: Yeah . marketing: you know , to manipulate that to hav be a cover that you can pull off and user interface: user interface: Yeah , some Something like a plastic cover covering  some interface , U_S_B_ interface as in the in  digital camera . You open a plastic cover and you see some U_S_B_ interfaces , some some interfaces for adaptor . So keys can be  buttons can be covered like this , with a plastic cover and  when  and when you open this cover it's like peeling a banana . project manager: Yeah , but do you see that as a rigid thing , or like like a banana , something very soft , you can open like banana , or . industrial designer: Well is it possible to make it soft ? user interface: Yeah , yeah , yeah it's a lic like a plastic cover , so . industrial designer: So I think if it's so then it's cool ? project manager: So , I dunno what you think , Bob , but it would be great for users I think , and very good for marketing .  maybe , how can we , if we have a soft thing , like this , and to open it we have to attach it somewhere , I dunno how to do that technically , or . Yeah or a Yeah it can is it can be a plastic cover  sticking to the to the all the stuff like  with magnetic p  magnetic  magnetic  materials in the border , so it's it sticks like refrigerator door , completely . So you you can be sure that it will not be open while you're  while while  you are commonly using  buttons on the banana . industrial designer: Well since since the since the things like the like the screen and  how to say that , solar cell has to be has to be like kept kept in the shape , we cannot b  So we need that the that the peeling  I dunno but we should we should take care of these two two things . So , if if  the solar cell won't be visible while the banana is closed , then the material must be able to put the light inside , you know . So you're saying is it possible to have a solar cell and this removable cover and industrial designer: It is possible , but , well if it marketing: And a and a banana . industrial designer: I dunno how to how to do it if if t if to if it's better to put the solar cell to the t to the peeling or outside it , or or inside . project manager: And something we forgot , maybe ,  about the speech recognition system , are we going to use it , or not ? marketing: user interface: Yes , I think . project manager: So we have the de design , the a good shape , new and so on , user interface:  . marketing: user interface: project manager: And  , yeah , I  I think you should work together , s you  Hamed and Peter , to work  in a in a first prototype , and  more about the shape and so on and how you can manage to put everything together <doc-sep>And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly . industrial designer: project manager: user interface: industrial designer: Well , I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and  user interface:  . B did you send us an email about this ? project manager: not yet , user interface: industrial designer: project manager: but if you want user interface: Yeah , we we received an email about this  d designs . project manager: Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ? industrial designer: user interface: Ah it's Okay . marketing: I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . user interface: 'Kay , we can project manager: So there are so we have three user interface: So there are three kinds of designs , that's all . project manager: So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? Any any volunteer ? industrial designer: I think our  responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager . user interface: Are you using the you are doing the in industrial designer: Yeah I I'm I'm Well , maybe we have okay so I industrial design . It was a little confusion about my  project manager: user interface: Ah industrial designer: but it's alright . industrial designer: Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done project manager: industrial designer: and what are your ideas about the project manager: About the design or Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ? industrial designer: Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess . industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno I project manager: And of course it should not be very costly . industrial designer: Well I I think that Norman and I would think about  the technical points and  we should discuss it in the next meeting , or user interface: Need to collect information .  , what is most important in a in a remote control ? What is the most important function aspect ?  . project manager: You won't user interface: Or or you can say for example ,  I want  to list all the programme tonight . Y you know , instead of  remote control it's doing the some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . project manager: I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . user interface: No , because no , project manager: S user interface: it's not very a lot . industrial designer: I I think if you want t to choose  from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use  w  I dunno marketing: I'm a okay . marketing:  the main  function of remote control is to have something in the hand project manager: In the hand . marketing: If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog user interface: Yeah . marketing: if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . industrial designer: marketing:  we have some or something , different technology but project manager: This is it's user interface: Yeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that  there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea project manager: industrial designer: but I I think that technically it would be  a little bit   more tricky to to achieve this than just to user interface: No . They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . user interface: And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons . industrial designer: Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to  navigate  through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so project manager: This is good idea . Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? industrial designer: Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen user interface: Good idea . industrial designer: and just  with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f user interface: I think I think that will be revol revolutionary . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: Because all the T_V_  the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . So I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff user interface: Okay . project manager: So we have five minutes to user interface: Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . project manager: Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we industrial designer: user interface: Five minutes . marketing: And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of user interface: Okay . marketing: So , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark  some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . industrial designer: Oh right so user interface: Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: Be before before writing you can  sit and that says what we what we said user interface:  . So so the most functional des  the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . The user can choose w which one they want , right ? industrial designer: Yeah , by content or by channel , user interface: By content or by channel . user interface: Okay , so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content . industrial designer: I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so user interface: Okay . And  industrial designer: I think that's the the things to do user interface: The main thing . user interface: So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get  the funct this is the functional designer ? That's the first aspect . project manager: So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ? And we'll discuss the other other aspects <doc-sep>We decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons and we are not decided about u the use of L_C_D_ screen on on the remote control because of costs . marketing: industrial designer: project manager: So you are you saved your y your presentation somewhere ? marketing: Yep . What I found in order of importance from less to more important is that people want an easy to use device . After they they want something new technologic technologically speaking , but the most what they what they find more more interesting , more or more important it's  a fancy look and feel instead of  instead of the current the current trend which was f the functional look and feel . industrial designer: marketing: So now more more cool aspect , ma more a cooler aspect  rather than a device with many functions and many buttons with instead of i instead of ha of a device which can do many things , a device which is pleasant to to watch , to see . marketing:  also Well in in Euro in in Paris and and Milan the user interface: industrial designer: marketing: in Paris and in Paris and Milan the the current trend of  of clothes , furniture and all this all this fashion it's it's fruit and the the the theme is fruit and vegetables . marketing: And also in the in the U_S_A_ the the current the mor the most popular feeling it's it's a spongy . marketing: So maybe we should we should think in in this direction , so user interface: What what do you mean by fruit and vegetables and spongy ? marketing: user interface: What you mean clothe industrial designer: Spongy means it it's like sp marketing: Fruit vegetables is the the new have you seen the last exposition of clothes in Milan ? user interface: No , I missed that one . marketing: Yeah , I I didn't miss an project manager: user interface: industrial designer: marketing: I didn't miss and I saw that the fruit , there are many fr pictures of fruits and vegetables in the clothes . user interface: Oh , they're okay so they're not like dressed as a carrot they just have like pictures of fruit on , okay . user interface: So we're not gonna have a remote control in the shape of of a banana , marketing: So te textu textures , yeah . industrial designer: But what's your suggestion how we can have some shape like that on the remote ? project manager: Well so this is in the next slide certainly . project manager: It's not ? user interface: marketing: It's user interface: So which fruit are you thinking of ? marketing: And  . project manager: industrial designer: marketing: I ha I haven't thought of any particular fruit , but the general aspect of the of the remote control may may could remind some kind of vegetable , some kind of instead of vegetable , some natur   natural object or something . marketing: But yeah it it depends on the project manager: So maybe you maybe you can display a banana on the L_C_D_ . user interface: Oh , so you want the remote control to be the shape of a fruit , project manager: user interface: or you want just some kind of like fruit logo on the industrial designer: Means buttons are in the shape of fruits , marketing: Yeah maybe the shape the shape industrial designer: buttons are in the frape shape of fruits or something , apple , banana , something like that . marketing: No , not n not not too much focus , not too much focu not n not too s not too similar to a fruit because next year the ten the trend the trend will be different . marketing: So we shouldn't be at re really attached to to the trend user interface: So something that looks half like a fruit and half like an elephant . user interface: But okay , marketing: user interface: I'm not , I'm not really sure if  that would really appeal to everyone though , maybe just to fashion gurus , like maybe just like a little bit n a little fruit picture somewhere in the corner , but I don't know about  I dunno how ergonomic a , an orange is . I think in my opinion we should focus on on young people because they are more open to new devi new devices user interface: To fruit ? marketing: and also yeah according to the marketing report ninety p ninety five percent of young people was was was able to to buy a a n a cooler remote control . user interface: But is it  is fruit cool ? marketing: What ? project manager: That's a question . marketing: What ? user interface: Is fruit cool ? marketing: Yeah ?  Is the new trend of the user interface: Well I guess , you know , Apple has the iPod so , imagi marketing: user interface: just 'cause they have an apple on their on their product , doesn't mean fruit is cool . marketing: No I think we we should think about a a shape with it a device with a shape of some user interface: Okay , but it has to be easy to  to use though and to hold you know , you don't wanna pear or a watermelon . Don don't you think we can find  the shape of a fruit which is handy to use ? user interface: Well , probably the only thing is a banana that I can think of , industrial designer: Banana . project manager: user interface: So , but  you also have to you have to also have , fit r all the buttons and you know . user interface: The thing is you have t normally with  with buttons , they have to be at some point attached to a circuit board so if you're gonna have things like on a cylindrical kind of device it may be difficult to kind of to build . marketing: Yeah but I li I like your idea that we shouldn't have a lot of buttons b buttons so project manager: Okay . Yeah and you you you will not have pla enough a lot of place to put a L_C_D_ on a banana also . marketing:  do you want a an L_C_D_ with twenty five Euros ? project manager: Well , you're the Marketing Expert you should tell us if it is too much or not . user interface: Well , this is marketing: I think Well , according to the to the report people are more interested in in a fa fancy look and feel and in a technological inno in innovation , project manager: marketing: so , I will give more importance to the look and feel than rather than the project manager: So So you you you suggest to go f marketing: new inputs and also it's I'm not convinced about this L_C_D_ because you need  internet connection , you need more things , it's not just buying a new control re remote , you need buying control remote , buying  project manager: Okay . project manager: you're simply looking s to a remote control that looks like a banana with few buttons with only a few buttons . So I received an email  around lunchtime letting me know that the brilliant minds at our technology division had developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit ,  which is a way for you to have a conversation with your coffee machine and or remote control . industrial designer: But it's just a speaker right ? user interface: It's no , what it is , it's it's very industrial designer: It's not a microphone . user interface: It has a has a microphone , has a speaker , it's got a little chip and it allows you t industrial designer: Actually I'm not reading microphone there , so that's why you can all have conversation , it just to speak to you . It means that it can recognize , it can do like a match on a on a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back a phrase in response to that . user interface: I guess you could build that in , you could you could link the the recognition of a certain phrase to some function on on the remote control . user interface: But basically the thing is , we have this technology available industrial designer: In-house . user interface: but the thing is obviously there's still gonna be a cost if you decided to integrate that because you still have to pay for the c production of the components , industrial designer: - , user interface: so  it it but it basically means we c we can kind of consider this from  you know  a theoretical or usability kind of viewpoint without worrying too much about you know how to develop it because we have this already done . user interface: Whilst you know , some people might get annoyed if we  if we just dump it , project manager: I there's something that I unclear really understanding . Is this a technology that recognize keywords speech keywords ? user interface: It's it it's no , well , it's it'll recognize  I guess keywords , but you know keywords in a certain order like a phrase . You train it for a certain  , for a certain phrase , you say the the example they said that they have  up and running with their prototype is  well they've actually integrated into the into the the coffee machine that  that we're producing is , you can say good morning to the coffee machine and it can recognize that phrase and it'll playback good morning , how would you like your coffee ? project manager: And it's just to , it's just to playback something ? user interface: Yeah . So actually that was a bad example , 'cause it doesn't actually ask how do you want your coffee because it can't really understand the response , so . user interface: Only , like , only in the sense that it it can recognize a set a set target kind of word an project manager: Yeah . user interface: It's designed it's designed as a fun kind of thing , project manager: Yeah yeah . user interface: but I guess you could use it as  as a way to implement  project manager: So it it's c  it it marketing: Yeah but you can u project manager: it is a   easy  a fancy thing that you you can bring to we can bring to the remote control that will not have any  user interface: Completely pointless yeah . project manager: yeah comp completely pointless for the inter for from the interaction point of v point of view . user interface: marketing: Yeah but the can we use it for saying okay , channel fifty , channel twenty ? user interface: Well yeah , that's the thing , if you can but you have to pro though I think it's a fairly simple design so you would have to record into the device every possible combination , you have to s tr train it to l to learn channel fifteen , that whole thing , not just the word channel and the word fifteen , it doesn't have that kind of logic in it . So this is so this is this is much more than tak taking this technology , bringing it to the remote control and using it . So if if if it is something that you can we can bring easily and to put it into the banana remote control user interface: Yeah . user interface: I  I I I don't think it's worth it though , I think it doesn't really add much to the functional design and it's it's it's not mature enough to use as a speech recognition engine , so project manager: Okay . So if we can just move on to the next slide , I've just done a quick mock-up of   some of the features of our potential funky-looking  remote control marketing: project manager: It doesn't look like a banana at all . user interface: Well , you see , I was I was unaware at this point of th of the fruit focus , project manager: Yeah . project manager: But you you can fit i you're saying now you can fit it to marketing: Looks like a tr look likes a a tro a tropical fruit . user interface: Yeah , well , this is actu this could be a genetically engineered fruit that's designed to be you know square so that it packs tighter in the boxes . user interface: But  , I've just indicated here , we could have actually two scroll wheels , 'cause I think the scroll wheel is a fairly  key part of , you know , industrial designer: Stable thing , that's right . To have , user interface: I think everyone has has agreed that it's that it could be quite a useful  thing , so . user interface: But I think it's important , you know , to have two scroll wheels because , you know , you want one for for the channel , but you also want one for for the volume , project manager:  . user interface: because it's it's the volume i it's , you know it's very handy for it to have  instant kind of  feedback  and response , so . user interface: But  , I've also included this turbo button because I think , you know , every design should have a turbo button , and well marketing: What's a turbo button ? user interface: so this is you know , a unique problem with with televisions is that if you have this scro this scroll wheel for the television , the  the tuner on the T_V_ is not gonna be able to to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll , so you know , the th the person might want to have a  Might want to be able to scroll past television stations without seeing what's on them , in which case it just waits until you stop scrolling and then , you know , displays that station . Or they might want to scroll and and have a quick glimpse of it , even if it lags behind what they're doing . marketing: It con it controls the speed ? user interface: Yeah , so with this turbo button you can , say , skip over t channels if  , you know , if I'm if I'm going if I'm scrolling past them and you know , it's  , you could have a little red light that comes up when they press it so they feel you know it's really going fast or whatever . project manager: user interface: So yeah , that's  , those are the two important  features I think we need on the remote , industrial designer: You know , i it could be , you know , if we if we wanna have like a very cheap kind of device , we could either consider that maybe we want to sell this as a very , if it's gonna be a banana , you know that's a pretty gimmicky kind of thing that doesn't have that much functionality , it's just you know a couple of scroll wheels and a button cause it's hard to get so many buttons on a banana project manager: It's enough . user interface: and it's still very it may even be for most for some people more functional than their current remote , but if they have these scroll wheels , so ,  you know , what other buttons do we want ? industrial designer: user interface:  we could have well , I guess you need an on and off switch , project manager: Switch on . user interface: but you could you could o you could turn it turn it on by taking the top off the banana maybe , you know , it's kind of like a spy kind of flick thing . project manager: So i it looks like we're going completely to forget about the L_C_D_ thing . user interface: Well , that's the thing , as have we decided that we can only spend , twenty five Euro ? project manager: I think that user interface: Well not spend , but you know , charge twenty five Euro . project manager: We can't use that to to comman co communicate , industrial designer: Communicate . project manager: it's just a thing marketing: Yeah , but we can say channel twenty five . marketing: No ? user interface: But then you have to have a template for every channel , for a hundred channels , you have to be able to to recognize industrial designer: Well , I f I think it's probably more than , than our can handle because it's designed for a coffee machine , you know , to say hello in the morning . Is it design for a coffee machine ? user interface: Well that's its current application , I would presume that it's kind of , they wouldn't design it to handle a hundred things th so . project manager: You want to g to move to your slides ? user interface: But  industrial designer: Yeah , that's right , yeah . project manager: You're finished ? user interface: Well I just I just made the point , I don't I don't know if that speech recognition is , you know , even if we can do it , I think it's not really appropriate for  television environment . user interface: But  I did have one thing from a previous meeting , you were talking about  being able to find the remote control marketing: Yeah . user interface: and I was talking about extendin being able to extend the remote control by having you know , a base station that can control other things as well . user interface: It might be useful to have some kind of base station , even if it's just you press on a button on it and  and the remote control starts beeping , you know , this is a way of finding the remote . user interface: Y in that case maybe the maybe the speech recognition the speech thing could be useful just to say I'm here project manager: Exactly yeah . user interface: but  it's probably a bit of overkill if you could just have a a beeping industrial designer: So it's a speech synthesis kind of thing , user interface: It's speech industrial designer: something has been  stored and it's just  spoken out . user interface: It's it's speech synthesis and s it's speech kind of , not really speech recognition , but kind of pattern matching , yeah industrial designer: So I was of the idea that we can have two kind of power supplies , one is the usual batteries which are there , they could be chargeable batteries if there's a basis station kind of thing and on top of that we can have solar cells , when the lighting conditions are good they can be used so it'll be pretty  innovative kind . Then  we need plastic with some elasticity so that if your if the remote control falls it's not broken directly into pieces , there should be some flexibility in t user interface: I guess that fits in with the spongy kind of design philosophy . Then controls for the traditionals u traditional users we can have the push buttons so that they don't feel that it's an alien thing for them . user interface: So , just one second , when you say double curve , what do you actually mean ? You reckon you could like draw us a thing on the , on the whiteboard 'cause I'm not sure industrial designer: Double curve is , you have curves on both the sides if I'm right . user interface: Okay , but like , kind of convex or concave ? industrial designer: So , it could be curve , so it could be convex , conve concave , depending on what what we want . industrial designer: These are the three things , and there are different materials , with plastic you can have double curve but with  certain other materials we cannot have double curve . So there there was  there were many other materials like wood , titanium and all those things , but plastic is I think is the most appropriate one , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: it'll bring the cost down user interface: Although , you know , wood could be  quite a stylish  option , industrial designer: and anyway it's user interface: if you take like , nice quality kind of wood that's got a nice grain and you kind of put some , some varnish on . project manager:  but i but there is no elasticity which could be industrial designer: Wooden cases user interface: Well it depends , you have the outs the wood itself is not gonna break so you don't have to worry too much about the case being broken , project manager: Yeah but the components inside . Yeah but inside you know you could have you can still have some kind of cushioning that's not visible to the to the user . project manager: And also  user interface: And  you could also , you can have just a very thin veneer of wood as well . user interface: That's true , but are we set on the banana idea ? industrial designer: project manager: Well it look like marketing: Actually project manager: it looks like you are all targeting that marketing: I was thinking that the user interface: project manager: yeah ? marketing: the shape of a banana is not it's not really handy . marketing:  I don't know the name o o in English  This industrial designer: Is it an e apple which has marketing: it's not a fruit it's a vegetable . user interface: Ah yeah , marketing:  user interface: is it what's it in French ? project manager: Poivron . marketing: Oui c'est ca user interface: Yeah , okay , so capsicum or pepper . project manager: But  they do d marketing: And it's al it also suits with the double curve for easy of project manager: Yeah . user interface: I don't know , it seems a little bit kind of bulky to me , like project manager: Yeah . marketing: No ,  in a project manager: It's not re it user interface: like with a banana you can have project manager: you you think it's really fancy and fun ? You think that young people that are marketing: I'm sure it's fun . More than a banana ? marketing: But banana is not so handy , user interface: Well industrial designer: Banana is more handier as compared to this I think , and to capsicum . user interface: But like a banana you can you can be holding like this and have the scroll wheel kind of on top project manager: Yeah . user interface: and just roll it back and forth like that , project manager: It's kind it's kind of it's more  user interface: but with  I don't know how you would hold a capsicum and project manager: it's really ergonomic , it's fit in the hand and you've a lot of surface to to put the controls . industrial designer: Okay , so push buttons for the traditional users so that they don't feel they are alienated , just and a scroll button with push technology for channel selection , volume control and teletext browsing . These are the three scroll buttons which are already available with us in the company and we we can go ahead with that . Then  there are different kind of chips , one one is the basic chip and the regular chip and one an adva advanced chip . And  regular chip supports speaker support , so this functionality could be used for tracing the mobile phone which has been misplaced . user interface: So is that , when you say speaker support , you mean it just has some output pinned which which which kind of industrial designer: It could be a beep kind of thing . user interface: Okay , but the speaker is actually attached to the to the chip in some way , or is just the the signal ? industrial designer: Yes , yes , that's right , it's it's onto the chip , user interface: Okay . So are there any issues where we place this this chip to make sure you can actually hear the the speaker from the outside of the banana ? industrial designer: That will be the volume control I think which which a user shou it it should be already pre-defined . Yeah , but the speaker , if the speaker is actually on the chip , then if it's too far away from the the casing , or if the casing is too thick , then you may not hear the the speaker . industrial designer: As or as hearing is concerned , we can have some gap at some place , user interface: Yeah . So that's something we have to keep in mind with the actual physical design is to keep the the speaker close enough to the outside . And  these were the findings which I I saw with the web web , that user wants to have control more than one device wants to control more than one device from the same remote control , so our T_V_ remote can have little extra things to support additional devices like V_C_R_ D_V_D_ players which are usually attached with the T_V_ , because users are like this and they don't want to have one remote control for everything , so with this additional little , we might be having slightly better market for us . user interface: Although , if It depends , if we like , if we are concentrating on like a fruit design , then maybe maybe we wanna sell a collection of fruit , you know , like a different fruit for each device . user interface: Cause that , you know , that sometimes people like to collect  you know things that of a similar type . marketing: I think that would be funny at the beginning but after one month you will be tired of be surrounded of fruits . user interface: project manager: industrial designer: And  as well as I could see on the web the scroll button is becoming really  hot thing s project manager: Okay . user interface: Well marketing: Actually I I didn't understand very well this trace speaker lost control . Now let's say marketing: So you you have to buy two things , the banana and the basis station . industrial designer: It's like a telephone handset is there and the basis station for the telephone hand set is there . So now what user gets additionally he doesn't have to buy batteries , they're rechargeable batteries , so over the period of cor time he'll recover the cost . So you're having the basis station and there is a button , if you press that button wherever the remote it'll start beeping so you know where the remote is . user interface: I think it's kind of people would find that worth it even if it wasn't  a recharging station , even if they didn't have to buy extra batteries , you know . industrial designer:  this is basis station is nothing more , just it's a wire which is coming from the main cable and  you're having one socket on which the thing sits . user interface: Although you do need to include R_F_ kind of circuitry in the remote . Anyway , we are not using really advanced technology , L_C_D_ has already been ruled out , A_S_R_ has been ruled out . I'm just wondering actually , 'cause , you know , I this whole fruit thing with the banana , it's  it seemed like it first seems a bit kind of  niche , like only a few people would really want a banana , industrial designer: And user interface: but what if it was kind of  a stylised banana ? You know , rather than having it kind of you know yellow and really looking exactly like a banana , you could make it kind of silver . And  , you know to give you kind of the idea of a banana but without it looking you know completely kitsch . user interface: Well , you know , I don I don't know how many peop industrial designer: marketing: project manager: If you make something that looks like a banana it should have the colour of a banana . No , I I industrial designer: A yeah , otherwise it'll be mis means you don't get b any feeling then . industrial designer: It's neither a banana nor a user interface: Yeah , like this colour this colour Maybe , you know , maybe like still in the shape of a banana .  , but you know , just maybe maybe not exactly the same texture as a banana and just kind of , you know because the thing is it's gonna be a little bit difficult to make  to give like the texture of a banana anyway and to k to have the exact shape . I think if you're gonna not be able to do it properly you may as well do it in a stylised way that just looks a bit more kind of , you know , twenty first century rather than sixties or seventies . Before before st before ending the meeting I'd like to to draw some sketch about the pro future prot prototype . project manager: Well no , not not you , you can finish your slides before industrial designer: Okay . Anyway , users'll be so the findings is users'll be very interested in our locator device to find their misplaced remotes . user interface: project manager: So I I propose that you go to the whiteboard user interface: Yeah . project manager: and we're going to report all the ideas we had we had during this these presentations just to draw some sketch about what will be the prod final product user interface: Okay . project manager: and  where Superman go banana and  user interface: project manager:  extra func functionalities such as wheels ,  the speaker unit  well not in order not to lost the  the device , industrial designer: project manager: I do I don't remember you call it ? industrial designer: That's right . user interface: Yeah , so , I guess you wanna hold like the way the end of the banana you wanna kind of hold as ma you maybe wanna kinda hold like a gun rather than 'cause you don't want it to point kind of towards the floor . user interface: So you know , so if you have like marketing: What about what about this shape ? More or less . project manager: I if it i if it has really the model shape of a bana you could marketing: Yeah , but how many buttons do we need ? project manager: the the starting is good but it could it should have more the shape of a banana if you want to point really a at the thing . If you don't want to to to do that movement which is which is difficult if you don't have to do it in fact , it's better . So ti time is running , industrial designer:  what about a project manager: we have to we have to we have to to move forward . user interface: So project manager: We have a a basis  , how do you call it ? industrial designer: The base station . user interface: okay , so I guess we need , you know , something that can fit a banana shaped object . user interface: Okay , so it's  project manager: So we that means we need a button on th on the on the basis . So we are going to add  also  you as you suggested the whee some wheels to control the volumes and channels and your tur turbo turbo  button . Yeah , which I think it's it's probably best actually on the on the underneath of the the device , industrial designer: Turbo button . user interface: so you have project manager: And the and the wheel a a at the level of the thumb for instance . user interface: So yeah , you need one one here and one on on the other side , so you got volume an and channel . project manager: Oh , just the switch , industrial designer: Remotes don't have power on off switch . They are not going to cost you much , everything is in-house and now you don't want the traditional users to be apprehensive of this . user interface: Well , I dunno if the traditional user is gonna buy a a banana remote in the first place , you know . user interface: Y  you need to kind of keep it  industrial designer: But you know our targets are very high , means fifty million Euros is the profit which we want make . marketing: What about user interface: Yeah , how many of these did we wanna sell ? I can't remember , industrial designer: Twenty five . marketing: user interface: Yeah , but how many units did we need to to sell ? industrial designer:  forty th four . project manager: The next step is to go for to f is to go to  to building a prototype , based on this , okay ? user interface: Okay . You have to  work on the look and feel  design and you have to work on the user interface , in fact you two you have to work together to model the first  f first prototype . user interface: project manager: Okay ? marketing: I wo what about adding the this word spotting , keyword spotting recognition saying volume up volume down ? project manager: It's too difficult . marketing: It's too difficult but people like innovation and that's really  innovative and I don't know if it would cost a lot , just a few five words . project manager: It's not a possi it will not be possible to implement it for the next prototype , so t it's in the next prototype so let's skip it . project manager: Yeah , maybe , for the n if if if it it works well , we'll go for  an orange one "

        "Query": "What is the final conclusion on the discussion about the criteria of ease of use, learnability, and intuitiveness when evaluating the product?",
        "Summary": "The Project Manager and Industrial Designer had a discussion about the second layer of the remote, with the Project Manager expressing concerns about its complexity, but the Industrial Designer reassured that users wouldn't need to pay much attention to it. The group unanimously agreed that the scroll wheel was superior to average remotes, giving it a score of two on this criterion. They also agreed that the remote scored highly in terms of locatability, initially assuming it would be intuitive. However, the Industrial Designer mentioned that it might take some time for people to get used to the scroll wheel as it was a new technology. The Marketing team believed that its usage was obvious. As a result, the group decided to give an average score of five for this criterion.",
        "Article": "industrial designer: Is there any time for a cup of coffee ? user interface: We have a slight problem . project manager: Sorry ? industrial designer: Can I get a cup of coffee ? project manager:  no . project manager:  then  the three of you  prepared a presentation , I think ? Sebastian ? industrial designer: I think so too . user interface: industrial designer: project manager: Then we'll do your one   as la  the last .  the top goal of this m user interface: But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe . project manager:  the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group  and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind .  the new project requirements , first of all ,  we didn't speak about it , but we should not  support teletext in the remote ,  because our b  board  feels that  teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext .  the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not  f  feasible , it's not  w user interface: Yeah . project manager:   we we cannot make it because of the time to market  that we have to deal with . project manager:  the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than  forty , which is important for you ,  Ruud , and as well for  Roo .  then for Roo , as well  important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product .  the individual presentations , I th  Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ? user interface: Yeah , I'll start .  the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . user interface: Then I found  two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function  remote control with many possibilities , but  the lack of the feeling I already mentioned  in the previous  discussion . user interface: And the ease-of-use remote control with  the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . My personal preferences were ease of  the easy to use remote control , because  the user-friendliness and  it can be more trendy in in user design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not  in our design . But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is  the best  possi possibility for us . project manager: Okay , so marketing: project manager: the important thing here is user interface: And it's also i indeed   Ruud's  insight in the in the topic . project manager: Yeah , okay , w we will s we all  user interface: Just for  for user desi  user  friendliness I  should choose for the the ease of use remote control .  well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . user interface: industrial designer:  basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by  sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to  implement a picture here , user interface: Energies and  industrial designer: but it's hardly readable . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using  infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . It's almost every piece of equipment  every piece of  every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . And I think that's what we w user interface: The glow in the dark  concept  we discussed . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . industrial designer: and I think we should  we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . industrial designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared , because  otherwise our device cannot  communicate with  almost every T_V_ set . And  if we want to use  a rechargeable design or  a energy-save design , we should really implement them .  for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost  circuit board ,  because most of the production cost are are in this  part of the equipment . industrial designer: And  the money we save on using this we can use  for elaborate fancy lighting  techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . user interface: And what's the  industrial designer: I think our  users will really  will really like that . user interface: if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or industrial designer: No , they're p f  power friendly LEDs also . user interface: For the same costs , it's can be  in our industrial designer:  no , they're  they're a little bit more expensive , but by    making user interface: Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's  industrial designer: We can we can make its I think . project manager: Yeah , but but the question is whether  two or four buttons makes  m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to  include fancy lightning techniques , I guess . user interface: Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , marketing: true . Well , it's not one light , it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . project manager: Okay well , industrial designer: project manager: we ar we are very curio curious to what the market  will feel about such a product . marketing: But  since  the other part is  forty percent of the market , I  thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . The buttons to zap are used the about  fifteen hundred times , when  the power button is only used one time . So user interface: Yeah , well it should just have a design The perfect design for those only those buttons . Just one thing I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? industrial designer: Well marketing: Yeah , that's  a problem . project manager: Well industrial designer: Usually project manager: maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , user interface: It should be   project manager: like  turning on and off the the the lights . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a  kind of weird sound , and your  remote controls then start to beep . project manager: But  th user interface: But but T_V_s don't have all   buttons . marketing: And you project manager: Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home  user interface: But I believe you will have an marketing: Yeah , and usually industrial designer: We do not control the T_V_ set so well . marketing: And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button ,  you would have to walk to your T_V_ , industrial designer: Yes , m yes . S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , marketing: and it's project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so we should think about project manager: So what about the clapping technique ?  because you se user interface: I'm convinced  Sebastian will  find  one solution for us . marketing: And b project manager: Well , you see it a lot in in light  lightning   industrial designer: Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics  the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , project manager: Yeah , a peak . industrial designer: But there are many other sounds  which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . industrial designer: Yes , user interface: But we can have just   a home stat  f a base station next to the T_V_ . user interface: Well if you lost th industrial designer: Well , project manager: Well  industrial designer: is there not something f something more easily user interface: I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . user interface:  that's just  industrial designer: No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and  b  perform a a some kind of  . You do not want another device , which can be  everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . project manager: Yeah , m maybe  w we  we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . project manager:  maybe Sebastian should have  a detailed look later on and  come up with a solution , industrial designer: But  before I do that I w I want to warn you that  by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated project manager: And there are some implepe imp user interface: And do we even  prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning  function ? industrial designer: Well , I I think so , because  when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . user interface: It's a unique item  project manager: Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . project manager: and  I think  it's worth   looking and and probably more i interesting than  than the lights . user interface: And just about  the user interface , I came up with  an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . marketing: Well , t  we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function . project manager: Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players  and all kind of stuff . user interface: So industrial designer: we should save costs  by not implementing a lot of functions and  the money that we can save from that we should use for  having a nice design and  thinking about the user interface project manager: Yeah . Okay , industrial designer: and project manager: Ruud , how do you feel about that ?  do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to  a simple marketing:  well if we  include other  innovative functions  then they  might , project manager: user interface:  just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated ,  because it has many functions . industrial designer: Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very  friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but  nevertheless project manager: But but are we not in in the in the manual   if you have few buttons , no display ,    I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and  one button can  industrial designer: Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . project manager: But but how does how does the remote  report  r  give back to the user w in what state it is ? user interface: Yeah , I don't know yet . There's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . project manager: I know , but but if we use  like a stick , for example ,  industrial designer: W When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe  a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just  pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t  turned up the volume . marketing: And if you use that stick for volume control and channel  selection , you have the m two most important functions in one  button . user interface: But does it  I then should n just use  i instead of the stick ,  like many cell phones , just a round m well , project manager: Yeah , draw draw it on the board . Oh user interface: It's just an easy  way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . user interface: A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down project manager: Yeah , it can break down . marketing: And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it  attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . project manager: Okay , but w we still we're still in the question of    putting in advanced options .  we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , I think . user interface: Yes ? project manager: We need to  have the  the user function  the functions decided and   our target audience . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ?  which  incorporates all function available on the device ? project manager:  well , I do not want a full  it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want  the kind of functions , for example  th the most important are volume and  programme selecting . l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but user interface: Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to  two channels , when you have  something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can  change industrial designer: project manager: Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last  Mielsen . industrial designer: but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . project manager: And and do we want  the ten digits ? user interface: The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so . industrial designer: Well , are are you sure ? marketing: Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . industrial designer: but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think but you should  shou you should know that . industrial designer: Okay , user interface:  and I think the most industrial designer: I can imagine when project manager: I agree actually . user interface: Just elder elder people would would buy it , industrial designer: I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . marketing: Well user interface: but industrial designer: But if you're  a regular T_V_ user , and you just want  to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can  you can use  about ten buttons . industrial designer: Well , marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: but how how often do you watch all these channels ? marketing: and if if we And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . Don't you think ? project manager: Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the industrial designer: The design . marketing: Well project manager: You c you can d make them very fancy marketing: And project manager: by   Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . industrial designer: Okay , so you can experiment by  with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .  it might be expensive and  hard to implement , but it would be a solution  for project manager: Okay , speech . industrial designer: So  when you add  speech recognition to your remote control ,  it's very easy to change  the channel . industrial designer: So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . project manager:  If if we would  drop the ten digits industrial designer: But maybe when we  project manager: but keep the programme and the volume , industrial designer: It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find  find the remote control button  remote control function . industrial designer: There are some  hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . industrial designer: So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . project manager: But But but can we manage it bu  for the costs ? industrial designer: You have to do nothing for it . marketing: And  if we if we could inc  include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be  a big problem . marketing: 'Cause when project manager: Is a cradle very cheap ? industrial designer: It's Oh , it's very cheap .  I would like to hear  maybe maybe you all have th  things not  spoken about , yeah , but that are important .  are there other things about the market we should know ? marketing:  I think we dealt with the most important information . project manager: Sebastian ? industrial designer:  I just want to make a summary of all all things  spoken and  the different possibilities . So on the outside it looks easy , but  we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by  implementing  speech techniques ,  voice recognition , that these kinds of things .  there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement  fancy techniques , which  I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about  the the costs and  the things like  battery lifetime , energy saving . industrial designer:  another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons . If we just add   a chip which does the voice recognition ,  our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another project manager: Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board industrial designer: well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . user interface: But the cheaper the ch  the the chip or th what was it ? industrial designer: project manager: No , it's th industrial designer: The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . user interface: Well it then we should just  take a look at the costs and  especially for the voice recognition . project manager: I'm not sure how how we'll f  determine the costs , I will have a look at it . project manager:  I'm not sure how how that industrial designer: Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will  have a lo  look at it . project manager:  I'm don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out . project manager:  then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work ,  and I'm sure your personal coaches will  assist you with it . project manager: User Interface Designer ,  Roo , I would like to see the user interface c  concept . project manager: And  user interface:  the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis  decisions Sebastian makes . industrial designer: Well project manager: Well , i it should be easy , user interface: Well project manager: that's w w what we concluded . industrial designer: So we drop the voice recognition ? project manager: No no no , we didn't industrial designer: Or project manager: but it shouldn't be integrated industrial designer: Oh . project manager: yeah , it's of course it's user interface , but  i I was talking about really the design of the industrial designer: Okay <doc-sep>Then  I've I will also take notes during this meeting and I will send you  a summary then as usual . We will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by  our two colleagues that make good work . industrial designer: marketing: project manager: And  then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product . And  end with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits with it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not . project manager: d let's start with the cost aspect so so I look at the aspect discussed last time , that is to say  to have a standard battery , to have a yellow banana shaped  case with  a rubber material around it industrial designer: project manager: to be  to feel spongy , user interface: Like a banana . project manager: So for the financial aspect it's okay , we can  we can continue with this product  as if , marketing: project manager: and we are now going to see the project evaluation with  our marketing expert . marketing: So I made an evaluation and the the evaluation criteria is made according to the users' requirements and the market trends we talked about  during the previous  meetings . marketing: So we we want to have a product fancy look and feel , technologically innovative , easy to use , fashion , easy to find in a room , and robust , project manager: Yeah . marketing: and  according to what you think about the this project you can   make a one point , two point or seven point . marketing: The okay ?  so  fancy look and feel , what do you think ? project manager: Okay . user interface: Do you vote  Christine ? marketing: eh ? user interface: Do you also vote ? marketing: No , I just want to see something project manager: Maybe we all have to agree on a common user interface: Well , we can very easily . So user interface: marketing: Need to project manager: this is your marketing:  I don't know if you we ha we have to put  one  f If it's better or project manager: One is most . project manager: How much would you give on the fancy aspect , on the fashionable aspect ? marketing: Six  s you can how much what ? project manager: How much would you you don't answer to this  questionnaire ? marketing: Oh yes I  I dunno  , I think six , it's a good  user interface: So it will have five point five average . project manager: Four ? industrial designer: A four also , because , except for the wheel , we don't have so much innovation . I I user interface: D are we including the voice are you glu are we including the voice in the end or not ? Huh ? project manager: No . project manager: Four ? So we have four , four f and five ? marketing: We can put four ? user interface: Yeah . Is it fashion ? project manager: Oh yeah , user interface: project manager: its its f its fruit fruit shape . marketing: Yeah it's fashion , because it's a fruit , user interface: Yeah , we can we can put a seven here . marketing: We have the lightning , or project manager: Yeah , we have the marketing: The lighting . project manager: we don't sesh especially have the lightning user interface: So you'll make the material transparent project manager: but marketing: user interface: so that it  lights up completely , or project manager: So it's yellow . project manager: I think it's very easy to marketing: Seven ? project manager: I would say seven . marketing: Is it is it robust ? project manager: Yeah , it's rubber , made of rubber , industrial designer:  f yeah , it's ru it's rubber . user interface: Yeah the only problem there might be which know , i if it's very sensitive , project manager: Yeah . user interface: I don't know project manager: But it is  it is surrounded by rubber material .  if we say that seven it's  it's the better , project manager: Yeah , the be . industrial designer: user interface: Yeah , the top marketing: and when  s six sit six are good it's a good  p product , I think . user interface: Because I saw  some phones that were banana shaped ,  wireless phones not mobile ones , wireless for the house , marketing: project manager: Yeah . user interface:  quite big also , marketing: user interface: and they were selling something like a hundred Euros , two hundred Euros . project manager: I think the industrial designer: But almo also the complexity between a phone and a remote control is not cannot compare . user interface: it's much more complex , but project manager: So , I think , we can summarise . We we have the cost below  our threshold and so we could sell at twenty five Euros and make i make profit . marketing: project manager: So the cost is in the budget , the evaluation is okay , so I th I think we can now  open champagne and make a huge party . user interface: project manager: I don't know if it's provided by  by the meeting staff . user interface: So what does the management say ? project manager: Sorry ? user interface: What does the management say ? project manager: I think we will have  much bigger project next time and a much bigger salary as well <doc-sep>The what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently . project manager:  then industrial designer: project manager: then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against . user interface: project manager: Then I need to say some st a few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria .  and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits .  and then we  will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through . S marketing: And then do we get to make a remote control ? industrial designer: project manager: 'Cause we missed out . project manager: So industrial designer: project manager: it's now I guess that we're supposed to start at fifteen thirty five , so we've got until four fifteen . How how much do we have , forty minutes ? project manager: Is that right ? user interface: Yeah , about four fifteen , yeah . Do you want user interface: So , you said  are are we starting with the the project manager: Yes . user interface: so will you maybe start with like the  the shape and things and and then I will explain the the user interface th  things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and industrial designer: Okay . project manager: user interface: marketing: You think bananas are a safe thing to use ? project manager: industrial designer:  marketing: It's a bit  phallic . project manager: Does it vibrate when you press the buttons ? industrial designer:  so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again . project manager: And it's the whole thing's made of rubber , is that user interface:  yeah . marketing: Is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ? user interface: Yeah , . user interface: yeah , but  one thing we actually kind of  forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder , industrial designer: Yeah , user interface: so we said the back side round , yeah . marketing: and then the whole shape's curvy , so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable . project manager: user interface: So so  the user interface as as we discussed last time   on on the on the cover we just have the very basic things . user interface: So we have that n  channels here starting from   one two three there would be numbers in in the on the actual one . user interface: So it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here . It's it's quite standard  place for it and and also the colour is quite often red , so it's it's kind of user friendly . user interface: And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and like the previous one and the next one . user interface: And and we would also have a l little  thing saying here , previous and ne prevon prevon next . user interface: On the side , marketing: Ah , you did get that in then , user interface: this one . user interface: And and and it's it's on the back is  cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here . user interface: See ? So the volume is you just scroll , but then once you flip it open , okay , there there you have the screen project manager: Yeah . user interface: You can move back and forth and then if you need to m choose something on the screen , you just push the cen  the middle button . project manager: Y or you could have it so you on the wheel if you marketing: On the wheel , like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute . industrial designer:  on the L_C_D_ we r you know , the main menu will have various options . user interface: Well , but the but the mute yeah , the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute , right ? project manager: But if you hold it in , industrial designer:  . marketing: Yeah , but it's a scroll and click , isn't it ? project manager: if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in ? marketing: Okay , cool . user interface: So I think it project manager: And it's with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours . user interface: Yeah , I think  we could do l the logo in grey , as it is on the website . industrial designer: project manager: user interface: project manager:  it's a sort of intermediate colour , I guess . project manager: industrial designer: marketing: I hate Play-Do , it's just minging . project manager: I suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues , but  we'll se I'm sure we can get around them somehow . marketing: industrial designer: project manager: We'll just send all of our manufacturing to some nice poor country industrial designer: project manager: and cut some of the prices that way . marketing: so one is , you know , yes , it totally meets with that requirement and seven is , no , it really doesn't , we need to go back and start again . Basically , what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them .  you know , so that we can evaluate each one and like so it was about going back to the start and saying oh yeah , we did manage to do that , or oh no , we really forgot about that . Is that right ? marketing: Yes , I did have A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ down here , but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points . But if you can imagine that they say A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ , then that would be really good . marketing: Well , I thought we'd  kinda said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the T_V_ ? project manager: Yeah , just prepare one now . What do you all say ? industrial designer: So ? project manager: I reckon it user interface: S seven was th the maximum , yeah ? marketing: Yeah . Okay   what I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in . project manager:  we can if we industrial designer: I can I can take note   marketing: If you take a note of them , and then I'll put them in in a minute . marketing: Okay , so we're all agreeing on seven for A_ ? project manager: Yeah . Does it match the operating behaviour of the user ? industrial designer:  the the only thing that we were considering was that  this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people , project manager: I think it does .  industrial designer: so if you're left-handed you're kind of left  scrolling with your finger . user interface: so y so we we might do we might want to do like a  another m model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one . project manager: 'cause you don't always have all left-handers or all right-handers in a family . industrial designer: So bu it's it's not a huge problem , marketing: I th I think it's not it's not like it's a pen . user interface: But then then I think left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway , project manager: Yeah . user interface: so they just marketing: Yeah , but  because it's not like it's a pen , you know , left-handed people can't normally write right-handed , user interface: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , because  anyway , right-handed people would be able to scroll with it , marketing: Yeah . user interface: so i if the majority are right-handed , it's  project manager: marketing: So  that does kind of negate the whole R_S_I_ issue . marketing: So maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation , maybe give it a five , I would say ? project manager:  marketing: What do you what do you all think ? industrial designer:  . user interface: Or maybe six , because it's just one one i one among the issues , project manager: Yeah , I think I think for  user interface:  . project manager:  most people are right-handed , so in in terms of our greatest target group , I think it's pretty good , but we might want to flag it for management , they want might want to  user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up , right , project manager: They industrial designer: so it opens on the side . industrial designer: So you guys can decide wh whether user interface: it will be and it will be it won't be heavy . user interface: Yeah well yeah , project manager: The length is gonna be difficu user interface: but it's it's a bit long . marketing: But you were thinking about making it smaller , yeah ? industrial designer:  this this kind of  makes it more project manager:  . marketing: So it works like a mobile phone flipping , but y you know , as long as that side's flat , than that will work . Are are we admitting defeat on C_ or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the T_V_ ? industrial designer: No , we have a locator . project manager: No , we're gonna put it like we've got th there's the locator dot . Cool , so that means you need a that does mean you need a little speaker on it though , user interface:  that you stick on T_V_ . user interface: Yeah well w but l but the speak sample speaker is included , so it it has some capacity to  to do some to make some sounds , so yeah . If   if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things project manager: Yeah . user interface: and it's I th I think it's project manager: I'd say six , 'cause the  the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you've got it . marketing: Yeah , and  d industrial designer: And  even the scroll , it's a it's a new technology project manager: So industrial designer: so m m might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni project manager: Might be industrial designer: so it is kind of not very intuitive but  it's a good technology ,  once they get used to it . project manager: But it and it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon . marketing: So , should we maybe say f a five industrial designer: So l marketing: and say it is intuitive , project manager: Five ? marketing: but it's different , so , do you know ,  it's obvious how to use it , project manager: Yeah . It has taken a little while , hasn't it ?  intuitive but Sorry , it's really hard to write on those . marketing: I just went a bit mad , didn't I ? project manager: marketing:  okay , cool , E_ , okay .  I would guess this comes back from this whole B_ thing links in here , so possibly for left-handed . user interface: but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , so it's kinda industrial designer: Yeah , I I think it is ergonomic . marketing: I used to send fifty texts a day , you know , project manager: Well we've banned them from marketing: and I never got repetitive strain injury from that , project manager: industrial designer:  yeah . industrial designer: And moreover it it has  L_C_D_ and everything , project manager: Yeah . marketing: Hang on , how come it's showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there ? That's just project manager: Ah , that's the second one . So you must have changed it on this one where it's got score , but not on the previous slide . industrial designer: Anyway it ha yeah , user interface: Technologi well industrial designer: it's the most sophisticated remote that I ever seen . Well  we have we have the sample speaker as well , which is yeah , it's kind of new . marketing: Yeah , but  you don't project manager: All of the components have been used in other things before . marketing: They're never been used i they've never been using remote remote control before I don't think . project manager: What do you reckon , five , six ? marketing: Yeah , what do you all think ? user interface: Six . marketing: Six ? user interface:  how how far can you go with a remote control , really ? project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: marketing: Well , that's it ,  user interface: It still has to do what i what it has to do . industrial designer: marketing: Yeah , but  everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really , hasn't it ? project manager: marketing: So , I don't think many peop project manager: Space remote . user interface: Yeah , isn't it fashionable ? project manager: industrial designer: The carrot banana remote . marketing: So , we give it seven , and we write user interface: Fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days , so . user interface: What's the assessment ? marketing: So , we need the average here , so we got user interface: The average is about six and something . marketing: So we've got four sevens , user interface: No , wait , a little bit under six . project manager: Fifty one , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight . project manager: Six point point industrial designer: Fifty one divided by user interface: Six point something , yeah . project manager: Now wait until we get to finance and then we'll see if we can afford it . marketing: project manager: That's all you've got at the moment , or did you have anything more ? marketing:  no , that's it , project manager: That's it ? marketing: yeah . marketing: user interface: project manager: Computer no signal ? industrial designer:  I guess it'll have to wait for a bit . project manager: It could be marketing: Yeah , but rubber comes coloured , doesn't it ? You know . project manager: it's I would maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it's different . user interface: Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it , project manager: Yeah , let's leave it as zero , 'cause it's easy . project manager: We we're definitely going to have to user interface: We have pushbuttons , industrial designer:  . project manager: so we've got pushbutton , and then we've user interface: scro we have scroll wheel as well . project manager: Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ? industrial designer: No  we we have  yeah . user interface: Yeah , but what do we ha we have L_C_ display , but but the wh but the s spinning wheel project manager: But the the spinning wheel's not there . I have think maybe it's integrated with the L_C_ display ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: We've got more than one pushbutton though , user interface: Okay , let's yeah . project manager: marketing: haven't we ? project manager: I think the pushbutton oh . marketing: 'Cause then you have project manager: I don't know if that's one marketing: That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it ? Not counting anything , we'd still be in budget . industrial designer: Huh ? project manager: Push what  industrial designer: Wh wh what is the limit ?  . project manager: whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we user interface: We have to count all of them , or yeah . industrial designer: No it says what what is the kind of interface , marketing: Well it doesn't , but it  project manager: No . industrial designer: if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five , it's a scroll wheel so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and L_C_D_ display , project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , the sample sensor will have to go , 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there . marketing: But that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really , isn't it ? industrial designer:  and the locator also goes away . marketing:  does project manager: What else does it need ? user interface: Well the speaker  the sample speaker is is expensive , but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps . project manager: Yeah , 'cause the sample speaker was , I think , more complicated then just a beeping thing . project manager: Yeah , okay , so we industrial designer: A also i in the case I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface , because it's just rubber , so it's probably a flat surface rubber . marketing: See , I was gonna say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing , 'cause project manager: Take it down to just a scroll wheel . We could do industrial designer: So tha that mean that we cannot press how do we how do we make a selection in  in the L_C_D_ ? user interface: Yeah , then then we would be in the b budget . industrial designer: If in the L_C_D_ we can scroll , right ? But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button . user interface: Yeah b no no , you can push this one , but we don't have a pushbutton  we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing . industrial designer: it's it's the scroll wheel and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing . That's the spin wheel though , isn't it ? Didn't that come with the L_C_ project manager: That's with the L_C_ industrial designer: That comes with the L_C_D_ ? marketing: Yeah . marketing: Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether project manager: It's nothing n marketing: and just have pushbuttons for the volume . project manager: Yeah , marketing:  the scroll wheel's pretty cool , but project manager: I have industrial designer: Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here , up for up and down . Oh look , we're way under budget and we'll make huge profits and we'll all get bonuses . marketing: Yeah , well we could admit to the single curve , couldn't we ? industrial designer: project manager: Or or that we have to have some sort of special colour . project manager: and then I'll take I can send it back to management and say we weren't quite sure about the colour , if that costs extra then we've still got some space for it , industrial designer: We have , yeah . industrial designer: Because we keep all the features , we keep voice recognition , we keep L_C_D_ display . marketing: We just got rid of a gimmick that was never anyway , industrial designer:  yeah . marketing: and the scroll wheel is  essentially the two buttons that was it's not a great difference I don't think . user interface: But yeah , it's it's not like sample speaker , but it will just beep , so we still have the locate . industrial designer: project manager: Tha user interface: Which colour , the the colour of the phone or the colour of the industrial designer: marketing: Oh the the beeper thing . project manager: 'Cause we we won't have run out of our pot of Play-Doh .  we need we've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting , so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went ,  so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product . project manager: Feedback ? Ideas ? user interface: Yeah  , as far as creativity is concerned , yeah I think there was there was room for creativity . The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had . industrial designer: I think  n one thing that was lacking  was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with . marketing: If we'd had that sheet at the beginning should've been like , okay , so we can have that lot , let's just throw it together and do what we can . project manager: But in terms of the process of  going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting , that that worked in terms of . marketing: so you didn't st go off and think , wouldn't it be great to have a vibrating remote control shaped like a banana , project manager: industrial designer: marketing: and then , you know , come back three days later and Jen's going look , look , it vibrates and it looks like a banana . That would just be so cool , to d do all your notes and s project manager: Yeah , you could take it to lectures and just write stuff down industrial designer: Yeah yeah yeah , project manager: and have it printed out when you got back to the office . industrial designer: that's it's it's project manager: They great ? industrial designer: I wonder what one of these costs . project manager: Do you think they'd notice if one went ? marketing: I don't think you should say that was the recording . project manager: But that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint , 'cause the I find that the problem with PowerPoint often is that it's so static and you can't change it once you're in there , marketing: It is a bit limiting , isn't it ? industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the marketing: Yeah . marketing: you didn't have the whole whooshing thing , 'cause there wasn't time for that , so yeah . We could make some little user interface: But yeah , but  already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting , yeah . marketing: Are we supposed to say nice things about Jen now ? industrial designer: project manager: And presumably you don't you can say nasty things as well . project manager: Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to say their bit ? user interface: To express them   industrial designer:  . user interface: pretty novel solution for a for a remote control really , all this flipping open thing and project manager: Yeah . marketing: I don't know , I don't go shopping for remote controls that often , maybe somebody's already though of it . user interface: Yeah , neither neither do I , project manager: user interface: but I've never seen anything and and none of my examples were was was like this , actually , so . industrial designer: project manager: user interface: Yeah maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one . marketing: I think we'd like to think the ideas were new , project manager: Banana remote . Vibrate user interface: marketing: Yeah , but that would just come up with like other things really wouldn't it . project manager: well within budget , including a little what have we got ? One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee . Were there any was there anything that you found difficult , or anything that didn't go as smoothly as you'd hope ? user interface: And my main difficulty was the the time pressure . industrial designer: I thought that was good though , because if you're given too much time then you got nothing to do with your time and  yeah . project manager: We've got about five minutes left , but if we've finished , then we've finished . industrial designer: We certainly are , project manager: and you should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time . marketing: project manager: It was very productive day and marketing: We could draw animals on the board again . industrial designer: user interface: Oh , you don't like anim marketing: It's just minging . project manager: Right , so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it . industrial designer: Was there a questionnaire already sent ? project manager: I don't know if it's already sent or not . project manager:  presumably I have to marketing: Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now ? project manager: I don't see why you can't stay here , really "

        "Query": "What were the professor's thoughts on latencies, VAD latency, and the breakdown of latency?",
        "Summary": "The professor expressed satisfaction with the improved model, attributing it to lower latencies. He believed that the effort put into developing a good Voice Activity Detection (VAD) was worthwhile. In order to determine the latency added by the VAD, the professor suggested running the process in parallel. Additionally, the professor informed the team that the maximum latency was still unknown. PhD C provided an explanation of the delays caused by various factors, including a 100ms delay from silence probabilities, a 40ms delay from delta at the input, and a 10ms delay from LDA filters. The professor criticized the insistence on using a flawed system and emphasized the need for straightforward solutions. He emphasized the importance of keeping the lag short for the task at hand.",
        "Article": "professor c: OK , what are we talking about today ? phd b: I don't know . phd a: Oh , this was the , talk where they were supposed to try to decide phd b: To to decide what to do , phd a: Ah , right .  , so  , let 's let 's assume for right now that we 're just kind of plugging on ahead , phd b: Yeah . professor c: because even if they tell us that , the rules are different , we 're still interested in doing what we 're doing .  , well , we 've a little bit worked on trying to see , what were the bugs and the problem with the latencies . phd d: To improve phd b: So , We took first we took the LDA filters and , we designed new filters , using  recursive filters actually . professor c: So when you say \" we \" , is that something Sunil is doing or is that ? phd b: I 'm sorry ? professor c: Who is doing that ? phd b: us . phd b: So we took the filters the FIR filters and we designed , IIR filters that have the same frequency response . phd b: So they had two filters , one for the low frequency bands and another for the high frequency bands . And the low frequency band has sixty - four milliseconds of delay , and the high frequency band filter has something like eleven milliseconds compared to the two hundred milliseconds of the IIR filters . So we have the filters but we still have to implement a routine that does recursive filtering professor c: OK . phd b: and professor c: You you had a discussion with Sunil about this though ? phd b: No . professor c: right ? So so you need to discuss with him what we 're doing , phd b: Yeah .  , I yeah , I don't know if th that 's what they were trying to They were trying to do something different like taking ,  well , using filter that takes only a past professor c: Right . I think that the the fact that we we did that with had that thing with the latencies was indicative of the fact that there wasn't enough communication . Well , there is w one , remark about these filters , that they don't have a linear phase . phd b: Well , I don't know , perhaps it perhaps it doesn't hurt because the phase is almost linear but .  , and so , yeah , for the delay I gave you here , it 's it 's , computed on the five hertz modulation frequency , which is the mmm , well , the most important for speech so . professor c: So that would be , a reduction of a hundred and thirty - six milliseconds , phd d: The low f f phd b: Yeah . professor c: which ,  What was the total we ended up with through the whole system ? phd b: Three hundred and thirty . professor c: So that would be within ? phd b: Yeah , but there are other points actually , which will perhaps add some more delay . Is that some other other stuff in the process were perhaps not very  perf well , not very correct , like the downsampling which w was simply dropping frames . phd b: so we will try also to add a nice downsampling having a filter that that professor c:  - huh .  , because wh when when we look at the LDA filters , well , they are basically low - pass but they leave a lot of what 's above twenty - five hertz . phd b: and so , yeah , this will be another filter which would add ten milliseconds again . phd b: yeah , and then there 's a third thing , is that , basically the way on - line normalization was done  , is just using this recursion on on the  , on the feature stream , professor c: Yeah .  , and when we look at this filter actually it has a delay of eighty - five milliseconds . If we want to be very correct , so if we want to the estimation of the mean t t to to be well , the right estimation of the mean , we have to t to take eighty - five milliseconds in the future . We would be at six so , sixty - five , plus ten , plus for the downsampling , plus eighty - five for the on - line normalization . So it 's professor c: phd b: plus plus eighty for the neural net and PCA . phd b: So it would be around two hundred and forty so , well , professor c: Just just barely in there . phd a: What 's the allowable ? professor c: Two - fifty , unless they changed the rules . phd a: What were they thinking of changing it to ? professor c: But phd b: Yeah . professor c: well the people who had very low latency want it to be low  , very very very narrow , latency bound . professor c: Unfortunately we 're the main ones with long latency , but phd a: Ah ! professor c: But , phd b: Yeah , and basically the best proposal had something like thirty or forty milliseconds of latency . professor c: Yeah , so they were basically  , they were more or less trading computation for performance and we were , trading latency for performance . And they were dealing with noise explicitly and we weren't , and so I think of it as complementary , that if we can put the phd a: Think of it as what ? professor c: Complementary . professor c: I think the best systems so , everything that we did in in a way it was it was just adamantly insisting on going in with a brain damaged system , which is something actually , we 've done a lot over the last thirteen years . So , w th w this was a test that largely had additive noise and we did we adde did absolutely nothing explicitly to handle ad additive noise . And , we did this , RASTA - like filtering which was done in the log domain and was tending to handle convolutional noise . So , the , spectral sub subtraction schemes a couple places did seem to seem to do a nice job . And so , we 're talking about putting putting some of that in while still keeping some of our stuff . I think you should be able to end up with a system that 's better than both but clearly the way that we 're operating for this other stuff does involved some latency to to get rid of most of that latency . To get down to forty or fifty milliseconds we 'd have to throw out most of what we 're doing . And and , I don't think there 's any good reason for it in the application actually .  , you 're you 're you 're speaking to a recognizer on a remote server and , having a a a quarter second for some processing to clean it up . professor c: These aren't large vocabulary things so the decoder shouldn't take a really long time , and . phd a: And I don't think anybody 's gonna notice the difference between a quarter of a second of latency and thirty milliseconds of latency . What what does wa was your experience when you were doing this stuff with , the the the surgical , microscopes and so forth .  , how long was it from when somebody , finished an utterance to when , something started happening ? phd a: we had a silence detector , so we would look for the end of an utterance based on the silence detector . phd a: And I I can't remember now off the top of my head how many frames of silence we had to detect before we would declare it to be the end of an utterance . phd a: but it was , I would say it was probably around the order of two hundred and fifty milliseconds . phd a: So professor c: Yeah , so you you so you had a phd a: this w professor c: so you had a a quarter second delay before , plus some little processing time , phd a: Right . professor c: And there 's physical inertia there , so probably the the motion itself was all phd a: And it felt to , the users that it was instantaneous . professor c: Yeah , so you would think as long as it 's under half a second or something . A person I don't think a person can tell the difference between , you know , a quarter of a second and a hundred milliseconds , and I 'm not even sure if we can tell the difference between a quarter of a second and half a second .  , basically if you yeah , if you said , \" what 's the ,  what 's the shortest route to the opera ? \" and it took half a second to get back to you , phd a: Yeah . phd a: because when we talk to each other we tend to step on each other 's utterances . So like if I 'm asking you a question , you may start answering before I 'm even done . Well , anyway , I think we could cut we know what else , we could cut down on the neural net time by by , playing around a little bit , going more into the past , or something like that . phd a: So is the latency from the neural net caused by how far ahead you 're looking ? professor c:   professor c: And there 's also well , there 's the neural net and there 's also this , multi - frame , KLT . phd a: Wasn't there Was it in the , recurrent neural nets where they weren't looking ahead at all ? professor c: They weren't looking ahead much . And and then But you also could just , we haven't experimented with this but I imagine you could , predict a , a label , from more in the past than in than than in the future . phd a: but I don't think professor c: Yeah , but we 've but we played a little bit with with asymmetric , guys . So , that 's what that 's what you 're busy with , s messing around with this , phd b: yeah . And , phd d: Also we were thinking to to , apply the eh , spectral subtraction from Ericsson phd b: Yeah . professor c: phd a: What is the advantage of that ? phd d:  phd b: Well , it 's that by the for the moment we have , something that 's discriminant and nonlinear . Well , it 's it 's a linear transformation , that  professor c: So at least just to understand maybe what the difference was between how much you were getting from just putting the frames together and how much you 're getting from the discriminative , what the nonlinearity does for you or doesn't do for you . Actually what we want to do , perhaps it 's to replace to to have something that 's discriminant but linear , also . And to see if it if it improves ov over over the non - discriminant linear transformation . professor c: Yeah , well , that 's what I meant , is to see whether whether it having the neural net really buys you anything . professor c: But maybe it 's just the discrimination and and maybe yeah , maybe the nonlinear discrimination isn't necessary . But the other part you were saying was the spectral subtraction , so you just kind of ,  phd b: Yeah . professor c: At what stage do you do that ? Do you you 're doing that ,  ? phd b: So it would be on the  on on the mel frequency bands , phd d: We was think phd b: so . professor c: OK , phd d: Yeah , professor c: so just do that on the mel f phd d: we no nnn We we was thinking to do before after VAD or phd b: Yeah , phd d: Oh , we don't know exactly when it 's better . phd b:  phd d: Before after VAD or professor c: So so you know that that that the way that they 're phd d: and then phd b:  . professor c: one thing that would be no good to find out about from this conference call is that what they were talking about , what they 're proposing doing , was having a third party , run a good VAD , and and determine boundaries . professor c: The reason for that was that ,  if some one p one group put in the VAD and another didn't , or one had a better VAD than the other since that they 're not viewing that as being part of the the task , and that any any manufacturer would put a bunch of effort into having some s kind of good speech - silence detection . It still wouldn't be perfect but  , e the argument was \" let 's not have that be part of this test . \" And so , I guess they argued about that yesterday and , yeah , I 'm sorry , I don't don't know the answer but we should find out . So ,  Yeah , so there 's the question of the VAD but otherwise it 's it 's on the the ,  the mel fil filter bank , energies I guess ? phd d:   professor c: And you 're you 're subtracting in the in the in the I guess it 's power power domain , or or magnitude domain . phd b: and professor c: if you look at the theory , it 's it should be in the power domain but but , I 've seen implementations where people do it in the magnitude domain phd b: Yeah . professor c: I have asked people why and they shrug their shoulders and say , \" oh , it works . professor c: and there 's this I guess there 's this mysterious  people who do this a lot I guess have developed little tricks of the trade .  , there 's there 's this ,  you don't just subtract the the estimate of the noise spectrum . phd b: so you have the estimation of the power spectra of the noise , and you multiply this by a factor which is depend dependent on the SNR . phd a:  ! phd b: When the speech lev when the signal level is more important , compared to this noise level , the coefficient is small , and around one . But when the power le the s signal level is  small compared to the noise level , the coefficient is more important . And this reduce actually the music musical noise , phd a: Oh ! phd b:  which is more important during silence portions , phd a:  - huh . professor c: Well , that 's  , that 's what differs from different different tasks and different s  , spectral subtraction methods . phd a:  ! professor c: if if you have , fair assurance that , the noise is is quite stationary , then the smartest thing to do is use as much data as possible to estimate the noise , get a much better estimate , and subtract it off . professor c: But if it 's varying at all , which is gonna be the case for almost any real situation , you have to do it on - line , with some forgetting factor or something . phd a: So do you is there some long window that extends into the past over which you calculate the average ? professor c: Well , there 's a lot of different ways of computing the noise spectrum . So one of the things that , Hans - Guenter Hirsch did ,  and pas and other people actually , he 's he wasn't the only one I guess , was to , take some period of of of speech and in each band , develop a histogram . And , in fact I think the NIST standard method of determining signal - to - noise ratio is based on this . phd a: A couple seconds ? professor c: So No , no , it 's based on this kind of method , phd a:  . Now , if you have signal and you have noise , you basically have these two bumps in the histogram , which you could approximate as two Gaussians . professor c: So so basically now you have this mixture of two Gaussians , you you n know what they are , and , sorry , you estimate what they are , and , so this gives you what the signal is and what the noise e energy is in that band in the spectrum . And the other thing to do is which is sort of more trivial and obvious is to , determine through magical means that that , there 's no speech in some period , and then see what the spectrum is .  , a variant on that for just determining signal - to - noise ratio is to just ,  you can do a w a  an iterative thing , EM - like thing , to determine means only . professor c: And then you just use those mean values as being the the ,   signal - to - noise ratio in that band . phd a: But what is the it seems like this kind of thing could add to the latency . Cuz if you don't look into the future , right ? phd a: OK , well that I guess that was my question , professor c: if you just yeah phd a: yeah . professor c: if you just if you you ,  a at the beginning you have some phd a: Guess . professor c: esti some guess and and ,  phd b: Yeah , but it professor c: It 's an interesting question . I wonder how they did do it ? phd b: Actually , it 's a mmm If - if you want to have a good estimation on non - stationary noise you have to look in the in the future .  , if you take your window and build your histogram in this window , what you can expect is to have an estimation of th of the noise in in the middle of the window , not at the end . So professor c: Well , yeah , phd b: the but but people professor c: but what does what what what does Alcatel do ? phd d:   grad e: Pretty stationary , phd b: but ,  professor c: Well , the thing , e e e e grad e: yeah . professor c: Yeah , y  , you 're talking about non - stationary noise but I think that spectral subtraction is rarely is is not gonna work really well for for non - stationary noise , phd b: Well , if y if you have a good estimation of the noise , professor c: you know ? phd b: yeah , because well it it has to work . professor c: But it 's hard to phd b: i professor c: but that 's hard to do . So so I think that that what what is wh what 's more common is that you 're going to be helped with r slowly varying or stationary noise . professor c: If it varies a lot , to get a If if to get a good estimate you need a few seconds of speech , even if it 's centered , right ? phd b:   professor c: if you need a few seconds to get a decent estimate but it 's changed a lot in a few seconds , then it , you know , i it 's kind of a problem . professor c: imagine e five hertz is the middle of the of the speech modulation spectrum , phd b: Mmm . So , phd b: So in this case , yeah , sure , you cannot professor c: Yeah . phd b: But I think y  , Hirsch does experiment with windows of like between five hundred milliseconds and one second .  and he worked on non - stationary noises , like noise modulated with well , wi with amplitude modulations and things like that , phd a: Were his , windows centered around the phd b: and But  , yeah . professor c: No , I understand it 's better to do but I just think that that , for real noises wh what what 's most likely to happen is that there 'll be some things that are relatively stationary phd b: Mmm . professor c: and other things where it 's not so stationary and  , you can always pick something that that falls between your methods , phd b:  . professor c: but I don't know if , you know , if sinusoidally , modul amplitude modulated noise is is sort of a big problem in in in practice . professor c: I think that it 's  phd a: We could probably get a really good estimate of the noise if we just went to the noise files , and built the averages from them . phd b: What What do you mean ? professor c: Just cheat You 're saying , cheat . phd b: But if the if the noise is stationary perhaps you don't even need some kind of noise estimation algorithm . phd b: We just take th th th the beginning of the utterance and professor c: Oh , yeah , sure . phd b: Well , everybody seems to use some kind of adaptive , well , scheme professor c: But but phd d: Yeah . phd b: is it very useful professor c: you know , stationary phd a: Very slow adaptation . phd b: and is the c phd a: th professor c: Right , the word \" stationary \" is has a very precise statistical meaning . But , you know , in in signal - processing really what we 're talking about I think is things that change slowly , compared with our our processing techniques . professor c: So if you 're driving along in a car I I would think that most of the time the nature of the noise is going to change relatively slowly . If you if you check it out , five minutes later you may be in a different part of the road phd b:   But it 's it 's i i i using the local characteristics in time , is probably going to work pretty well . professor c: But you could get hurt a lot if you just took some something from the beginning of all the speech , of , you know , an hour of speech and then later phd b: Yeah . professor c: so they may be you know , may be overly , complicated for for this test but but but , I don't know .  , if possible you shouldn't you should you should make it , the center of the center of the window .  , phd a: If they 're going to provide a , voice activity detector that will tell you the boundaries of the speech , then , couldn't you just go outside those boundaries and do your estimate there ? professor c: Oh , yeah . So I I imagine that 's what they 're doing , right ? Is they 're they 're probably looking in nonspeech sections and getting some ,  phd b: Yeah , they have some kind of threshold on on the previous estimate , and So . Yeah , so , they h they have an estimate of the noise level and they put a threshold like six or ten DB above , and what 's under this threshold is used to update the estimate . It 's like saying what 's under the threshold is silence , professor c: Does France Telecom do this phd b: and grad e:  . professor c: Does France Telecom do th do the same thing ? More or less ? phd b: I d I Y you know , perhaps ? phd d: No .  , maybe we can talk about a couple other things briefly , just , things that that we 've been chatting about but haven't made it into these meetings yet . So you 're coming up with your quals proposal , and ,  Wanna just give a two three minute summary of what you 're planning on doing ? grad e: Oh , two , three , it can be shorter than that .  , but I 'm , looking into extending the work done by Larry Saul and John Allen and  Mazin Rahim .  , they they have a system that 's , a multi - band , system but their multi - band is is a little different than the way that we 've been doing multi - band in the past , where  Where we 've been @ @  taking  sub - band features and i training up these neural nets and on on phonetic targets , and then combining them some somehow down the line , they 're they 're taking sub - band features and , training up a detector that detects for , these phonetic features for example , he presents  , a detector to detect sonorance . And so what what it basically is is ,  it 's there 's at the lowest level , there it 's it 's an OR ga  , it 's an AND gate . So , on each sub - band you have several independent tests , to test whether  , there 's the existence of sonorance in a sub - band . And at the at the higher level , for every if ,  The higher level there 's a soft OR gate .  , so if if this detector detects  , the presence of of sonorance in any of the sub - bands , then the detect  , the OR gate at the top says , \" OK , well this frame has evidence of sonorance . \" phd a: What are what are some of the low level detectors that they use ? grad e: And these are all Oh , OK .  , and the ,  professor c: So that , by the way , basically is a is one of the units in our in our our neural network . Yeah , so he uses , an EM algorithm to to  train up these  parameters for the logistic regression . professor c: Well , actually , yeah , grad e: The professor c: so I was using EM to get the targets . So so you have this this this AND gate what we were calling an AND gate , but it 's a product product rule thing at the output . And then he uses , i u and then feeding into that are I 'm sorry , there 's it 's an OR at the output , isn't it ? Yeah , grad e:   phd a: And so are each of these , low level detectors are they ,  are these something that you decide ahead of time , like \" I 'm going to look for this particular feature or I 'm going to look at this frequency , \" or What what what are they looking at ? grad e:  phd a: What are their inputs ? grad e:  Right , so the OK , so at each for each sub - band there are basically , several measures of SNR and and correlation .  , and for for every s every sub - band , e you you just pick ahead of time , \" I 'm going to have like five i independent logistic tests . grad e: And you initialize these parameters , in some some way and use EM to come up with your training targets for a for the the low - level detectors . grad e: And then , once you get that done , you you you train the whole whole thing on maximum likelihood .  , and h he shows that using this this method to detect sonorance is it 's very robust compared to ,  to typical , full - band Gaussian mixtures  estimations of of sonorance . You get enough of these detectors together , then you have enough information to do , higher level discrimination , for example , discriminating between phones phd a:   grad e: and then you keep working your way up until you you build a full recognizer . grad e: So , that 's that 's the direction which I 'm I 'm thinking about going in my quals .  , one is the going towards , using narrow band information for , ph phonetic features of some sort rather than just , immediately going for the the typical sound units . professor c: Another thing I like about it is that you t this thing is going to be trained explicitly trained for a product of errors rule , which is what , Allen keeps pointing out that Fletcher observed in the twenties , phd a:   And then , the third thing I like about it is , and we 've played around with this in a different kind of way a little bit but it hasn't been our dominant way of of operating anything , this issue of where the targets come from . So in our case when we 've been training it multi - band things , the way we get the targets for the individual bands is , that we get the phonetic label for the sound there phd a:   professor c: and we say , \" OK , we train every \" What this is saying is , OK , that 's maybe what our ultimate goal is or not ultimate but penultimate goal is getting these these small sound units . But but , along the way how much should we , what should we be training these intermediate things for ?  , because , we don't know  , that this is a particularly good feature .  , there 's no way ,  someone in the audience yesterday was asking , \" well couldn't you have people go through and mark the individual bands and say where the where it was sonorant or not ? \" phd a:   professor c: But , you know , I think having a bunch of people listening to critical band wide , chunks of speech trying to determine whether I think it 'd be impossible . professor c: It 's all gonna sound like like sine waves to you , more or less . professor c:  Well not  , it 's g all g narrow band  , i I m I think it 's very hard for someone to to a person to make that determination . It could sh be that you should , not be paying that much attention to , certain bands for certain sounds , in order to get the best result . professor c: So , what we have been doing there , just sort of mixing it all together , is certainly much much cruder than that . Now we have I guess done experiments you 've probably done stuff where you have , done separate , Viterbis on the different grad e: Yeah . Did did that help at all ? grad e: it helps for one or t one iteration but  , anything after that it doesn't help . professor c: So so that may or may t it that aspect of what he 's doing may or may not be helpful because in a sense that 's the same sort of thing . You 're taking global information and determining what you how you should But this is this is , I th I think a little more direct . phd a: How did they measure the performance of their detector ? professor c: And Well , he 's look he 's just actually looking at , the confusions between sonorant and non - sonorant . professor c: So he hasn't applied it to recognition or if he did he didn't talk about it . It 's it 's just And one of the concerns in the audience , actually , was that that , the ,  he he did a comparison to , you know , our old foil , the the nasty old standard recognizer with mel mel filter bank at the front , and H M Ms , and and so forth . But the one of the good questions in the audience was , well , yeah , but that wasn't trained for that .  , this use of a very smooth , spectral envelope is something that , you know , has evolved as being generally a good thing for speech recognition but if you knew that what you were gonna do is detect sonorants or not So sonorants and non - sonorants is is is almost like voiced - unvoiced , except I guess that the voiced stops are are also called \" obstruents \" .  , so it 's it 's  , but with the exception of the stops I guess it 's pretty much the same as voiced - unvoiced , phd a:   So , if you knew you were doing that , if you were doing something say for a a ,  a a Vocoder , you wouldn't use the same kind of features . Nonetheless , it was one that was interesting because , this is what we are actually using for speech recognition , these smooth envelopes . And this says that perhaps even , you know , trying to use them in the best way that we can , that that that we ordinarily do , with , you know , Gaussian mixtures and H M Ms and so forth , you you don't , actually do that well on determining whether something is sonorant or not . phd a: Didn't they professor c: Which means you 're gonna make errors between similar sounds that are son sonorant or obstruent . phd a: Didn't they also do some kind of an oracle experiment where they said \" if we could detect the sonorants perfectly and then show how it would improve speech recognition ? I thought I remember hearing about an experiment like that . professor c: That would that 's you 're right , that 's exactly the question to follow up this discussion , is suppose you did that , got that right . phd b: What could be the other low level detectors , for Other kind of features , or ? in addition to detecting sonorants or ? Th - that 's what you want to to to go for also grad e:  phd b: or ? grad e: What t Oh , build other other detectors on different phonetic features ? phd b: Other low level detectors ? Yeah . e  , w easiest thing would be to go go do some voicing stuff but that 's very similar to sonorance . grad e: phd a: When we when we talked with John Ohala the other day we made a list of some of the things that w grad e: Yeah . professor c: Yeah , so there 's a half dozen like that that are grad e: Yeah , nasality . professor c: Now this was coming at it from a different angle but maybe it 's a good way to start .  , these are things which , John felt that a a ,  a human annotator would be able to reliably mark . So the sort of things he felt would be difficult for a human annotator to reliably mark would be tongue position kinds of things . professor c: But stress doesn't , fit in this thing of coming up with features that will distinguish words from one another , grad e:   professor c: right ? It 's a it 's a good thing to mark and will probably help us ultimate with recognition phd a: Yeah , there 's a few cases where it can like permit and permit . professor c: Well , yeah , but i either case you 'd write PERMIT , right ? So you 'd get the word right . phd a: No , I 'm saying , i i e I thought you were saying that stress doesn't help you distinguish between words . As long as you get The sequence , professor c: We 're g if we 're doing if we 're talking about transcription as opposed to something else phd a: right ? Yeah . Yeah , so that 's yeah , that 's , you know , a neat neat thing and and ,  So . grad e: S so , Ohala 's going to help do these ,  transcriptions of the meeting data ? phd a: well I don't know .  , we just talked about some possible features that could be marked by humans and , grad e:  . phd a: because of having maybe some extra transcriber time we thought we could go through and mark some portion of the data for that . professor c: that 's not an immediate problem , that we don't immediately have a lot of extra transcriber time . professor c: But but , in the long term I guess Chuck is gonna continue the dialogue with John and and , and , we 'll we 'll end up doing some I think .  , so , y you want to talk maybe a c two or three minutes about what we 've been talking about today and other days ? grad f: Ri Yeah , OK , so , we 're interested in , methods for far mike speech recognition , mainly , methods that deal with the reverberation in the far mike signal . So , one approach would be , say MSG and PLP , like was used in Aurora one and , there are other approaches which actually attempt to remove the reverberation , instead of being robust to it like MSG . And so we 're interested in , comparing the performance of  , a robust approach like MSG with these , speech enhancement or de - reverber de - reverberation approaches . grad f: And , it looks like we 're gonna use the Meeting Recorder digits data for that . phd b: And the de - reverberation algorithm , do you have can you give some more details on this or ? Does it use one microphone ? grad f: o o phd b: Several microphones ? Does it ? grad f: OK , well , there was something that was done by , a guy named Carlos , I forget his last name , who worked with Hynek , who , professor c: Avendano . grad f: it was like RASTA in the sense that of it was , de - convolution by filtering  , except he used a longer time window , phd b:   And the reason for that is RASTA 's time window is too short to ,  include the whole , reverberation  , I don't know what you call it the reverberation response . The reverberation filter from my mouth to that mike is like it 's t got it 's too long in the in the time domain for the  for the RASTA filtering to take care of it . And , then there are a couple of other speech enhancement approaches which haven't been tried for speech recognition yet but have just been tried for enhancement , which , have the assumption that  , you can do LPC  analysis of th of the signal you get at the far microphone and the , all pole filter that you get out of that should be good . It 's just the , excitation signal that is going to be distorted by the reverberation and so you can try and reconstruct a better excitation signal and , feed that through the i  , all pole filter and get enhanced speech with reverberation reduced . professor c: There 's also this , echo cancellation stuff that we 've sort of been chasing , so ,  we have ,  and when we 're saying these digits now we do have a close microphone signal and then there 's the distant microphone signal . And you could as a kind of baseline say , \" OK , given that we have both of these , we should be able to do , a cancellation . \" So that , we we , essentially identify the system in between the linear time invariant system between the microphones and and and and re and invert it , or or cancel it out to to some some reasonable approximation phd b: that 's not a practical thing , if you have a distant mike , you don't have a close mike ordinarily , but we thought that might make also might make a good baseline .  , but And then there are s  , there are single microphone methods that I think people have done for ,  for this kind of de - reverberation . Do y do you know any references to any ? Cuz I I w I was w w I I lead him down a a bad path on that . phd b: I g I guess I guess when people are working with single microphones , they are more trying to do professor c: But . phd b: well , not not very Well , there is the Avendano work , professor c: Right . phd b: but also trying to mmm ,  trying to f t find the de - convolution filter but in the  not in the time domain but in the  the stream of features  I guess . Well , @ @ there there 's someone working on this on i in Mons professor c: Yeah , OK . phd b: So perhaps , yeah , we should try t to He 's working on this , on trying to professor c: Yeah . phd b: on re reverberation ,  professor c: The first paper on this is gonna have great references , I can tell already . professor c: It 's always good to have references , especially when reviewers read it or or one of the authors and , feel they 'll \" You 're OK , you 've r You cited me . Well , he did echo cancellation and he did some fancier things like , training different network on different reverberation conditions and then trying to find the best one , but . professor c: The oth the other thing , that Dave was talking about earlier was , multiple mike things , where they 're all distant . So , there 's there 's all this work on arrays , but the other thing is , what can we do that 's cleverer that can take some advantage of only two mikes , particularly if there 's an obstruction between them , as we as we have over there . It 's part of why you have such good directionality with , with two ears phd b:   professor c: So that Yeah , the the head , in the way , is really that 's what it 's for . It 's basically , phd a: That 's what the head 's for ? To separate the ears ? professor c: Yeah , it 's to separate the ears . professor c: Yeah ? phd a: I think th that may be due to the fact that Adam ran out of digits , and didn't have time to regenerate any . professor c: Oh ! Oh ! I guess it 's Well there 's no real reason to write our names on here then , phd a: Yeah , if you want to put your credit card numbers and ,  professor c: is there ? grad e: Oh , no ? professor c: Or do did any do we need the names for the other stuff , phd a: yeah , I do need your names and and the time , and all that , professor c: or ? Oh , OK <doc-sep>professor b: So ne next week we 'll have , both Birger and , Mike Michael Michael Kleinschmidt and Birger Kollmeier will join us . professor b: and you 're you 're probably gonna go up in a couple three weeks or so ? When d when are you thinking of going up to , OGI ? phd d: Yeah , like , not next week but maybe the week after . So at least we 'll have one meeting with yo with you still around , and and phd d:  - huh . So there was this conference call this morning , and the only topic on the agenda was just to discuss a and to come at  , to get a decision about this latency problem . professor b: No , this I 'm sorry , this is a conference call between different Aurora people or just ? phd d: yeah . There were like two hours of discussions , and then suddenly , people were tired , I guess , and they decided on a number , two hundred and twenty , included e including everything . W It 's it 's p d primary primarily determined by the VAD at this point , phd d:  . We probably should do that pretty soon so that we don't get used to it being a certain way . We have , like , a system that gives sixty - two percent improvement , but if you want to stick to the this latency Well , it has a latency of two thirty , but if you want also to stick to the number of features that limit it to sixty , then we go a little bit down but it 's still sixty - one percent . And i is the tandem network , small enough that it will fit on the terminal size in terms of ? phd d: no , I don't think so . phd d: It 's still in terms of computation , if we use , like , their way of computing the the maps the the MIPs , I think it fits , professor b:   phd d: and I don't know how much this can be discussed or not , because it 's it could be in ROM , so it 's maybe not that expensive . But professor b: Ho - how much memory d ? H how many ? phd d: I d I d  , I I don't kn remember exactly , but  . I 'd like to see that , cuz maybe I could think a little bit about it , cuz we maybe we could make it a little smaller or  , it 'd be it 'd be neat if we could fit it all . professor b: But I guess it 's still within their rules to have have it on the , t  , server side .  , mmm , and one of the trick was to , use some kind of hierarchical structure where the silence probability is not computed by the final tandem network but by the VAD network .  , so apparently it looks better when , we use the silence probability from the VAD network professor b: Huh . So it 's some kind of hierarchical thing , that Sunil also tried , on SPINE and apparently it helps a little bit also . Yeah , the reason w why why we did that with the silence probability was that ,  professor b: Could ?  , I 'm I 'm really sorry . So there is the tandem network that e e e estimates the phone probabilities professor b: Yeah . phd d: And things get better when , instead of using the silence probability computed by the tandem network , we use the silence probability , given by the VAD network , professor b: Oh . phd d: professor b: The VAD network is ? phd d: Which is smaller , but maybe ,  So we have a network for the VAD which has one hundred hidden units , and the tandem network has five hundred . phd d: Maybe it 's has something to do to the fact that we don't have infinite training data and professor b: We don't ? phd d: Well ! And so Well , things are not optimal professor b: Yeah . phd d: and Mmm grad e: Are you you were going to say why what made you wh what led you to do that .  , there was a p problem that we observed , that there was there were , like , many insertions in the in the system . phd d: Actually plugging in the tandem network was increasing , I I I think , the number of insertions . professor b: So , you know , in a way what it might i it 's it 's a little bit like combining knowledge sources . phd d:  professor b: Right ? Because the fact that you have these two nets that are different sizes means they behave a little differently , phd d:   And , if you have ,  f the distribution that you have from , f speech sounds is w sort of one source of knowledge . professor b: And this is and rather than just taking one minus that to get the other , which is essentially what 's happening , you have this other source of knowledge that you 're putting in there . Well , there are other things that we should do but , it requires time and We have ideas , like so , these things are like hav having a better VAD . Of course we have ideas on this also , but w we need to try different things and  , but their noise estimation ,   professor b: back on the second stream , that 's something we 've talked about for a while . professor b: so we have this this default idea about just using some sort of purely spectral thing ? phd d: yeah . professor b: for a second stream ? phd d: But , we we did a first try with this , and it it clearly hurts . So , if you just had a second stream that was just spectral and had another neural net and combined there , that that , might be good .  Yeah , and the other thing , that noise estimation and th  , maybe try to train  , the training data for the t tandem network , right now , is like i is using the noises from the Aurora task and I think that people might , try to argue about that because then in some cases we have the same noises in for training the network than the noises that are used for testing , professor b: Right . Well , that 's something I would like to investigate further , but , I did , like ,  I did , listen to the m most noisy utterances of the SpeechDat - Car Italian and tried to transcribe them . phd d: but but still , what happens is is that , the digit error rate on this is around one percent , professor b: Yeah .  , but what happens also is that if I listen to the ,  a re - synthesized version of the speech and I re - synthesized this using a white noise that 's filtered by a LPC , filter professor b: Yeah . phd d: well , you can argue , that ,  that this is not speech , professor b: Yeah . But s actually it sound like whispering , so we are professor b: Well , it 's phd d: eh professor b: There 's two problems there .   , so so the first is that by doing LPC - twelve with synthesized speech w like you 're saying , it 's i i you 're you 're adding other degradation . professor b: Right ? So it 's not just the noise but you 're adding in fact some degradation because it 's only an approximation .  , and the second thing is which is m maybe more interesting is that , if you do it with whispered speech , you get this number . What if you had done analysis re - synthesis and taken the pitch as well ? Alright ? So now you put the pitch in . professor b: What would the percentage be then ? phd d:  professor b: See , that 's the question . So , you see , if it 's if it 's if it 's ,  Let 's say it 's back down to one percent again . professor b: That would say at least for people , having the pitch is really , really important , which would be interesting in itself . But professor b: if i on the other hand , if it stayed up near five percent , then I 'd say \" boy , LPC n twelve is pretty crummy \" . professor b: So I I I 'm not sure I 'm not sure how we can conclude from this anything about that our system is close to the human performance . Well , the point is that eh l ey the point is that , what I what I listened to when I re - synthesized the LP - the LPC - twelve spectrum is in a way what the system , is hearing , cuz @ @ all the all the , excitation all the well , the excitation is is not taken into account . And professor b: Well , you 're not doing the LPC phd d: in this case professor b: so so what if you did a phd d: Well , it 's not LPC , sure , professor b: What if you did LPC - twenty ? phd d: but LPC ? professor b: Twenty . professor b: So , all I 'm saying is that you have in addition to the w the , removal of pitch , you also are doing , a particular parameterization , phd d:   professor b: so , let 's see , how would you do ? So , fo phd d: But that 's that 's what we do with our systems . Actually , we d we we don't , because we do we do , mel filter bank , for instance . Right ? phd d: Yeah , but is it that is it that different ,  ? professor b: I don't know what mel , based synthesis would sound like , phd d: I professor b: but certainly the spectra are quite different . phd a: Couldn't you t couldn't you , test the human performance on just the original audio ? phd d:   So , y  , your performance was one percent , and then when you re - synthesize with LPC - twelve it went to five . professor b:  We were we were j It it it 's a little bit still apples and oranges because we are choosing these features in order to be the best for recognition . professor b: And , i if you listen to them they still might not be very Even if you made something closer to what we 're gonna i it might not sound very good . professor b: and i the degradation from that might might actually make it even harder , to understand than the LPC - twelve . So all I 'm saying is that the LPC - twelve puts in synthesis puts in some degradation that 's not what we 're used to hearing , phd d:  - huh . professor b: and is ,  It 's not it 's not just a question of how much information is there , as if you will always take maximum advantage of any information that 's presented to you . And so it it isn't phd a: But professor b: But , I agree that it says that , the kind of information that we 're feeding it is probably , a little bit , minimal . And that 's why I was saying it might be interesting if you an interesting test of this would be if you if you actually put the pitch back in . So , you just extract it from the actual speech and put it back in , and see does that is that does that make the difference ? If that if that takes it down to one percent again , then you 'd say \" OK , it 's it 's in fact having , not just the spectral envelope but also the also the the pitch that , @ @ has the information that people can use , anyway . phd a: But from this it 's pretty safe to say that the system is with either two to seven percent away from the performance of a human . professor b: Well , or it 's it 's phd a: Two two to six percent . professor b: Yeah , so It 's it 's one point four times , to , seven times the error , phd d: To f seven times , yeah . phd d: But but professor b: But that 's that 's what that 's the first thing that I would be curious about , is , you know , i i when you we phd d: But the signal itself is like a mix of  , of a a periodic sound and , @ @  , unvoiced sound , and the noise professor b:   So , what what do you mean exactly by putting back the pitch in ? Because phd a: In the LPC synthesis ? I think professor b: Yeah . professor b: So ,  and you did it with a noise source , rather than with with a s periodic source . professor b: Right ? So if you actually did real re - synthesis like you do in an LPC synthesizer , where it 's unvoiced you use noise , where it 's voiced you use , periodic pulses . professor b: Right ? phd d: Yeah , but it 's neither purely voiced or purely unvoiced . professor b: Well , it might be hard to do it phd d: So professor b: but it but but the thing is that if you  , if you detect that there 's periodic s strong periodic components , then you can use a voiced voice thing . professor b: But I 'm I 'm just saying , at least as a thought experiment , that 's what I would wanna test . professor b: I wan would wanna drive it with a a a two - source system rather than a than a one - source system . professor b: And then that would tell you whether in fact it 's Cuz we 've talked about , like , this harmonic tunneling or other things that people have done based on pitch , maybe that 's really a key element . Maybe maybe , without that , it 's it 's not possible to do a whole lot better than we 're doing . Evi professor b: But , other than that , I don't think it 's  , other than the pitch de information , it 's hard to imagine that there 's a whole lot more in the signal that that ,  that we 're throwing away that 's important . professor b: Right ?  , we 're using a fair number of filters in the filter bank and  phd d:   If somebody was paying really close attention , you might get I would actually think that if , you looked at people on various times of the day and different amounts of attention , you might actually get up to three or four percent error on digits . professor b: So it 's you know , we 're not we 're not incredibly far off . On the other hand , with any of these numbers except maybe the one percent , it 's st it 's not actually usable in a commercial system with a full telephone number or something .  , while we 're still on Aurora stuff maybe you can talk a little about the status with the , Wall Street Journal things for it . They wrote some scripts that sort of make it easy to run the system on the Wall Street Journal , data .  , I 'm waiting there was one problem with part of it and I wrote a note to Joe asking him about it .  , they on their web site they , did this little table of where their system performs relative to other systems that have done this this task . So they 're professor b: This is on clean test set ? phd a: This is on clean on clean stuff . They they 've started a table where they 're showing their results on various different noise conditions but they they don't have a whole lot of it filled in and and I didn't notice until after I 'd printed it out that , they don't say here what these different testing conditions are . professor b:  phd a: You actually have to click on it on the web site to see them . professor b: What kind of numbers are they getting on these on the test conditions ? phd a: Well , see , I was a little confused because on this table , I 'm the they 're showing word error rate . But on this one , I I don't know if these are word error rates because they 're really big . professor b:  phd a: So m I guess maybe they 're error rates but they 're ,  they 're really high . professor b: I I I don't find that surpri phd a: So professor b: we W what 's what 's some of the lower error rates on on on  , some of the higher error rates on , some of these w  , highly mismatched difficult conditions ? What 's a ? phd d:  . phd a: Correct ? phd d: And the baseline , eh phd a: Accuracy ? phd d: error rate . professor b: So if you 're doing so if you 're doing , phd d: and phd a: Yeah . professor b: Yeah , and if you 're saying sixty - thousand word recognition , getting sixty percent error on some of these noise condition not at all surprising . phd d: The baseline is sixty percent also on digits , phd a: Oh , is it ? phd d: on the m more mismatched conditions . professor b: It 's a bad sign when you looking at the numbers , you can't tell whether it 's accuracy or error rate .  , they 're I I 'm still waiting for them to release the , multi - CPU version of their scripts , cuz right now their script only handles processing on a single CPU , which will take a really long time to run . But their s professor b: This is for the training ? phd a:  I beli Yes , for the training also . So , as soon as they get that , then I 'll I 'll grab those too professor b: OK . I 'll go ahead and try to run it though with just the single CPU one , professor b: if the phd a: and I they they , released like a smaller data set that you can use that only takes like sixteen hours to train and stuff . So I can I can run it on that just to make sure that the the thing works and everything . Is that about right you think ? phd d: we don't know yet , I I think . Did they say anything on the conference call about , how the Wall Street Journal part of the test was going to be run ? Because I I thought I remembered hearing that some sites were saying that they didn't have the compute to be able to run the Wall Street Journal stuff at their place , phd d: No . Well , this first , this was not the point at all of this the meeting today phd a: Oh , OK . phd d: and , professor b: Some phd d: frankly , I don't know because I d didn't read also the most recent mails about the large - vocabulary task . But , did you do you still , get the mails ? You 're not on the mailing list or what ? phd a:   I I don't get any mail about professor b: I have to say , there 's  something funny - sounding about saying that one of these big companies doesn't have enough cup compute power do that , so they 're having to have it done by Mississippi State . phd a: because there 's this whole issue about , you know , simple tuning parameters , like word insertion penalties . If you change your front - end , you know , the scale is completely can be completely different , so . But phd d: You didn't get any answer from Joe ? phd a: I did , but Joe said , you know , \" what you 're saying makes sense phd d:  - huh . phd a: that 's th We had this back and forth a little bit about , you know , are sites gonna are you gonna run this data for different sites ? And , well , if if Mississippi State runs it , then maybe they 'll do a little optimization on that parameter , and ,  But then he wasn't asked to run it for anybody . phd a: he 's been putting this stuff out on their web site and for people to grab but I haven't heard too much about what 's happening . professor b: So it could be  , Chuck and I had actually talked about this a couple times , and and over some lunches , I think , that , one thing that we might wanna do The - there 's this question about , you know , what do you wanna scale ? Suppose y you can't adjust these word insertion penalties and so forth , so you have to do everything at the level of the features . What could you do ? And , one thing I had suggested at an earlier time was maybe some sort of scaling , some sort of root or or something of the , features . But the problem with that is that isn't quite the same , it occurred to me later , because what you really want to do is scale the , @ @ the range of the likelihoods rather than phd d: Nnn , the dist Yeah . professor b: But , what might get at something similar , it just occurred to me , is kind of an intermediate thing is because we do this strange thing that we do with the tandem system , at least in that system what you could do is take the , values that come out of the net , which are something like log probabilities , and scale those . But but , you know So because what we 're doing is pretty strange and complicated , we don't really know what the effect is at the other end . professor b: So , my thought was maybe  , they 're not used as probabilities , but the log probabilities we 're taking advantage of the fact that something like log probabilities has more of a Gaussian shape than Gaus - than probabilities , and so we can model them better . So , in a way we 're taking advantage of the fact that they 're probabilities , because they 're this quantity that looks kind of Gaussian when you take it 's log . And we may end up being in a situation where we just you know really can't change the word insertion penalty . But the other thing we could do is also we could  , this this may not help us , in the evaluation but it might help us in our understanding at least . We might , just run it with different insper insertion penalties , and show that , \" well , OK , not changing it , playing the rules the way you wanted , we did this . \" phd a: I wonder if it it might be possible to , simulate the back - end with some other system . So we we get our f front - end features , and then , as part of the process of figuring out the scaling of these features , you know , if we 're gonna take it to a root or to a power or something , we have some back - end that we attach onto our features that sort of simulates what would be happening . phd a: professor b: And just adjust it until it 's the best number ? phd a: and just adjust it until that our l version of the back - end , decides that that professor b: Well , we can probably use the real thing , can't we ? And then jus just , use it on a reduced test set or something . So  , I I think that that 's a reasonable thing to do and the only question is what 's the actual knob that we use ? phd a:   professor b: And the knob that we use should  , unfortunately , like I say , I don't know the analytic solution to this cuz what we really want to do is change the scale of the likelihoods , phd a:   grad e: Out of curiosity , what what kind of recognizer is the one from Mississippi State ? phd a: w what do you mean when you say \" what kind \" ? grad e: Is it ?  , is it like a Gaussian mixture model ? phd a: Yeah . phd a: It 's the same system that they use when they participate in the Hub - five evals .  , they started off with  , when they were building their system they were always comparing to HTK to make sure they were getting similar results . And so , it 's a Gaussian mixture system ,  professor b: Do they have the same sort of mix - down sort of procedure , where they start off with a small number of some things phd a: I don't know . professor b: D Do you know what kind of tying they use ? Are they they sort of some sort of a bunch of Gaussians that they share across everything ? Or or if it 's ? phd a: Yeah , th I have I I I don't have it up here but I have a the whole system description , that describes exactly what their system is professor b: OK . phd a: It 's some kind of a mixture of Gaussians and , clustering and ,  They 're they 're trying to put in sort of all of the standard features that people use nowadays . professor b: So the other , Aurora thing maybe is I I dunno if any of this is gonna come in in time to be relevant , but , we had talked about , Guenter playing around , over in Germany phd d:   professor b: and and , @ @  , possibly coming up with something that would , fit in later .  , I saw that other mail where he said that he  , it wasn't going to work for him to do CVS . professor b: So if he 'll he might work on improving the noise estimate or on some histogram things , or phd d: Yeah . I just saw the Eurospeech We we didn't talk about it at our meeting but I just saw the just read the paper . Someone , I forget the name , and and Ney , about histogram equalization ? Did you see that one ? phd d: it was a poster .  It was something similar to n on - line normalization finally  , in the idea of of normalizing professor b: Yeah . But it 's a little more it it 's a little finer , right ? So they had like ten quantiles phd d: Yeah . professor b: So you you have the distributions from the training set , phd d: N professor b: and then ,  So this is just a a histogram of of the amplitudes , I guess . And and and then , when you get a new new thing that you you want to adjust to be better in some way , you adjust it so that the histogram of the new data looks like the old data . professor b: You do this kind of piece - wise linear or , some kind of piece - wise approximation . They did a  one version that was piece - wise linear and another that had a power law thing between them between the points . And , they said they s they sort of see it in a way as s for the speech case as being kind of a generalization of spectral subtraction in a way , because , you know , in spectral subtraction you 're trying to get rid of this excess energy . And then they have s they have some kind of , a floor or something , grad e:  . phd a: So is this a histogram across different frequency bins ? professor b: and phd a: Or ? professor b: I think this i You know , I don't remember that . I  Something like one per frequency band , professor b: One phd a: So , one histogram per frequency bin . phd a: So th professor b: And I don't remember whether it was filter bank things phd a: Oh . phd d: and I didn't professor b: or whether it was FFT bins phd a: Huh . professor b: or phd a: And and that that , histogram represents the different energy levels that have been seen at that frequency ? professor b: I don't remember that . And they do they said that they could do it for the test So you don't have to change the training . phd a: So they ,  Is the idea that you you run a test utterance through some histogram generation thing and then you compare the histograms and that tells you what to do to the utterance to make it more like ? professor b: I guess in pri Yeah . professor b: whether it was some , on - line thing , or whether it was a second pass , or what . We 're sort of curious about , what are some things that are , u u  , @ @ conceptually quite different from what we 've done . professor b: Cuz we you know , one thing that w that , Stephane and Sunil seemed to find , was , you know , they could actually make a unified piece of software that handled a range of different things that people were talking about , and it was really just sort of setting of different constants . So , we 're not making any use of pitch , which again , might might be important , because the stuff between the harmonics is probably a schmutz . And and ,  And we there 's this overall idea of really sort of matching the the hi distributions somehow . So I guess , Guenter 's gonna play around with some of these things now over this next period , phd d: I dunno . professor b: or ? phd d: I don't have feedback from him , but professor b: Yeah . phd d: I guess he 's gonna , maybe professor b: Well , he 's got it anyway , so he can . professor b: So potentially if he came up with something that was useful , like a diff a better noise estimation module or something , he could ship it to you guys u up there phd d:  - huh . So , why don't we just ,  I think starting starting a w couple weeks from now , especially if you 're not gonna be around for a while , we 'll we 'll be shifting more over to some other other territory . But , n not not so much in this meeting about Aurora , but but , maybe just , quickly today about maybe you could just say a little bit about what you 've been talking about with Michael . So Michael Kleinschmidt , who 's a PHD student from Germany , showed up this week . And he 's done some work using an auditory model of , human hearing , and using that f  , to generate speech recognition features . And he did work back in Germany with , a toy recognition system using , isolated digit recognition as the task .  , and he tried that on I think on some Aurora data and got results that he thought seemed respectable . And he w he 's coming here to u u use it on a  , a real speech recognition system . And , maybe I should say a little more about these features , although I don't understand them that well . And I 'm - I 'm not sure what we have @ @ in there that isn't already modeled in something like , PLP . And then the second stage is , the most different thing , I think , from what we usually do . It 's ,  it computes features which are , based on sort of like based on diffe different w  , wavelet basis functions used to analyze the input .  So th he uses analysis functions called Gabor functions , which have a certain extent , in time and in frequency . And the idea is these are used to sample , the signal in a represented as a time - frequency representation . And , that , is is interesting , cuz , @ @ for for one thing , you could use it , in a a multi - scale way . You could have these instead of having everything like we use a twenty - five millisecond or so analysis window , typically , and that 's our time scale for features , but you could using this , basis function idea , you could have some basis functions which have a lot longer time scale and , some which have a lot shorter , and so it would be like a set of multi - scale features . So he 's interested in ,  Th - this is because it 's ,  there are these different parameters for the shape of these basis functions ,  there are a lot of different possible basis functions . And so he he actually does an optimization procedure to choose an an optimal set of basis functions out of all the possible ones . H What does he do to choose those ? grad c: The method he uses is kind of funny is , he starts with he has a set of M of them .  , he and then he uses that to classify  , he t he tries , using just M minus one of them . grad c: Whichever sub - vector , works the the best , I guess , he says the the fe feature that didn't use was the most useless feature , professor b: Y yeah . grad c: so we 'll throw it out and we 're gonna randomly select another feature from the set of possible basis functions . phd a: So it 's a professor b: So i so it 's actuall phd a: it 's a little bit like a genetic algorithm or something in a way . grad e: It 's like a greedy professor b: But it 's but it 's  , it 's there 's a lot number of things I like about it , let me just say .  , i i in truth , both pieces of this are have their analogies in stuff we already do . But it 's a different take at how to approach it and potentially one that 's m maybe a bit more systematic than what we 've done , and a b a bit more inspiration from from auditory things . The primary features , are in fact Yeah , essentially , it 's it 's , you know , PLP or or mel cepstrum , or something like that . We always have some you know , the the the kind of filter bank with a kind of quasi - log scaling .  , if you put in if you also include the RASTA in it i RASTA the filtering being done in the log domain has an AGC - like , characteristic , which , you know , people typi typically put in these kind of , auditory front - ends .  , I would agree that the second one is is somewhat more different but , it 's mainly different in that the things that we have been doing like that have been  , had a different kind of motivation and have ended up with different kinds of constraints . So , for instance , if you look at the LDA RASTA stuff , you know , basically what they do is they they look at the different eigenvectors out of the LDA and they form filters out of it . But , they 're not sort of systematically multi - scale , like \" let 's start here and go to there , and go to there , and go to there \" , and so forth . It 's more like , you run it on this , you do discriminant analysis , and you find out what 's helpful .  grad c: I it 's multi - scale because you use several of these in parallel , professor b: Yeah .  , but it 's also ,   Hyn - when Hynek 's had people do this kind of LDA analysis , they 've done it on frequency direction and they 've done it on the time direction . I think he may have had people sometimes doing it on both simultaneously some two - D and that would be the closest to these Gabor function kind of things . And , the other thing that 's interesting the the ,  the feature selection thing , it 's a simple method , but I kinda like it .  , eh , I remember people referring to it as old when I was playing with it twenty years ago , so I know it 's pretty old , called Stepwise Linear Discriminant Analysis in which you which I think it 's used in social sciences a lot . And what what Michael 's describing seems to me much , much better , because the problem with the stepwise discriminant analysis is that you don't know that you know , if you 've picked the right set of features . So , here at least you 're starting off with all of them , and you 're throwing out useless features .  , so the only thing is , of course , there 's this this artificial question of of , exactly how you how you a how you assess it and if if your order had been different in throwing them out .  , it still isn't necessarily really optimal , but it seems like a pretty good heuristic . professor b: And and and , the thing that I wanted to to add to it also was to have us use this in a multi - stream way . professor b: so so that , when you come up with these different things , and these different functions , you don't necessarily just put them all into one huge vector , but perhaps you have some of them in one stream and some of them in another stream , and so forth . And ,  And we 've also talked a little bit about , Shihab Shamma 's stuff , in which you the way you look at it is that there 's these different mappings and some of them emphasize , upward moving , energy and fre and frequency . But , I think we 're sorta gonna start off with what he , came here with and branch out branch out from there . grad e: As as we were talking about this I was thinking , whether there 's a relationship between  , between Michael 's approach to , some some sort of optimal brain damage or optimal brain surgeon on the neural nets . grad e: So , like , if we have ,  we have our we have our RASTA features and and presumably the neural nets are are learning some sort of a nonlinear mapping , from the the the features to to this this probability posterior space . grad e: Right ? And ,  and each of the hidden units is learning some sort of some sort of some sort of pattern . And then when you 're looking at the the , the best features , you know , you can take out you can do the do this , brain surgery by taking out , hidden units that don't really help at all . grad e: And this is k sorta like professor b: Right ? grad e: Yeah . professor b: y actually , you make me think a a very important point here is that , if we a again try to look at how is this different from what we 're already doing , there 's a a ,  a nasty argument that could be made th that it 's it 's not different at at all , because ,  if you ignore the the selection part because we are going into a a very powerful , nonlinearity that , in fact is combining over time and frequency , and is coming up with its own you know , better than Gabor functions its , you know , neural net functions , grad e:   grad c:  professor b: so you could argue that in fact it But I I don't actually believe that argument because I know that , you can ,  computing features is useful , even though in principle you haven't added anything in fact , you subtracted something , from the original waveform You know , if you 've you 've processed it in some way you 've typically lost something some information . And so , you 've lost information and yet it does better with with features than it does with the waveform . So that 's why it really seems like the constraint in in all this stuff it 's the constraints that are actually what matters . Because if it wasn't the constraints that mattered , then we would 've completely solved this problem long ago , because long ago we already knew how to put waveforms into powerful statistical mechanisms . Well , if we had infinite processing power and data , I guess , using the waveform could grad e: Right . But but , i it 's With finite of those things  , we we have done experiments where we literally have put waveforms in and and and , phd d:   professor b: we kept the number of parameters the same and so forth , and it used a lot of training data . And it and it it ,  not infinite but a lot , and then compared to the number parameters and it it ,  it just doesn't do nearly as well . professor b: it 's not just having the maximum information , you want to suppress , the aspects of the input signal that are not helpful for for the discrimination you 're trying to make . So maybe just briefly ,  grad e: Well , that sort of segues into what what I 'm doing . grad e: so , the big picture is k  , come up with a set of , intermediate categories , then build intermediate category classifiers , then do recognition , and , improve speech recognition in that way .  , so right now I 'm in in the phase where I 'm looking at at , deciding on a initial set of intermediate categories . And I 'm looking for data data - driven methods that can help me find , a set of intermediate categories of speech that , will help me to discriminate later down the line . And one of the ideas , that was to take a take a neural net train train an ordinary neural net to  , to learn the posterior probabilities of phones . And so , at the end of the day you have this neural net and it has hidden hidden units .  , and I 'm gonna to try to to look at those patterns to to see , from those patterns  , presumably those are important patterns for discriminating between phone classes . And maybe maybe some , intermediate categories can come from just looking at the patterns of  , that the neural net learns . professor b: Be - before you get on the next part l let me just point out that s there 's there 's a a pretty nice relationship between what you 're talking about doing and what you 're talking about doing there . professor b: So , it seems to me that , you know , if you take away the the the difference of this primary features , and , say , you use as we had talked about maybe doing you use P - RASTA - PLP or something for the the primary features , then this feature discovery , thing is just what he 's talking about doing , too , except that he 's talking about doing them in order to discover intermediate categories that correspond to these  , what these sub - features are are are are showing you . And , the other difference is that , he 's doing this in a in a multi - band setting , which means that he 's constraining himself to look across time in some f relatively limited , spectral extent . Right ? And whereas in in this case you 're saying \" let 's just do it unconstrained \" . So they 're they 're really pretty related and maybe they 'll be at some point where we 'll see the the connections a little better and connect them . Yeah , so so that 's the that 's the first part  , one one of the ideas to get at some some patterns of intermediate categories .  , the other one was , to , come up with a a a model  , a graphical model , that treats the intermediate categories as hidden hidden variables , latent variables , that we don't know anything about , but that through , s statistical training and the EM algorithm , at the end of the day , we have ,  we have learned something about these these latent ,  latent variables which happen to correspond to intermediate categories . Yeah , and so those are the the two directions that I 'm I 'm looking into right now . Should we do our digits and get ou get our treats ? grad e: Oh , tea time ? professor b: Yeah . It 's kind of like , you know , the little rats with the little thing dropping down to them . phd a: That 's ri professor b: We do the digits and then we get our treats <doc-sep>grad e: Hello ? professor a: So everybody everybody 's on ? phd d: Today 's professor a: Yeah . professor a: eh e and  I guess Chuck you weren't there either , so the  phd b: I was there . professor a: Oh you were there ? phd b: With Hynek ? professor a: Yeah . professor a: What was the w what was the downsampling problem again ? phd c: So we had professor a: I forget . phd c: So the fact that there there is no  low - pass filtering before the downsampling . phd c: There is because there is LDA filtering but that 's perhaps not  the best w m professor a: Depends what it 's frequency characteristic is , yeah . So we discussed about this , about the  professor a: Was there any conclusion about that ? phd c:  \" try it \" . So again this is th this is the downsampling  of the  the feature vector stream phd c:  . professor a: and  Yeah I guess the the  LDA filters they were doing do have   let 's see , so the the the feature vectors are calculated every ten milliseconds so  the question is how far down they are at fifty fifty hertz . Does anybody know what the frequency characteristic is ? phd c: We don't have yet professor a: Oh OK . And the third point  was the  , yeah , the on - line normalization where , well , the recursion f recursion for the mean estimation is a filter with some kind of delay professor a: Yeah . For this , the conclusion of Hynek was , well , \" we can try it but \" professor a:  - huh . professor a: Try try what ? phd c: So try to   take into account the delay of the recursion for the mean estimation . And so while discussing about these these LDA filters , some i issues appeared , like well , the fact that if we look at the frequency response of these filters it 's  , well , we don't know really what 's the important part in the frequency response and there is the fact that in the very low frequency , these filters don't don't really remove a lot .  and that 's probably a reason why , yeah , on - line normalization helps because it it , professor a: Right . Yeah , but perhaps everything could should be could be in the filter ,  the the mean normalization and Yeah . phd c: And this was this LDA  tuning perhaps and Hynek proposed again to his  TRAPS , so . phd c: Yeah , professor a:  I g I guess the key thing for me is is figuring out how to better coordinate between the two sides phd c:  . professor a:  I was talking with Hynek about it later and the the sort of had the sense sort of that that neither group of people wanted to to bother the other group too much . And and I don't think anybody is , you know , closed in in their thinking or are unwilling to talk about things but I think that you were sort of waiting for them to tell you that they had something for you and and that and expected that they would do certain things and they were sor they didn't wanna bother you phd c:   professor a: and they were sort of waiting for you and and and  we ended up with this thing where they they were filling up all of the possible latency themselves , and they just had hadn't thought of that .  it 's true that maybe maybe no one really thought about that that this latency thing would be such a a strict issue phd c: Yeah . Well professor a: in in  the other phd c: Yeah I don't know what happened really , but professor a: Yeah . Because , well , we discussed about that about this problem and they told us \" well , we will do all that 's possible to have enough space for a network \" but then , yeah , perhaps they were too short with the time and professor a: Then they couldn't . Well maybe we should just   you 're you 're bus other than that you folks are busy doing all the all the things that you 're trying that we talked about before right ? And this machines are busy and you 're busy phd c: Yeah . professor a: Let 's let 's , I think that as as we said before that one of the things that we 're imagining is that  there there will be  in the system we end up with there 'll be something to explicitly   do something about noise phd c:   professor a: in addition to the  other things that we 're talking about and that 's probably the best thing to do . And there was that one email that said that it sounded like   things looked very promising up there in terms of  I think they were using Ericsson 's approach or something and in addition to They 're doing some noise removal thing , right ? phd c: Yeah , yeah . phd c: And phd d: Yeah , I modified it well , modifying I studied Barry 's sim code , more or less . and we have some the feature for Italian database and we will try with this feature with the filter to find the result . phd d: and maybe try another type of spectral subtraction , I don't professor a: When you say you don't have a result yet you mean it 's it 's just that it 's in process or that you it finished and it didn't get a good result ? phd d: No . No , no n we have n we have do the experiment only have the feature the feature but the experiment have phd c: Yeah . So  I suggest actually now we we we sorta move on and and hear what 's what 's what 's happening in in other areas like what 's what 's happening with your investigations about echos and so on . grad f: Oh  Well  I haven't started writing the test yet , I 'm meeting with Adam today professor a:   grad f:  and he 's going t show me the scripts he has for  running recognition on mee Meeting Recorder digits . grad f:  I also  haven't got the code yet , I haven't asked Hynek for for the for his code yet . Cuz I looked at  Avendano 's thesis and I don't really understand what he 's doing yet but it it it sounded like  the channel normalization part  of his thesis  was done in a a bit of I don't know what the word is , a a bit of a rough way  it sounded like he  he he it it wasn't really fleshed out and maybe he did something that was interesting for the test situation but I I 'm not sure if it 's what I 'd wanna use so I have to I have to read it more , I don't really understand what he 's doing yet . Yeah I haven't read it in a while so I 'm not gonna be too much help unless I read it again , phd d: It 's my phd c: Oh yeah ? phd d: I know this is mine here . The  so you , and then you 're also gonna be doing this echo cancelling between the the close mounted and the and the the the what we 're calling a cheating experiment  of sorts between the distant grad f:  I I 'm ho Right . grad f: I I think he 's at least planning to do it for the cl close - mike cross - talk and so maybe I can just take whatever setup he has and use it . Yeah actually  he should  I wonder who else is I think maybe it 's Dan Ellis is going to be doing  a different cancellation . One of the things that people working in the meeting task wanna get at is they would like to have cleaner close - miked recordings . So  this is especially true for the lapel but even for the close close - miked  cases  we 'd like to be able to have  other sounds from other people and so forth removed from So when someone isn't speaking you 'd like the part where they 're not speaking to actually be So what they 're talking about doing is using ec  echo cancellation - like techniques . It 's not really echo but  just   taking the input from other mikes and using   a  an adaptive filtering approach to remove the effect of that  other speech .  what was it , there was there was some some some point where eh  Eric or somebody was was speaking and he had lots of silence in his channel and I was saying something to somebody else  which was in the background and it was not it was recognizing my words , which were the background speech on the close close mike . phd b: Yeah that was actually my I was wearing the I was wearing the lapel and you were sitting next to me , professor a: Oh you it was you I was Yeah . phd b: and I only said one thing but you were talking and it was picking up all your words . So I think I think Dan Ellis or somebody who was working with him was going to  work on that . And  I don't know if we 've talked lately about the the plans you 're developing that we talked about this morning  I don't remember if we talked about that last week or not , but maybe just a quick reprise of of what we were saying this morning . So continuing to  extend phd b: What about the stuff that  Mirjam has been doing ? And and S Shawn , yeah . professor a: But that 's   all that 's is a a certainly relevant  study and , you know , what are the features that they 're finding . professor a:  what are the variables , what we 're calling this one , what are the variables that they 're found finding useful phd c:  . professor a:  for phd b: And their their targets are based on canonical mappings of phones to acoustic f features . And that 's certainly one thing to do and we 're gonna try and do something more f more fine than that but   so  So I guess you know what , I was trying to remember some of the things we were saying , do you ha still have that ? Yeah . professor a: There 's those that  yeah , some of some of the issues we were talking about was in j just getting a good handle on on  what \" good features \" are and phd b: What does what did  Larry Saul use for it was the sonorant  detector , right ? How did he H how did he do that ? Wh - what was his detector ?   professor a: And the other thing you were talking about is is is where we get the targets from . So  , there 's these issues of what are the what are the variables that you use and do you combine them using the soft \" AND - OR \" or you do something , you know , more complicated  and then the other thing was so where do you get the targets from ? The initial thing is just the obvious that we 're discussing is starting up with phone labels from somewhere and then  doing the transformation . But then the other thing is to do something better and eh w why don't you tell us again about this this database ? This is the phd b:  ! professor a: And then tell them to talk naturally ? Yeah , yeah . professor a: Maybe you could go to these parlors and and you could , you know you know have have , you know , reduced rates if you if you can do the measurements . You could what you could do is you could sell little rings and stuff with embedded you know , transmitters in them and things professor a: Yeah . phd b:  ! There 's a bunch of data that l around , that people have done studies like that w way way back right ?  I can't remember where  Wisconsin or someplace that used to have a big database of Yeah . I remember there was this guy at A T - andT , Randolph ? or r What was his name ? Do you remember that guy ?  , researcher at A T - andT a while back that was studying , trying to do speech recognition from these kinds of features . professor a: Do you mean eh but you  Mar phd c: Well he was the guy the guy that was using professor a: you mean when was was Mark Randolph there , or ? phd b: Mark Randolph . phd c: Is it the guy that was using the pattern of pressure on the tongue or ? phd b: I can't remember exactly what he was using , now . But I know I just remember it had to do with you know  positional parameters phd c: What Yeah . So the only the only  hesitation I had about it since ,  I haven't see the data is it sounds like it 's it 's continuous variables and a bunch of them . professor a: I don't know how complicated it is to go from there What you really want are these binary labels , and just a few of them . And maybe there 's a trivial mapping if you wanna do it and it 's e but it I I I worry a little bit that this is a research project in itself , whereas  if you did something instead that like  having some manual annotation by  you know , linguistics students , this would there 'd be a limited s set of things that you could do a as per our discussions with with John before phd b:   professor a: but the things that you could do , like nasality and voicing and a couple other things you probably could do reasonably well .  the other thing you could do is boot trying to to  get those binary variables and take the continuous variables from  the   the data itself there , but I I 'm not sure phd b: Could you cluster the just do some kind of clustering ? professor a: Guess you could , yeah . So anyway that 's that 's  that 's another whole direction that cou could be looked at .  in general it 's gonna be for new data that you look at , it 's gonna be hidden variable because we 're not gonna get everybody sitting in these meetings to wear the pellets and  . phd b: So you 're talking about using that data to get  instead of using canonical mappings of phones . phd b: So you 'd use that data to give you sort of what the the true mappings are for each phone ? grad e:   So wh yeah , where this fits into the rest in in my mind , I guess , is that  we 're looking at different ways that we can combine  different kinds of of rep front - end representations  in order to get robustness under difficult or even , you know , typical conditions . And part of it , this robustness , seems to come from  multi - stream or multi - band sorts of things and Saul seems to have a reasonable way of looking at it , at least for one one  articulatory feature . The question is is can we learn from that to change some of the other methods we have , since  , one of the things that 's nice about what he had I thought was that that it it  the decision about how strongly to train the different pieces is based on  a a reasonable criterion with hidden variables rather than  just assuming that you should train e e every detector  with equal strength towards  it being this phone or that phone . It 's a soft \" AND \" , I guess but in in principle you you wanna get a strong concurrence of all the different things that indicate something and then he \" OR 's \" across the different soft \" OR 's \" across the different  multi - band channels . And  the weight yeah , the target for the training of the \" AND \" \" AND ' ed \" things is something that 's kept  as a hidden variable , and is learned with EM . Whereas what we were doing is is  taking the phone target and then just back propagating from that phd b: So he doesn't have professor a: which means that it 's it 's  i It could be for instance that for a particular point in the data you don't want to   train a particular band train the detectors for a particular band . You you wanna ignore that band , cuz that 's a Ban - band is a noisy noisy measure . professor a: And we don't We 're we 're still gonna try to train it up . In our scheme we 're gonna try to train it up to do as well well as it can at predicting . phd b: So he doesn't have to have truth marks or Ho grad e: F right , and  he doesn't have to have hard labels . professor a: Well at the at the tail end , yeah , he has to know what 's where it 's sonorant . But he 's but what he 's - but what he 's not training up  what he doesn't depend on as truth is grad e: Right . professor a:  I guess one way of describing would be if if a sound is sonorant is it sonorant in this band ? Is it sonorant in that band ? grad e: Right . professor a: Is it sonorant in that band ? i It 's hard to even answer that what you really mean is that the whole sound is sonorant . professor a: then it comes down to , you know , to what extent should you make use of information from particular band towards making your decision . And   we 're making in a sense sort of this hard decision that you should you should use everything  with with  equal strength . professor a: And  because in the ideal case we would be going for posterior probabilities , if we had  enough data to really get posterior probabilities and if the if we also had enough data so that it was representative of the test data then we would in fact be doing the right thing to train everything as hard as we can . But  this is something that 's more built up along an idea of robustness from from the beginning and so you don't necessarily want to train everything up towards the phd b: So where did he get his  his tar his  high - level targets about what 's sonorant and what 's not ? grad e: From  canonical mappings  at first phd b: OK . grad e: and then it 's unclear  eh phd b: Using TIMIT ? or using grad e: using TIMIT phd b:  - huh .  we ha we have a kind of iterative training because we do this embedded Viterbi ,  so there is some something that 's suggested , based on the data but it 's it 's not I think it s doesn't seem like it 's quite the same , cuz of this cuz then whatever that alignment is , it 's that for all all bands . professor a: Well no , that 's not quite right , we did actually do them separate tried to do them separately so that would be a little more like what he did . But it 's still not quite the same because then it 's it 's  setting targets based on where you would say the sound begins in a particular band . Might be closer I guess if we did a soft soft target   embedded neural net training like we 've done a few times  f the forward  do the forward calculations to get the gammas and train on those .  what 's next ? phd b: I could say a little bit about w stuff I 've been playing with . You 're playing ? phd b: I  Huh ? professor a: You 're playing ? phd b: Yes , I 'm playing .  so I wanted to do this experiment to see   what happens if we try to  improve the performance of the back - end recognizer for the Aurora task and see how that affects things . And so I had this  I think I sent around last week a this plan I had for an experiment , this matrix where I would take the  the original  the original system . So there 's the original system trained on the mel cepstral features and then com and then  optimize the b HTK system and run that again . So look at the difference there and then  do the same thing for the ICSI - OGI front - end . professor a: What which test set was this ? phd b: This is that I looked at ? professor a:   phd b: So as far as I 've gotten is I 've  been able to go through from beginning to end the  full HTK system for the Italian data and got the same results that  that  Stephane had . So  I started looking to and now I 'm I 'm sort of lookin at the point where I wanna know what should I change in the HTK back - end in order to try to  to improve it . One of the first things I thought of was the fact that they use the same number of states for all of the models professor a:   phd b: and so I went on - line and I  found a pronunciation dictionary for Italian digits professor a:   phd b: and just looked at , you know , the number of phones in each one of the digits .  you know , sort of the canonical way of setting up a an  system is that you use  three states per phone and  so then the the total number of states for a word would just be , you know , the number of phones times three . And so when I did that for the Italian digits , I got a number of states , ranging on the low end from nine to the high end , eighteen . Now you have to really add two to that because in HTK there 's an initial null and a final null so when they use  models that have eighteen states , there 're really sixteen states . And so  their guess of eighteen states seems to be pretty well matched to the two longest words of the Italian digits , the four and five which  , according to my , you know , sort of off the cuff calculation , should have eighteen states each . So my guess  And then if you I I printed out a confusion matrix   for the well - matched case , and it turns out that the longest words are actually the ones that do the best . So my guess about what 's happening is that you know , if you assume a fixed the same amount of training data for each of these digits and a fixed length model for all of them but the actual words for some of them are half as long you really  have , you know , half as much training data for those models . Because if you have a long word and you 're training it to eighteen states ,  you 've got you know , you 've got the same number of Gaussians , you 've gotta train in each case , professor a:   phd b: but for the shorter words , you know , the total number of frames is actually half as many . phd b: So it could be that , you know , for the short words there 's because you have so many states , you just don't have enough data to train all those Gaussians . So  I 'm going to try to  create more word - specific   prototype H M Ms to start training from . professor a: Yeah , it 's not at all uncommon you do worse on long word on short words than long words anyway just because you 're accumulating more evidence for the for the longer word , phd b:   phd b: Yeah so I 'll I 'll , the next experiment I 'm gonna try is to just  you know create  models that seem to be more w matched to my guess about how long they should be . phd b: And as part of that  I wanted to see sort of how the  how these models were coming out , you know , what w when we train up  th you know , the model for \" one \" , which wants to have nine states , you know , what is the  what do the transition probabilities look like in the self - loops , look like in in those models ? And so I talked to Andreas and he explained to me how you can calculate the expected duration of an  just by looking at the transition matrix professor a:   phd b: and so I wrote a little Matlab script that calculates that and so I 'm gonna sort of print those out for each of the words to see what 's happening , you know , how these models are training up , professor a:   I d I did quickly , I did the silence model and and  that 's coming out with about one point two seconds as its average duration and the silence model 's the one that 's used at the beginning and the end of each of the string of digits . And so the S P model , which is what they put in between digits , I I haven't calculated that for that one yet , but  . So they basically their their model for a whole digit string is silence digit , SP , digit , SP blah - blah - blah and then silence at the end . professor a: Are the SP 's optional ?  skip them ? phd b: I have to look at that , but I 'm not sure that they are . Now the one thing about the S P model is really it only has a single s emitting state to it . phd b: So if it 's not optional , you know , it 's it 's not gonna hurt a whole lot professor a: I see . phd b: and it 's tied to the center state of the silence model so it 's not its own  It doesn't require its own training data , professor a:   phd b: So it , it 's pretty good the way that they have it set up , but  i So I wanna play with that a little bit more . I 'm curious about looking at , you know how these models have trained and looking at the expected durations of the models and I wanna compare that in the the well - matched case f to the unmatched case , and see if you can get an idea of just from looking at the durations of these models , you know , what what 's happening . professor a: Yeah , I think that  , as much as you can , it 's good to d sort of not do anything really tricky . professor a: Not do anything that 's really finely tuned , but just sort of eh you know you t you i z phd b: Yeah . professor a: The premise is kind of you have a a good person look at this for a few weeks and what do you come up with ? phd b:   professor a: And  phd b: And Hynek , when I wa told him about this , he had an interesting point , and that was th  the the final models that they end up training up have I think probably something on the order of six Gaussians per state . And Hynek was saying that well , probably in a real application , you wouldn't have enough compute to handle models that are very big or complicated . But you know , it depends on what the actual application is and it 's really hard to know what your limits are in terms of how many Gaussians you can have . professor a: I I I what I thought you were gonna say i but which I was thinking was  where did six come from ? Probably came from the same place eighteen came from . professor a:  that 's another parameter , right ? that that maybe , you know ,  you really want three or nine or phd b: Yeah , yeah . Well one thing  , if I if if I start  reducing the number of states for some of these shorter models that 's gonna reduce the total number of Gaussians . professor a: how much better can you make it ? And  since they 're only simple things there 's nothing that you 're gonna do that is going to blow up the amount of computation phd b:   professor a: if you found that nine was better than six that would be O K , I think , actually . I really wasn't even gonna play with that part of the system yet , professor a:  -  , OK . phd b: I was just gonna change the the t professor a: Yeah , just work with the models , yeah . So  what 's  I guess your plan for You you you guys ' plan for the next next week is just continue on these these same things we 've been talking about for Aurora and phd c: Yeah , I guess we can try to have some kind of new baseline for next week perhaps . And then do other things , play with the spectral subtraction , and retry the MSG and things like that . I think that after all of this   confusion settles down in another some point a little later next year there will be some sort of standard and it 'll get out there and hopefully it 'll have some effect from something that that has  been done by our group of people but  e even if it doesn't there 's there 's go there 'll be standards after that . phd b: Does anybody know how to  run Matlab sort of in batch mode like you c send it s a bunch of commands to run and it gives you the output . Is it possible to do that ? grad e: I I think  Mike tried it phd b: Yeah ? grad e: and he says it 's impossible so he went to Octave . phd c: What is Octave so ? It 's a free software ? grad e: What 's that ?  , Octave ? phd c: Yeah . phd c: And it does the same syntax and everything eh like Matlab , or ? grad e:  i it 's a little behind , it 's the same syntax but it 's a little behind in that Matlab went to these like  you can have cells and you can you can  implement object - oriented type things with Matlab .  Octave doesn't do that yet , so I think you , Octave is kinda like Matlab  four point something or . phd b: If it 'll do like a lot of the basic matrix and vector stuff grad e: The basic stuff , right "

        "Query": "Why was the concept of an intelligent controller proposed by the user interface designer and disapproved by the project manager?",
        "Summary": "The user interface designer proposed incorporating speech recognition and gesture recognition technologies into the controller for convenience and to differentiate it from traditional controllers. However, the project manager raised concerns about the reliability of these features and the potential increase in cost. The designer suggested collaborating with a research institute to address these issues, as the vocabulary would be limited and language adaptations could be made for international users. Despite these solutions, there were still unresolved problems with the necessary microphone and camera for the technologies.",

So I will first  marketing: No y you do the minutes first , or ? project manager: What ? marketing: No ? project manager: I I think I will let  our User Interface Designer speak first , Mister David Jordan . The second concept is a fancy controller ,  so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive ,  they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g  industrial designer:  . industrial designer: marketing: user interface: Yeah , it's very , you know project manager: It's very big , user interface: if you're project manager: yeah . marketing: user interface: It's hard f i it's easy for you to remember it . user interface: so maybe we should  use   technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and  gesture recognition . project manager: I just have one question , because for the intelligent controller , you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition , user interface: Yeah . project manager: but as the  expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels . Do you think they will be able to use gestures ? user interface: Yeah , so project manager: Because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ? user interface: Y marketing: industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , I think they will be bored after a while . You don't think so ? user interface:  I think some time it's very  convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button . user interface: For example , if you cannot find your  controller , you can just  just just  speak something such as , yeah , one two . project manager: I industrial designer: Oh yeah , that's a good that's a good point , so . industrial designer: marketing: Yeah but how how is how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition ? project manager: Broken arm ? user interface: For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very marketing: Okay . project manager: Yeah , but suppose you have a family watching T_V_ , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you think it will work ?

It's It's it means when you when you sell this controller in China it's can recognise Chinese . industrial designer: It's a very smart , it's a very smart controller maybe project manager: okay . user interface: Yeah , project manager: And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ? user interface: it's industrial designer: Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah . project manager: Yeah , but how will you user interface: So industrial designer: Yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one . industrial designer: because  the for example for Se user interface: Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to industrial designer: Oh really ? That's project manager: Oh . marketing: but then w Yeah , industrial designer: Comple user interface: No , it's not so complex . marketing: we have to take care of the twelve Euros project manager: And what about voice recognition , do we have microphones ? marketing: problem . project manager: And where will be they ? Do you think if we're far from television it will work ? user interface: No no no it's not I think that's n that's not a problem because you you don't have to wear a microphone . industrial designer: project manager: Yeah , but we're marketing: No , but then it's it's like this  project manager: here it's  an object . project manager: Yeah , but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object . user interface: Yeah yeah just you just put the controller here , then you industrial designer: I if you say one , he switch to channel , user interface: you use your command project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: yeah . user interface: No no it's n y if you lose it industrial designer: So well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the T_V_ to switch to channel one . project manager: Okay you so you can build a kind of black box industrial designer: Devic project manager: and put it on T_V_ and just to recognize gestures and voice . Or is it do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ? Or you you still have the possibility to use buttons ? user interface: think it we should give the  flexibility to the user and we think marketing: Okay , so you project manager: Yeah , user interface: yeah . user interface: No , project manager: And maybe it will be quite user interface: that's quite inter quite attractive . industrial designer: But I think that , you know , switching from one country to to another will be a problem , so although y y user interface: Well , if you do language adaptation , there should be no problem . marketing: What ? project manager: Which kind of controller would you prefer to use , you as a remote control user ? marketing: If if  ,  I'm sure if the user pays the same price , he's happy to have recognition . industrial designer: Yeah , but marketing: But if if if it like doubles  industrial designer: I think he need a control that is very reliable , marketing: no one would would be interested . project manager: So I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller . user interface: project manager: Just want to have something controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy . You think it's possible ? user interface: Yeah but if if you stick to  stick to the first two parts . So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ? There's no k features of our controller , so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ? industrial designer: Yeah . No , user interface: Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that marketing:  industrial designer: It's not really the we marketing: Y industrial designer: we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet , so or something like that . But  I think a user need user interface: Yeah , you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller , that's a function of T_V_ . You can replace your T_V_ with a new T_V_ with internet browsing function , marketing: No , user interface: but marketing: but you need you need new remote controller then . Because if you wanna browse internet or , I don't know , if you wanna type something , industrial designer: Don't have a the the Yeah user interface: Okay . user interface: But it's not the only the problem only the issue of controller , it's it's also the issue of the T_V_ . industrial designer: Because the p the problem I can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example if marketing: Cause for example yeah . user interface: Yeah , but we do we do we we we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller , marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , but  we want so user interface: but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , but you when you choose a new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition . user interface: the feature is not one hundred percent reliable , but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our from other products . project manager: Yeah , but w we we want something th that works all the time , every day , every hour , for everyone . industrial designer: And for all the person of the family maybe , user interface: Yeah ,  project manager: You don't need to tune it . user interface: Yeah , if if if if you're if you ar if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable , would you replace it with another one ? project manager: Yeah , why not ? If it's marketing: for example the goo y industrial designer: Because you have new marketing: you say we would we would to have a Google-like controller . marketing: I don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like Google . marketing: so I I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it's already a lot . marketing:  thi this  , the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition user interface: The then nn marketing: or user interface: no . marketing: if he has something that works fine and is really fancy , looks nice and it's easy easy to use , easy to use . user interface: But the there's there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller . marketing: See user interface: That's the same marketing: That's the problem , user interface: yeah .  , I I know it's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever . marketing: But you have to think , the user is the one who gonna buy the product user interface: Yeah . project manager: Two ? industrial designer: Yeah , participant two  project manager: Working ? industrial designer: Yeah , working design , user interface: industrial designer: so . marketing: industrial designer: So I think project manager: I can industrial designer: Can you go to the next one ? I  it's not this one . industrial designer: It's  oth the oth so I marketing: industrial designer: It's the working design . project manager: It's okay industrial designer: So this yeah so this is the described use project manager: industrial designer: What ? Are you inst project manager:  I think there's something wrong with your user interface: It did didn't r receive it . project manager: It seems that we have a problem with the marketing: I dunno if you remember what you had to say or industrial designer: I can say it to you without . project manager: Yeah , so user interface: Yeah , maybe we can first come to project manager: No , I think it will be more interesting to start with  user interface:  to Frahan . With Frahan , then you can prepare your slides , marketing: I think it's more interesting what he says , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: exac marketing: project manager: You will had s some more information in industrial designer: Okay . industrial designer: I s because i in my presentation I don't have here with user interface: project manager: Okay , never mind . industrial designer: so It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r user interface: Okay . So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside user interface: Okay . So I in fact the the f something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use , project manager: industrial designer: so will it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one . industrial designer: so it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like L_C_D_ where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night , project manager: industrial designer: And the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be for example  d  solar energy alimentation user interface: -huh . And I think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have  both of them , so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities  for example in some place in in S Senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come user interface: industrial designer: and so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con It can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example . project manager: Yeah , I think it's an added value to the remote control industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers industrial designer: Ecologists , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . project manager: and but about the the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more , industrial designer: project manager: no ? industrial designer: Alrigh In fact , having them both will if we want to have battery , regular battery and and the solar energy battery it could be it'll it will add a little bit of the price , project manager: So . project manager: And what tha what about the  materials ? industrial designer: And the materials , it depends for example you if you have a wooden material it can be more the plastic material is more common project manager: Impersonal , industrial designer: it's very resistant but , you know , something wooden will be like , I don't know high cl so a special high class , project manager: Yeah . marketing: Special for industrial designer: or you know , you can have some project manager: Yeah , and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood . industrial designer: Yeah , even if it is not completely wood , but just a part of the , you know , will be wooden , in wood user interface: industrial designer: And so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , it depends , but I think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module . project manager: Yeah , we want something easy to use and so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough . project manager: And you think that we will be industrial designer: Yeah , I think it will fit on the price we want , twel twelve Euros , project manager: Okay . industrial designer: project manager: And what about the buttons ? industrial designer: I think the buttons I pr I prefer , you know , the L_C_D_ you know lighted buttons because , you know , it's I don't know  yeah , in the dark , it's fashion project manager: No it's fashion , yeah . industrial designer: and it's related to how beautiful it is or  if you want to watch T_V_ in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness it's very easy so , right . industrial designer: I think a touch screen will be t as expensive as the L_C_D_ buttons so .  , I think so , just Yeah , so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of  have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , so next . project manager: marketing: So again , it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting . Like the one you've shown , David , with all the buttons and  i i it sounds good technically user interface:  . marketing: but it's it's not what they want and  So , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on . Wha what we really see this year is that  everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables , industrial designer: Ah yes . marketing: okay , so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing . And then  if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance . marketing: So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , and then if we combine this with the fashion  from Milan and Paris industrial designer: And fruit and vegetables yeah . And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch , industrial designer: Spongy 'Kay . industrial designer: Yeah , but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ? marketing: Yeah thi this is this would be like  industrial designer: Pla S marketing: plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like  industrial designer: Very stuff Okay , rubber rubber desi okay , yeah . marketing: Okay , tha tha that was the main point , I think , from the trend in fashion . So , as you say you want something technologically innovative , maybe using solar energy and with battery would be something interesting , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager:  cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be  enough to have something working well . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: industrial designer: No wood but Plastic ? marketing: Maybe not no wood , but  ma maybe not the part you touching you know . industrial designer: Would some user interface: Pla project manager: Maybe you industrial designer: I think we can have wood for example in the bottom and , you know . marketing: But still y project manager: Th The feeling is natural , industrial designer: Yeah , it's natural marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: And it can be correlated to energy , solar energy , so for the marketing aspect , you know , saying that it's ecol marketing: Yeah ,  it's not exactly right for the spongy point of view . marketing: But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons , industrial designer: Okay . project manager:  and what about the user interface concept ? industrial designer: Google and project manager: Google and fancy ? industrial designer: and fancy , f how about the the voice ? And project manager: Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this . industrial designer:  maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested user interface:  yes . industrial designer: But and the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the T_V_ , so speak directly to the T_V_ and you don't need a remote control actually , project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: so . industrial designer: But it will be embedded on the T_V_ and not on the remote control , so . project manager: So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller , marketing: I dunno . project manager: maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood . project manager: Yeah , I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add . And pf what can we think a supplement to marketing: What interface ? project manager: Yeah , for the interface something added value . It is just , you know , it is not the most important , but it can be a part of project manager: With a module ? You mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . So the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes so we'll you will all have to work in in your direction . So you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the  simple vocal commands recognition . project manager:  you will have to work more , Baba , on the  spongy way to to add spongy  touch to the buttons industrial designer: expensive buttons Yeah , to make some new project manager: and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control . project manager: And remember as as I said last meeting , we really have to build a fashion remote control and  the colour of the  the society will be really it will be seen in the remote control . project manager: So you will have Baba and David Jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us  modelling a cl a clay remote control , user interface: Yeah . Yep project manager: And I think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach <doc-sep>And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly . industrial designer: project manager: user interface: industrial designer: Well , I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and  user interface:  . B did you send us an email about this ? project manager: not yet , user interface: industrial designer: project manager: but if you want user interface: Yeah , we we received an email about this  d designs . project manager: Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ? industrial designer: user interface: Ah it's Okay . marketing: I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . user interface: 'Kay , we can project manager: So there are so we have three user interface: So there are three kinds of designs , that's all . project manager: So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? Any any volunteer ? industrial designer: I think our  responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager . user interface: Are you using the you are doing the in industrial designer: Yeah I I'm I'm Well , maybe we have okay so I industrial design . It was a little confusion about my  project manager: user interface: Ah industrial designer: but it's alright . industrial designer: Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done project manager: industrial designer: and what are your ideas about the project manager: About the design or Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ? industrial designer: Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess . industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno I project manager: And of course it should not be very costly . industrial designer: Well I I think that Norman and I would think about  the technical points and  we should discuss it in the next meeting , or user interface: Need to collect information .  , what is most important in a in a remote control ? What is the most important function aspect ?  . project manager: You won't user interface: Or or you can say for example ,  I want  to list all the programme tonight . Y you know , instead of  remote control it's doing the some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . project manager: I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . user interface: No , because no , project manager: S user interface: it's not very a lot . industrial designer: I I think if you want t to choose  from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use  w  I dunno marketing: I'm a okay . marketing:  the main  function of remote control is to have something in the hand project manager: In the hand . marketing: If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog user interface: Yeah . marketing: if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . industrial designer: marketing:  we have some or something , different technology but project manager: This is it's user interface: Yeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that  there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea project manager: industrial designer: but I I think that technically it would be  a little bit   more tricky to to achieve this than just to user interface: No . They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . user interface: And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons . industrial designer: Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to  navigate  through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so project manager: This is good idea . Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? industrial designer: Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen user interface: Good idea . industrial designer: and just  with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f user interface: I think I think that will be revol revolutionary . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: Because all the T_V_  the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . So I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff user interface: Okay . project manager: So we have five minutes to user interface: Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . project manager: Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we industrial designer: user interface: Five minutes . marketing: And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of user interface: Okay . marketing: So , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark  some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . industrial designer: Oh right so user interface: Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: Be before before writing you can  sit and that says what we what we said user interface:  . So so the most functional des  the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . The user can choose w which one they want , right ? industrial designer: Yeah , by content or by channel , user interface: By content or by channel . user interface: Okay , so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content . industrial designer: I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so user interface: Okay . And  industrial designer: I think that's the the things to do user interface: The main thing . user interface: So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get  the funct this is the functional designer ? That's the first aspect . project manager: So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ? And we'll discuss the other other aspects <doc-sep>industrial designer: project manager: So in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare a prototype for the for the remote control . And  so we have and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes , because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an L_C_D_ or not because it's too expensive . industrial designer: You can  choose the direction and if you just push on it it's considered like a enter function . industrial designer: You have on the  on the side here the microphone for the for the speech recognition system here . user interface: industrial designer: And here the the switch that control if you want project manager: Why you why you you put it in the the side ? industrial designer: Well I I I think  it's the project manager: It's not a good place maybe . industrial designer: Yeah but user interface: No i i it's the all around camer  microphone isn't it . marketing: Is it an only a single mic or a microphone array ? industrial designer: Well so it's a microphone array . industrial designer: No user interface: Yeah industrial designer: it's just a single microphone , and you I I think  we we put it here because I think when you when you are browsing your L_C_D_ you will be close to user interface:  . industrial designer: well it's better to to to place it here th than here , for instance . industrial designer: And here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker  recognition system to  to be on or off . project manager: How much does it cost this one ? industrial designer: Well this this prototype is  made for about  well fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars user interface: For the project manager: Fifteen dollars ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: fifteen dollars , project manager: Ah it's above it's above the budget . industrial designer: but  well it's not it's not  yeah , but  it's just a prototype and if we  if we optimises the  the  voila . project manager: How many b battery is there ? industrial designer: How many , excuse me ? project manager: Battery . industrial designer: Well  f battery , we use  about  user interface: Is it n the two A_A_s batteries in it . industrial designer: Yeah and you just project manager: So one one battery ? industrial designer: On  yeah one battery . industrial designer: marketing: user interface: You just n  marketing: Now what is the whole day rating for that ? industrial designer: The excuse me ? marketing: Whole day's rating . user interface: marketing: What type of battery ? industrial designer: Oh yeah it's just a r  simple battery a rechargeable  user interface: Yeah yeah . industrial designer: So and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Then the next time you pick it , oh project manager: industrial designer: it works . user interface: I forgot to tell you there is only a single button there , b this button industrial designer: Yeah just explain the button  Norman . This button is like the mouse is like a joystick , industrial designer: user interface: you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction so you can make a turn and it the additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have a click you have a double click all in a single button . industrial designer: user interface: You can move up , down , left , right , or you can do a swing . So even though it's a single button , but it is pretty s flexible because of the three hundred and sixty degree movement . marketing: And the L_C_D_ is this one , on the remote ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: project manager: I think it's not a good idea because after maybe one or two months of function is getting destroyed . project manager: industrial designer: Yeah it's project manager: industrial designer: So we have the the second version also with the different  button configuration . marketing: industrial designer: So basically th it's the same  marketing: -huh and also the switch . user interface: marketing: And I think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger , user interface: Oh no marketing: because that's a major that's a user interface: th actually th we'll come to that point in our industrial designer: Yeah it's it's it's embed in the  speech recognition system . marketing: Okay industrial designer: So marketing: and if you disable speech recognition system then ? user interface: W w I'll I'll come to that point later on . user interface: Th they either these with the  the the charger any project manager: With the remote control . project manager: Okay so the price of the charger included in the user interface:  it's a standard module so you should get it for a cheap price  . user interface: It's that same charger that you can use for the hand-phone but  again depends on the types . I think we have to investigate more on that , but project manager: The price should be below twelve and a half Euro . Yeah project manager: Well that's so user interface: but as the Marketing Manager says , people is willing to people are willing to pay more for good design . project manager: We have we have just marketing: Yeah people are willing to pay more , user interface: industrial designer: marketing: but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment . project manager: And the price of production user interface: industrial designer: Alright please  go on Norman with the special features . marketing: Or  user interface: Yeah we'll we'll come up to that , the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular so you want more function you pay more . If you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system , marketing: user interface: so is  modular . user interface: Yeah yeah , project manager: user interface: for example the L_C_D_ , you can take it you can put it put it back in , or you can use the other one , marketing: Something like customised . industrial designer: user interface: You want a microphone to put in the speech recogniser you don't wan you pay less for the system you see . industrial designer: You also have the the the two other modules for the parental control project manager: But user interface:  yeah yeah you should present that . industrial designer: that that you ca you can add up to the to your remote control marketing: And this is other one ? user interface: industrial designer: i i if you  if you want to to have more more power on what you do , and  which channel you want to choose and so on . industrial designer: H here is just the the the module for the kids and th if the parents want to watch T_V_ , up they come up with their modules , marketing:     . industrial designer: they just plug in it user interface: Yeah industrial designer: and they can have all the control they want here . industrial designer: We also have this module for  old people with big buttons , clearly labelled , user interface:  . Simplicity meaning that we have few buttons , powerful is that all the controls with the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n but here you only have few buttons but you retain the  the same powerful functionalities . So that's the best idea , the cond that that's our  an innovation   i in this  design here . The first one is the speech recogniser , again it's detachable or add-on . And then we also have security feature for example this here oop industrial designer: user interface: it's very robust , it doesn't break and the material , what's the material again ? industrial designer: The titanium project manager: Titanium . industrial designer: and so it's very  user interface: Again  and the battery life is  is an is an endurable one , again because this is A_A_ batteries you can choose the types of battery you want . user interface: Lithium-ion may be a good one , but you can replace it with cheaper one , again you pay for what you get , and then  y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder . So when you finish watching your T_V_ and you the you t you turn off the T_V_ ,  and then there's this message coming out that  please put that back to the charger , so so that's the or is it marketing: Okay . Yeah and  And it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary , so we didn't define the vocabulary so it's up to the user to define marketing:     . user interface: so sorry ? project manager: industrial designer: marketing: user interface: And then  because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a a of T_V_ programmes by genre , and this can be used by the adult or by the children . So it's pretty powerful , and that's that's why the num buttons are reduced , because of this feature . project manager: What what's user interface: Maybe we can improve more on the design but project manager: Maybe yeah . industrial designer: project manager: What's the price to p to produce ? user interface:  this is the industrial designer: Well so the price to produce For  the simplest one , say we start from four dollars to produce such a device . project manager: With with with the charge ? industrial designer:  it's about it The without without the charger marketing: With the charger ? project manager: Okay . user interface: Yeah industrial designer: it's about  well two dollars to produce  the microphone and speech recognition systems . user interface: industrial designer: Two dollars for the  for the add-on modules , and finally three dollars for the charger . So if you  sum up  everything wi with the L_C_D_ , which costs two dollar , you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two . industrial designer: so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about  fifteen dollars . project manager: No it's industrial designer: But it's just if you want all functionalities . user interface: marketing: Yeah it's a nice input project manager: We marketing: but we have an other inputs from the l public demands . project manager: marketing: I think we will just have a rough look and then we can make our statements , and we can finalise the product based on this discu user interface: Yeah . user interface: marketing: So the marketing made an evaluation criteria and these were some of the findings , and  in the market the people are not really interested with L_C_D_ , without L_C_D_ , with speech recognition interface , or without speech recognition interface , but most of the people what they are interested is first thing is , they want to have an fancy look and feel , it should be very fancy with colourful and  very handy to hold . user interface: marketing: Of course in that we could put L_C_D_ or recognition to be more technologically innovative . industrial designer: Well I think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself since we haven't yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the T_V_ screen   with just four buttons . marketing: Okay and if we go to the next slide , here you can find these are the latest fashion updates , and so this in Paris and Milan they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable , so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable , or whatever they like . marketing: And the second thing is , and if the material , they really do not want it to be very hard , as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium , it should be somewhat spongy . user interface: But the the problem is that  is it robust to mishandling ? industrial designer: Okay . user interface: We have you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy . user interface: marketing: So these are the f  three criteria on which we are going to build our remote . marketing: say that we have a seven point scale , from one to seven , user interface: industrial designer: marketing: So now you have with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ , user interface:  . marketing: so on this scale , if it is true , if it is if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one , or if it is false , it doesn't it looks  it doesn't look much fancy , then you could just tell me seven . So user interface: So marketing: We can make our study on this and user interface: so is the e evaluation depending on us or other users ? marketing: No no we have you have designed two products now , project manager: Yeah . user interface: But who will give the scoring  we ourself or or a third party ? project manager: You . marketing: According to you , no according to you designers , how will feel does it  with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ ? user interface:  . marketing: D is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy ? industrial designer: Well it doesn't look much fancy I'll I'll say three or four . marketing: And you both agree for that ? project manager: And you ? user interface: I think we can improve on the design . It's it it project manager: user interface:  we have been focused all all this time on the on the technical aspect , functional aspect , but also the simplicity . marketing: So I take three on with L_C_D_ ? industrial designer: Yeah a three . marketing: So without L_C_D_ how would you rate it ? user interface: Yeah . I think it's it's  more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated marketing: Four . industrial designer: so removing the L_C_D_  gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look . industrial designer: Well it's it's the same for both so I will give a five , six . marketing: Five with L_C_D_ and user interface: industrial designer: Well five also  Norman please . user interface: Yeah project manager:  user interface: from the innovation aspect I feel that  what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting is that  the retrieval of T_V_ programmes by content , because  that is really innovative , and for now and another innovation we have is simplicity and simplicity , few buttons , we've  A lot of functionalities . user interface: So that is  that is  for both th marketing: So without L_C_D_ ? user interface: Our gi I think that the our our product is  has the best in all well this is a biased judgement industrial designer: user interface: because we designed them . marketing: No no according to design aspect we want to know how would you feel the innovativeness ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: And without L_C_D_ ? industrial designer:  for both it's the the same innovations . So I there is high innovativeness included if you make it with L_C_D_ y industrial designer: Yeah . user interface:    there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the L_C_D_ ? marketing: So we can't go project manager: industrial designer: Talk about user interface: We haven't really  determined what are actually actually project manager: marketing:  that what you are sayin that's what the design user interface: it's good to have a L_C_D_ but what are we gonna display on a L_C_D_ ? industrial designer: marketing: No it's like this , project manager: marketing:  on the L_C_D_ , according to what I understand from your model is , you have a joystick here , and you have L_C_D_ , you just press your joystick , you get here a programme . Yeah but industrial designer: Yeah project manager: But industrial designer: but you have the same programme on the T_V_ screen . marketing: No on the T_V_ you don't it doesn't display on the T_V_ now . industrial designer: If you have the L_C_D_ , but if n marketing: L_C_D_ ? Then  there is no meaning in having it on the T_V_ . marketing: Or then again you have a channels , volume and all the stuff and what a user interface: But you cannot display all on a L_C_D_ . marketing:  that depends upon your design , so user interface: Anyway for for the users who who who opt for L_C_D_ we'll give them the give them the L_C_D_ , marketing:  user interface: we give what the customer  wants , right . user interface: marketing: So without L_C_D_ you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness ? And which do you recommend e easy to use , with L_C_D_ or without L_C_D_ ? user interface: industrial designer: Well I think both are really easy to use because there are few button buttons , user interface: Yeah industrial designer: and  well t p the menu are clear , well-organised , so user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Well with little knowing of the technology you can you can easily use the product user interface: industrial designer: so I will give a six for the easy to use . user interface: Yeah I think project manager: No it's just if I I see the the f the rate I think it's better to do it without L_C_D_ . project manager: Because that's with L_C_D_ just will increase the price , marketing: Yeah . project manager: and I thi i they have the same rate so without L_C_D_ it will be user interface: Yeah . marketing: Or we can just go back to the previous slide  where we ha we have a few updates . S industrial designer: And  if the the well if we have less technology we have more liberty to  for the shape and  things like that so marketing: Yeah that's right . For kids they want simply the s similarit for the old people they want simplicity , marketing: Yeah yeah that's right .  we can ha have build a more complex design if if they want it , but but  what I'm trying to say here is that the  we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people . marketing: So without L_C_D_ I just take it five ? project manager: user interface: W  marketing: Or you want it to be six ? user interface: I think it's the same . industrial designer: Yes as you say , with better  project manager: Without L_C_D_ . marketing: S s oh I think it's better to have this without L_C_D_ . marketing: As our Programme Manager s Pro Project Manager says that without L_C_D_ it is going to reduce the cost also , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yes and to give us more liberty to have a fancy look so user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: so let's go back to our laboratory and user interface: To improve on the design . project manager: what about the integration of speech recognition ? user interface: Huh ? The speech recogniser is a add-on module . industrial designer: It's optional yeah , since well according to this study  people more likes more to have a spongy  remote control than project manager: I think it will be I think i user interface: marketing: Yeah . project manager: I think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control , because maybe parents will lose these  marketing: Yeah , but  if you have an add-ons , the kids may just  hide the parental module project manager: Yeah . project manager: Or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or , industrial designer: project manager: so mayb better if you have all this in the same marketing: In the same set , yeah , project manager: marketing: and and individual buttons to make them work . user interface: The problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component , and doesn't want the parental control because it's a couple who do not have children when you sell the product in the market you could meet any kind of people , and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them . I don't know , project manager: So you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional  will be optional . user interface: what do you think  ? Yes exa what do you think , I don't know . project manager:  marketing:  how to how to how to make a marketing survey that  how many married couple or how many couples have a T_V_ user interface: Yeah . But the the question is n does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost ? project manager: I think it inc increase . industrial designer: Oh no , project manager: industrial designer: because if you if you add  something well yeah maybe because it's three different pieces  to to to build but project manager:  . industrial designer: Yeah yeah yeah user interface: industrial designer: it's I think it's cheaper if you if you already built the all the functionalities  on the same module , but  user interface:  . marketing: On the same P_C_B_ user interface: Well well the other aspect is that if in the when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the you're gonna keep the same customer , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah i i so if don't don't buy now they can buy i in the future . So in in that way you're actually keeping the cus the same customer , attracting them to come back in again and again . industrial designer: user interface: We're not trying to follow the Microsoft and we don't want to the m project manager: marketing: Updates and we sell it . industrial designer: user interface: Yeah well if the buyers can be up the th would be can be upgraded , it would be a good thing right ? project manager: industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: And  what's the idea about  the shape of the remote controls ? industrial designer: Well so marketing:  can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types ? industrial designer: Yeah yeah marketing: Do you require different types of P_C_B_s and industrial designer: I think we are yeah but we are also the  well the components will have to change because  we have to deal with the shape and  but I don't think it will  increase the cost too much so user interface:  . marketing: Or  it could be like this the P_C_B_ would be the same for all , but only the exterior  shape is different o for all . industrial designer:  well but it's a bit complicated to if if if you need machines to different machines to  ah well user interface: Yeah . For example the i the mobile phones nowaday , they sell different kinds of skin marketing: Yeah , yeah that's right . industrial designer: and then  add on skins and with with this  tex spongy texture  things like that . project manager: So industrial designer: So we finished the prototype  presentation if you have  something else to say . user interface: marketing: I think the Project Manager would be interested to look about the financial issues in making these models . We have to give answers so marketing: user interface: I suppose that you this criteria , is it ? project manager: Project evaluation . This room is a bit small , but industrial designer: project manager: user interface: but I think it's okay for us to work with . marketing: I feel it's fine , we know we don't need  I think it's okay . marketing:   what type of product would you think could we make this more interesting ? user interface:  we I I know something , we need more cakes , more biscuits on the table while we have meetings . industrial designer: Yeah and also more well  more seriously I think it's it's a good idea to have  clear clear points whenever we do a meeting marketing: user interface:  . industrial designer:  prior to the meeting to have  well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that , but I think it's alright . marketing: And the evaluation was project manager: Without without L_C_D_ , without speech recognition , it will be simple . marketing: So project manager: Yeah free free coffee user interface: Alright then , we finished ? industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Yeah thank you for your work and marketing: Yeah thank you , thank you very much "

        "Query": "What are the future prospects for data collection?",
        "Summary": "In the second phase of data collection, the group plans to use more complex scenarios to generate intricate dialogues. To ensure an adequate number of participants, subjects will be recruited from within the Psychology department, as their participation in experiments is mandatory. The group's goal is to collect over 100 hours of Meeting Recorder data, and they are currently revising the speaker consent forms. It has been proposed that subjects should sign a new consent form after every 10 recording sessions.",
        "Article": "professor a: We 're not recording yet , are we ? grad g: Well , I don't think phd f: No , that that wasn't recorded . phd f: I guess I have to d stop doing this sigh of contentment , you know , after sipping cappuccino or something . phd f: I was just noticing a big s professor d: So are we recording now ? Is this phd e: Yeah . professor d: So , what were we gonna talk about again ? So we said we said data collection , which we 're doing . Do we do th do you go around the room and do names or anything ? grad g: I think that phd e: It 's a good idea . grad g: u usually we 've done that and also we 've s done digits as well , but I forgot to print any out . Besides with this big a group , phd b: You can write them on the board , if you want . I it 'd be even better with this big grad g: it would take too much time . phd e: Mari ? postdoc h: What professor a: What ? professor d: It 's not that long . professor d: w u phd e: So that thing the little th that part should be pointing upwards . professor a: It 's kind of professor d: Oh , yeah , the element , yeah , n should be as close to you your mouth as possible . So what we had was that we were gonna talk about data collection , and , you you put up there data format , professor a:  . professor d: and other tasks during data collection , professor a: So , I think the goal the goal was what can we do how can you do the data collection differently to get professor d: and professor a: what can you add to it to get , some information that would be helpful for the user - interface design ? Like grad g: especially for querying . postdoc h: Well , one thing that came up in the morning in the morning was the , i  , if he I ,  if he has s I I don't remember , Mister Lan - Doctor Landry ? grad g: Landay . postdoc h: La - Landay ? So he has , these , tsk note - taking things , professor a:   postdoc h: then that would sort of be a summary which you wouldn't have to solicit . professor a: Well , if if you actually take notes as a summary as opposed to n take notes in the sense of taking advantage of the time - stamps . So action item or  , reminder to send this to so - and - so , blah - blah - blah . grad g: But if we had the CrossPads , we could ask people , you know , if if something comes up write it down and mark it somehow , postdoc h:   And so , you know phd f: the down - side to that is that he sort of indicated that the , quality of the handwriting recognition was quite poor . I don't think there 'd be so many that you couldn't have someone clean it up professor a: So grad g: pretty easily . We also could come up with some code for things that people want to do so that for frequent things . So , if that you know , if if we just keep it simple then maybe it 's still useful . professor d: I just realized we skipped the part that we were saying we were gonna do at the front where we each said who we were . professor a: But anyway , shall we do the roll call ? professor d: No , not a No , I just My mind went elsewhere . So , yeah , I 'm Morgan , and where am I ? I 'm on channel three . postdoc h: Should we have used pseudo - names ? Should we do it a second time with pseudo No . professor d: I 'm Rocky Raccoon on channel phd e: Let me , turn that off . grad g: And , do you want to do the P D As and the P Z phd e: Oh . phd e: PDM - right , PZA - right PDA - right , PDA - left . grad g: Yeah , and eventually once this room gets a little more organized , the Jimlets will be mounted under the table , and these guys will be permanently mounted somehow . postdoc h: I have a question on protocol in these meetings , which is when you say \" Jimlet \" and the person listening won't know what that is , sh shou How how do we get Is that important information ? You know , the Jimlet  , the box that contains the professor d: Well , suppose we broaden out and go to a range of meetings besides just these internal ones . There 's gonna be lots of things that any group of people who know each other have in column common that we will not know . professor d: we we were originally gonna do this with VLSI design , and and and the reason we didn't go straight to that was because immediately ninety percent of what we heard would be jargon to to us . Should we do it and , if so , what 'll we have them do ?  , do we have s people write summaries ? Everybody or one person ? And then , do we ask people for how they would query things ? Is that phd f: There 's there 're sub - problems in that , in that where or when do you actually ask them about that ? professor a: Right . phd f: that was One thing I was thinking about was is that Dan said earlier that , you know , maybe two weeks later , which is when you would want to query these things , you might ask them then . phd f: But there 's a problem with that in that if you 're not If you don't have an interactive system , it 's gonna be hard to go beyond sort of the first level of question . professor d: There 's there 's another problem grad g: And professor d: which is , we certainly do want to branch out beyond , recording meetings about Meeting Recorder . And , once we get out beyond our little group , the people 's motivation factor , reduces enormously . And if we start giving them a bunch of other things to do , how you know , we we did n you know another meeting here for another group and and , they were fine with it . But if we 'd said , \" OK , now all eight of you have to have to come up with , the summar \" grad g: Well , I asked them to and none of them did . grad g: So , I I asked them to send me ideas for queries after the meeting postdoc h:   grad g: So I didn't track them down and say \" please do th do it now \" . professor d: I I 'm worried that if you did even if you did push them into it , it it it might be semi - random , professor a: Right . professor d: as opposed to what you 'd really want to know if you were gonna use this thing . grad g: I just don't know how else to generate the queries other than getting an expert to actually listen to the meeting and say \" that 's important , that might be a query \" . Well , there is this other thing which y which you were alluding to earlier , which is , there are certain key words like , you know , \" action item \" and things like that , which could be used in , t to some degree finding the structure . phd e: Although professor a: W postdoc h: And and I also , was thinking , with reference to the n  , note - taking , the advantage there is that you get structure without the person having to do something artificial later . And the fir third thing I wanted to say is the summaries afterwards , I think they should be recorded instead of written because I think that , it would take so long for people to write that I think you wouldn't get as good a summary . professor a: How about this idea ? That normally at most meetings somebody is delegated to be a note - taker . professor a: And So why don't we just use the notes that somebody takes ? postdoc h: Yeah . grad g: that gives you a summary but it doesn't really How do you generate queries from that ? phd e: Well . But , maybe a summary is one of the things we 'd want from the output of the system . phd b: Actually And so grad g: James and I were talking about this during one of the breaks . And the problem with that is , I 'm definitely going to do something with information retrieval even if it 's sort of not full full - bore what I 'm gonna do for my thesis . And so if someone wants to do that , that 's fine , but it 's not gonna be me . professor d: Well , I think that we  , the the f the core thing is that you know once we get some of these issues nailed down , we need to do a bunch of recordings professor a: Well professor d: and send them off to IBM and get a bunch of transcriptions even if they 're slightly flawed grad g: Yep . professor d: And then , i i we can start l looking and thinking , what do we want to know about these things and at the very least . So , if you could sense just when people are writing , and you tell them not to doodle , or try not to be using that for other purposes , and each person has a note pad . Then you c you can just have a fff plot of wh you know , who 's writing when . But I bet that 's that will allow you to go into the sort of the hot places where people are writing things down . phd b: you can tell when you 're in a meeting when everybody stops to write something down that something was just said . phd b: It may not be kept in the later summary , but at that point in time is was something that was important . phd b: And that wouldn't take any extra postdoc h: That 's a nice idea . phd b: Or someone could just pu you could just put your hand on the pad professor d: It professor c:   It 's professor d: That 's a good idea but that doesn't Maybe I 'm missing something , but that doesn't get to the question of how we come up with queries , right ? professor a: Well , what it does phd b: Well , then you can go to the points where the you could actually go to those points in time and find out what they were talking about . phd b: And grad g: y professor a: I I think it 's an interesting thing . I don't think it gets at the the queries per - se , but it does give us an information fusion sort of thing that , you know , you wanna i say \" what were the hot - points of the meeting ? \" phd b: Yeah . professor d: That that 's what  , is that I think it gets at something interesting but if we were asking the question , which I thought we were , of of of , \" how do we figure out what 's the nature of the queries that people are gonna want to ask of such a system ? \" , knowing what 's important doesn't tell you what people are going to be asking . phd e: Well , see , there are th professor a: I think you could say they 're gonna ask about , when  , when did so - and - so s talk about blah . phd b: At least you can find the locations where there are maybe keywords professor d: Maybe . grad g: i this would tell you what the hit is , phd b: and grad g: not what the query is . grad g: And so you could you can generate a query from the hits , professor a: Right . grad g: but phd b: We don't even know what  , if you want to find out what any user will use , that might be true for one domain and one user , professor d:   professor d: Yeah , but we 're just looking for a place to start with that phd b:  . professor d: because , you know , th what what what James is gonna be doing is looking at the user - interface and he 's looking at the query in in i We we have five hours of pilot data of the other stuff but we have zero hours of of of queries . So he 's just sort of going \" where where do I where do I start ? \" professor a: w Well , th you could do I think the summaries actually may help get us there , professor d: OK . One , if you have a summary if you have a bunch of summaries , you can do a word frequency count and see what words come up in different types of meetings . professor a: So \" action item \" is gonna come up whether it 's a VLSI meeting , or speech meeting , or whatever . So words that come up in different types of meetings may be something that you would want to query about . professor a: the second thing you could possibly do with it is just run a little pilot experiment with somebody saying \" here 's a summary of a meeting , what questions might you want to ask about it to go back ? \" grad g: Yeah , I think that 's difficult because then they 're not gonna ask the questions that are in the summary . professor a: Well grad g: But , I think it would give professor a: That 's one possi one possible scenario , though , is you have the summary , grad g:   So that that is another use of Meeting Recorder that we haven't really talked about , which is for someone else , as opposed to as a remembrance agent , which is what had been my primary thought in the information retrieval part of it would be . But , I guess if you had a meeting participant , they could use the summary to refresh themselves about the meeting and then make up queries . phd e: But th there is this ,  There is this class of queries , which are the things that you didn't realize were important at the time but some in retrospect you think \" oh , hang on , didn't we talk about that ? \" And it 's something that didn't appear in the summary but you professor a:   phd e: And that 's kind of what this kind of , complete data capture is kind of nicest for . phd e: Cuz it 's the things that you wouldn't have bothered to make an effort to record but they get recorded . So ,  And th there 's no way of generating those , u u until we just until they actually occur . phd e: But  , it 's difficult to sort of say \" and if I was gonna ask four questions about this , what would they be ? \" Those aren't the kind of things that come up . postdoc h: I also think that w if if you can use the summaries as an indication of the important points of the of the meeting , then you might get something like y So if th if the obscure item you want to know more about was some form of data collection , you know , maybe the summary would say , you know , \" we discussed types of na data collection \" . If you if you had the the larger structure of the of the discourse , then if you can categorize what it is that you 're looking for with reference to those l those larger headings , then you can find it even if you don't have a direct route to that . postdoc h: I think that grad g: That 's a pretty fine grain that the note - taker will have to take . I think you got to have somebody who knows the pro knows the topic or you know , whose job it is delegated to be the note - taker . phd b: No , but someone who can come sit in on the meetings and then takes the notes with them that the real note - taker grad g: But they phd b: And that way that one student has , you know , a rough idea of what was going on , and they can use it for their research .  , this isn't really necessarily what you would do in a real system , grad g:   But if he has some students that want to study that then they should sort of get to know the people and attend those meetings , professor d:   Their sort of note - taking application stuff they 've been doing for the last couple of years , and I don't think anyone is still working on it . grad g: And so the question is \" is there such a person ? \" And I think right now , the answer is \" no \" . professor a: Well professor d: I 've b been thinking grad g: We 'll just have to see . professor d: I 've been thinking about it a little bit here about the  , th this , e  I think that the now I 'm thinking that the summary a summary , is actually a reasonable , bootstrap into this into what we 'd like to get at . It 's it 's not ideal , but we you know , we we have to get started someplace . So I was I was just thinking about , suppose we wanted to get w We have this collection of meeting . So now we have five hours of meetings and , you ask me , \" Morgan , what d you know , what kind of questions do you want to ask ? \"  , I wouldn't have any idea what kind of questions I want to ask . So in fact if I looked at summary of it , I 'd go \" oh , yeah , I was in that meeting , I remember that , what was the part that \" And and th I think that might then help me to think of things even things that aren't listed in the summary , but just as a as a as a refresh of what the general thing was going on in the meeting . One , as sort of a refresh to help bootstrap queries , professor d:   professor a:  phd b: So how does the summary get generated ? professor a: Well , i i ? phd b: I 'm not against the idea of a summary , grad g: By hand . phd b: but I wanted to think carefully about who 's generating it professor a: Or , d o phd b: and how because the summary will drive the queries . professor a: What I I think , you know , in most meetings , phd b: So professor a: this one being different , but in most meetings that I attend , there 's somebody t explicitly taking notes , frequently on a laptop  , you can just make it be on a laptop , phd b:   professor a: so then yo you 're dealing with ASCII and not somebody you don't have to go through handwriting recognition . postdoc h: I I I think that , there 's we 're using \" summary \" in two different ways . postdoc h: And what I originally thought was , if you asked someone \" what was the meeting about ? \" phd b: OK . postdoc h: And then they would say \" well , we talked about this and then we talked about that , and so - and - so talked about \" And then you 'd have , like I e My thought was to have multiple people summarize it , on recording rather than writing because writing takes time and you get irrelevant other things that u take time , that professor a:   postdoc h: Whereas if you just say it immediately after the meeting , you know , a two - minute summary of what the meeting was about , I think you would get , with mult See , I I also worry about having a single note - taker because that 's just one person 's perception . And , you know , it it 's releva it 's relative to what you 're focus was on that meeting , professor d:   professor d: A postdoc h: So , my proposal would be that it may be worth considering both of those types , you know , the note - taking and a spontaneous oral summary afterwards , professor a: OK . postdoc h: no longer than two minutes , professor d: Adam , you can postdoc h: from multiple people . professor d: but but , my impression was that , pretty much , true that the meetings here , nobody sits with a w  , with a laptop grad g: Never . Does anyone ? phd b: Dan ? professor d: I grad g: Dan is the one who who most frequently would take notes , phd e: Yeah . Most of the meetings we have are four or five people grad g: That 's true are four or five people . professor d: and you 're not you don't have somebody sitting and taking minutes for it . professor a: So , I think it depends on whether it 's a business meeting or a technical discussion . grad g: The IRAM meeting , they they take notes every professor d: Do they ? grad g: There 's  a person with a laptop at each meeting . phd b: I don't know how , but for instance , the outline is sort of up here and that 's what people are seeing . phd e: We sh we should grad g: I agree , but but you you just you g end up with video , postdoc h: I agree . phd e: f u I think for this data capture , it would be nice to have a digital camera grad g: Yeah , different phd b: y phd e: just to take pictures of who 's there , where the microphones are , and then we could also put in what 's on the board . grad g: But don't you think that 's Don't you think that But postdoc h: I agree .  , I I just think  , I think that right now we don't make a record of where people are sitting on the tables . phd e: Not not as part of the not as a part of the data that you have to recover . phd e: Just just in terms of phd b: We should just Like archiving it or storing it . postdoc h: It 's i because discourse is about things , phd b: Because someone postdoc h: and then you have the things that are about , and it 's recoverable . phd b: someone later might be able to take these and say \" OK , they , you know at least these are the people who were there phd e: So phd b: and here 's sort of what they started talking about , and \" and just postdoc h: Yes . professor d: Li postdoc h: Like you said , three snapshots professor d: L L L postdoc h: and professor d: Liz , you postdoc h: Just to archive . professor d: u  , Liz , you sa you sat in on the , subcommittee meeting or whatever phd e: Actually professor d: on you on the subcommittee meeting for for at the ,  that workshop we were at that , Mark Liberman was was having . They they they they h must have had some discussion about video and the visual aspect , and all that . But I 'm just saying first of all there 's a whole bunch of fusion issues that DARPA 's interested in . And there 's also I think a personal interest on the part of Mark Liberman in this kind of in storing these images in any data we collect professor d:   phd b: And professor d: I think you  , that the key thing there is that this is a description of database collection effort that they 're talking about doing . professor d: And if the database exists and includes some visual information that doesn't mean that an individual researcher is going to make any use of it . professor d: So ,  grad g: But that it 's gonna be a lot of effort on our part to create it , and store it , and get all the standards , and to do anything with it . So we 're gonna So we 're gonna do what we 're gonna do , whatever 's reasonable for us . phd b: I think even doing something very crude professor d: But having phd b: Like I know with ATIS , we just had a tape recorder running all the time . phd b: And later on it turned out it was really good that you had a tape recorder of what was happening , even though you w you just got the speech from the machine . So if you can find some really , you know , low , perplexity , grad g: Low fidelity . And if it 's simple as  , as simple as just the digital phd b: Otherwise you 'd you lose it . professor d: Well , minimally , what what Dan is referring to at least having some representation of the p the spatial position of the people , postdoc h: Yeah . professor d: so ,  grad g: Well , once the room is a little more fixed that 's a little easier professor d: Yeah . grad g: But phd b: Also CMU has been doing this and they were the most vocal at this meeting , Alex Waibel 's group . And they have said , I talked to the student who had done this , that with two fairly inexpensive cameras they they just recorded all the time professor d:   phd b: and were able to get all the information from or maybe it was three from all the parts of the room . So I think we would be we might lose the chance to use this data for somebody later who wants to do some kind of processing on it if we don't collect it at all . The problem with it is you 'll have more people who don't want to be filmed than who don't want to be recorded . grad g: So that there 's going to be another group of people who are gonna say \" I won't participate \" . phd b: Or you could put a paper bag over everybody 's head grad g:  phd b: and not look at each other and not look at boards , and just all be sitting talking . phd b: That would be an interes Bu postdoc h: Well professor d: Great idea . But I think y she 's we 're just proposing a minimal preservation of things on boards , phd b: Yeah . postdoc h: sp spatial organization And you could anonymize the faces for that matter . You know , this is grad g: But , you know , that 's a lot of infrastructure and work . postdoc h: We can talk about the grad g: To set it up and then anonymize it ? postdoc h: It 's just one snapshot . phd b: No , it wa n not ,  professor a: No , no , no , no . Maybe we don't want to spend that much more time discussing it , phd f: Did they store it digitally , or ? postdoc h: but phd b:   I think they just phd f: or just put it on videotape ? phd b: I think they just had the videotapes with a c you know , a counter or something . Well , I think for  , for our purposes we probably will d phd b: I 'm not sure . professor d: we we might try that some and and we certainly already have some recordings that don't have that , which , you know , we we 'll we 'll get other value out of , I think . postdoc h: Th The thing is , if it 's easy to collect it it th then I think it 's a wise thing to do because once it 's gone it 's gone . And phd b: I 'm just The community If LDC collects this data u  , and L - if Mark Liberman is a strong proponent of how they collect it and what they collect , there will probably be some video data in there . phd b: And so that could argue for us not doing it or it could argue for us doing it . The only place where it sort of overlaps is when some of the summarization issues are actually could be , easier made easier if you had the video . professor d: I think at the moment we should be determining this on the basis of our own , interests and needs rather than hypothetical ones from a community thing . professor d: As you say , if they if they decide it 's really critical then they will collect a lot more data than we can afford to , and and will include all that . professor d: professor a: e professor d: I I I 'm not worried about the cost of setting it up . In other words , it 's it it 'd be kind of silly to collect it all and not look at it at all . And so I I I think that we do have to do some picking and choosing of the stuff that we 're doing . But I I am int I do think that we m minimally want something we might want to look at at some some , subsets of that . Like for a meeting like this , at least , take a Polaroid of the of the of the boards , phd b: Of the board . phd b: Or at least make sure that the note - taker takes a sh you know , a snapshot of the board . professor d: a and know the position of the people phd b: That 'll make it a lot easier for meetings that are structured . phd b: otherwise later on if nobody wrote this stuff on the board down we 'd have a harder time summarizing it or agreeing on a summary .  , this is shared knowledge among all the participants , and it 's a shame to keep it off the recording . grad g: except in postdoc h: s grad g: er , if we weren't recording this , this this would get lost .  , I just think that the grad g: The point is that we 're not saving it anyway . postdoc h: Well professor a: What do you mean we 're not saving it anyway ? I 've written all of this down and it 's getting emailed to you . That would be the other alternative , to make sure that anything that was on the board , is in the record . postdoc h: Well professor a: Well , that 's why that 's why I 'm saying that I think the note - taking would be I think in many for many meetings there will be some sort of note - taking , in which case , that 's a useful thing to have  , we  , we don't need to require it . professor a: so so we won't worry about requiring these things , but the more things that we can get it for , the more useful it will be for various applications . professor d: So So , departing for the moment from the data collection question but actually talking about , you know , this group and what we actually want to do , so I guess that 's th the way what you were figuring on doing was was was , putting together some notes and sending them to to everybody from from today ? OK . professor d: So so the question that that we started with was whether there was anything else we should do during during th during the collection . professor d: And I guess the CrossPads was certainly one idea , and we 'll get them from him and we 'll just do that . Right ? And then the next thing we talked about was the was the summaries and are we gonna do anything about that . professor a: So , if I 'm collecting data then there is this question of do I use CrossPads ? professor d: Yeah . professor a: So , I think that if we really seriously have me collect data and I can't use CrossPads , it 's probably less useful for you guys to go to the trouble of using it , unless you think that the CrossPads are gonna n I 'm not I 'm not sure what they 're gonna do . But but having a small percentage of the data with it , I 'm not sure whether that 's useful or not . professor d: I guess the point was to try again , to try to collect more information that could be useful later for for the UI stuff . professor d: So it 's sort of Landay supplying it so that Landay 's stuff can be easier to do . professor d: So it it Right now he 's g operating from zero , professor a: Nothing . professor d: and so even if we didn't get it done from UW , it seems like that would could still You shou professor a: OK . phd b: I think it 'd be useful to have a small amount of it just as a proof of concept . grad g: And and they seem to not be able to give enough of them away , so we could probably get more as well . So if it if it seems to be really useful to you guys , we could probably get a donation to me . I think it it it will again depend on Landay , and if he has a student who 's interested , and how much infrastructure we 'll need . grad g: but if it requires a lot of our time , we probably won't do it . professor d: I guess a lot of the stuff we 're doing now really is pilot in one sense or another . That if if people have something in front of them phd b: I 'd be sort of cool . So , I j I think we should just say this is not we don't want to put any extra burden on people , but if they happen to generate minutes , could could they send it to us ? grad g: Yeah . What I was gonna say is that I don't want to ask people to do something they wouldn't normally do in a meeting . professor d: So who who does this summarization ? postdoc h: Yeah , I 'm thinking that grad g: People in the meeting . grad g: You know , just at at the end of the meeting , before you go , postdoc h:  - huh . phd e: People with radio mikes can go into separate rooms and continue recording without hearing each other . phd b: Well , then you should try them a few weeks later postdoc h: How fascinating . phd b: and They have all these memory experiments about how little you actually retain grad g: And see score them ? phd e: That 's right . phd b: and wasn't phd e: If we do if we collect four different summaries , you know , we 're gonna get all this weird data about how people perceive things differently . professor a: But but again , like the CrossPads , I don't think I would base a lot of stuff on it , professor d: Ru grad g: I d yeah , I don't know how you would do it , though . professor a: because I think I know when I see the the clock coming near the end of the meeting , I 'm like inching towards the door . grad g: Maybe e Is email easier ? postdoc h: Well , I think if grad g: I when you first said do do it , spoken , what I was thinking is , oh then people have to come up postdoc h:   postdoc h: Yeah , I 'd just try Well , however the least intrusive and and quickest way is , and th and closest to the meeting time too , cuz people will start to forget it as soon as they l leave . But , I don't think that they 'll necessarily you 'll you 'll get many people willing to stay . professor a: But , you know , if you get even one postdoc h: w professor d: Well , I think it 's like the note - taking thing , postdoc h: I would s Yeah . professor d: that that y that you can't certainly can't require it or people aren't gonna want to do this . postdoc h: And I 'm also wondering , couldn't that be included in the data sample so that you could increase the num you know , the words that are , recognized by a particular individual ? If you could include the person 's meeting stuff and also the person 's summary stuff , maybe that would be  , phd e: Yeah . postdoc h: Under the same acoustic circumstance , cuz if they just walk next door with their set - up , nothing 's changed , phd e: Right . postdoc h: just phd f: So I have a question about queries , grad g: God , that 's bugging me . phd f: which is , grad g: Can we turn that light off ? postdoc h: You turn phd f:  grad g: If can we turn that just that that let professor d: The fl the fluorescent light is flickering . grad g: Yeah , there 's a phd b: Oh , it is it is like OK . professor a: That and y Too much caffeine and really tired , grad g: Too much caffeine . phd f: the question I had about queries was , so what we 're planning to do is have people look at the summaries and then generate queries ? Are are we gonna try and o grad g: We we 've just been talking , how do we generate queries ? phd f: Yeah . phd f: so , the question I had is is have we given any thought to how we would generate queries automatically given a summary ?  , I think that 's a whole research topic un unto itself , professor d: Mmm . phd f: n phd b: Shouldn't Landay and his group be in charge of figuring out how to do this ? professor d: Yeah . phd b: They 're the expert phd e: Mari ? professor a: Yeah ? phd e: Someone wants to know when you 're getting picked up . Is someone picking you up ? professor a: what 's our schedule ? professor d: Well , you still wanted to talk with Liz . professor a: Let 's see , you and I need dis  , no , we did the Liz talk . professor a: We need to finish this discussion , and you and I need a little time for wrap - up and quad chart . So , grad g: And what ? professor a:  professor d: I 'm at your disposal . professor a: what what 's the plan for this discussion ? We should professor d: I think we should be able to wind up in another half - hour or something , you think ? grad g: At least . professor a: So , I think phd b: It 's interesting that he 's got , like , this discussion free professor d: Well , we still haven't talked about the action items from here and so on . professor d: And professor a: e e why don't you say five - thirty ? I don't phd e: OK , five - thirty . grad g: Well , in answer to \" is it Landay 's problem ? \" , he doesn't have a student who 's interested right now in doing anything . So I don't think he wants to do information retrieval , query generation , that sort of stuff . professor d: Yeah , well there 's gonna be these student projects that can do some things but it can't be , yeah , very deep . u I I actually think that that , again , just as a bootstrap , if we do have something like summaries , then having the people who are involved in the meetings themselves , who are cooperative and willing to do yet more , come up with with with queries , could at least give give Landay an idea of the kind of things that people might want to know .  , ye Right ? If he doesn't know anything about the area , and the people are talking about and and ,  phd b: But the people will just look at the summaries or the minutes and re and sort of back - generate the queries . phd f: Well , I 'm not sure I 'm not sure that 's a solved problem . phd f: Right ? Of how to how to generate queries from a phd b: How to do this from the summary . phd b: So what you want to h to do is , people who were there , who later see , minutes and s put in summary form , which is not gonna be at the same time as the meeting . phd b: and , like , make up some stuff to which these notes would be an answer , or or a deeper Yeah . phd b: You postdoc h: I 'm also wondering if we could ask the the people a a question which would be \" what was the most interesting thing you got out of this meeting ? \" Becau - in terms of like informativeness , phd b: That 's a good one . postdoc h: it might be , you know , that the summary would would not in even include what the person thought was the most interesting fact . professor a: But actually I would say that 's a better thing to ask than have them summarize the meeting . postdoc h: Because you get , like , the general structure of important points and what the what the meeting was about . postdoc h: So you get the general structure , the important points of what the meeting was about with the summary . But with the \" what 's the most interesting thing you learned ? \"  , so the fact that , I know that Transcriber uses Snack is something that I thought was interesting phd b: Going to see the kids . So , you could ge pick up some of the micro items that wouldn't even occur as major headings professor a:   professor c: Are you thinking about just asking one participant or all of them ? grad g: As many are willing to do it . Cuz you 'll get cuz you 'll get very different answers from everybody , right ? professor c: and then Yeah . phd e: So grad g: Well , maybe one thing we could do is for the meetings we 've already done  , I we didn't take minutes and we don't have summaries . professor a: But actually it would be an easy thing to just go around the room and say what was the most interesting thing you learned , grad g: Mmm . postdoc h: And that I think it would pick up the micro - structure , the some some of the little things that would be hidden . professor d: Boy , I I don't know how we get at this postdoc h: That would be interesting . professor c: Yeah , but when you go around the room you might just get the effect that somebody says something grad g: Or want to get up and leave . professor c: and then you go around the room and they say \" yeah , me too , I agree . professor c: So phd e: On the other hand people might try and come up with different ones , right ? professor d: Well phd e: They might say \" oh , I was gonna say that one but now I have to think of something else \" . grad g: Well , you have the other thing , that that they know why we 're doing it . We 'll  , we 'll we 'll be telling them that the reason we 're trying to do this is is to d generate queries in the future , so try to pick things that other people didn't say .  , It seemed The kind of , interest that I had in this thing initially was , that i basically the form that you 're doing something else later , professor a:   So it 's really the imp the the list of what 's important 's in the something else professor a: Right . professor d: in fact if if it was really major , if it 's the thing that really stuck in your head , then you might not need to go back and and and check on it even . So it 's it 's that you 're trying to find You 're you 've now You weren't interested Say I I said \" well , I wasn't that much interested in dialogue , I 'm more of an acoustics person \" . professor d: But but thr three months from now if for some reason I get really interested in dialogue , and I 'm \" well what is what was that part that that that , Mari was saying ? \" grad g: Yeah , like Jim Bass says \" add a few lines on dialogue in your next perf \" professor a:  professor d: Yeah . professor d: And then I 'm trying to fi  , that 's that 's when I look in general when I look things up most , is when it 's something that didn't really stick in my head the first time around and but for some new reason I 'm I 'm I 'm interested in in in the old stuff . professor a: Well , I That 's hard to generate professor d: So , I don't I don't know . phd f: Do we professor a: and and I think that 's half of what i I would use it for . But I also a lot of times  , make you know , think to myself \" this is interesting , professor d:   professor a: So , things that I think are interesting , I would be , wanting to do a query about . And also , I like the idea of going around the room , because if somebody else thought something was interesting , I 'd kind of want to know about it and then I 'd want to follow up on it . That that might get at some of what I was I was concerned about , being interested in something later that w  , I didn't consider to be important the first time , which for me is actually the dominant thing , because if I thought it was really important it tends to stick more than if I didn't , but some new task comes along that makes me want to look up . grad g: But But what 's interesting to me may not b have been interesting to you . grad g: Yeah , I I think you can't get at all of it , professor d: Yeah . phd f: The question the question then is h h how much bias do we introduce by you know , introduce by saying , you know , this was important now and , you know , maybe tha something else is important later ? professor d:   But postdoc h: Well , and and one thing , we we 're saying \" important \" and we 're saying \" interesting \" . But I I I guess that 's the question , really , is that  , postdoc h:   professor d: W phd f: does building queries based on what 's important now introduce an irreversible bias on being able to do what Morgan wants to do later ? professor d: Well , irreversible . phd f: That 's that 's professor d: I I  , I guess what I what I I keep coming back to in my own mind is that , the soonest we can do it , we need to get up some kind of system postdoc h: Yeah . professor d: so that people who 've been involved in the meeting can go back later , even if it 's a poor system in some ways , and ,  and ask the questions that they actually want to know . If you know , if  , as soon as we can get that going at any kind of level , then I think we 'll have a much better handle on what kind of questions people want to ask than in any anything we do before that . postdoc h: I will say that that I I chose \" interesting \" because I think it includes also \" important \" in some cases . postdoc h: Well , and and also i it puts a lot of burden on the person to to evaluate . You know , I think inter \" interesting \" is is non - threatening in professor a: OK - OK . professor a: In the interest of , grad g: Importance ? postdoc h: Yeah . professor a: No , i in the interest of generating some minutes here , and also moving on to action items and other things , let me just go through the things that I wrote down as being important , that we at least decided on . CrossPads we were going to try , if Landay can get the ,  get them to to you guys , and see if they 're interesting . professor a: getting just , digital pictures a couple digital pictures of the the table and boards to set the context of the meeting .  , and then going around the room at the end to just say qu ask people to mention something interesting that they learned . So rather than say the most interesting thing , something interesting , postdoc h: k professor a: and that way you 'll get more variety . \" And then the last thing c would be for those people who are willing to stay afterwards and give an oral summary . professor a: OK ? Does that pretty much cover everything we talked about ? That well , that we want to do ? postdoc h:   grad g: Yeah , that 's like n I think that 's gonna predominantly end up being whoever takes down the equipment then . postdoc h: And and that would also be that the data would be included in the database . phd e: there is still this hope that people might actually think of real queries they really want to ask at some point . phd e: And that if if that ever should happen , then we should try and write them down . grad g: Give them a reward , a dollar a query ? phd e: Yeah , really . So professor d: Well , and again , if we can figure out a way to jimmy a a a a very rough system , say in a year , then  , so that in the second and third years we we actually have something to postdoc h: Yeah .  , the level of the query could be , you know , very low - level or very high - level . And it gets fuzzier and fuzzier as you go up , right ? grad g: Well , we 're gonna phd b: So you need to have some sort of if you start working with queries , some way of identifying what the you know , if this is something that requires a a one - word answer or it 's one place in the recording versus was there general agreement on this issue of all the people who ha phd e:  . phd b: In fact , they 're very meaningful cuz they 're very high - level . phd b: It But it may well grad g: But professor d: Because  , b because it depends on , what our goal is . grad g: Really ? professor d: If our goal is Wizard of Oz - ish , we might want to know what is it that people would really like to know about this data . professor d: And if it 's if if it 's something that we don't know how to do yet , th great , phd e: Yeah . grad g: Yeah , I was thinking about Wizard of Oz , but it requires the wizard to know all about the meetings . phd e: Well just imagine if professor d: But but just phd e: Get people to ask questions that they def the machine definitely can't answer at the moment , professor d: Yeah . w Just \" what would you like to know ? \" phd e: but grad g: Yep . postdoc h: I I was wondering if if there might be one s more source of queries which is indicator phrases like \" action item \" , professor a: OK . postdoc h: Yeah , that 's something to be determined , something to be specified , phd b: Well , probably if you have to sit there at the end of a meeting and say one thing you remember , it 's probably whatever action item was assigned to you . phd b: So , in general , that could be something you could say , right ? I 'm supposed to do this . Well , but then you could you could prompt them to say , you know , \" other than your action item \" , you know , whatever . phd e: Well postdoc h: But but the action item would be a way to get , maybe an additional query . Well , but you know , but you could get again @ @ professor a: Well , we 're piloting . professor a: or maybe we should wait until the summary of this until this meeting is transcribed and then we will hav professor d: We we had  , phd e: Yeah . professor d: somewhere up there we had milestones , but I guess Did y did you get enough milestone , from the description things ? professor a: I got Yeah . In fact , why don't you hand me those transparencies so that I remember to take them . professor d: And , you know , there 's obviously detail behind each of those , as much as is needed . What I have down for action items is we 're supposed to find out about our human subject , requirements . professor a: people are supposed to send me U R for their for web pages , to c and I 'll put together an overall cover . We professor a:  ? phd e: we need to look at our web page professor a: And and you also need to look at your web page phd e: and make one that 's that 's p professor a: and clean it up by mid - July . And so ,  professor a: How about if I just c  , Right now all I want I personally only want text data . I think the only thing Jeff would do anything with right now But I 'm just speaking fr based on a conversation with him two weeks ago I had in Turkey . professor d: Wh postdoc h: You could email to both of us , just  , if you wanted to . postdoc h: I don't think either of us would mind recei professor a: OK . postdoc h: but but in any case I 'd be happy to send you the professor a: And your email is ? professor d: i postdoc h: Edwards at ICSI . professor a: And then professor d: In in our phone call , before , we we ,  It turns out the way we 're gonna send the data is by , And ,  and then what they 're gonna do is take the CD - ROM and transfer it to analog tape and give it to a transcription service , that will grad g: Oh , is this IBM ? professor d: Yeah . postdoc h: Yeah , using foot pedals professor d: Yeah , foot foot pedals postdoc h: and professor d: and grad g: so do they How are they gonna do the multi - channel ? professor d: See , that 's a good question . professor d: probably about like you did , grad g: Mix ? professor d: and then there will be some things you know , many things that don't work out well . And that 'll go back to IBM and they 'll they 'll ,  they run their aligner on it and it kicks out things that don't work well , which you know , the overlaps will certainly be examples of that . professor d: We 'll give them all the the multi - channel stuff grad g: So we 'll give them all sixteen channels professor d: and grad g: and they 'll do whatever they want with it . phd b: But you also should probably give them the mixed You know , equal sound - level professor d: Yeah . professor d: It 's also won't be adding much to the data to give them the mixed . phd f: But w phd b: I phd f: It 's not professor a: Right . phd b: You should that may be all that they want to send off to their transcribers . Related to to the conversation with Picheny , I need to email him , my shipping address and you need to email them something which you already did . I I m emailed them the Transcriber URL , the on - line , data that Adam set up , The URL so they can click on an utterance and hear it . And I was gonna m email them the which I haven't yet , a pointer to to the web pages that we that we currently have , cuz in particular they want to see the one with the the way the recording room is set up postdoc h: Good . grad g: And then p possibly postdoc h: I C - I CC ' ed Morgan . grad g: Not an immediate action item but something we do have to worry about is data formats for for higher - level information . We were gonna grad g: Well , or d or not even higher level , different level , prosody and all that sort of stuff . professor a: That 's postdoc h: Well ,  professor a: W My my u feeling right now on format is you guys have been doing all the work phd e: Well  , yeah . So , what n important thing professor a: but Cuz I 'm not actually touching the data , postdoc h: Well , it c phd e: Right . professor d: So a key thing will be that you we tell you postdoc h: Great . phd f: and \" professor d: We also had the ,  that we were s  , that you were gonna get us the eight - hundred number professor a: Oh , yeah . professor d: and we 're all gonna we 're gonna call up your Communicator thing and and we 're gonna be good slash bad , depending on how you define it , users . professor c: Now , something that I mentioned earlier to Mari and Liz is that it 's probably important to get as many non - technical and non - speech people as possible in order to get some realistic users . Cuz we don't want people who already know how to deal with dialogue systems , professor a: Yeah . Or , like if you have a professor c: who know that you shouldn't hyper - articulate , for instance , and things like that . professor a: Or , like if you have somebody who makes your your plane reservations for you , professor c: So . e You know , it could result in some good bloopers , which is always good for presentations . professor d: My mother would have a very interesting conversation with it grad g: He would never use it . So I have the professor d: We talked about that we 're getting the recording equipment running at UW . And so it depends , w e e e they 're you know , they 're p m If that comes together within the next month , there at least will be , major communications between Dan and UW folks phd e: Yeah .  , professor a: I 'm I 'm shooting to try to get it done get it put together by the beginning of August . professor d: as to phd e: we should talk about it , but postdoc h: Mmm . professor a: So , you know , if professor d: But we have it it 's it 's pretty We don't know .  , he he s  , he said that it was sitting in some room collecting dust professor a: We don't know . professor d: and and so we don't know , professor a: i It 's probably unlikely that we 'll pull this off , professor d: i e professor a: but a at least it 's worth trying .  , and I will email these notes  , I 'm not sure what to do about action items for the data stuff , although , then somebody I guess somebody needs to tell Landay that you want the pads . professor d: and he also said something about outside there that came up about the outside text sources , that he he may have grad g:   professor a: Oh ! professor d: some text sources that are close enough to the sort of thing that we can play with them for a language model . phd e: Yeah , that was  , that was What he was saying was this he this thing that , Jason had been working on finds web pages that are thematically related to what you 're talking about . But it 's p it might be phd e: so professor a: But but that 's actually what I wanna do . grad g: Un - unfortunately Landay told me that Jason is not gonna be working on that anymore . He seemed when I asked him if he could actually supply data , he seemed a little bit more reluctant . If I don't get something grad g: Who ? Landay or Jason ? professor a: Landay . professor a: you know , otherwise , if you guys have any papers or I could I could use ,  I could use your web pages . You 've got all the web pages on the Meeting Recor professor d: Yeah , why search for them ? professor a: Yeah ! professor d: They 're we know where they are . professor d: There 's there 's some , Carnegie Mellon stuff , right ? On on meeting recording , grad g: Yep . professor a: So , there 's there 's ICSI , Xerox , professor d: and phd b: And there 's You should l look under , like , intelligent environments , professor d: And Xerox . phd b: smart rooms , grad g: the \" Georgia Tech Classroom Two Thousand \" is a good one . J There 's th That 's where I thought you would want to eventually be able to have a board or a camera , professor a:   phd b: because of all these classroom grad g: Well , Georgia Tech did a very elaborate instrumented room . I think that 's good enou that 's that 's pretty much all I can think of . postdoc h: Can I ask , one thing ? It relates to data data collection and I and I 'd and we mentioned earlier today , this question of  , so , I s I know that from with the near - field mikes some of the problems that come with overlapping speech , are lessened . But I wonder if  , is that sufficient or should we consider maybe getting some data gathered in such a way that , u w we would c  , p have a meeting with less overlap than would otherwise be the case ? So either by rules of participation , or whatever . postdoc h: Now , you know , it 's true , we were discussing this earlier , that depending on the task so if you 've got someone giving a report you 're not gonna have as much overlap . phd f: Adam ! postdoc h: But , i i  , so we 're gonna have s you know , non - overlapping samples anyway . But , in a meeting which would otherwise be highly overlapping , is the near - field mike enough or should we have some rules of participation for some of our samples to lessen the overlap ? professor d:  . phd e: turn off professor a: I don't think we should have rules of participation , but I think we should try to get a variety of meetings . That 's something that if we get the the meeting stuff going at UW , that I probably can do more than you guys , postdoc h: OK . Just want to be sure there 's enough data to professor a: phd b: They 're still gonna overlap , postdoc h: OK , good . phd b: but Mark and others have said that there 's quite a lot of found data from the discourse community that has this characteristic and also the political Y you know , anything that was televised for a third party has the characteristic of not very much overlap . professor d: Wasn - but w I think we were saying before also that the natural language group here had less overlap . postdoc h: because you know , it is true people can modify the amount of overlap that they do if if they 're asked to . postdoc h: Not not entirely modify it , but lessen it if if it 's desired . But if if that 's sufficient data I just wanted to be sure that we will not be having a lot of data which can't be processed . So I 'm just writing here , we 're not gonna try to specify rules of interaction but we 're gonna try to get more variety by i using different groups of people postdoc h: Time . And I you know , I I know that the near f near - field mikes will take care of also the problems to s to a certain degree . professor a: Cuz if I recorded some administrative meetings then that may have less overlap , because you might have more overlap when you 're doing something technical and disagreeing or whatever . Well , I just as as as a contributary eh , so I I know that in l in legal depositions people are pr are prevented from overlapping . They 'll just say , you know you know , \" wait till each person is finished before you say something \" . professor a: Well , the reason why I didn't want to is be why I personally didn't want to is because I wanted it to be as , unintrusive as possi postdoc h:   I just want to be sure we don't that we 're able to process , i u  , you know , as much data as we can . Did they discuss any of that in the the meeting they had with L Liberman ? phd b:   professor d: What phd b: And there was a big division , professor d: What what do they phd b: so Liberman and others were interested in a lot of found data . phd b: So there 's lots of recordings that They 're not close - talk mike , professor d: Yeah . phd b: but And and there 's lots of television , you know , stuff on , political debates and things like that , congre congressional hearings .  , and then the CMU folks and I were sort of on the other side in cuz they had collected a lot of meetings that were sort of like this and said that those are nothing like these meetings . And , I guess we just left it as @ @ that if there 's found data that can be transformed for use in speech recognition easily , then of course we would do it , professor d:   Is that is that going to be publicly available , phd b: As far as I know , they h have not . grad g: It 's also it 's not it 's not near - far , right ? phd b: I 'm not sure .  , if people were interested they could talk to them , but I I got the feeling there was some politics involved . grad g: Cuz I had thought they 'd only done far - field , phd b: I think you need to talk to Waibel and grad g: intelligent - room sorts of things . phd b: But they had multiple mikes and they did do recognition , and they did do real conversations . Well , once we send out postdoc h: Yeah , I think professor d: we still haven't sent out the first note saying \" hey , this list exists \" . But but , once we do that professor a: Is that an action item ? professor d: Yeah . We should at least check that everybody here ? grad g: I think everyone here is on the list . grad g: I I added a few people who didn't who I knew had to be on it even though they didn't tell me . grad g: You are on it , aren't you ? postdoc h: Yeah , I am . So \" found data \" , they mean like established corpora of linguistics and and other fields , right ? phd b: What they mean is stuff they don't have to fund to collect , postdoc h: It sounds like such a t phd b: and especially good postdoc h: Yeah , OK . It 's things occur without any You know , the pe these people weren't wearing close - talking mikes , but they were recorded anyway , like the congressional hearings and , you know , for legal purposes or whatever . Of course it 's not \" found \" in the sense that at the time it was collected for the purpose . phd b: But what he means is that You know , Mark was really a fan of getting as much data as possible from you know , reams and reams of stuff , of broadcast stuff , postdoc h: That 's interesting . phd e: We should go around and say something interesting that happened at the meeting ? professor a: Oh . phd b: Rrrh ! grad g: Now , I was already thinking about it , so professor d: Oh ! Good man . phd b: I grad g: So , I really liked the idea of what I thought was interesting was the combination of the CrossPad and the speech . So , can you determine the interesting points by who 's writing ? Can you do special gestures and so on that that have , special meaning to the corpora ? I really liked that . postdoc h: Well , I I just realized there 's another category of interesting things which is that , I I found this discussion very , i this this question of how you get at queries really interesting . And and the and I and the fact that it 's sort of , nebulous , what what that what kind of query it would be because it depends on what your purpose is . So I actually found that whole process of of trying to think of what that would involve to be interesting . I just sort of thought we we went around a nice discussion of the factors involved there , which I thought was worthwhile . grad g: Did you take pictures of the boards ? phd e: Not that I postdoc h: Yeah .  , I will take pictures of them , but postdoc h: That 's a good point . phd f: I 'm gonna pass because I can't  , of the Jane took my answer . But I will say  , I will actually  , a spin on different slightly different spin on what you said , this issue of , realizing that we could take minutes , and that actually may be a goal . So that that may be kind of the test in a sense , test data , the the template of what we want to test against , generating a summary . I think the question of how to generate queries automatically was the most interesting question that came up , and it 's something that , as you said , is a whole research topic in itself , so I don't think we 'll be able to do anything on it because we don't have funding on it , in this project . professor d: Well , being more management lately than than research , I think the thing that impressed me most was the people dynamics and not any of the facts . phd e: How are we gonna find that in the data ? grad g: Well , if we had people wearing the wireless mikes all the time phd e: Oh , yeah . grad g: Yeah , I think phd f: Well , one thing you could search for is were people laughing a lot . phd e: How happy were they ? professor d: I 'd probably search for something like that . postdoc h:  h Do we need do I need to turn something off here , or I do unplug this , or ? professor d: Now these we turn off <doc-sep><doc-sep>But all all I know is that it seems like every time I am up here after a meeting , and I start it , it works fine . And if I 'm up here and I start it and we 're all sitting here waiting to have a meeting , it gives me that error message and I have not yet sat down with been able to get that error message in a point where I can sit down and find out where it 's occurring in the code . professor d: So  so the  , the new procedural change that just got suggested , which I think is a good idea is that  , we do the digit recordings at the end . And that way , if we 're recording somebody else 's  meeting , and a number of the participants have to run off to some other meeting and don't have the time , then they can run off . It 'll mean we 'll get somewhat fewer  , sets of digits , but  , I think that way we 'll cut into people 's time , if someone 's on strict time  , less .  , so , let 's see , we were having a discussion the other day , maybe we should bring that up , about  , the nature of the data that we are collecting .  @ @ that  , we should have a fair amount of data that is  , collected for the same meeting , so that we can ,  I don't know . Wh - what what were some of the points again about that ? Is it phd f: well , OK , I 'll back up . phd f: at the previous at last week 's meeting , this meeting I was griping about wanting to get more data and I I talked about this with Jane and Adam , and was thinking of this mostly just so that we could do research on this data  , since we 'll have a new this new student di does wanna work with us , phd a: Well , great . phd f: And he 's already funded part - time , so we 'll only be paying him for sort of for half of the normal part - time , phd a: What a deal . grad b: And what 's he interested in , specifically ? phd f: So he 's comes from a signal - processing background , but I liked him a lot cuz he 's very interested in higher level things , like language , and disfluencies and all kinds of eb maybe prosody , grad b:   Anyway , I thought OK , maybe we should have enough data so that if he starts he 'd be starting in January , next semester that we 'd have , you know , enough data to work with . phd f: But , Jane and Adam brought up a lot of good points that just posting a note to Berkeley people to have them come down here has some problems in that you m you need to make sure that the speakers are who you want and that the meeting type is what you want , and so forth . So , I thought about that and I think it 's still possible , but I 'd rather try to get more regular meetings of types that we know about , and hear , then sort of a mish - mosh of a bunch of one one - time grad b: One offs ? phd f: Yeah , just because it would be very hard to process the data in all senses , both to get the ,  to figure out what type of meeting it is and to do any kind of higher level work on it , like well , I was talking to Morgan about things like summarization , or what 's this meeting about .  it 's very different if you have a group that 's just giving a report on what they did that week , versus coming to a decision and so forth . Then I was  , talking to Morgan about some new proposed work in this area , sort of a separate issue from what the student would be working on where I was thinking of doing some kind of summarization of meetings or trying to find cues in both the utterances and in the utterance patterns , like in numbers of overlaps and amount of speech , sort of raw cues from the interaction that can be measured from the signals and from the diff different microphones that point to sort of hot spots in the meeting , or things where stuff is going on that might be important for someone who didn't attend to listen to . And in that  , regard , I thought we definitely w will need it 'd b it 'd be nice for us to have a bunch of data from a few different domains , or a few different kinds of meetings . So this this meeting is one of them , although I 'm not sure I can participate if I You know , I would feel very strange being part of a meeting that you were then analysing later for things like summarization . phd f: and then there are some others that menti that Morgan mentioned , like the front - end meeting and maybe a networking group meeting . phd f: But basically , for anything where you 're trying to get a summarization of some kind of meeting meaning out of the meeting , it would be too hard to have fifty different kinds of meetings where we didn't really have a good grasp on what does it mean to summarize , grad b: Yeah . phd f: but rather we should have different meetings by the same group but hopefully that have different summaries . And then we need a couple that of We don't wanna just have one group because that might be specific to that particular group , but @ @ three or four different kinds . So , in general , I was thinking more data but also data where we hold some parameters constant or fairly similar , grad b:   phd f: like a meeting about of people doing a certain kind of work where at least half the participants each time are the same . grad b:  professor d: Now , let l l let me just give you the other side to that cuz I ca because I I don't disagree with that , but I think there is a complimentary piece to it too . professor d: As many people here a a and talking about the kind of thing that you were just talking about it would have  too few people from my point of view . So ,  I think I would also very much like us to have a fair amount of really random scattered meetings , of somebody coming down from campus , and and  , phd c:   professor d: sure , if we can get more from them , fine , postdoc e:   professor d: but if we only get one or two from each group , that still could be useful acoustically just because we 'd have close and distant microphones with different people . postdoc e: Can I can I say about that that the the issues that I think Adam and I raised were more a matter of advertising so that you get more native speakers . Because I think if you just say an And in particular , my suggestion was to advertise to linguistics grad students because there you 'd have so people who 'd have proficiency enough in English that that  , it would be useful for for purposes You know . postdoc e: But you know , I think I 've been I 've I I 've gathered data from undergrads at on campus and if you just post randomly to undergrads I think you 'd get such a mixed bag that it would be hard to know how much conversation you 'd have at all . And and the English you 'd have The language models would be really hard to build professor d: Well , you want to i postdoc e: because it would not really be it would be an interlanguage rather than than a professor d: Well , OK , first place , I I I don't think we 'd just want to have random people come down and talk to one another , I think there should be a meeting that has some goal and point cuz I I think that 's what we 're investigating , postdoc e: OK . phd f: It has to be a a pre - existing meeting , like a meeting that would otherwise happen anyway . professor d: So I was I was thinking more in terms of talking to professors  , and and and  , senior  , d and  , doctoral students who are leading projects and offering to them that they have their hold their meeting down here . The second point is  I think that for some time now , going back through BeRP I think that we have had speakers that we 've worked with who had non - native accents and I th I think that postdoc e: Oh , oh . postdoc e: No , it 's more a matter of  , proficiency , e e just simply fluency . postdoc e: I deal with people on on campus who I think sometimes people , undergraduates  in computer science  , have language skills that make , you know that their their fluency and writing skills are not so strong . professor d: You 're just talking about postdoc e: Well , e I just think , grad b: We all had the same thought . postdoc e: but you know , it 's like when you get into the graduate level , no problem . professor d: But grad b: Well , I think that ,  I think that the only thing we should say in the advertisement is that the meeting should be held in English . And and I think if it 's a pre - existing meeting and it 's held in English , I I think it 's probably OK if a few of the people don't have  , g particularly good English skills . postdoc e: OK , now can I can I say the other aspect of this from my perspective which is that  , there 's there 's this this issue , you have a corpus out there , it should be used for for multiple things cuz it 's so expensive to put together . postdoc e: And if people want to approach  , i so I know e e You know this The idea of computational linguistics and probabilistic grammars and all may not be the focus of this group , professor d:  - huh . postdoc e: but the idea of language models , which are fund you know generally speaking  , you know , t t terms of like the amount of benefit per dollar spent or an hour invested in preparing the data , professor d:   postdoc e: if you have a choice between people who are pr more proficient in  , i more fluent , more more close to being academic English , then it would seem to me to be a good thing . I postdoc e: Because otherwise y you don't have the ability to have  , so if if you have a bunch of idiolects that 's the worst possible case . If you have people who are using English as a as an interlanguage because they they don't  , they can't speak in their native languages and but their interlanguage isn't really a match to any existing , language model , professor d:  - huh . professor d: Well , that 's pretty much what you 're going to have in the networking group . But the thing is , I think that these people are of high enough level in their in their language proficiency that professor d: I see . postdoc e: I I 'm I 'm just thinking that we have to think at a at a higher level view , could we have a language model , a a grammar a grammar , basically , that  , wo would be a a possibility . postdoc e: So y so if you wanted to bring in a model like Dan Jurafsky 's model , an and do some top - down stuff , it to help th the bottom - up and merge the things or whatever , it seems like  , I don't see that there 's an argument professor d:   postdoc e: I 'm I what I think is that why not have the corpus , since it 's so expensive to put together , useful for the widest range of of central corp things that people generally use corpora for and which are , you know , used in computational linguistics . professor d: OK , well , i i let 's let 's see what we can get .  , it it I think that if we 're aiming at at  , groups of graduate students and professors and so forth who are talking about things together , and it 's from the Berkeley campus , probably most of it will be OK , postdoc e: Yes , that 's fine . And my point in m in my note to Liz was I think that undergrads are an iff iffy population . grad b: Well , not to mention the fact that I would be hesitant certainly to take anyone under eighteen , probably even an anyone under twenty - one . professor d: Oh , you age - ist ! grad b: What 's that ? Well , age - ist . Well , Morgan , you were mentioning that Mari may not use the k equipment from IBM if they found something else , cuz there 's a professor d: They 're they 're yeah , they 're d they 're  assessing whether they should do that or y do something else , hopefully over the next few weeks . phd f: Cuz  , one remote possibility is that if we st if we inherited that equipment , if she weren't using it , could we set up a room in the linguistics department ? And and  , there there may be a lot more or or in psych , or in comp wherever , in another building where we could  , record people there . I think we 'd have a better chance grad b: I think we 'd need a real motivated partner to do that . But if there were such a  it 's a remote possibility , then  , you know , one of us could you know , go up there and record the meeting or something rather than bring all of them down here . phd f: So it 's just a just a thought if they end up not using the the hardware . professor d: Well , the other thing Yeah ,  the other thing that I was hoping to do in the first place was to turn it into some kind of portable thing so you could wheel it around .  , and grad b: Well , I know that space is really scarce on at least in CS . phd f: But you may not need a separate room , you know , grad b: That 's true . phd f: the idea is , if they have a meeting room and they can guarantee that the equipment will be safe and so forth , and if one of us is up there once a week to record the meeting or something grad b: True . professor d: Well , maybe John would let us put it into the phonology lab or something . grad b: Yeah , I think it would be interesting because then we could regularly get another meeting . phd c: But I I I think you need , another portable thing a another portable equipment to to do , eh , more e easier the recording process , eh , out from ICSI . phd c: Eh , if you you want to to record , eh , a seminar or a class , eh , in the university , you you need It - it would be eh eh very difficult to to put , eh , a lot of , eh , head phones eh in different people when you have to to record only with , eh , this kind of , eh , d device . grad b: Yeah , but I think if we if we wanna just record with the tabletop microphones , that 's easy . grad b: Right ? That 's very easy , phd c: Ye - Yeah , yeah . professor d: Actually , that 's a int that raises an interesting point that came up in our discussion that 's maybe worth repeating . We realized that , when we were talking about this that , OK , there 's these different things that we want to do with it . So , it 's true that we wanna be selective in some ways , the way that you were speaking about with , not having an interlingua and  , these other issues . But on the other hand , it 's not necessarily true that we need all of the corpus to satisfy all of it . So , a a as per the example that we wanna have a fair amount that 's done with a small n recorded with a small , typ number of types of meetings But we can also have another part that 's , just one or two meetings of each of a of a range of them and that 's OK too .  , i We realized in discussion that the other thing is , what about this business of distant and close microphones ?  , we really wanna have a substantial amount recorded this way , that 's why we did it . But what about For th for these issues of summarization , a lot of these higher level things you don't really need the distant microphone . phd f: Right , I c I think there 's grad b: And you don't really need the close microphone , you mean . phd f: Yea - yeah yeah , you actually don't really even need any fancy microphone . postdoc e: Which one did you mean ? professor d: You d You don't ne it doesn't you just need some microphone , somewhere . professor d: but  phd f: use  , but I think that any data that we spend a lot of effort to collect , professor d: Yeah . phd f: you know , each person who 's interested in  , we have a cou we have a bunch of different , slants and perspectives on what it 's useful for , they need to be taking charge of making sure they 're getting enough of the kind of data that they want . phd f: And So in my case , I think there w there is enough data for some kinds of projects and not enough for others . phd f: And so I 'm looking and thinking , \" Well I 'd be glad to walk over and record people and so forth if it 's to help th in my interest . phd f: And other people need to do that for themselves , h or at least discuss it so that we can find some optimal professor d: Right . professor d: But I think that I 'm raising that cuz I think it 's relevant exactly for this idea up there that if you think about , \" Well , gee , we have this really complicated setup to do , \" well maybe you don't . professor d: Maybe if if If really all you want is to have a a a recording that 's good enough to get a  , a transcription from later , you just need to grab a tape recorder and go up and make a recording . professor d: we we could have a fairly We could just get a DAT machine and phd f: Well , I agree with Jane , though , on the other hand that phd c: Yeah . phd f: So that might be true , you may say for instance , summarization , or something that sounds very language oriented . You may say well , \" Oh yeah , you just do that from transcripts of a radio show . phd f: But what you what I was thinking is long term what would be neat is to be able to pick up on  Suppose you just had a distant microphone there and you really wanted to be able to determine this . phd f: So I do think that long term you should always try to satisfy the greatest number of of interests and have this parallel information , which is really what makes this corpus powerful . phd f: Otherwise , you know , lots of other sites can propose individual studies , so professor d:  but I I think that the  i We can't really underestimate the difficulty shouldn't really u underestimate the difficulty of getting a setup like this up . professor d: And so ,  it took quite a while to get that together and to say , \" Oh , we 'll just do it up there , \" phd f: OK . professor d: If you 're talking about something simple , where you throw away a lot of these dimensions , then you can do that right away . Talking about something that has all of these different facets that we have here , it won't happen quickly , it won't be easy , and there 's all sorts of issues about th you know keeping the equipment safe , or else hauling it around , and all sorts of o phd f: So then maybe we should try to bring people here . professor d: I think the first priority should be to pry to get try to get people to come here . phd f: that 's that 's OK , so professor d: We 're set up for it . phd f: Yeah , I And I think we can get people to come here , that But the issue is you definitely wanna make sure that the kind of group you 're getting is the right group so that you don't waste a lot of your time and the overhead in bringing people down . professor d: Yeah , they have to do their digits or they don't get they don't get their food . professor d: Yeah grad b: Should I pursue that ? phd f: Oh , definitely , yeah . grad b: So I 'm not sure whether they 'll still be so willing to volunteer , but I 'll send an email and ask . phd f: I 'd love to get people that are not linguists or engineers , cuz these are both weird grad b: Right . professor d: The the The oth the other h phd f: well , I know , I shouldn't say that . The o the o the other The other thing is , that we we talked about is give to them  , burn an extra CD - ROM . professor d: and give them So if they want a basically and audio record of their phd f: Well , I thought that was I thought he meant , \" Give them a music CD , \" like they g Then he said a CD of the of their speech professor d: Oh . phd f: and I guess it depends of what kind of audience you 're talking to , but You know , I personally would not want a CD of my meeting , grad b: Mmm . Of the meeting ? phd f: but maybe yeah , maybe you 're professor d: If you 're having some planning meeting of some sort and  you 'd like phd f: right . professor d: We 're saying , \" Look , you know , you 're gonna get this . It 's actually p It 's probably gonna be pretty useless to you , grad b: Yep . professor d: but you 'll ge appreciate , you know , where it 's useful and where it 's useless , phd f: Right . professor d: and then , we 're gonna move this technology , so it 'll become useful . phd a: What if you could tell them that you 'll give them the the transcripts when they come back ? postdoc e: Alth phd f: But we might need a little more to incentivize them , that 's all . postdoc e: I hav I have to  raise a little eensy - weensy concern about doing th giving them the CD immediately , because of these issues of , you know , this kind of stuff , where maybe You know ? professor d: Good point . professor d: So we can so we can postdoc e: We could burn it after it 's been cleared with the transcript stage . phd f: If It should be the same CD - ROM that we distribute publically , grad b: That 's a good point . phd f: right ? professor d: Although it 's phd f: Otherwise they 're not allowed to play it for anyone . postdoc e: Yeah , that 's right , say \" Yeah , well , I got this CD , and , Your Honor , I \" grad b: Yeah . So that was that topic , and then  , I guess another topic would be where are we in the whole disk resources question for grad b: We are slowly slowly getting to the point where we have  enough sp room to record meetings . So I  did a bunch of archiving , and still doing a bunch of archiving , I I 'm in the midst of doing the P - files from  , Broadcast News . phd c: Eleven ? grad b: And it 'll take another eleven to do the clone . phd a: Where did you copy it to ? grad b: Well , it 's Abbott . professor d: Sk - It 's copying from one place on Abbott to another place on Abbott ? grad b: Tape . phd a: Ah ! grad b: So I 'm archiving it , and then I 'm gonna delete the files . postdoc e: One thing The good news about that that is that once once it 's archived , it 's pretty quick to get back . professor d: Is it ? postdoc e: it it it The other direction is fast , but this direction is really slow . phd a: Generating a clone ? postdoc e: Yeah , that 's a good point . phd a: Oh ! Hunh ! professor d: S postdoc e: Now , what will  Is the plan to g to So stuff will be saved , it 's just that you 're relocating it ?  , so we 're gonna get more disk space ? Or did I ? grad b: No , the the these are the P - files from Broadcast News , which are regeneratable regeneratable postdoc e: OK . grad b: And so they they were two gigabytes per file and we had six of them or something . professor d: Or maybe six ? grad b: The SUN , ha  , takes more disks than the Andatico one did . The SUN rack takes Th - One took four and one took six , or maybe it was eight and twelve . professor d: How many How much phd a: Is there a difference in price or something ? grad b: Well , what happened is that we we bought all our racks and disks from Andatico for years , according to Dave , and Andatico got bought by another company and doubled their prices . I 've been looking at the , Aurora data and , first first look at it , there were basically three directories on there that could be moved . One was called Aurora , one was Spanish , which was Carmen 's Spanish stuff , and the other one was , SPINE . phd a: And so , I wrote to Dan and he was very concerned that the SPINE stuff was moving to a non - backed - up disk . So , I realized that well , probably not all of that should be moved , just the CD - ROM type data , the the static data . So I moved that , and then  , I asked him to check out and see if it was OK . I told him he could delete it if he wanted to , I haven't checked today to see if he 's deleted it or not . And then Carmen 's stuff , I realized that when I had copied all of her stuff to XA , I had copied stuff there that was dynamic data . professor d: So , but ,  y you 're figuring you can record another five meetings or something with the space that you 're clearing up from the Broadcast News , but , we have some other disks , some of which you 're using for Aurora , but are we g do we have some other other space now ? grad b: Yep . So , so , we have space on the current disk right now , where Meeting Recorder is , and that 's probably enough for about four meetings . phd a: OK , I but the stuff I 'm moving from Aurora is on the DC disk that we grad b: I don't remember . Yeah ,  we were at a hundred percent and then we dropped down to eighty - six for reasons I don't understand . And then with Broadcast News , that 's five or six more meetings , so , you know , we have a couple weeks .  , so , yeah , I think I think we 're OK , until we get the new disk . phd a: So should ,  One question I had for you was , we need we sh probably should move the Aurora an and all that other stuff off of the Meeting Recorder disk . Is there another backed - up disk that you know of that would ? grad b: We should put it onto the Broadcast News one . grad b: But , so we could ' jus just do that at the end of today , once the archive is complete , and I 've verified it . professor d: OK , @ @ So , then I guess th the last thing I 'd had on my my agenda was just to hear hear an update on what what Jose has been doing , phd c:  - huh . professor d: so phd c: I have , eh , The result of my work during the last days . Eh , and the the last , eh , days , eh , I work , eh , in my house , eh , in a lot of ways and thinking , reading eh , different things about the the Meeting Recording project . phd c: But for me , eh is interesting because , eh , eh , here 's i is the demonstration of the overlap , eh , problem . phd c: It 's a real problem , a frequently problem  , because you have overlapping zones eh , eh , eh , all the time . phd c: Eh , by a moment I have , eh , nnn , the , eh , n I I did a mark of all the overlapped zones in the meeting recording , with eh , a exact mark . Oh , you did that by hand ? phd c: Heh ? That 's eh , yet b b Yeah , by b b by hand by hand because , eh , eh \" Why . \" grad b: Can I see that ? Can I get a copy ? professor d: Oh . phd c: My my idea is to work phd a: Wow ! phd c: I I I do I don I don't @ @ I don't know , eh , if , eh , it will be possible because I I I haven't a lot eh , enough time to to to work .  , only just eh , six months , as you know , but , eh , my idea is , eh , is very interesting to to work in in the line of , eh , automatic segmenter . phd c: Eh but eh , eh , in my opinion , we need eh , eh , a reference eh session to t to to evaluate the the the tool . And so are you planning to do that or have you done that already ? phd c: And No , no , with i grad b: Have you done that or are you planning to do that ? phd c: Sorry ? No , I I plan to do that . Darn ! phd c: I plan I plan , but eh , eh , the idea is the is the following . I I will I will eh , talk about eh , in the in the blackboard about the my ideas . phd c: Eh , eh This information eh , with eh , exactly time marks eh , for the overlapping zones eh overlapping zone , and eh , a speaker a a pure speech eh , eh , speaker zone .  , eh zones eh of eh speech of eh , one speaker without any any eh , noise eh , any any acoustic event eh that eh , eh , w eh , is not eh , speech , real speech . And , I need t true eh , silence for that , because my my idea is to to study the nnn the the set of parameters eh , what , eh , are more m more discriminant to eh , classify . The idea is to eh to use eh , I 'm not sure to eh yet , but eh my idea is to use a a cluster eh algorithm or , nnn , a person strong in neural net algorithm to eh to eh study what is the , eh , the property of the different feat eh feature , eh , to classify eh speech and overlapping eh speech . phd c: And my idea is eh , it would be interesting to to have eh , a control set . And my control set eh , will be the eh , silence , silence without eh , any any noise . postdoc e: Which means that we 'd still You 'd hear the grad b: Yeah , fans . phd c: Eh , I  eh , noise eh , eh claps eh , tape clips , eh , the difference eh , professor d:   phd c: eh , eh , event eh , which , eh , eh , has , eh eh , a hard effect of distorti spectral distortion in the in the eh speech . grad b: So so you intend to hand - mark those and exclude them ? professor d:   phd c: Yeah , I have mark in in in in that Not in all in all the the file , grad b:   phd c: only eh , eh , nnn , mmm , I have eh , ehm I don't remind what is the the the the quantity , but eh , I I have marked enough speech on over and all the overlapping zones . I have , eh , two hundred and thirty , more or less , overlapping zones , and is similar to to this information , grad b: Whew !   phd c: because with the program , I cross the information of  , of Jane with eh , my my segmentation by hand . phd c: And the the idea is , eh , I I will use , eh , I want My idea is , eh , to eh to classify . phd c: I I need eh , the exact eh , mark of the different , eh , eh , zones because I I want to put , eh , for eh , each frame a label indicating . I I I put , eh , eh , for each frame a label indicating what is th the type , what is the class , eh , which it belong . phd c: Eh , the class you will overlapping speech \" overlapping \" is a class , eh , \" speech \" @ @ the class that 's grad b: Nonspeech . phd a: These will be assigned by hand ? phd c: a I I I ha I h I I put the mark by hand , phd a: Based on the  - huh . phd c: because , eh , my idea is , eh , in in the first session , I need , eh , I I need , eh , to be sure that the information eh , that , eh , I I will cluster , is is right . Because , eh , eh , if not , eh , I will I will , eh , return to the speech file to analyze eh , what is the problems , grad b: Well , training , and validation . And I I 'd prefer I would prefer , the to to have , eh , this labeled automatically , but , eh , eh , fro th I need truth . So , the difference between the top two , i So so I start at the bottom , so \" silence \" is clear . By \" speech \" do you mean speech by one sp by one person only ? phd c: Speech Yeah . postdoc e: So this is un OK , and then and then the top includes people speaking at the same time , or or a speaker and a breath overlapping , someone else 's breath , or or clicking , overlapping with speech So , that that 's all those possibilities in the top one . phd c: Eh , in the first moment , because , eh , eh , I I have information , eh , of the overlapping zones , eh , information about if the , eh , overlapping zone is , eh , from a speech , clear speech , from a one to a two eh speaker , or three speaker , or is is the zone where the breath of a speaker eh , overlaps eh , onto eh , a speech , another , especially speech . postdoc e: So it 's basi it 's basically speech wi som with with something overlapping , which could be speech but doesn't need to be . phd c: No , no , es especially eh , overlapping speech from , eh , different eh , eh , speaker . Eh professor d: No , but there 's but , I think she 's saying \" Where do you In these three categories , where do you put the instances in which there is one person speaking and other sounds which are not speech ? \" phd c: Ah ! professor d: Which category do you put that in ? postdoc e: Yeah , that 's right . Yeah , he here I I put eh speech from eh , from , eh , one speaker without , eh , eh , any any any events more . postdoc e: Oh ! professor d: Right , so where do you put speech from one speaker that does have a nonspeech event at the same time ? phd c: Where ? Where What is the class ? professor d: Which catege which category ? postdoc e: Like a c phd c: No . phd c: For for the by the @ @ no , @ @ because I I I I want to limit the the nnn , the the study . grad b: Yeah , so that 's what he was saying before , is that he excluded those . phd c: \" Why ? Why ? What 's the reason ? \" because i it 's the first study . In the in the future , the the idea is to to extend the class , phd a: Is is phd c: to consider all the all the information , you you mentioned before professor d: Yeah . phd c: but eh , the the first idea Because eh , I don't know what hap what will happen with the study . i it 's pure phd a: What if there was a door - slam or something ? phd c: No , no , it 's pure silence . professor d: What you Well w I I think what you m I think what you mean is that it 's nonspeech segments that don't have impulsive noises . professor d: Right ? Cuz you 're calling what you 're calling \" event \" is somebody coughing or clicking , or rustling paper , or hitting something , which are impulsive noises . Right ? phd c: h here yet , yet I I I I I think I I think , eh , there are that some kind of noises that , eh , don't don't wanted to to be in that , eh , in that control set . phd c: But I prefer , I prefer at at the first , eh , the the silence with eh , this eh this kind of the of eh of noise . professor d: Right , it 's  , it 's \" Background \" might be might be a better word than \" silence \" . phd c: And , with this information The idea is eh , eh , nnn , I have a label for for each , eh , frame and , eh with a cluster eh algorithm I and postdoc e: Well , we needed to get the categories , yeah . And eh I am going to prepare a test bed , eh , well , eh , a a set of feature structure eh , eh , models . phd c: I have to to test , but eh I phd a: You have your own ? phd c: Yeah , yeah , yeah . Is a modified version of of of a pitch tracker , eh , from , eh , Standar - eh Stanford University in Stanford ? No . phd a: Oh ! What 's it written in ? phd c: Eh , em , I I I don't remember what is the the name of the of the author , because I I have several I have eh , eh , em , eh , library tools , from eh , Festival and of from Edinburgh eh , from Cambridge , eh , and from our department . phd c: And And I have to because , in general the pitch tracker , doesn't work very well and grad b: Bad . This this is And th the idea is to to , eh , to obtain , eh , for example , eh , eh diff eh , eh , different well , no , a great number of eh FEC for example , eh , eh , twenty - five , eh , thirty thirty parameters , eh , for for each one . And in a first eh , nnn , step in the investi in the research in eh , my idea is try to , eh , to prove , what is the performance of the difference parameter , eh to classify the different , eh , what is the the the the front - end approach to classify eh , the different , eh , frames of each class eh and what is the the , nnn , nnn , nnn , eh , what is the , the error eh , of the data grad b: Supervised clustering . phd c: and the second is try to eh , to use some ideas eh , similar to the linear discriminant analysis . phd c: Eh ? Eh , similar , because the the idea is to to study what is the contribution of eh , each parameter to the process of classify correctly the different the different parameters . What sort of classifier ar ? phd c: Eh , the the the classifier is nnn by the moment is eh is eh , similar , nnn , that the classifier used eh , in a quantifier vectorial quantifier is eh , used to to eh , some distance to to put eh , a vector eh , in in a class different . grad b: Unimodal ? phd c: Is Yeah ? W with a model , is is only to cluster using a eh , @ @ or a similarity . grad b: So is it just one cluster per phd c: A another possibility it to use eh a netw netw a neural network . phd c: But eh what 's the p What is my idea ? What 's the problem I I I I see in in in if you you use the the neural network ? If w when this kind of eh , mmm , cluster , clustering algorithm to can test , to can eh observe what happened you you can't you can't eh , eh put up with your hand in the different parameter , grad b: Right , you can't analyse it . phd c: but eh If you use a neural net is is a good idea , but eh you don't know what happened in the interior of the neural net . professor d: Well , actually , you can do sensitivity analyses which show you what the importance of the different parce pieces of the input are . professor d: It 's hard to w w what you It 's hard to tell on a neural net is what 's going on internally . professor d: But it 's actually not that hard to analyse it and figure out the effects of different inputs , especially if they 're all normalized . professor d: Well , this isn't tru if if if you really wonder what different if if phd c: Yeah . phd c: But professor d: Yeah , then a decision tree is really good , but the thing is here he 's he 's not he 's not like he has one you know , a bunch of very distinct variables , like pitch and this he 's talking about , like , a all these cepstral coefficients , and so forth , grad b: Right . professor d: in which case a a any reasonable classifier is gonna be a mess , and it 's gonna be hard to figure out what what  phd c: And grad b: Right . professor d: I  , I think the other thing that one  , this is , I think a good thing to do , to sort of look at these things at least See what I 'd I 'd Let me tell you what I would do . Instead of taking all the MFCC 's , or all the PLP 's or whatever , I would just take a couple . professor d: OK ? Like like C - one , C - two , something like that , so that you can visualize it . professor d: OK , so before you do build up any kind of fancy classifiers , just take a look in two dimensions , at how these things are split apart . professor d: That I think will give you a lot of insight of what is likely to be a useful feature when you put it into a more complicated classifier . professor d: And the second thing is , once you actually get to the point of building these classifiers , @ @ what this lacks so far is the temporal properties . So if you 're just looking at a frame and a time , you don't know anything about , you know , the structure of it over time , and so you may wanna build @ @ build a Markov model of some sort  , or or else have features that really are based on  on on some bigger chunk of time . But don't  anyway , this is my suggestion , is don't just , you know , throw in twenty features at it , the deltas , and the delta del and all that into some classifier , even even if it 's K - nearest - neighbors , you still won't know phd c: Yeah . professor d: what it 's doing , even You know it 's  , I think to know what it 's to have a better feeling for what it 's grad b: Yep . professor d: look at at som some picture that shows you , \" Here 's These things  ,  are offer some separation . \" And , in LPC , the thing to particularly look at is , I think is something like , the residual phd c: Yeah . S postdoc e: Can I ask ? It strikes me that there 's another piece of information  , that might be useful and that 's simply the transition . So , w if you go from a transition of silence to overlap versus a transition from silence to speech , there 's gonna be a b a big informative area there , it seems to me . phd c: I eh the the Meeting Recorder project , for me , has eh , two eh , w has eh several parts , several p objective professor d:   But eh , at the first , in the acoustic , eh , eh , parts of the project , eh I think you eh we have eh two main eh objective . And for that , if you don't use , eh , eh , a speech recognizer , eh broad class , or not broad class to to try to to to label the different frames , I think the Ike criterion or BIC criterion eh will be enough to detect the change . When you you have , eh , eh s eh the transition of speech or or silence eh to overlap zone , this criterion is enough with probably with , eh , this kind of , eh , eh the the the more eh use eh use eh used eh em normal , regular eh parameter MF - MFCC . But eh eh I I understand that you your objective is to eh classify , to know that eh that zone not is only a new zone in the in the file , that eh you have eh , but you have to to to know that this is overlap zone . because in the future you will eh try to to process that zone with a non - regular eh eh speech recognizer model , I suppose . phd c: you you will pretend to to to process the overlapping z eh zone with another kind of algorithm professor d:   phd c: because it 's very difficult to to to obtain the transcription from eh using eh eh a regular , normal speech recognizer . phd c: A model to detect more acc the mor most accurately possible that is p  , will be possible the , eh the mark , the change and another another model will @ @ or several models , to try s but eh several model eh robust models , sample models to try to classify the difference class . grad b: I 'm I 'm I 'm sorry , I didn't understand you what you said . What what model ? postdoc e:  phd c: Eh , the the classifiers of the of the n to detect the different class to the different zones before try to to recognize , eh with eh to transcribe , with eh a speech recognizer . phd c: And my idea is to use eh , for example , a neural net postdoc e: So p phd c: with the information we obtain from this eh this eh study of the parameter with the selected parameter to try to eh to put the class of each frame . phd c: you you eh , eh have obtained in the first eh , step with the for example , BIC eh , eh criterion compare model postdoc e:   phd c: And You I don't - u professor d: OK , but , I I think in any event we 're agreed that the first step is phd c: i postdoc e: Yeah . professor d: Because what we had before for for  , speaker change detection did not include these overlaps . professor d: So the first thing is for you to to build up something that will detect the overlaps . professor d: Right ? So again , I think the first thing to do to detect the overlaps is to look at these  , in in in in grad b: Features ? phd c: Yeah . professor d: Well , I again , the things you 've written up there I think are way too way too big . professor d: OK ? If you 're talking about , say , twelfth twelfth - order  MFCC 's or something like that it 's just way too much . All you 'll be able to do is put it into a classifier and see how well it does . professor d: Whereas I think if you have things if you pick one or two dimensional things , or three of you have some very fancy display , and look at how the the different classes separate themselves out , you 'll have much more insight about what 's going on . professor d: Well , you 'll you 'll get a feeling for what 's happening , you know , phd c: Yeah . professor d: so if you look at Suppose you look at first and second - order cepstral coefficients for some one of these kinds of things and you find that the first - order is much more effective than the second , and then you look at the third and there 's not and not too much there , you may just take first and second - order cepstral coefficients , phd c: Yeah . professor d: right ? And with LPC , I think LPC per se isn't gonna tell you much more than than than the other , maybe .  , and  on the other hand , the LPC residual , the energy in the LPC residual , will say how well ,  the low - order LPC model 's fitting it , which should be pretty poorly for two two or more people speaking at the same time , and it should be pretty well , for w for for one . professor d: And so I i again , if you take a few of these things that are are prob  promising features and look at them in pairs , I think you 'll have much more of a sense of \" OK , I now have  , doing a bunch of these analyses , I now have ten likely candidates . phd c: but eh , eh eh eh eh I don't know it is the first eh way to to do that and I would eh like to to know what eh , your opinion . Eh all this study in the f in the first moment , I I w I I will pretend to do with eh eh equalizes speech . grad b: With postdoc e: With what ? With what ? grad b: Right . phd c: Eh , why ? Because eh the spectral distortion is more eh a lot eh clearer , very much clearer if we compare with the PDA . phd c: fff ! Because the n the noise eh to sp the signal - to - noise relation is eh is is low . phd c: I don't know eh  i i that eh the the result of the of the study eh with eh with eh this eh this speech , the mix speech eh will work exactly with the eh PDA files . phd c: eh What , I  , what what is the effect of the low ' signal to to to noise relation , you know , eh with professor d: N u We Well , I think I think I think it 's not a it 's not at all unreasonable . It makes sense to start with the simpler signal because if you have features which don't aren't even helpful in the high signal - to - noise ratio , then there 's no point in putting them into the low signal ratio , one would think , anyway . professor d: And so , if you can get @ @  again , my prescription would be that you would , with a mixed signal , you would take a collection of possible  , features look at them , look at how these different classes that you 've marked , separate themselves , and then collect ,  in pairs , and then collect ten of them or something , and then proceed with a bigger classifier . professor d: And then if you can get that to work well , then you go to the other signal . And then , and you and you know , they won't work as well , but how m you know , how much grad b: Right . Because it I think it would be interesting to see if some features work well with close mixed , and And don't professor d:  . professor d: That 's well , the It it 's it 's true that it also , it could be useful to do this exploratory analysis where you 're looking at scatter plots and so on in both cases . phd c: I I I I think that the the eh parameter we found , eh , eh worked with both eh , speech file , postdoc e: That 's good . phd c: but eh what is the the the relation of eh of the performance when eh you use eh the , eh eh speech file the PDA speech files . Is eh is not easy eh to to solve , because if you I I I have seen the the the speech file from eh PDA , and s some parts is very difficult because you you don't see the spectrum the spectrogram . phd c: Is very difficult to apply eh , eh a parameter to detect change when you don't see . Well , that that that 's another reason why very simple features , things like energy , and things things like harmonicity , and residual energy are  , yeah are are better to use than very complex ones because they 'll be more reliable . phd a: Yeah , I maybe this is a dumb question , but w I thought it would be I thought it would be easier if you used a PDA professor d: Nah . phd a: because can't you , couldn't you like use beam - forming or something to detect speaker overlaps ?  grad b: Well , if you used the array , rather than the signal from just one . professor d: Yeah , no , you you 're you 're right grad b: But that 's professor d: that In fact , if we made use of the fact that there are two microphones , you do have some location information . which we don't have with the one and and so that 's phd a: Is that not allowed with this project ? professor d: well , no , we we don't have any rules , r really . professor d: I think I I think I think it 's it 's it 's a it 's an additional interesting question . professor d: I think you wanna know whether you can do it with one , because you know it 's not necessarily true that every device that you 're trying to do this with will have two . professor d: if , on the other hand , we show that there 's a huge advantage with two , well then that could be a real point . professor d: But , we don't n even know yet what the effect of detecting having the ability to detect overlaps is . postdoc e: There there is a complication though , and that is if a person turns their back to the to the PDA , then some of the positional information goes away ? phd c: Yeah . professor d: Well , it it it does , i it d it does , but the the the issue is that that phd a: No , it 's not it 's not that so much as postdoc e: And then , And if they 're on the access on the axis of it , that was the other thing I was thinking . postdoc e: He You mentioned this last time , that that if if you 're straight down the midline , then then the r the left - right 's gonna be different , grad b: Yeah , we hav need to put it on a little turntable , phd c: I I I I I th grad b: and phd a: Well , it 's phd c: Yeah . postdoc e: It seems to me that that it 's not a p  , you know , it 's this the topograph the topology of it is is a little bit complicated . phd a: I don't I don't know ho phd c: I I I think Sorry . I I I think because the the the distance between the two microph eh , microphone , eh , in the PDA is very near . But it 's  from my opinion , it 's an interesting idea to to try to study the binaural eh problem eh , with information , because I I found difference between the the speech from from each micro eh , in the PDA . It - it 's not amplitude , postdoc e: Oh yeah ! Oh I agree ! And we use it ourselves . postdoc e: But I 'm just I 'm just saying that the way we 're seated around a table , is not the same with respect to each to each person with respect to the PDA , phd c: No . postdoc e: so we 're gonna have a lot of differences with ref respect to the speaker . phd c: But professor d: That 's So so i @ @ I think the issue is , \" Is there a clean signal coming from only one direction ? \" phd a: Right . professor d: If it 's not coming from just one direction , if it if th if there 's a broader pattern , it means that it 's more likely there 's multiple people speaking , phd c: Yeah . phd a: So it 's sort of like how how confused is it about where the beam is . professor d: Yeah , is there a narrow Is there a narrow beam pattern or is it a a distributed beam pattern ? So if there 's a distributed beam pattern , then it looks more like it 's it 's  , multiple people . OK , it just it just seemed to me that  , that this isn't the ideal type of separation .  , I I think it 's I can see the value o professor d: Oh , ideal would be to have the wall filled with them , but  But the thing is just having two mikes If you looked at that thing on on Dan 's page , it was When when there were two people speaking , and it looked really really different . phd a: Did - Sorry , b  I 'm not sure what Dan 's page is that you mean . professor d: You take the signal from the two microphones and you cros and you cross - correlate them with different lags . So when one person is speaking , then wherever they happen to be at the point when they 're speaking , then there 's a pretty big maximum right around that point in the l in in the lag . professor d: So if at whatever angle you are , at some lag corresponding to the time difference between the two there , you get this boost in the in in the cross - correlation value function . phd a: So so if there 's two grad b: And if there are multiple people talking , you 'll see two peaks . postdoc e: Well , let me ask you , if if both people were over there , it would be less effective than if one was there and one was across , catty - corner ? phd c: Yeah . The - the Oh , I 'm sorry , postdoc e: No ? professor d: if they 're right next to one another ? phd a: If I was if I was here and Morgan was there and we were both talking , it wouldn't work . professor d: i i postdoc e: Next next one over n over on this side of the P PDA . postdoc e: Versus you versus you know , and we 're catty - corner across the table , and I 'm farther away from this one and you 're farther away from that one . grad b: Or or even if , like , if people were sitting right across from each other , you couldn't tell the difference either . Yeah , so it 's postdoc e: And so my point was just that it 's it 's gonna be differentially differentially varia valuable . postdoc e: it 's not to say  , I certainly think it 's extremely val And we we humans n n depend on you know , these these binaural cues . professor d: But it 's almost but it 's almost a I think what you 're talking about i there 's two things . professor d: There 's a sensitivity issue , and then there 's a pathological error  issue . professor d: If someone just happens to be sitting right there then we won't get good information from it . and i and if there So it And if it 's the two of you guys on the same side professor d: if they 're if they 're close , it 's just a question of the sensitivity . professor d: So if the sensitivity is good enough and we just we just don't have enough , experience with it to know how postdoc e: Yeah . postdoc e: Oh I 'm not I 'm not trying to argue against using it , by any means . I just wanted to point out that that weakness , that it 's topo topologically impossible to get it perfect for everybody . professor d: the other thing you can do  , if  , i We 're assuming that it would be a big deal just to get somebody convince somebody to put two microphones in the PDA . And then you know then you 're sort of Yeah , then then you pretty much could cover phd a: Once you got two postdoc e: Interesting . phd a: Well what about just doing it from these mikes ? postdoc e: Interesting . phd c: It will be more interesting to study the PZM because the the the separation I I think professor d:  @ @ But - but that 's  , we can we 'll be all of this is there for us to study . professor d: But but but the thing is , one of the at least one of the things I was hoping to get at with this is what can we do with what we think would be the normal situation if some people get together and one of them has a PDA . phd a: That 's what I was asking about , what are the constraints ? phd c: Yeah . professor d: Well , that 's that 's the constraint of one question that I think both Adam and I were were were interested in . professor d: but you know if you can instrument a room , this is really minor league compared with what some people are doing , right ? Some people at at  , yeah , at Brown and and and and at   and at Cape , grad b: Big micro @ @ arrays . phd a: Didn't they have something at Cape ? professor d: they both have these , you know , big arrays on the wall . And you know , if you could do that , you 've got microphones all over the place grad b: Very finely . professor d: you know p tens of microphones , and and  phd a: Oh ! I saw a demo . professor d: And if you do that then you can really get very nice  kind of selectivity phd a: Yeah . grad b: Oh , I saw one that was like a hundred microphones , a ten by ten array . phd a: And you could In a noisy room , they could have all kinds of noises and you can zoom right in on somebody . grad b: It was all in software and they and you could pick out an individual beam and listen to it . professor d: But , the reason why I haven't focused on that as the fir my first concern is because  , I 'm interested in what happens for people , random people out in some random place where they 're p having an impromptu discussion . And you can't just always go , \" well , let 's go to this heavily instrumented room that we spent tens of thousands of dollars to se to set up \" . phd a: No , what you need to do is you 'd have a little fabric thing that you unroll and hang on a wall . phd a: It has all these mikes and it has a plug - in jack to the PDA . grad b: But I think professor d: The other thing actually , that gets at this a little bit of something else I 'd like to do , is what happens if you have two P D grad b: Yep . professor d: and they communicate with each other ? And then You know , they 're in random positions , the likelihood that  , basically there wouldn't be any l likely to be any kind of nulls , if you even had two . grad b: Though All sorts of interesting things you can do with that , postdoc e: Interesting . grad b: not only can you do microphone arrays , but you can do all sorts of  multi - band as well . postdoc e: Ah ! phd a: I still like my rug on the wall idea , so if anybody patents that , then grad b: But I think postdoc e: Well , you could have strips that you stick to your clothing . phd a: Hats ? grad b: In terms of the research th research , it 's really it 's whatever the person who is doing the research wants to do .  , I i I i I would actually kind of like us to wind it down , see if we can still get to the end of the , birthdays thing there . professor d: So grad b: Well , I had a couple things that I did wanna bring out . grad b: One is , do we need to sign new these again ? postdoc e: Well , it 's slightly different . phd a: Are they new ? postdoc e: Cuz it it 's slightly different . professor d: Oh , this morning we didn't sign anything cuz we said that if anybody had signed it already , we didn't have to . grad b: Yeah , I I should 've checked with Jane first , but the ch the form has changed . grad b: I had some things I wanted to talk about with the thresholding stuff I 'm doing . postdoc e: I had to make one grad b: But , if we 're in a hurry , we can put that off . postdoc e: Well , should I  I have some results to present , but  I guess we won't have time to do that this time . But it seems like  the anonymization is  , is also something that we might wanna discuss in greater length .  , wha what postdoc e: If if we 're about to wind down , I think what I would prefer is that we  , delay the anonymization thing till next week , and I would like to present the results that I have on the overlaps . @ @ It sounds like u  , there were there were a couple technical things people would like to talk about . Why don't we just take a couple minutes to to briefly do them , and then and then and then and then and then we grad b: OK , go ahead , Jane . postdoc e: I 'd Oh , I 'd prefer to have more time for my results . postdoc e: And I think the anonymization , if y if you want to proceed with that now , I just think that that 's that 's a discussion which also n really deserves a lo a you know , more that just a minute . postdoc e: I really do think that , because you raised a couple of possibilities yourself , you and I have discussed it previously , and there are different ways that people approach it , e and I think we should grad b: Alright . We 're we 're just We 're getting enough data now that I 'd sort of like to do it now , before I get overwhelmed with once we decide how to do it postdoc e: Well , OK . I I 'll give you the short version , but I do think it 's an issue that we can't resolve in five minutes . postdoc e: OK , so the the short thing is  , we have  , tape recording  , sorry , digitized recor recordings . postdoc e: Now , in terms of like the transcript , the question becomes what symbol are you gonna put in there for everybody 's name , and whether you 're gonna put it in the text where he says \" Hey Roger \" or are we gonna put that person 's anonymized name in instead ? grad b: No , because then that would give you a mapping , and you don't wanna have a mapping . postdoc e: OK , so first decision is , we 're gonna anonymize the same name for the speaker identifier and also in the text whenever the speaker 's name is mentioned . Because that would give you a mapping between the speaker 's real name and the tag we 're using , and we don't want postdoc e: I I don't think you understood what I what I said . postdoc e: So  , so in within the context of an utterance , someone says \" So , Roger , what do you think ? \" OK . Then , it seems to me that Well , maybe I  it seems to me that if you change the name , the transcript 's gonna disagree with the audio , and you won't be able to use that . grad b: We don't we wanna we ha we want the transcript to be \" Roger \" . grad b: Because if we made the the transcript be the tag that we 're using for Roger , someone who had the transcript and the audio would then have a mapping between the anonymized name and the real name , and we wanna avoid that . postdoc e: OK , well , but then there 's this issue of if we 're gonna use this for a discourse type of thing , then and , you know , Liz was mentioning stuff in a previous meeting about gaze direction and who 's who 's the addressee and all , then to have \" Roger \" be the thing in the utterance and then actually have the speaker identifier who was \" Roger \" be \" Frank \" , that 's going to be really confusing and make it pretty much useless for discourse analysis . postdoc e: Now , if you want to , you know , in some cases , I I I know that Susan Ervin - Tripp in some of hers , actually did do  , a filter of the s signal where the person 's name was mentioned , except professor d: Yeah Yeah , once you get to the publication you can certainly do that . postdoc e: And and I cer and I So , the question then becomes one level back .  , how important is it for a person to be identified by first name versus full name ? Well , on the one hand , it 's not a full identity , we 're taking all these precautions ,  and they 'll be taking precautions , which are probably even the more important ones , to they 'll be reviewing the transcripts , to see if there 's something they don't like OK . On the other hand , this is a small this is a small pool , and people who say things about topic X e who are researchers and well - known in the field , they 'll be identifiable and simply from the from the first name . However , taking one step further back , they 'd be identifiable anyway , even if we changed all the names . postdoc e: So , is it really ,  You know ? grad b: Ugh ! postdoc e: Now , in terms of like so I I did some results , which I 'll report on n next time , which do mention individual speakers by name . Now , it would be very possible for me to take those data put them in a in a study , and just change everybody 's name for the purpose of the publication . And someone who looked professor d: You can go , you know , \" Z \"  , for instance .  , yeah , t it doesn't  , I 'm not knowledgeable about this , but it certainly doesn't bother me to have someone 's first name in in the in the transcript . postdoc e: Yeah , and and in the form that they sign , it does say \" your first name may arise in the course of the meetings \" . So again , th the issue is if you 're tracking discourse things , you know , if someone says , \" Frank said this \" and then you wanna connect it to something later , you 've gotta have this part where that 's \" Frank colon \" . grad b: Yeah , shoot ! professor d: Right ? postdoc e: Yeah , and and you know , even more i i  , immediate than that just being able to ,  Well , it just seems like to track track from one utterance to the next utterance who 's speaking and who 's speaking to whom , cuz that can be important . postdoc e: S i You know , \" You raised the point , So - and - so \" , it 's be kind of nice to be able to know who \" you \" was . postdoc e: And ac and actually you remember furthermore , you remember last time we had this discussion of how you know , I was sort of avoiding mentioning people 's names , professor d: Yeah , I was too . Well , if we 're going to step in after the fact and change people 's names in the transcript , we 've basically done something one step worse . Well , I would sug I I don't wanna change the names in the transcript , phd c: Yeah . grad b: but that 's because I 'm focused so much on the acoustics instead of on the discourse , and so I think that 's a really good point . L let me just back up this to make a a brief comment about the , what we 're covering in the meeting .  I realize when you 're doing this that   , I didn't realize that you had a bunch of things that you wanted to talk about . So I think what would be helpful would be  , i and I 'll I 'll mention this to to Liz and Andreas too , that  , before the meeting if anybody could send me , any any , agenda items that they were interested in and I 'll I 'll take the role of organizing them  , into into the agenda , postdoc e: OK . I 've no desire to to make it up , but if if no one 's told me things , then I 'm just proceeding from my my guesses , and and  , and i ye yeah , I I 'm sorry it ended up with your out your time to  , I 'm just always asking Jose what he 's doing , you know , and and so it 's There 's  , there 's obviously other things going on . grad b: How will we how would the person who 's doing the transcript even know who they 're talking about ? Do you know what I 'm saying ? phd a: \" The person who 's doing the transcript \" The IBM people ? grad b: Yeah .  , so so how is that information gonna get labeled anyway ? postdoc e: How do you mean , who what they 're who they 're talking about ? grad b: so if I 'm saying in a meeting , \" oh and Bob , by the way , wanted wanted to do so - and - so \" , postdoc e: How do you mean ? phd a: They 're just gonna write \" Bob \" on it or do @ @ grad b: if you 're doing Yeah , @ @ they 're just gonna write \" Bob \" . If you 're if you 're doing discourse analysis , postdoc e: They won't be able to change it themselves . professor d: What ar how are they gonna do any of this ? grad b: Yeah , really . postdoc e: Well , I I 'm betting we 're gonna have huge chunks that are just totally un untranscribable by them . professor d: they 're gonna say speaker - one , or speaker - two or speaker  I I phd a: They can't do that . phd c: Yeah , I think grad b: Well , the current one they don't do speaker identity . phd c:  grad b: because in NaturallySpeaking , or , excuse me , in ViaVoice , it 's only one person . I think that My understanding from Yen Is it Yen - Ching ? Is that how you pronounce her name ? professor d:  Yu - Ching , Yu - Ching . postdoc e: Oh ,  Yu - Ching ? Yu - Ching ? grad b: y Yu - Ching . postdoc e: was that  , they will that they will adopt the part of the conventions that that we discussed , where they put speaker identifier down . But , you know , h they won't know these people , so I think it 's Well , they 'll they 'll adopt some convention but we haven't specified to them So they 'll do something like speaker - one , speaker - two , is what I bet , but I 'm betting there 'll be huge variations in the accuracy of of their labeling the speakers . professor d: And it and it may very well be  , since they 're not going to sit there and and and worry ab about , it being the same speaker , they may very well go the eh the the first se the first time it changes to another speaker , that 'll be speaker - two . professor d: And the next time it 'll be speaker - three even if it 's actually speaker - one . grad b: Yeah we we can probably regenerate it pretty easily from the close - talking mikes . phd c:  postdoc e: Yes , I was thinking , the temp the time values of when it changes . grad b: The p It 's a good point , \" which what do you do for discourse tracking ? \" phd c: Because y y you don't know to know , eh you don't need to know what i what is the iden identification of the of the speakers . If if if if someone says , \" what what is Jose doing ? \" and then Jose says something , you need to know that that was Jose responding . postdoc e: Unless we adopt a different set of norms which is to not id to make a point of not identifying people by name , which then leads you to be more contextually ex explicit . You know ?  , so when we did this las last week , I felt that you know , now , Andreas may , @ @  , he he i sometimes people think of something else at the same time and they miss a sentence or something , and and because he missed something , then he missed the r the initial introduction of who we were talking about , and was was unable to do the tracking . postdoc e: But I felt like most of us were doing the tracking and knew who we were talking about and we just weren't mentioning the name . phd a: But , you know , like , at the beginning of this meeting Or , you I think said , you know , or s Liz , said something about  , \" is Mari gonna use the equipment ? \"  , how would you say that ? postdoc e: Yeah ? phd a: you have to really think , you know , about what you 're saying bef grad b: if you wanted to anonymize . Yeah , is professor d: \" Is you know who up in you know where ? \" phd a: Yeah . professor d: Right ? Use the phd a: I think it would be really hard if we made a policy where we didn't say names , plus we 'd have to tell everybody else . grad b: Yeah , darn !  , what I was gonna say is that the other option is that we could bleep out the names . phd a: I I think the I think I don't know , my own two cents worth is that you don't do anything about what 's in the recordings , you only anonymize to the extent you can , the speakers have signed the forms and all . grad b: Well , but that but that as I said , that that that works great for the acoustics , but it it hurts you a lot for trying to do discourse . grad b: Because you don't have a map of who 's talking versus their name that they 're being referred to . phd a: I thought we were gonna get it labelled speaker - one , speaker - two grad b: Sure but , h then you have to know that Jose is speaker - one and phd a: Why do you have to know his name ? professor d: OK , so suppose someone says , \" well I don't know if I really heard what  , what Jose said . professor d: So  u phd a: Oh , I see , you wanna associated the word \" Jose \" in the dialogue with the fact that then he responded . professor d: And so , if we pass out the data to someone else , and it says \" speaker - five \" there , we also have to pass them this little guide that says that speaker - five is Jose , grad b: And that violates our privacy . professor d: and if were gonna do that we might as well give them \" Jose \" say it was \" Jose \" . postdoc e: Now , I I think that we have these two phases in the in the data , which is the one which is o our use , University of Washington 's use , IBM , SRI . postdoc e: And within that , it may be that it 's sufficient to not  change the to not incorporate anonymization yet , but always , always in the publications we have to . postdoc e: And I think also , when we take it that next step and distribute it to the world , we have to . But I but I don that 's that 's a long way from now and and it 's a matter of between now and then of d of deciding how grad b: Making some decisions ? postdoc e: i i it You know , it may be s that we we 'll need to do something like actually X out that part of the  the audio , and just put in brackets \" speaker - one \" . phd c: the ? ? grad b: You know , what we could do also is have more than one version of release . professor d: I I think that we we have a need to have a consistent licensing policy of some sort , and postdoc e: But I also think a consistent licensing policy is important . phd a: Well , one thing to to take into consideration is w are there any  For example , the people who are funding this work , they want this work to get out and be useful for discourse . phd a: If we all of a sudden do this and then release it to the public and it 's not longer useful for discourse , you know grad b: Well , depending on how much editing we do , you might be able to still have it useful . grad b: But , n excuse me , but you could bleep out just the names . professor d: She No , but she 's saying , from the argument before , she wants to be able to say if someone said \" Jose \" in their in their thing , and then connect to so to what he said later , then you need it . But in the transcript , you could say , everywhere they said \" Jose \" that you could replace it with \" speaker - seven \" . But I I also wanna say that people grad b: And then it wouldn't meet match the audio anymore . professor d: And th and the other thing is if if if Liz were here , what she might say is that she wants to look if things that cut across between the audio and the dialogue , postdoc e: Well , you see ? So , it 's complicated . postdoc e: But it 's g but I think it was good to introduce the thing and we can do it next time . grad b: I didn't think when I wrote you that email I wasn't thinking it was a big can of worms , but I guess it is . postdoc e: Well it Discourse , you know Also I wanted to make the point that that discourse is gonna be more than just looking at a transcript . postdoc e: It 's gonna be looking at a t You know , and prosod prosodic stuff is involved , and that means you 're going to be listening to the audio , and then you come directly into this confronting this problem . phd a: Maybe we should just not allow anybody to do research on discourse , postdoc e: So . professor d: maybe we should only have meetings between people who don't know one another and who are also amnesiacs who don't know their own name . grad b: Did you read the paper on Eurospeech ? postdoc e: We could have little labels . I I I wanna introduce my Reservoir Dogs solution again , which is everyone has like \" Mister White \" , \" Mister Pink \" , \" Mister Blue \" . Did you read the paper a few years ago where they were reversing the syllables ? They were di they they had the utterances . phd a: But so , the syllables were in the same order , with respect to each other , but the acous grad b: Everything was in the same order , but they were the individual syll syllables were played backwards . phd a: What did it sound like ? grad b: People had no difficulty in interpreting it . So what we need is something that 's the reverse , that a speech recognizer works exactly the same on it but people can't understand it . professor d: What , what does the speech recognizer care ? grad b: Ah , anyway . professor d: postdoc e: Oh , do we do digits ? Or ? What do we do ? grad b:  OK , we 'll quickly do digits . like as if you were talking like , \" nine eight six eight seven ? \" postdoc e: Well , you know , in the in the one I transcribed , I did find a couple instances I found one instance of contrastive stress , where it was like the string had a li So it was like \" nine eight two four , nine nine two four \" . So they were like looking ahead , postdoc e: And phd a: huh ? postdoc e: Well , they differed .  , I 've I am sort of interested in in And sometimes , you know , I s And I I never know . phd a: Well , I was thinking that it must get kind of boring for the people who are gonna have to transcribe this postdoc e: and I phd a: They may as well throw in some interesting intonations "

        "Query": "Summarize the main points discussed in Marketing's presentation during the last meeting and the group's feedback on it.",
        "Summary": "The remote control should not only be small, easy to use, and eye-catching, but also have buttons with a soft feel and a trendy design, possibly incorporating fruit and vegetable elements. Marketing suggested incorporating one or two star features, such as speech recognition, to build the campaign around. The energy source for the remote should be a battery, and it was emphasized that the remote should be brought to the market before the competition. Marketing emphasized the importance of adopting the latest trends and fashion updates for the remote control, particularly for the targeted young users. This includes features like an LCD screen, vivid colors, and a cool shape. However, it was noted that the decisions made regarding the interface did not align with the desired look and feel. The team discussed the possibility of incorporating Bluetooth functionality, but ultimately decided against it. They also explored the idea of using squeezable rubber as an energy generator. Easy usability was another key point raised by Marketing, who suggested incorporating fruit-shaped buttons to align with the upcoming fashion trend. The Project Manager proposed marketing the control in different colors for different groups of people, similar to the iPod. During the evaluation process, Marketing expressed dissent regarding the financial aspects of the design, highlighting the need for further adjustments during budget control. The lack of information about prices led to unrealistic discussions about costly functions like recognition. Marketing believed that users would be interested in a speech recognizer to simplify program selection and reduce the number of buttons. The remote control should also be small and affordable. The team briefly considered lighting adapting options but ultimately left the decision to the Industrial Designer and User Interface designer. The team also discussed potential user-friendly features, including tracking devices to recognize personal preferences and a voice activator to help locate the remote. However, due to budget constraints, these ideas were set aside. The Industrial Designer mentioned the importance of considering repetitive strain injury (RSI) in the ergonomic design process and suggested using touch buttons instead of press buttons to mitigate this issue.",
        "Article": "Then  I've I will also take notes during this meeting and I will send you  a summary then as usual . We will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by  our two colleagues that make good work . industrial designer: marketing: project manager: And  then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product . And  end with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits with it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not . project manager: d let's start with the cost aspect so so I look at the aspect discussed last time , that is to say  to have a standard battery , to have a yellow banana shaped  case with  a rubber material around it industrial designer: project manager: to be  to feel spongy , user interface: Like a banana . project manager: So for the financial aspect it's okay , we can  we can continue with this product  as if , marketing: project manager: and we are now going to see the project evaluation with  our marketing expert . marketing: So I made an evaluation and the the evaluation criteria is made according to the users' requirements and the market trends we talked about  during the previous  meetings . marketing: So we we want to have a product fancy look and feel , technologically innovative , easy to use , fashion , easy to find in a room , and robust , project manager: Yeah . marketing: and  according to what you think about the this project you can   make a one point , two point or seven point . marketing: The okay ?  so  fancy look and feel , what do you think ? project manager: Okay . user interface: Do you vote  Christine ? marketing: eh ? user interface: Do you also vote ? marketing: No , I just want to see something project manager: Maybe we all have to agree on a common user interface: Well , we can very easily . So user interface: marketing: Need to project manager: this is your marketing:  I don't know if you we ha we have to put  one  f If it's better or project manager: One is most . project manager: How much would you give on the fancy aspect , on the fashionable aspect ? marketing: Six  s you can how much what ? project manager: How much would you you don't answer to this  questionnaire ? marketing: Oh yes I  I dunno  , I think six , it's a good  user interface: So it will have five point five average . project manager: Four ? industrial designer: A four also , because , except for the wheel , we don't have so much innovation . I I user interface: D are we including the voice are you glu are we including the voice in the end or not ? Huh ? project manager: No . project manager: Four ? So we have four , four f and five ? marketing: We can put four ? user interface: Yeah . Is it fashion ? project manager: Oh yeah , user interface: project manager: its its f its fruit fruit shape . marketing: Yeah it's fashion , because it's a fruit , user interface: Yeah , we can we can put a seven here . marketing: We have the lightning , or project manager: Yeah , we have the marketing: The lighting . project manager: we don't sesh especially have the lightning user interface: So you'll make the material transparent project manager: but marketing: user interface: so that it  lights up completely , or project manager: So it's yellow . project manager: I think it's very easy to marketing: Seven ? project manager: I would say seven . marketing: Is it is it robust ? project manager: Yeah , it's rubber , made of rubber , industrial designer:  f yeah , it's ru it's rubber . user interface: Yeah the only problem there might be which know , i if it's very sensitive , project manager: Yeah . user interface: I don't know project manager: But it is  it is surrounded by rubber material .  if we say that seven it's  it's the better , project manager: Yeah , the be . industrial designer: user interface: Yeah , the top marketing: and when  s six sit six are good it's a good  p product , I think . user interface: Because I saw  some phones that were banana shaped ,  wireless phones not mobile ones , wireless for the house , marketing: project manager: Yeah . user interface:  quite big also , marketing: user interface: and they were selling something like a hundred Euros , two hundred Euros . project manager: I think the industrial designer: But almo also the complexity between a phone and a remote control is not cannot compare . user interface: it's much more complex , but project manager: So , I think , we can summarise . We we have the cost below  our threshold and so we could sell at twenty five Euros and make i make profit . marketing: project manager: So the cost is in the budget , the evaluation is okay , so I th I think we can now  open champagne and make a huge party . user interface: project manager: I don't know if it's provided by  by the meeting staff . user interface: So what does the management say ? project manager: Sorry ? user interface: What does the management say ? project manager: I think we will have  much bigger project next time and a much bigger salary as well <doc-sep>marketing: What's the agenda for this meeting ? project manager: The I will  present here agenda with with with with slides to you . I've also made notes of the previous meeting and  I was about to send them you but then  I had to go to this  meeting so you will get them too  marketing: project manager: Then I hope you all have  worked out some some  some some presentations about  about well you the the task given to you in the previous meeting .  then I will  bring in some some some new requirements I I got  from the  account manager , I try to work them out , they were quite abstract , and we can have maybe have com some discussion about it . project manager: and Well in this meeting we should really try to reach a decision about the target group and the functionality of the marketing:  . industrial designer: You mean the social target group who we wants to target ? project manager: Yes  well yes w who are we going to  to well to sell this , marketing:  . So And then  we will close this meeting  user interface: project manager: and after this meeting we'll  we'll have a lunch . Maybe  why  Anna can you c do you have a presentations ? marketing: No , I don't . project manager:  you want a table to to  marketing: I c I can talk about it but I have no slides or anything . project manager: Yes yes maybe maybe you can  can just talk about it or maybe you can use the whiteboard if necessary  . Well I've just been  presented with some research we've done in a small focus group so , a hundred people , just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in a remote control . It's probably can't email this to you , I've just got a web page with some data on it .  seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot , so they use their remote control quite frequently while they're watching television . Fifty percent of users say that they only use ten percent of the buttons , so they've got a remote control with a lot of functionality but really most of the time they only use a small part of that . project manager: Do you Do you have this  information on the web page you said ? marketing: I have an a web page yes . So basically  there's a breakdown of how much they use the different functions on a rem remote control .  , channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times  and then there's things like channel settings , audio settings , which are only used very infrequently . Teletext is used  fourteen times in the hour , so it is used but not nearly as much as the channel selection is used . marketing: An interesting thing that this report has brought up is that  fifty fifty percent of users report that the remote control gets lost a lot of the time in the room , so some way of some way of locating the remote control would be very useful to a lot of users . industrial designer: marketing: Thirty four percent said it takes too long to learn to use a remote control , they want something that's easier to use straight away , more intuitive perhaps . industrial designer: It's it's easy to learn or how do you say it's marketing: Thirty four percent said it took too much time to learn to use a new one . industrial designer: Not enough marketing: I don't know how we'd go about combating that . What do you mean there ? marketing: For R_S_I_ ? Respet Repetitive strain injury . project manager: But it's it's the opinion of the  of the users huh ? marketing: Yeah . marketing:  and then it's got a demographic breakdown on industrial designer: Maybe y y you cannot put this webpage online on the marketing:  I should be able to actually , if I email it to you now . user interface: You can disconnect it there project manager: You can maybe just just user interface: no ? marketing: Oh no , yeah . industrial designer: Ah it's it okay it's a webpage on the C_ it's a file marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: So these are important numbers that Matthew and I need to take into account for our functional  user interface: Oh yeah . It's probably easier if you put it on yours and then I'll just email it to you . industrial designer: Yeah these numbers have have to be have to be taken into account for the  both yeah user interface and functional design . marketing: One thing it goes on to talk about , which is interesting , is the hang on a minute . industrial designer: Because if there are many numbers and we need to select to to constraint  our design based on what is more important . industrial designer: Speech recognition in marketing: And who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful . industrial designer: So that we don't Do we not need any button on the remote control marketing: Well potentially yeah ,  project manager: user interface: industrial designer: it would be all based on speech . project manager: Well it would it would be a solution for  when your remote control is lost , marketing: project manager:  when it has speech recognition then  i then it doesn't matter where it is , my well it's we should be in range , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: I'm not sure whether we will we can make this for for twelve Euro fi and fifty cents . industrial designer: And we don't know where the state of the art of speech recognition is , maybe you know ? user interface: Oh . Well , it depends you know like there is  it's a very small vocabulary that you want to do the operations like you want to say on , off , one , two , twenty three , project manager:  . project manager: Yes , user interface: It's it's going to be li project manager: that that that that's  . user interface: it's not going to be s so easy but u usually it's going to be more of an isolated case project manager: Do you have some more important facts user interface: but it's but I don't know with twenty fi marketing:  project manager: or can we go to the next presentation ? industrial designer: Okay . So marketing: Well industrial designer: you had to to to summarise maybe the marketing: This is now talking about  who would pay for speech recognition in a remote control , who would pay more for it ,  . Ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more , it goes down from there , seventy six percent for twenty five to thirty five , thirty five percent for thirty five to forty five ,  twenty two percent for forty five to fifty five and then eight percent for fifty five to sixty five . marketing: Yeah , it really depends where we're gonna be targeting this product , user interface: project manager:  . industrial designer: I thi You us marketing: It'll be in a different window , yep . marketing: Another thing it's talking about there is the L_C_D_ screen but there's no figures apparently on that .  I okay project manager: Oh , industrial designer: I stay project manager: this is user interface: Now you can move I think yeah . user interface: It's a channel selection , a module , this and this function , marketing: Sorry ? Oh .  I'd like first to give a quick a very simple introduction , how does it work , so that everybody knows even if you don't have a very  technical background  what is it because I think in the product it is important . industrial designer: So basically  the basic function of a remote control is to send  messages to another system that is fixed . industrial designer: And so an energy source feeds an integrated circuit , the chip , that can compose messages , usually  through a  infrared bit marketing: So my method for  designing the yeah the work design  yeah first the the main point is that I would wish to to make a really functional product . I would prefer to have very functional  capabilities rather than fancy stuff that in fact is not used and doesn't work . industrial designer: So for that yeah as it's important to take into account the user requirements from the Marketing  Expert  Anna marketing: industrial designer: and  w to to we should agree on what are the technical functions  for this remote control and I show you the the working design .  we want an on off button , it can be  it's simple but it's it's important , and also  the to both channels as well as other buttons that come after , marketing:  . So the components I quickly draw here , is that in this part you have the remote control the the sender and on the other part the receiver so that's my method is  will be to well my aim would be to  design the and choose the chips and the infrared  components to build the remote control marketing: This is very quick  design ,  you stop me or interrupt me if  you don't agree on it on that . industrial designer: And  so what I have found and after a lot of work actually I I draw this I draw for you this  schema marketing: Well . industrial designer: that can be maybe too technical for you but is very important for me marketing: You drew it a long time ago ? industrial designer: you know . industrial designer: And  that's it so I won't go into details about that project manager: overwhelming . So project manager: are they cheap , or are they  reliable ? What were your industrial designer: found and yeah th you have always a compromise with  reliability and  i if it's expensive , project manager:  . industrial designer: but  this one was not this one also really  reliable  so yeah that's it for the working design ,  I hope you get clearer view on  what what a remote control is  in terms of  technical components project manager: Yes . industrial designer: but maybe yeah project manager: So user interface: But is it  can you just buy it on the market and f plug it in or you want to ma industrial designer: No no no no we we will  This is a preference but we can always change  project manager: What I w what I was thinking about  the the the schema  about  the sender and the receiver ,  can you can you get back to it ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yeah  , the receiver is of course already in the television and we are not  able to change it . We will use  infrared protocol  using yeah infrared and  and of course we need to adapt to that protocol that already exists project manager: industrial designer: and but we what we can do is   adapting the the chips inside  to the best  chips and  infrared bubbles . Of course yeah user interface: But you should be careful , industrial designer: in the chip you have it yeah . user interface: people are sometime becoming problem , like a guy has recently designed a remote    which could switch off any other T_V_s , so basically through all the things . user interface: So maybe we should think of marketing: industrial designer: Of course yeah we should take that into account marketing: That's handy . project manager: Yeah yes marketing: So if the b T_V_ in the next apartment's really loud , you can just turn it off . industrial designer: in the  user interface: Yeah so you can just go on the street and then switch off everyone's T_V_ and you can just walk away industrial designer: user interface: You don't have to be near the T_V_ at all . project manager: I I feel I I I think M Mael will will consider this  th these things . So  I'm going to talk a little bit about the technical function so wha what actually it's about what is the user going to do , I think my last presented what is going inside , marketing: user interface: so what's the user is going to see from the outside and how he is going to use it . So well the approach is that  basically the idea is to send a message to the T_V_ set , as Mael has pointed , and it will be decoded by the T_V_ and usually we it is easier to have  keys or buttons with which people can  press and then  changing a button will basically  change the message which is being sent to the T_V_ and   industrial designer: So p as  Anna has said that this ki people are interested in things which are you don't need to k press the keys , people are can have a speech recognition but this is  s a question which will we have to see later . user interface: But in the present scenario is that you have certain keys and you press it like your mobile phone , and it sends a message to the T_V_ . user interface: And  so generally  I don't have some figures sorry but  so there are two kinds of  remote if you popularly in the household , actually so you have a standard T_V_ remote where you have just a on , off button and play ,  volume change and  keys for the number and more than one digit option . And if you see for example righ right now   even the one  on more than one digit option is for two digit channel which is like ninety nine , but tomorrow you might have one fifty channels you know to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows , but   . Then there is  this is the standard one with without any fancy thing you know like i it doesn't have teletext option , it can without any , it's a very simple thing ,  which which you can vouch . And then you have  what's the v video remote file which is like usually it has almost all the keys over there and , but it then it has other options like stop  and then you play the movie or  or fo fast forward the movie or something like that so i it has those marketing: And then well personal preferences I would  basically think of having a kind of aim for the next generation thing where the we could have both the  the f a T_V_ and the remote video remote control because  some of the keys in the video's remote control and the T_V_ they could be integrated together so that  we could  aim for the like in the f coming future  that type of  applications with marketing: Okay . How would that work ? So you've got say maybe a V_C_R_ and a T_V_ which are separate , user interface: marketing: so you on my one at home I've got a V_C_R_ remote which then changes the channel on the V_C_R_ and doesn't do anything on the T_V_ , user interface: Yeah . marketing: so is it gonna be like a switch on the remote that says t use the T_V_ or use the V_C_R_ ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: or does it know which one you want to use ? user interface:  actually  you could you could think of  having s a y you can have a key which could tell y it could go to the video thing marketing: user interface: but   yo you you you still can't  in that case when it you use that the function should be able to take up the V_C_R_ option marketing: user interface: and you could play it or You can also think about having like  I in a few days you will be ha in in few ye coming years you might even have a system where you have a separate  sitting setup box marketing: user interface: and  you have   something like   you do you do you suppose you are not able to watch some programme and actually it downloading all the time for you marketing: user interface: and  you can just you know  when you come back you could just switch on that thing and  watch a program . user interface: In that case you want to browse faster , browse slow , you want to have those kind of functionalities . user interface: It's the next generation thing , project manager:  yes , user interface: but it is going to come in couple of years . project manager: but I think it's i i it's already there , user interface: It's goi project manager:  the hard disk  recorders  I I've seen them in the shop . user interface: it's going to record your things and you and you you need basically the functionalities what you need in both   video as well as in the standard T_V_ thing . That's , user interface: No no we are not making a universal remote , marketing: yeah . user interface: we are just looking at  giving a scenario , I have a T_V_ and tomorrow I am going to have set up box marketing:  . user interface: which is going to sit there and  it's going to do that job for me . Because y project manager: W w w w we need to decide on on on on in how far we go to in this . project manager: Mean , you can go pretty far I f I think with with with functions and possible  future p  prospects marketing:  . So we can always discuss about it for example  the presently the video market actually  this demand , video over-demand or what we call it as , it's presently booming up actually industrial designer: user interface: so it i like people are providing like  things like   movies , you can select actually so you want to watch a movie and  your p your provider gives a list of movies , and then you select those list . user interface: and then when you come you want to loo watch it on your T_V_ . industrial designer: Or even you don't need to download it , it's streamed  online  yeah . user interface: Yeah it can be streamed online for you and you can say what time I want to watch the movie marketing:  . project manager: I have  received some some some some well points of of thinking over of my account manager and  I would like to share them with you . project manager: first thing is  teletext is a well known feature of televisions marketing: Do we include it , and do we give it a prominent  prominent  place on on on the on well huh on the remote mot control itself . project manager:  as  a in any case it's it's not used , well very much , but it's it is still used . project manager: further yes we must think ,  do we stay  to to television only , the television as we as we all know it with with broadcasting signals and you can't go back  huh , or do we   go further as Matthew indicated by supporting   recording  devices ? user interface: marketing: So D_V_D_s and V_C_R_s ? project manager:  indeed indeed .  , furthermore , w we need really need to interest  y younger customers and then with younger customers  people  below the age of forty , marketing: project manager: So industrial designer: So project manager: that's to that's  there's a market but  they will grow older older marketing: project manager: and you'll al always need to have the the future with younger people . project manager:  therefore , younger people like trendy trendy designs , so that's w we should make our our our R_C_ as trendy as possible but it should also be  have a reliable image , so when it looks too too spacey or too fancy people will think well does it work at all . user interface: Yeah it's  well you you can follow the ideas how you want to keep the keys , you know right now if you take it you have like zero , one , two , three like a keys separately , marketing: user interface: but suppose if you take the the present trend of mobile phones there are like big thick keys marketing:  . user interface: you press on the top , it takes one number , you press on the bottom it takes another number , and  basically   so the space covered so that you don't see two separate keys there actually industrial designer: But I think taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting , especially if we're going after a younger market , user interface: Yeah so . Yes yes marketing: that's the the the  the new and the funky things , project manager: mo industrial designer: Because they are already used to that , you know , product . marketing: that's , project manager: Yes it's recognisable industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: yeah , there's lot there's lots of pretty mobile phones , not too many pretty remote controls . So , for example you have  presently  keys like one , two , three like this , actually , and   four five six like that and  you can have keys like this in form like  keys like that project manager: Mael can you hand me over this  ? industrial designer: Yes . How much longer have we got for the meeting by the way ? project manager:  well marketing: 'Cause we haven't talked about demographic at all project manager: I think fi five min user interface: Forty minutes ? marketing: and it's a very important issue . too sorry , so we basically don't change the  original order of them industrial designer: user interface: but then the keys are more spacious , marketing: user interface: they don't look  so there there is a very sligh thing , so if you press on the top it takes the one , it takes the three ,  four , sorry four here  five and six , marketing:  . user interface: so the keys can be it looks you know not very much cluttered but it looks nice industrial designer: user interface: but you can have a lot of options t if you press on the to project manager: Okay . industrial designer: marketing: basically we're trying to get people to buy a remote control user interface: Yeah . marketing: wouldn't they already have a remote control with their television when they buy one ? user interface: project manager: Of course they have already one . marketing: 'cause it's only a low market , it's a cheap-end remote control , we can't beat modern functionality , we might we'll be able to beat them on th the look of it , th the design of it but that's not a big seller , if they're not just going to buy a new remote control just 'cause it looks pretty , they have to actually need it as well . I well I think many people said  in your in in your research    the appearance of the  R_C_ is is important when they are buying one marketing:  . I've got friends who've got so many things they need a universal remote , otherwise they're using five different remotes for their all their things . marketing: In that case they wouldn't buy our product , because it doesn't give them what they need in terms of functionality . project manager: So your you think we should go for a more u universal high-performance marketing: Well , we can't , with the price range . project manager: What do What do you think about What componen industrial designer: Yeah we have yeah twelve point five Euros  per  per R_ s R_C_ marketing:  . industrial designer: and I think  with this now you know that chips are very  cheaps marketing: If we're getting into universal remote territory , we're getting to L_C_D_ screens and things like that industrial designer: that's marketing: which would drive the cost up a lot . industrial designer: Ye project manager: Is the L_C_D_ screen marketing: For universal remotes industrial designer: I don't think L_C_D_ is not necessary well , th for long term . project manager: I think thi this could be this could be a market because  universal remote controls  tend to be  quite expensive . marketing: And quite complicated to use , project manager: S so we can try to go in between , marketing: yes . project manager: but but still but still people have the idea this is more functional than a normal   R_C_ industrial designer: Universal . project manager: marketing: But if we're going for the say fifteen to twenty five age group then not many of them would actually own T_V_s to use a remote control on . project manager:  yes but w we're targeting I think on more on the on the twenty to forty group . Who just have or already have a job and have the money but may not want to spend that much money on a on a universal universal control . Are we gonna be at the very bottom of the price range , or are we kind of middle to bottom ? I don't know . project manager: I think  when we think it over I thi I think we are trying to offer the a kind of universal control for for less money . project manager: So d Do you agree ? user interface: Well Well I it's fine with me like the price as long as it is  not too expensive . industrial designer: Yeah user interface:  and it d  Our provin industrial designer: because we have to take into account that we are gonna b we are gonna sell  four aro around four million so when we speak about these numbers  the price of a chip is  price of a chip is very cheap . industrial designer: So I'm okay for designing  a ne  less yeah a a kind of universal  R_C_ yeah . And  basically you can look to the standards of other industrial designer: Yeah that's needed , yeah . So I guess what I'd like from a universal remote is maybe choosing between three devices , being able to switch between them , there may be stereo , V_C_R_ and T_V_ . marketing: And just be able to s use them all from the same remote , but not at the same time . user interface: Yeah you can also browse through all the standards you know , where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them . project manager: So given we are going for this   universal type  m maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need and y you will try to get more specific  user interface content industrial designer: Yes . project manager: and  maybe you can look on on what trends are in this  in this type of market . user interface: and we'll I'm sure we'll up something good marketing: project manager: W yes , user interface: for the project manager: we  we can have lunch now . project manager: So  Then th th the next meeting will  user interface: Yeah so we meet in well what are our project manager: after lunch you have  we have  thirty minutes of work and then we have the next meeting <doc-sep>And  I want to introduce myself ,  my name is  Shrida Daseri and  I'm a project manager for this new project which we are going to discuss now . And what you're  drawing ? user interface:  sure my name is Agnes and I'm an user usability user interface designer . So thanks for coming for the meeting first of all , and  we have a long time , just twenty-five minutes to discuss about  this project and the the project initiation . First of all I want to ask  Mister Ed about your  marketing plan and your product plan and  marketing: Well I think that we'll see that throughout the day in how we're going to put this together as a marketing to to market the product . We'll have to see on a through discussion on where we're gonna go from here and from with this . project manager: - but  do you already have like a functional design or a technical design or marketing:  for the moment not yet . project manager: Oh for the moment not yet , okay , but  what's what's your  do you have some project plan , something with you or marketing: Good question . No , this is like I said that we have to be discussed between all of us and we'll go from there . Okay , so  by when you think you can  give me some kind of  project plan , okay , a discussion with  marketing: Certainly by the next meeting .  Okay , so there's any questions or  first of all about  this project ? industrial designer: What is the goal of the project ? project manager:  the goal of the project I think maybe I'll  hand out to the Ed , okay , so to explain  what is the project because he's in the sales and the accounting . marketing: industrial designer: marketing: I'm in the sales I'm supposed to explain them what to do . We have to define exactly what our product is , from  project manager: Yes , so can you explain  what exactly the product is ? marketing: From what I had in mind we're supposed to be marketing coffee , is that right ? project manager: Oh I think  , if I'm not wrong , we're making the remote control . I had a first part of mine was to make a remote control for a new f remote control for television , and afterward I had a discussion about coffee so project manager: Yes . marketing: Something  visual that has something that will will draw people to buy the product , project manager: marketing: because I think everybody's experienced with  remote controls , and some remote controls are are worth  throwing out the window .  th most of them ar I don't know we're have to come up with a new idea on how to make it a lot easier to use , project manager: marketing: 'cause a lot of times  spend  half a day through the instruction book trying to figure out how to use it . project manager: And  what abo  Christine , what about your  the industrial design plan ? Are you have a design already on this product or  you're still working on the design ? industrial designer:  no , I I have not begun working on the design , project manager: industrial designer: and  I  I actually didn't know we were designing a remote control , I thought we were designing a new monitor .  the website I went to look at had some announcements about an introduction of a   some sort of a seven inch  monitor , and  I understood that that was the project goal . So  I'm glad I didn't d do any work  ahead of time because  I clearly didn't understand the project goal . industrial designer:  I just did s see that we were starting a new project together and there was going to be a four member team composed of these people , and  that's about  that's project manager: industrial designer: and I I read through the different steps , and what my responsibilities were relative to the steps . project manager: So  you'll be leading the team for your design team or how many members is working in the team , for the design ? industrial designer:  for the industrial design ? project manager: Yes . marketing: project manager: That's industrial designer:  because  , you know , you can  you can make it  you have different choices with different financial models . project manager: Yeah , but  before we talk about  the finance , okay ,  do you have some idea how we can  sell this product or project in the market and how much is going to benefit to the company and  of course it's to the individual also . industrial designer: Well , you know  , I kind of think that in general you have to do   y you have to have something that's very fashionable , that's  very attractive that  people see and recognize  its goal , and  they immediately wanna have it  have one of their own . So it would really would need to  something like the iPod would be good , seems to have caught on fairly well , project manager: industrial designer: so  d  you know , I don't care what it does , just so it looks cool . project manager: Okay , but   when you think you can give me like a kind of design on the functional design or the technical design ? industrial designer: Well ,  I've got a lot of other projects I'm doing right now  and so I'll have to wait and see how those  how those go . project manager: Yeah , but  I need something in the writing , so like  what's your functional design , what's your technical design , and  how many people you need for this project , and what's the time frame you're looking , okay , and what is the budget , maybe  initial budget you're looking , okay , and  how is going to the market , okay , industrial designer: project manager: so you've you've had to meet with the marketing team and how they're going to market and what are the marketing strategic plan , okay , when are you going to introduce , okay , and by the time you introduce the product and  you know there there would be a competition , okay , so I need some kind of   the plan in the writing from you . Okay , and it's po industrial designer: And when would you like that ? project manager: B as soon as possible . industrial designer:  well if  if we have enough time  then d do you think  two weeks is a is close enough ? project manager: Yes I think  that would be good , because I need to go to the management and  tell them what we are going to do , and  what cost is , okay , and what's the time frame and what's the project plan , because  without any  documentations , I cannot go to the management and say , so we are going to do this and we need this much money , okay , so then it's it's difficult for me to say , okay , that's the reason I need  some kind of plan from you , initially , okay , then we can have the further discussion again . industrial designer:  are there other people who will be contributing to the plan ? project manager: Yes , of course , if you need some help ,  so let me know . So , who are the people you need  from the marketing or  the technical side or  the administration point of view , okay , to add in any documentation , or some technical point of view , industrial designer: project manager: so just let me know so I can  coordinate all the teams . And  Ed  so what's what do you think about  this  project for the remote control and d do you have some already planned something for your marketing strategy or  the sales strategy ? marketing: Well not yet other than  doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do  , what they're building , their designs , their ideas , project manager:  . marketing: It should be a fairly large market because  the number of people that  the competition , project manager: marketing:  th I agree it has to be something it has to be something new , it has to be something that that draws people saying eh , I like this . Whether it works or not , they have to first say I like this , I like the design , and then it's gotta be simple to use . project manager: Yes , so what I  prefer maybe  you need to interact  more with the Christine , okay , because you know what she is going to do it , okay , and you know how to sell it . Okay , because  she is doing the design , but you are the core because you are in the marketing , okay , marketing: Yeah . project manager: so because you need to sell and you're the responsible for the all the money , the finance , okay , tomorrow . project manager: So , what I prefer , okay , so you need to interact with the Christine more and  within her team , okay , who is using the functional design or technical design , okay , marketing: project manager: and  you need to come up with some kind of plan , okay , how we are going to do the your sales plan , okay , th marketing: Do we already have a cost limit on this , th an idea of how much  we want to market this for , how much it's gonna sell for , project manager: Th That that's marketing: that's up that's up to us to decide , eh ? project manager: Yes , that's you have to decide , okay , so the best thing is you  both of  the Christine and you discuss with yourself , okay , and come up with the cost , and how we are going to compete in the market , okay , in the the technically , or in the sales wise , okay , the commercial wise , okay . Then  we have to design , okay , how long it will take the whole project , okay , how much is going to cost us , and how much we are going to benefit for the company . Okay , so I think it's  maybe if we can  give me some kind of your  the sales plan , okay , including the technical what  she's going to talk to you within the team , okay , then it will help me to discuss with the management for further , okay , and put it in the the proper project plan . Okay , and if you need  any coordination in between  compared to the maybe the some technical vendors or commercial vendors , okay , depends if you want to have some   marketing plan or technical plan , okay , so you let me know .  my job from what I understood was to look at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable , it's acceptable to the people who are gonna use it and look at the best ways to do that . user interface: So I think I'll have to interact with Christine and discuss with her , so that she's not designing something that my studies will show right off the bat that it's not going to work , project manager: Th Christine , yeah . Which is user interface: and so it's sort of it's a loop that feeds in , but I don't think necessarily that I'm in a coordinating position for it . Yeah , so basically you need to interact with Christine more , okay , for the user acceptability , okay , and the testing , okay , user interface: Yeah . project manager: then you will user interface: Which will also feed into the marketing , project manager: Yes . user interface: because depending on what users want , depends on how you sell it , what tag lines you attach to it , how you try to make it more attractive to users .  , and then I guess build the plan based on all of that , because I think you need to take all the factors into account .

        "Query": "What were Barry Hughes' thoughts on the legal framework, infrastructure of out-of-court disposals, targets for performance measures, and the registration of grandparents in relation to the childcare offer?",
        "Summary": "Barry Hughes believed that implementing a clear legal framework would provide clarity for parents and professionals, but there was confusion and ambiguity when it came to prosecution, leading to some cases falling into grey areas. He also suggested that the infrastructure for out-of-court disposals could be developed by the Welsh Government, the police, and crime commissioners. Barry clarified that they did not have specific targets for prosecution, but only pursued cases with reasonable prospects. Similarly, the police no longer had targets, except for certain individuals. Huw Irranca-Davies emphasized the focus on registered licensed providers for the childcare offer, aiming for higher quality and a broader range of services compared to individual childcare. However, it was noted that some grandparents who were registered, licensed, and inspected also cared for their grandchildren and other children in small groups.",
        "Article": "Item 2 this afternoon is our eleventh evidence session on the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. I'm very pleased to welcome Barry Hughes, who is Chief Crown Prosecutor for Wales; Kwame Biney, who is senior policy advisor, CPS; and Iwan Jenkins, who is head of the complex casework unit, Crown Prosecution Service Cymru Wales. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions from Members, and the first ones are from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian. I would like to start just by looking in general at how the law currently stands, and how do you think the law as it currently stands today, and specifically in terms of reasonable punishment\u2014how does that protect children. barry hughes: Sorry, can I just be clear? How does the law as it presently stands protect children? sian gwenllian am: Yes. barry hughes: We have a range of offences created by the criminal law, going back to the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 in the middle of the century before last, which provide for offences of assault against a variety of people, including, in particular, Acts such as the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, which provides for offences that are specific to children. But the more general criminal legislation, such as the Offences Against the Person Act, does provide specifically for adults and children alike not to be subject to physical assault. In respect of children in particular, you'll be aware that we have section 58 of the Children Act 2004, which does make it a defence for a person accused of assaulting a child to argue that it was a case where they were acting only so as to impose reasonable punishment upon the child. sian gwenllian am: Well, a review was undertaken by the Government back in 2007 that stated that retaining the law in its current form\u2014that that would be the best thing to do because there's no evidence that it's not working satisfactorily. You are suggesting perhaps towards the end of your answer that there could be some change that's happened since 2007. barry hughes: I think the law should reflect contemporary society and the law is evolutionary in nature, and should be evolutionary in nature. And just as if we go back 50 years there are types of behaviour that we might all have contemplated back then as being socially acceptable, many of those types of behaviour are not now, and the law has changed to reflect that. We don't need to go back a very long way to find, for example, that there was no such offence as raping one's married wife, and the law has changed to reflect the fact that that is simply not acceptable. And from what I've seen of the research, and I think back to the 2007 review, to which you've just referred, there is evidence within that review already that opinions are changing. And I've seen research more current than that that suggests that young people find it less acceptable to use reasonable punishment in chastising a child than do people of an older generation. Of course, as we move forward in time, the people who are young now are going to be the older adults of the future. We have heard evidence as a committee that this proposed law would provide a much clearer legal framework\u2014that is, to take out this reasonable punishment defence, that then would make things much clearer for parents and professionals. Does the CPS have a view on that? barry hughes: I think it will make things clearer. I'm not sure it will make them much clearer, because if we get into some of the\u2014. And when it comes to prosecuting, it's often the case that things aren't just black and white; there are multiple shades of grey in between. We know that the Children Act did introduce a degree of clarity, in that it removed the defence of reasonable chastisement for offences of causing actual bodily harm, causing grievous bodily harm, causing grievous bodily harm with intent, and various incidents of child cruelty under the Children and Young Persons Act. There were a series of Court of Appeal cases that sought to clarify the law, but that was at a time, at the end of the 1990s, the start of the 2000s, when we had the European convention on human rights and we had a quickly developing body of case law. A decision was clearly made back then in the early 2000s not to include common assault in the same category as actual bodily harm, grievous bodily harm et cetera. As we wind forward some 15 years, I have seen the research that suggests that some people see that the present legislation, and the way in which section 58 applies to reasonable chastisement for common assault of children\u2014some people have interpreted that as saying that smacking is acceptable. I don't think that it is what it says, but there is a degree of confusion around that. And the reason why I say it's not as simple as that is, going back to my words a couple of minutes ago, it's rarely a case of being black and white; there are these degrees of grey. sian gwenllian am: What are the areas of grey that you refer to? Can you give a few examples? barry hughes: If you take an example\u2014so, one of the examples that I've heard discussed has been a child\u2014a young child; let's say a five-year-old child by the side of a road\u2014who darts to go out in the path of moving traffic. Now, technically, taking hold of the child at that point is an assault, because it's an unwanted imposition of physical force. But no-one's going to say that's anything like an assault that should come to the criminal courts. At that point, the parent then seeks to admonish the child, tells them off and smacks the child on the legs. But so much depends upon the circumstances, whether this is something that happens frequently with the child, the size of the child, the parent, the force of the slap, the way in which it's imposed. As we move towards the other end of the spectrum, we might have repeated smacking, shouting, maybe hitting the child over the head as well. There'll be a point at which it crosses the threshold from something that needs to be reported to the police, and the police would take some form of action, and then, as we move through the tiers, it'll reach a stage where the police think this is a case that should be prosecuted and they would bring it to the Crown Prosecution Service for a charging decision. And the absolute other end of the spectrum here is one where we decide it's an offence that we think is so serious that it should be charged and brought before a criminal court. That would be very much towards the serious end of the spectrum of the type of behaviour that I've just described to you. Does that help to illustrate that, at one end, it's relatively white and the other end it's relatively black, but in the middle we have the shades of grey? sian gwenllian am: But that would mean that there could be more prosecutions at the softer end. So, you are probably aware, but forgive me if I just explain quickly anyway, when we approach a file of material evidence submitted by the police we apply the code for Crown prosecutors, which has a two-stage test. The first stage is whether there's sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction, and the second stage is\u2014. If there isn't enough evidence, we don't go on to consider whether it's in the public interest, because we wouldn't put an offence before the courts if we didn't think there was a realistic prospect of conviction. So, to return to the point, if we have an offence where, let's say, there is a light smack at the time, the police apply the same code before they bring a case to us. We don't always agree with the police; generally we do, but we don't always agree. So, if a police officer takes witness statements in relation to that case\u2014the light smacking on the leg\u2014at present it's unlikely that would come to the CPS, because they would look at it and say, 'Reasonable chastisement provides for a defence.' If that defence is removed, then obviously there is a greater possibility that it would be referred to the CPS. I would like to think\u2014and I think this is what will probably happen in practice\u2014that the police would take a view that the evidential test may have been satisfied because the defence had been removed, but it wouldn't be in the public interest to prosecute. It may be that the police decide that it is\u2014it may have been two smacks, three smacks, so it moves towards the end of the spectrum that would suggest that matters are becoming rather more serious. We would then apply independently the same test, and we would probably conclude that the evidential stage was met in that instance because the defence no longer exists, which takes us on to considering the public interest. In the circumstances that I've described, every case is going to be unique on its own facts, but in the circumstances that I've described, if it is just a light smack and it's a one-off and there's no history of this, it would probably be the sort of offence we'd decide it wouldn't be in the public interest to prosecute. sian gwenllian am: But isn't it creating a new grey area in terms of the police now having to decide whether repeated smacking is in the public interest to at least refer it to you to decide about that? Do you know what I'm saying? barry hughes: If this Bill goes through, then it will remove a defence, which will make it likely that the police will give this more consideration for referral to the CPS than beforehand, but it doesn't necessarily mean they will refer it, because it will depend on the facts of each individual case. lynne neagle am: We've got some questions now on the divergence between the law in England and Wales from Dawn Bowden. The Assembly doesn't have any legislative competence to impose duties on the CPS, as you know, in the absence of the Secretary of State's consent. What are the implications for implementing the Bill in Wales for that? barry hughes: Can I give you two examples? One of the implications is this\u2014and it's fairly obvious but it's still worth stressing\u2014that the removal of the defence would mean that there would be more cases that would pass the evidential stage in Wales than there would be in England, because the defence would still apply there. That, therefore, raises issues in particular in terms of awareness of criminal offending for people from England who travel to Wales, because it's fairly evident that there would be a defence available in England that is not available in Wales. One of the examples that we talked about was if you consider a family on its way from England into Wales, travelling to Barry Island for a holiday, and troublesome children in the back of the car, harsh words and a small smack on the leg delivered while they're on the M4 going past Bristol would be subject to a defence. By the time we come over to this side of the water, there would be no such defence for the same journey, for the same act. The second example that I'll give you is that we already have within the United Kingdom a certain degree of divergence of laws, and the example I'll give to you is this: drink driving. In England and Wales, the limit for having micrograms of alcohol in your breath is 35 \u00b5g in 100 ml of breath. As you drive into Scotland, you're probably okay to drive if you've got 34 \u00b5g; by the time you get into Scotland, you won't be. And the consequences for you are significant, because of course it's an offence in Scotland, and not an offence in England, but the punishment, namely disqualification, applies everywhere in the United Kingdom. So, we already have a degree of divergence of law, and the CPS recognises this. In our code, we have a specific provision that takes account of the potential divergence of Welsh law. So, would you see the necessity for a memorandum of understanding, for instance, or it being useful in these circumstances, or are you quite satisfied that the current guidance code would cover that? barry hughes: Well, it's yet to move from a Bill into an Act, so we'd need to make sure that happened. We know there would be a period of time, perhaps as much as two years, or maybe a little more, while that takes place. In terms of how we'd approach it within the Crown Prosecution Service in Cymru-Wales, my approach would be along the lines of working with Kwame and his colleagues to make sure that the guidance that we issue nationally suits both England and Wales. And when it comes to the practical application of the legislation in Wales, we would almost certainly work on the basis that the number of offences\u2014and we might want to get into the number of potential offences, but my take on it is the number of offences is likely to be very small and we would probably have two or three specialists trained in this so that any case that comes through goes to people who've got a close network and can talk with each other\u2014 dawn bowden am: And that would be primarily around the public interest issue. So you're obviously a key stakeholder in terms of this legislation and you're clearly very au fait with it and all its implications. What's actually been your involvement with the Government as they've been developing this legislation? barry hughes: My own personal involvement? dawn bowden am: Or the service's. I met with a Minister and a Deputy Minister\u2014I met with Huw Irranca-Davies a little while ago, and I met with Julie Morgan a few months ago\u2014to discuss the overall implications, and then officials on both sides have been engaging with each other. It hasn't been a very close-knit involvement, but we have had enough involvement so that we've felt we've been able to offer views on how we would deal with the legislation. I don't feel that it's been too much, nor do I feel we've been left on the side at all. Now, we've just talked about the divergence of criminal law, and this is probably the first time that there's been an obvious divergence between English and Welsh law, and so we were then talking about the guidance, weren't we, and whether that needs amending to reflect it. But I think you were saying that you felt, within the existing guidance, it could be dealt with, so you don't see a need to update or amend the guidance. barry hughes: I think we would need to update the guidance, and it goes back to the application of the evidential stage, before the public interest stage. On the evidential stage, I doubt that we'll need to do much, other than to make people aware that the defence is not available in Wales in the same way that it is in England, and we might have some light-touch guidance around that. When it comes to the public interest stage, that's a little more specialist and I think we would need to develop more with respect to that. dawn bowden am: And are you satisfied that your staff in Wales\u2014well, and in England, actually, across the border\u2014will be sufficiently aware of the divergence in this area of law? barry hughes: Not as of the present day. [Laughter.] dawn bowden am: But you would expect that to be something you would\u2014 barry hughes: Yes, I have no doubt. To an extent, actually, I think I would say that staff in Wales are aware of this already, because in my role as chief Crown prosecutor, I publish a monthly blog and we talk about the things we're doing, so staff are aware. I've discussed with staff and they've seen my blog and we've put it on our website: there have been engagements with the Welsh Government that this is a piece of work in which we're interested and that is under way. I think most staff would probably be aware that we are involved in this and that it is something that, at present, may well happen. And does that mean that there would also be a similar need for the CPS in England to be aware of the changes? barry hughes: They would need to be aware, but not to the same extent. So, in my office in Cardiff, for example, because we work digitally, I have about 30 to 35 prosecutors who work for the CPS in London, and they work exclusively on London cases. But there are times when some of those prosecutors will prosecute at courts in Wales, and then there may be an interchange; they'll come to work for us on secondment, or they'll come to work for us permanently. We'd need to make sure that those people were brought up to speed on the fact that there are some aspects of Welsh law that diverge from English law. My final question, Chair, is just whether you think there are any other significant cross-border issues that arise from this potential legislation. It boils down to the fact that there's a defence in England for assaults upon children that isn't available in Wales if this Bill goes through, and then it's dealing with the consequences of that. Oh no, that's right\u2014obviously, this Act is on a particular trajectory at the moment, and it's due to be introduced before the end of this Assembly. Do you think it would be better for us as scrutinisers\u00a0of this Act if we could see the draft changes to CPS guidance on the public interest test before we make our final decision? barry hughes: I honestly don't think that would necessarily be helpful. What we would envisage is that we would simply want to take the present public interest factors, which are set out, in my view, very clearly in the code for Crown prosecutors, and we would provide a degree of detail around those that relates more specifically to the issues that we're discussing here. And we'd need to work that up as we go along, and I think you'd run a risk of putting the cart before the horse, if I may put it like that. suzy davies am: It's just that, personally, I think the public interest test is critical in all this, and it would really help us to understand what it could look like before we commit to a particular course of action in supporting or not supporting the Bill, that was all. sian gwenllian am: My point is about the criminal law in Wales and England diverging in this particular instance, and we've been told that this is probably the first time it's happened. Can you think of any other examples where that divergence has happened and does it actually set some kind of precedent in motion? barry hughes: There are other offences in Wales that don't exist in England, but they don't crop up very often. So, to give you examples, there is an offence of putting an electronic collar on your pet\u2014let's not stretch that into children. But putting an electronic collar on your pet that administers a shock is an offence in Wales; it's not an offence in England. There are also offences around the picking of cockles in west Wales, which is not an offence\u2014. So, you can see there are some, but I would argue that the fact that you drive across the border into Scotland and commit an offence that you won't commit in England is possibly more significant for the general public. Of course, the topic we're discussing here is of real relevance for the general public, and you have heard evidence, I know, already, that comes from people who are quite strongly in favour and people quite strongly against it. One of the ways in which I've approached this is looking at it from the perspective of what the law is there for, which is to set out, in essence, what is acceptable, what is not acceptable. It doesn't necessarily mean we need to use the law for that, but it signifies how society views a certain behaviour. I like to look at it from the perspective of the person who is being affected by this, namely the child, and the change in the law here would afford children a degree of protection that they don't presently have, but which they do have when they attain the age of 16.FootnoteLink So, I looked at this\u2014. I've had considerable dealings over the years with offences against residents in care homes, and you'll have seen Winterbourne View, you'll have seen recently up in Durham, where we have adults who need to be looked after because of issues with their mental capacity, and sometimes, the carers become frustrated with them and they admonish them. In much the same way as children are vulnerable and are looked after and can be sometimes quite annoying\u2014but there is a level of protection for an adult striking a child lightly under the present law that is not available to the same adult for striking that child when they turn 16. sian gwenllian am: Do you think that what we're doing in Wales will be emulated in England at some point? barry hughes: Well, it's certainly going through in parallel in Scotland, and there are a great many other countries around the world that already have this, including a large number of European countries. Who knows? Trying to get any legislation through Westminster at the moment\u2014who knows? Not tomorrow, I'd say. Can I just begin by asking you to help the committee out here in understanding how the burden of proof is going to work if this defence is removed? Because the issue of whether something is punishment or not is going to disappear, providing that it's clear that contact with a child has happened. Is that going to work on the presumption that that's an unlawful contact? Is that something the prosecution will still have to prove, or will it be for an accused parent to say, to use your example, 'I was just dragging them out of the traffic or stopping them putting their hands in the fire'? barry hughes: I understand your point. So, if we remove the defence of reasonable chastisement, in a sense that alters some things but it doesn't alter the basic responsibility of the prosecution, which is to establish its case beyond a reasonable doubt. And if the defence raise an argument and say, 'Well, look, that was a lawful act; I was only doing what I thought was reasonable in the circumstances', it's for the Crown to disprove that. barry hughes: And we've got to disprove that to the criminal standard, which is beyond a reasonable doubt. I can see the potential for individuals who feel strongly about this to look to contest the matter, to not admit any wrongdoing at all and to take the matter to trial, and it would be our responsibility to disprove that. Obviously, when we're talking about CPS guidelines and all the rest, we've already come some distance down the process, haven't we? Have you got any views on what might be done to prevent cases even coming as far as arrest? Because one of the things that we have to consider is that once you're arrested, that is recorded somewhere and will appear in things like DBS checks in the future, even if it goes no further. Do you have any views on how intervention might work better earlier on, even at the point of the knock at the door? barry hughes: From the perspective of the CPS, I'm not sure I can help you there. Unlike in many other jurisdictions, we have no power whatsoever to direct the police, so if the police decide not to investigate\u2014. I routinely get letters from members of the public outraged that the police have decided not to investigate their particular neighbour dispute or something, and they want us to do something about it and we can't. suzy davies am: Thank you for that, because I thought that was important to get on the record as well. We're looking at a period of a couple of years after this Act passes\u2014if it does\u2014for implementation. Is there anything at the moment that you think perhaps you still need to do as an organisation towards being in a position to practically implement this law? barry hughes: I think we need to maintain the type of dialogue that we've built up with the Welsh Government and colleagues there. We have other members of my staff who are involved in the other work streams that feed through to that, and I believe that that involvement will ensure that we are sufficiently interconnected; that we can liaise, in turn, with Kwame and his colleagues in the headquarters to respond to things as they develop. So, I think we've got a network of contacts built up here that is adequate for the purpose\u2014at least, 'adequate' might sound a little\u2014 suzy davies am: Sufficient. suzy davies am: So, you're confident, by 2022, then, that you'll have changes to the CPS guidelines that are good to go, if you like. Bear with me a second\u2014thank you very much\u2014in your written evidence, you did welcome the indication from the Welsh Government that this reasonable period after Royal Assent would be necessary. Apart from the CPS guideline changes, which you'll be working through, is there anything else you think you might be needing to do apart from just keeping in touch? I'm just thinking: are there any practical and possibly financial implications for your workforce in this? barry hughes: If this legislation goes through, there will be minor financial consequences for us and I don't see any significant financial consequences in the period between now and the Bill becoming law other than the time of ourselves in discussing this today. And what about afterwards, then? Because one of the pieces of thinking behind this Act is to collect data to see whether this change in the law actually works. Do you want to talk us through a little bit about how that might affect you? I don't know who to ask on this. Well, I think that we are going to need to maintain a clear record of any cases that are referred to the CPS from the police and that will\u2014. Normally, we do this through our case management system, which is England-and-Wales wide, and you'd put a flag on. So, for example, domestic abuse, there's a flag for that, and assault on a child, there's a flag for that. Trying to get that through on a system that covers all of England and Wales\u2014it's quite expensive, unbelievably; it wouldn't happen. My take on it: I've seen and spoken with Matt Jukes about this, from South Wales Police; I have seen the justice impact assessment; I've seen the research that's been fed through from New Zealand; and I've seen our own response to a freedom of information request and the papers that the CPS put into the review that you mentioned earlier in 2007. I would be very surprised if we were to prosecute anything other than low single figures a year, if that much. We may have more referrals from the police, but I doubt it would be double the figure we prosecute, even. There are out-of-court disposals and there are all sorts of diversions that you will have discussed, and I know you've discussed, with the police and the police and crime commissioner. So, the numbers will be very small, which means we would be able to keep a clear track on those and, obviously, we would wish to keep the situation under review, and we'd reach a period of time after whatever\u201412, 18 months, maybe 24 months\u2014where we'd look back to see how we are doing. And I'd like to think that we will be doing that in consultation with interested parties and stakeholders. So, for offences such as racially aggravated offending, whether it's criminal damage or offence against the person, we will bring together interested parties, by which  people from outside the CPS, quite often third sector agencies that represent vulnerable groups. That, in turn, helps us shape and improve the way that we prosecute these cases and I can foresee that, after this legislation came in, we might get 18 months, two years down the road, and I can see us sitting in a room with some of the cases we've prosecuted, maybe cases we've decided not to prosecute, with the police and interested parties from both sides, to have a discussion about how we're doing with it all. suzy davies am: That's really helpful to know because, of course, one of the difficulties of dealing with the culture change, which is what the Minister's effectively after here, is that we are still talking about it in the context of criminal legislation. And what I'm hearing from you is that the chances of somebody who's currently protected by the defence and is not part of a bigger case where there's serial smacking or other difficulties in a family, for example\u2014the chances of them getting to you in the first place are pretty low, and then the chances of them passing even the current public interest tests are pretty low. In which case, my question is: why are we bothering with this law rather than concentrating on a new piece of law, possibly through the civil system, which would achieve the culture change better? Maybe that's not a question you feel that you can answer, but you can see why I'm asking the question. In other words, there is a greater degree of protection for children, and I think the value that would derive from this legislation is the message that it sends out. I go back to what I was saying to you right at the start, about the evolution of the law, and the way we've seen many other countries around the world adopt a very similar approach to that being proposed by the Welsh Government is, in my view, an evolution of the law. So, yes, there may not be many more prosecutions, but there won't be fewer than there are presently, because there's a greater degree of protection for children. lynne neagle am: Before we move on, can I just ask\u2014? The Children Act 2004 applies to a child up to the age of 18\u2014 barry hughes: Sixteen. barry hughes: I'm reasonably confident that it's 16.FootnoteLink lynne neagle am: Okay. Is there anything else you'd like to put on record about the factors that the CPS would be taking into consideration when applying the public interest test in respect of this Bill? barry hughes: Can I give you an example, which might illustrate the way in which things could be different? This is one, which\u2014I give credit to Iwan for this, because he thought of it. If we take an adult with a small child\u2014say, a four-year-old\u2014in a supermarket, and the child is pulling cans off the shelves, it's quite annoying, and they keep doing it and keep doing it. The parent remonstrates, and the parent ends up finding that verbal admonishment is inadequate, and smacks the child lightly on the legs, which does the trick and the child stops. Presently, if someone in that supermarket were to report that to the police, I think the police would probably conclude that that is covered by the defence of reasonable chastisement. In other words, the evidential stage wouldn't be passed; you don't get on to consider the public interest. But if we have that same parent in there the following week, and you have the same happen again, presently, the defence would apply. If that defence didn't apply at all, and we had a sequence of three offences, the public interest test would kick in, if I may put it like that, pretty quickly, because it would be repeated behaviour. So, that would be the distinction between how things are now and how they would be in the future, because the defence would not be available, so the public interest test would then come to the fore that much more quickly. So, when we apply the public interest test, the essence of it is about proportionality, and trying to come up with an approach that is proportionate to the offending. We look at the age of the offender, the age of the victim, we look at the circumstances, we look at the impact upon the victim, we look at the impact that's likely in relation to the suspect, and there is, within the code, a long list of matters that we take into account. If someone's got previous convictions for doing something wrong, it's more likely they're going to be prosecuted the next time. Mostly, it's reasonably obvious; the more serious an offence, the more likely you are to be prosecuted. vikki howells am: Thank you, that's really useful, and\u2014 lynne neagle am: Just before you move on, can I ask you a question? This morning the committee was meeting with groups of parents who are opposed to the Bill and groups of parents who are for the Bill, and one of the parents this morning was querying where the interests of the child would come into the public interest test. Can you just clarify for the record how the best interests of the child would be taken into account in considering whether to go forward with a prosecution? barry hughes: Normally, if there were an assault by someone else upon a child, outside the family, we would tend to take views from the parents of that child. In circumstances where both parents, arguably, are the suspects, we probably wouldn't be asking them. We would find another way, and we would talk with the police to ensure that we are informed about how the child feels about what has happened. I can foresee real difficulties in circumstances where we have parents who are separating where the children are being used, effectively, in divorce proceedings, for example, where we might have one parent saying there was a really bad impact upon the child and the other parent saying there wasn't. We'd want to find a way to cut through that to work out really from the police how does the child feel about that. So, we would tailor it to the circumstances of the particular incident to assess how the child feels about it. It's not determinative, nor is it determinative in cases where we prosecute for adult defendants inflicting some form of assault upon adult victims. In the same session this morning I thought this was an interesting question raised by a parent, on the rights of the child side of things, where if a parent offers a child two forms of punishment because that child has done something that they know they shouldn't have, and they're given the option of, 'You can have a quick smack and a cwtch, or you're going to your bedroom for quarter of an hour', and the child is allowed to choose and the child chooses the smack, what happens then? I'm not offering any views on the fact that this choice has been given, but it was put to us today about how would that fall in the law once it were changed. There is a body of law that\u2014 suzy davies am: A child can't consent to assault. barry hughes: Yes, you can't consent to a serious assault, apart from in certain\u2014. So, for example, tattooing is a serious assault on one level, but you can consent to a tattoo. I can think of one case where a man branded his initials on a woman's buttocks, but she consented to it and the Court of Appeal held that they could consent to that. I can also think of a series of cases, which I won't get into here, that involve sadomasochistic behaviour between adults, some of which was really serious, and involved people willingly applying themselves to things that no sane person would do. And the Court of Appeal in that case, a case called Brown, said, 'No, that's going too far\u2014you can't consent to that.' Then, you may have seen there was a case from the midlands recently where a gentleman operating a tattoo parlour was also involved in body surgery\u2014splitting people's tongues. So, there is again\u2014I referred before to the spectrum of offending, and there is a clear spectrum of offending that you can realistically consent to and then you get to offending you can't consent to. When it comes to much lesser assaults, the law is more unclear as to what you can consent to. I've got one further series of questions around out-of-court disposals, which you've already mentioned briefly. In your written evidence, you say there's ongoing work exploring diversion rather than prosecution in respect of this Bill. Firstly, could you tell us a bit more about the work that is being done to explore this as an option? barry hughes: We've been working with the National Police Chiefs' Council. She is responsible for developing the police approach to out-of-court disposals and simplifying the range of out-of-court disposals. There is quite a range, and life would be simpler and clearer to have fewer types of disposal with more clarity about what each one of them involved. I must say, this is primarily a matter for the police, because there are a great many offences or reports of crime that do not reach the CPS because they are dealt with by way of an out-of-court disposal. There's a document called the director's guidance on charging, which is issued by the director of public prosecutions, which sets out offences the police may charge and offences the CPS may charge. Offences that the police refer to us for a charging decision will generally be offences where they feel that there should be a prosecution rather than an out-of-court disposal. There may be cases where it's genuinely very difficult to assess what's the best approach, in which case we will have a conversation with them, a meaningful conversation, about what's the best way to approach that particular case. There will also be cases, and we see these not that rarely, where the police will bring a case to us for a prosecution on the basis that satisfies the evidential stage and satisfies the public interest stage, and we take a different view on the public interest stage. So, we might say\u2014for example, it involves a 15-year-old youth\u2014we\u00a0 think that diversion from the criminal justice system is a better disposal and we decide not to prosecute. We aren't responsible for administering\u00a0the out-of-court disposal or indeed monitoring compliance with that disposal, if, for example, it has conditions attached, such as repayment of the damage caused to a window or a front gate. That's not our responsibility\u2014that will fall to the police\u2014but we can decide that an out-of-court disposal is a more appropriate disposal than a prosecution. One final question on that then: creating a body of out-of-court disposals that are specific to this Bill\u2014how would that actually work in practice do you think, given the fact that the Assembly's legislative competence to make provision on the face of the Bill is limited? barry hughes: The way I might see it is that, clearly, policing's not devolved, the CPS is not devolved\u2014the way I might see this is that, within Wales, you could build an infrastructure that provides for a range of out-of-court disposals. You can't direct the police or the CPS to point people towards that, but, if you build a good infrastructure, it's more likely that people will be pointed in that direction. vikki howells am: And who would build that infrastructure, in your opinion? barry hughes: Somewhere within Wales\u2014Welsh Government, local authorities, the police working in partnership. If I could just ask about awareness raising, then: you mentioned the Bill in Scotland, but that Bill includes a duty on the Government to raise awareness of the change. Do you think that's right or should this committee be saying that there should be a similar duty imposed in Wales? barry hughes: I'm not sure it's for me to say whether there should be a duty or not. I can, however, say that I think the greater the level of awareness, the more likely it is that the Act, if passed, will achieve its intentions. And, in your written evidence, you mentioned the fact that there's no indication of any plans for awareness raising in England and that if a person from England is being prosecuted in Wales as a result of this change, a question could arise about the lack of knowledge about the different provisions that apply in Wales. Can I ask what approach the CPS currently takes in Wales if a law is unintentionally broken by someone who's come from outside the UK, for example? barry hughes: It's straightforward: if someone comes to this country and commits an offence here\u2014by this country, I'd say England or Wales; I'd treat them as one for these purposes\u2014if someone comes from abroad and commits an offence that isn't an offence in their country, but is an offence here, then I'm afraid that ignorance of the law is no defence. So, raising awareness is important, and I saw, and I was pleased to see, that the media publicity surrounding this proposed legislation, which is now going through, reached as far afield as New York and had widespread media coverage across England and Wales, and I think the Government would be well placed here to take advantage of that willingness of the media to explore something, which is potentially divisive, and I think you've probably seen some of that. Anything like that is a good story, and a good story gets out there, which means you're more likely to make people aware of it. sian gwenllian am: Yes, we've discussed some of these already, but, for example, under the new law, or the proposed law, would one unintended consequence be that, if someone living in Wales who can't use the reasonable punishment defence\u2014would their life prospects be different compared to those people in England, who will be able to use that defence? I think you've mentioned that in your written evidence. A simple answer: if somebody in Wales is convicted\u2014so, if it goes towards the end of the spectrum that is serious, which results in a prosecution\u2014. It may be\u2014the sort of circumstance I can see happening here is somebody who takes a principled stand and declines any form of out-of-court disposal and says, 'Prosecute me'. So, let's say it comes to court and let's say they end up being convicted of assaulting their child\u2014in circumstances that would not have happened in England\u2014then they would have a criminal conviction they wouldn't have in England, and that, inevitably, has an impact upon their life prospects. And do you think that that would be an isolated incident? barry hughes: Yes, truly, I believe, an isolated incident. I've said before that I would be very surprised if we even had referrals that reached double figures on these cases. When the CPS was asked to conduct a survey across all of England and Wales\u2014this was the review in 2007\u2014it spanned just over a two-year period, and there were 12 cases that were brought up at that stage. Now, I have to say, I don't think that's entirely reliable, but it is indicative. We had a Freedom of Information Act request at one stage, which threw up something like three cases in a year. So, if you think about that as being all of England and Wales\u2014and we make up about 5 per cent of the volume of criminal prosecutions nationally\u2014you can see why I might say the numbers are likely to be small, for the reasons we've explored about getting past the evidential stage into the public interest. In terms of thinking about another kind of unintended consequence, in terms of managing performance and all of the targets that the police need to reach, are we perhaps going to see some people going through the criminal justice system in an inappropriate way and contrary to the interests of the child, because we need to reach some target in terms of performance measures? barry hughes: I have to say I think that extremely unlikely. Clearly, we prosecute if we think that there's a reasonable prospect, a realistic prospect, of conviction and it's in the public interest, but we have no targets. And I would also say, because the numbers here are likely to be so small, any assertion of looking to meet targets\u2014it's a tiny, tiny fragment of a drop in the ocean. sian gwenllian am: What about\u2014? There is a target for unsolved crimes, or unsolved offences. What if they fall into that category? Is that an unintended consequence? barry hughes: I'm talking about something I don't have great knowledge of here. There was, at one stage, a series of targets for the police that bore down upon cases that secure what was called a sanction detection, which counted for Home Office figures. Some individual constabularies may still have targets, but, as far as I'm aware, we don't have a suite of national measures. And, in my experience, the police are much more sensible these days than they may have been 20 years ago, in terms of trying to get cases charged in order to meet some notional target. We've mentioned this, namely the risk of malicious reporting against parents involved in private family law cases. Is that going to increase if we change the law? barry hughes: There is greater potential for it to increase. I think the numbers, again, will be tiny, and dwarfed by the number of cases where we have to deal with the fallout between a relationship breakdown between partners\u2014whether they be living within the same house or living in different houses. Getting into the subtleties of the father, say, smacking the child in a way that was reasonable chastisement or was not reasonable chastisement is probably part of a much bigger piece here. It's not something that would cause me concern, simply because we already have a well-developed approach to dealing with the way in which we evaluate the evidence from parties who may well have a particular position that they want to reinforce, sometimes through exaggeration of basic facts and sometimes through fabrication. sian gwenllian am: Are there any other unintended consequences that come to your mind if we introduce this law? barry hughes: No, I think we've had a pretty helpful canter through most of the circumstances here that might happen. sian gwenllian am: Finally from me, therefore\u2014another issue, in a way\u2014the European convention on human rights. Would not introducing the new law mean, at some point, that Wales could get itself into difficulty because there is a breach of the human rights convention? And therefore England as well, at some point. How to approach that one? In the 2007 review to which we've referred already, the Government, the then Government, set out its position that it believes that section 58, in the way that it was drafted, is compliant with the European convention. If Wales implements this legislation and it becomes part of the law, then, arguably, Wales would be more in compliance with ECHR than not, and England would be less so. But nonetheless, at present, I haven't seen any demurral from the position that was expressed in 2007, which is that they consider that the position that's been adopted with section 58 is compliant with the legislation. It may well be tested by case law; that's the way it's likely to happen. Some of the changes in this arena were driven by case law\u2014so, that case I referred to, Regina v H, which was heard back in 2001 in the Court of Appeal, was significant in helping shape the direction of travel towards section 58. sian gwenllian am: And that case law not necessarily would have to happen within the UK\u2014that case law could come from other countries within the European Union. barry hughes: It could, but I would be a foolish man if I were to say what impact European jurisprudence might have upon us. [Laughter.] suzy davies am: [Inaudible.]\u2014like common law jurisdictions would be. Suzy's touched on this mildly, but, in written evidence, you say that you do not consider that the costs of prosecuting cases made possible by the Bill will be of great significance to the Crown Prosecution Service, and you're basing that, from your evidence here today, on the low numbers of prosecutions. So, we've been asked by individuals, and we've had consultation responses from individuals, who've argued that there is no point creating legislation if people are not prosecuted for breaching it. What's your answer to that? barry hughes: There is a huge body of legislation out there that outlaws certain offences, and I think probably about\u2014. From memory\u2014please never hold me to this\u2014but, from memory, there are something like 10,000 criminal offences; we probably prosecute 5 per cent of those in any given year. I've been prosecuting for 32 years now; there are some offences that I've never come near and probably never will. But, nonetheless, the fact those offences exist sets out in terms what is acceptable and what is not acceptable. Well, they're not something that we do, but it sets out what's tolerant\u2014what's tolerable, sorry, and what isn't. So, the fact that we might not have many prosecutions is, for me, not a reason not to say that we shouldn't signify that certain behaviour is or is not acceptable. Clearly, we don't wish to criminalise everything\u2014that would be a nonsense\u2014or to attempt to set the boundaries by almost micromanaging what individuals do and don't do. And then the explanatory memorandum says there is a shortage of registered intermediaries who assist child witnesses during police interview and when giving evidence in court. Is this a potential barrier to implementing this proposed law, and are there any other potential barriers you want to raise? barry hughes: No. There was a shortage of registered intermediaries in Wales, and I know that the Ministry of Justice have taken action to deal with that, and we have had a number of people who are now in a position to act as intermediaries. Now, of course, if they were to decide not to do that anymore, we may have a problem, but, in turn, we would be looking to recruit more people into those positions. So, yes, it has the potential to serve as a barrier, but in practice, I don't think it would be a barrier. I think, particularly given the very low numbers we're talking about, we would be able to manage it. Can I thank you for attending, the three of you, and for your answers, which have been fascinating and very clear and most helpful to the committee? You will be sent a transcript following the meeting to check for accuracy. Paper to note 1 is a letter from me to the Business Committee requesting an extension on the deadline for the Bill, which has now been agreed. Paper to note 2 is a letter from myself to the Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services requesting some further information from CAFCASS Cymru on the Bill. Paper to note 3 is a letter from myself to the Minister for Education regarding Diamond reform implementation ahead of our scrutiny session on 4 July. Can I propose in accordance with Standing Order 17.42 that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you.<doc-sep>Item 3 this morning then is a scrutiny session on early childhood education and care, and I'm very pleased to welcome Julie Morgan AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services; Jo-anne Daniels, director of communities and tackling poverty at Welsh Government; and Nicola Edwards, deputy director of the childcare, play and early years division in Welsh Government. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions, and the first ones are from Hefin David. What are your primary objectives? Is it supporting the development of children or getting parents into work? julie morgan am: Well, I think you'll be aware from the range of programmes that we've got that we do feel it\u2019s important to support both children and parents. There's obviously lots of evidence to show how important the early years are for children, how important they are for their development, and so, that is one of our primary objectives. But we also know how important it is for parents to have stable jobs, reasonably paid, so that can also help with the development of the children. So, we really see it that our plans are for both parents and children, and we believe that a high-quality, early-childhood education and care system can provide that. And, of course, in terms of when we talk about jobs as well, I think it\u2019s really important to remember that the childcare system is a big employer as well and a very important employer. hefin david am: So, the evidence we've seen suggests that, historically, Governments in the UK and devolved have focused on primarily getting parents into work. So, are you suggesting then that your focus is to change that and move towards early child development? julie morgan am: No, what I'm saying is that we want to give parents the opportunity to work. We don't want childcare to be a barrier to parents working because we think that working is one the best routes out of poverty, but we do also want to make sure that children have the greatest experience that they can have in the early years. julie morgan am: The situation as it is is complex, and I think it needs simplifying. It is a challenge, but it\u2019s probably one of the most important challenges we've got in Government, because what we offer to families with young children is one of the most important things we do. hefin david am: And in your evidence to the committee, you said that the Welsh Government\u2019s approach 'will build on a wide variety of programmes that are continually developing in order to support parents, families and children during the early years.' And you've just said you want to simplify that. How do you simplify that, particularly with regard to the provision of funding and the way these things connect from the birth of a child into school? How will simplification look, and what will happen? julie morgan am: Well, we're not at the stage of being able to say what it will look like at the moment, but we're looking at ways of simplifying, because I think it\u2019s absolutely right, it is a very complex system, because it\u2019s grown up from all different routes. We have got pathway projects in, I think it\u2019s eight local authorities, who are looking at ways of joining up the whole system. So, we are looking at that, and I absolutely except that it is very complex and we want to find ways of making it simpler and easier to understand. So, we are working with local authorities and health boards to see how we can actually work together and simplify things. Can I just come back to the first thing you said: 'We can't say yet what we're going to do'? julie morgan am: No. hefin david am: So, when will we have a policy plan and something that we can interrogate in more detail? julie morgan am: Well, I think we are near getting to an announcement where we will be able to say what direction we're going in, and because we have had\u2014. Some of this work has been going on for a year or so, and we're getting the results of those pathfinder projects coming in. So, when we do have all those results, we will be able to say the direction that we want to go in, and I hope we'll be able to do that very soon. And finally from me\u2014 julie morgan am: I'm sorry I can't say too much about that because we haven't actually\u2014. And if that's as far as you're willing to go, then I'll stop asking. sian gwenllian am: I just want to understand a little about the pilot, the pathfinders in eight local authority areas. Is the focus there on the child or is it on parents returning to work? julie morgan am: The focus is on an early years system, but we've worked both locally and nationally. , actually, I think, perhaps, Nicola, would you like to or one of you like to describe one of the programmes? sian gwenllian am: And can you just explain the vision? Is it a child-centred early years provision that we're thinking of in these pathfinder\u2014? jo-anne daniels: So, in 'Prosperity for All', we set out that early years was one of the key priority areas, and within that we said that we wanted to create a more joined-up and more responsive system. So, when we talk about a system, we're talking about the services that are provided by health boards, so health visiting, midwifery, speech and language support, other kinds of therapeutic services, as well as all the important services that local authorities are providing, such as support for parenting, advice and guidance, employment support and childcare, obviously. So, Flintshire, Newport, Blaenau Gwent, Neath Port Talbot, Swansea, Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire\u2014and then I've missed one, I think, because I've only got to seven\u2014who have been working with us to look at how all of those services are currently delivered in their local area and whether and how they can reorganise those services to improve accessibility, to improve take-up, but essentially to improve the efficacy of those programmes in terms of supporting children, but often, obviously, in supporting children you have to support parents too and support the home. sian gwenllian am: So, would you say it's a child-centred approach? jo-anne daniels: Absolutely, because it's about making sure that we deliver the best start in life for children in Wales, but obviously parents are a critical element of that, so can't be excluded. lynne neagle am: And how long have they been going for? jo-anne daniels: So, those eight pathfinders started their work in\u2014I think it was\u2014February this year. And they're still in the very early stages in terms of actually unpicking and mapping the current provision of services across their areas and then moving on to the stage where they'll develop proposals for how they might change the delivery of early years. julie morgan am: Just to say also, the one in Flintshire is also testing the impact of consistent funding rates for education and childcare. So, that's another important area because there's an evaluation of that project under way at the moment. jo-anne daniels: Sorry, but Caerphilly was the one that I forgot to mention. hefin david am: In your report, the 'Alignment of the Childcare Offer for Wales to the Foundation Phase', one of the recommendations was that 'The Welsh Government, local authority education and childcare policy and delivery teams could merge'. So, looking behind the scenes, those disparate parts of policy, delivering the foundation phase and childcare offer should merge. Is that the case? Has that been put under way and should we be looking at this structure in more depth? julie morgan am: Well, probably not at the structure at this time because the report that you're referring to was looking at the first year of the delivery of the childcare offer and it did make a number of points, which we have taken on board. For example, we issued guidance last year regarding the delivery of the foundation phase, which supports widening the number of non-maintained settings that are able to deliver early education and we're also supporting co-location and partnership working between education and childcare providers through our capital investment programme. I think it's about \u00a381 million that we put into the capital investment where we are developing\u00a0childcare facilities co-located with the education facilities, because that was one of the things that came out from this report you're referring to. And, obviously, early years is one of the key priorities within 'Prosperity for All' and, obviously, education sits within one portfolio with the Minister for Education, and childcare is with me. But we're doing what we can to work together to try to bring those together, and that was one of the proposals in that report. hefin david am: And I remember when you were on the committee here with me, sitting next to me, we had those discussions about co-location. I know the problem with not having co-location is that you could end up seeing a child travelling between three or more locations during the course of a day. Are you suggesting now that the actions you're taking will resolve that issue universally, or will it lead to a piecemeal resolution? And, if so, to what extent, what percentage of children will see that resolved as an issue? julie morgan am: Certainly, the co-location is not going to solve it universally because although we've been able to develop a lot of new facilities, or build on old facilities, there will be a lot of areas that we won't have covered. So, I can't say that there's going to be a situation where everything is going to be co-located because I don't think that would be feasible, and,for some of the providers, they wouldn't be in a position to move to a school. But ideally it's a good situation, but, certainly, I think the discussions that there were on the committee, it's not ideal to take children for long distances between different providers, let alone the effect it has on the climate change issue. So, I can't say that they will ever be co-located, but as I said in response to your earlier question, we are encouraging the development of the foundation phase in non-maintained settings, which, obviously, is quite significant. What is the Welsh Government doing to address the big differences in the amount of early childhood education and care provision available in different parts of Wales? julie morgan am: Right. , obviously, it would be good to see a greater degree of consistency, but I think it's important to acknowledge that there are reasons for that variation. Now, early education, of course, is the responsibility of the Minister for Education, and we are aware that different local authorities have adopted different patterns of providing early education. For example, local authorities are funded to provide 10 hours minimum of the foundation phase for three and four-year-olds across Wales, but there's quite a variance in how much is actually provided, with some local authorities providing a lot more historically. So, it does mean that there is a different pattern across Wales, according to what local authorities do. But what I could say is, of course, the quality is very good, as the Estyn reports have shown; that the quality provided, the delivery of the foundation phase, is very good. But it does vary in terms of what is offered throughout Wales, and that is the decision of the local authorities, and it is a historical thing. I refer to this pilot in Flint, which is trying to test paying the same rate for foundation phase and childcare. We're going to have an independent evaluation on that soon, in November this year, so that will help us. Obviously, I think local authorities' role in all this is absolutely crucial because they are the local, nearest people to decide how things develop in their own areas. And then, of course, we've got Flying Start, which is geographically targeted, which uses the data from income benefit to decide which are the areas where that is being delivered. And that is delivered where the highest proportion of children aged nought to three are living in income-dependent households. With Flying Start being geographically targeted, with the education being determined by the local authorities about how much there is, we know that there is a variance throughout Wales. We'd like to see facilities developed in each local authority throughout Wales that would answer the needs of the families and the children in those areas. lynne neagle am: Before you move on, Janet, Si\u00e2n's got a supplementary. sian gwenllian am: Just in terms of the foundation phase, there have been cuts, of course, in expenditure in that phase. How concerned are you about that and the impact that that will have on the way in which the foundation phase is taught in our schools? The foundation phase is now part of the education improvement grant, which has seen a reduction of 10 per cent, and it has to compete against other expenditure streams within that greater pot of funding. So, are you concerned that money is being lost and that that will have an impact on standards in the foundation phase? julie morgan am: I haven't seen any evidence. Obviously, I must reiterate the foundation phase does come under the Minister for Education, but I haven't seen any evidence of any standards being lowered, and the reports from Estyn are very good. In fact, I think the foundation phase is one of our great joys, that we absolutely celebrate it, and so I'd be very concerned if I thought there was any drop in standards in the foundation phase, and I certainly haven't had any evidence of that. sian gwenllian am: Exactly, but if there are fewer teaching assistants in the system because of the cuts, it's going to impact on standards, at the end of the day. julie morgan am: I think we have to be very careful to see that lower standards are not implemented, because it was groundbreaking when we brought it in, and it has proved to be a great success, so we want to make sure that's guarded. janet finch-saunders am: Going back to my original question about the big differences in amounts of early childhood education and care provision in different parts of Wales, the Welsh and UK Governments have followed a demand-driven approach to the childcare market, with subsidies mainly given to working parents. Is that a mistake? Should it be more universally available? julie morgan am: Well, some of our provision is universally available in certain areas. For example, the Flying Start provision is universally available in geographically defined areas, and I think that's very important, because that does mean that there isn't stigma, and so,in those areas, everybody can take advantage of it, and yet it is reaching those who are most in need because it's reaching those areas. In terms of when you say demand led, could you elaborate on that? janet finch-saunders am: I know that\u2014we've just had a useful briefing from\u00a0David Dallimore, and, basically, there is this theory that there are too many resources\u2014the demand-driven approach is based more on certain factors: geographic spread in terms of it being more universal, and whether that's the right way. How do children then mix with peers from different backgrounds, in their own peer or age group? julie morgan am: It is demand\u2014 nicola edwards: [Inaudible.]\u2014because the offer is targeted at working parents\u2014 janet finch-saunders am: Yes, yes. nicola edwards: \u2014obviously, then the amount of availability is based on how many parents apply for it and take it up. julie morgan am: It is universally available to all parents who meet the eligibility criteria of working, and I think what you're saying is that it should be available to everybody. lynne neagle am: I think the point that Janet's making is that some areas have traditionally got more childcare anyway because they have traditionally had more demand in those areas, so there's not a level playing field to start from. julie morgan am: I think that, historically, that is definitely true, and when you look at the take-up of the childcare offer, it's certainly taken up in some areas with a very high take-up rate. I think Ynys M\u00f4n was nearly 90 per cent or something\u2014 sian gwenllian am: They need more money, because they haven't got enough funding. julie morgan am: In other areas, it's much, much lower\u2014in some of the cities, I know. So, there is a big range in take-up\u2014 janet finch-saunders am: So, do you intend to bring something forward to address that? julie morgan am: We are planning to extend it. Obviously, we have to wait for the evaluation\u00a0of that.\u00a0It would be great to be able to offer it to absolutely everybody, but obviously we have got the finance to look at in terms of how we do that. janet finch-saunders am: Does the Welsh Government intend to develop an integrated approach, then, against all settings? If so, given the current inconsistencies, how can quality be assured? julie morgan am: We are developing a more integrated approach towards the early years. As I've said, we're trying to have the foundation phase operating in more non-maintained settings, and we're already developing that. But Estyn and CIW will continue to inspect and regulate the early years sector to ensure standards, and, since January 2019, CIW and Estyn have moved to joint inspections for the non-maintained settings that are offering the foundation phase. So, that is a very positive move, I think, and is absolutely making sure that standards are maintained, because if we are having the foundation phase in non-maintained settings, that is a challenge where we want to be sure that the standards and the philosophy of the foundation phase are maintained. janet finch-saunders am: And finally from me, what specific steps have been put in place to take forward the commitments from the Welsh Government's 2017 childcare/play early years workforce plan to build a better understanding of the workforce's Welsh language skills to enable support for the sector to be targeted and to identify where capacity needs to be built for the future to meet the needs of the early years sector in a bilingual Wales? julie morgan am: We think this is very important, and we're pleased that 29 per cent of children taking up the childcare offer are in Welsh or bilingual settings, so we think that's very good. We have established a specific programme to develop Welsh language skills in the childcare and play workforce with the National Centre for Learning Welsh, to develop workplace Welsh language skills across the sector. So, we're actually working with that, and I think you've done something with those recently, haven't you? I don't know if you want to\u2014 nicola edwards: Yes. So, we have a stakeholder group where we've brought together a variety of people with an interest in the early years, childcare and play sectors, and we had a presentation just last month from the national language centre about the education programmes that they're rolling out, and how this is all coming together, which is quite interesting. We've been working quite carefully to make sure that the variety of work-based learning programmes that we provide and offer are also available in Welsh and bilingually. Recruiting and retaining staff with really good Welsh language skills adds an extra dimension to it, and\u00a0that it's a point that Mudiad Meithrin makes to us quite regularly, that they do struggle to find staff with the right skills. So, upskilling the existing workforce is a key part of it, but also doing more to attract people in with Welsh language skills in the first place in terms of the training courses that we're taking forward, and thinking about that in the context of the targets within Cymraeg 2050 and the aim to get to one million Welsh speakers. So, as the Deputy Minister said, we've got quite a number of children accessing the offer in Welsh-medium or bilingual settings at the moment. We're going to be doing some baselining work against that in terms of local authorities' Welsh in education strategic plans and education places, and what we can then do to increase the number of childcare places in parallel with that so that you can make sure that you start that pathway through learning Welsh, interacting with education and childcare through Welsh at a much earlier stage. suzy davies am: Just on this early point, anybody who's been through the Welsh education system, which is 20 years now, will have some Welsh language skills, obviously to differing degrees. For the entrants that are coming into childcare training now, there are going to be very few of them, realistically, with no Welsh at all, so what's actually being incorporated into the early years care training to make sure, at that stage, that the Welsh language skills are being developed, as opposed to an add-on later on? nicola edwards: You're quite right. Most people coming through the education system will have some awareness of Welsh although I think it's probably important to remember we do also employ people from outside of wales. It's not necessarily appropriate for then teaching that language to children, who may be coming from families who don't use Welsh at home. So, there's a lot of that in terms of child development and how you develop children bilingually, particularly if they're coming from English-medium homes, and reinforcing the language in language choices. There will also be some people who are, perhaps\u2014we see this quite a lot in the office\u2014quite confident in terms of speaking Welsh but less so in terms of some of the paperwork, the reporting, the writing and the interacting with parents more officially, which we need to think about as well. But it is mainly about getting people to a point where they can transmit that language onwards in a confident and meaningful way. lynne neagle am: Just before we move on, you said that 29 per cent of the take-up of the childcare offer is either through Welsh or is bilingual. Have you got any figures about how many children are accessing it in Welsh only? nicola edwards: We will have. With the way we do it, it's because of the way that the setting defines their language category, and that's how we collect it. We do go down to individual child level, although it's anonymised, data collection on a termly basis. lynne neagle am: Maybe if the committee could have a note, that would be really useful. lynne neagle am: We've got some questions now on childcare from Dawn Bowden. Deputy Minister, the evaluation of the childcare offer, when it was published last year, said that there was very little evidence currently available to determine what its impact was. You're going to be producing a second evaluation in November this year; do you expect to see some indications now of the impact? julie morgan am: Well, the evaluation of the first year of the childcare offer was very limited, because the childcare offer wasn't available throughout the whole of Wales. And the evaluation for year 2, I think, will also show a limited impact for the same reasons. And the parental survey was released to parents in June 2019, therefore any impact on parents in the authorities coming on board in the second year will also be negligible. So, it's from the next one, however, we hope that we will get more information. dawn bowden am: So you think, by the time we get to November 2020, you might have a better picture. What the first year's evaluation did show, however, was that 94 per cent of respondents said that they were already using formal childcare before the offer came into place. A couple of things, really: are you surprised at that, and is that likely to inform the way that you develop the offer in the future? julie morgan am: No, I'm not surprised at all. In terms of how the families found out that it was available, they found it out through the childcare providers, where they already had their children there. But, of course, we were not able to fully advertise the childcare offer until it was available in all the local authorities, which was last April. So we are planning, this autumn, quite a big push now to try to make it available to everybody\u2014so everybody knows about it. So, no, this is the pattern we would have expected, and I think anybody who's involved in starting up something in childcare will know you have to wait a number of years before you actually see it being fully taken up. dawn bowden am: I guess the question that it raises in my mind is: does this mean that, actually, it hasn't been an incentive to get somebody back into work, because they were already in work and already had childcare provision? What you've done is you've directed money to people who were already spending that money anyway. So it hasn't been a move towards getting people into work because they couldn't afford childcare. julie morgan am: Well I think that that is something that we are moving towards, because the take-up of the offer is actually increasing each month, which is why I call it a great success. At the end of July, we hit almost 16,000 children accessing the offer, which obviously means that there are 16,000 families benefiting from this, and the feedback that we have had from parents is that they have been able to\u2014. They've got more money available, which is obvious, which is great, because obviously more money is available to plunge into the economy and carry out that sort of thing, and we've got examples of parents who've been supported into work through programmes like Parents, Childcare and Employment to begin with, and then have gone on to access the offer. So, I think we are seeing signs that people are moving on, have got more ability to be flexible in the work that they're doing, but I hope that when we look at it again, we will be able to see people actually moving into work because of having the access to childcare. Before\u2014 lynne neagle am: Are you going to move on? Si\u00e2n's got a supplementary. If you foresee that there's going to be more people going to be taking up that offer through the fact that you're marketing it more, what if the same situation arises that has happened on Anglesey? The take-up has been very good there, but the money that the Welsh Government has been allocating to Anglesey doesn't match that. What if it happens in every local authority right across Wales? Are you confident there's going to be plenty of money available to respond to that demand? julie morgan am: Based on the current levels of take-up and looking at the rates of increase each month, we expect to spend in the region of \u00a350 million to \u00a355 million in this financial year. Our published plans already include the provision of \u00a340 million, and we're absolutely committed to making available the total funding that is needed to deliver on the offer. It is fantastic to see the offer being so well received on Ynys M\u00f4n, recognising, as Janet said earlier, it is demand led. It's this year now that the big increase has happened; the previous two years\u2014 sian gwenllian am: So, local authorities won't have to find the extra money out of their own pots. You've already alluded to this in answer to Janet earlier on, about extending the childcare offer to those in training and education. So, I'm not quite sure what 'on the cusp' of returning to work is, but from the committee's point of view, we're very pleased that you've reached that conclusion, because it was one of the recommendations that we had following the scrutiny of the Bill. So, can you say a little more about that, bearing in mind that I'm also conscious that you've told Hefin you're going to be making an announcement shortly? So you may not be able to say too much. But a little bit more about the inclusion of parents in training and education, what 'on the cusp of returning to work' is\u2014what that means from your perspective\u2014and how you've arrived at that decision now, six months into the programme. What is it that's made you move towards that conclusion? julie morgan am: Well, obviously, the children and young persons committee made a very good case for education and training, in particular; I think that was one of the things that was at the top of the list. What we've committed to do is to review the programme, particularly looking at how we could bring in education and training, and that review will report early next year. But the other thing that's also happened is that, obviously, with the new First Minister, that was one of his manifesto commitments\u2014that he would bring education and training in. So, we're obviously following the\u2014 dawn bowden am: Because that was one of the key drivers for that as well. julie morgan am: Yes, so that is another of the key drivers, as you said\u2014the committee and what the First Minister said. There are a wealth of programmes supporting parents into education, training or work, and many of those do provide support with childcare costs. But we have, by rolling out this programme, the childcare programme, highlighted some gaps where people have felt that they, particularly people who are in full-time education\u2014and I can think of a number of people who are actually doing PhD studies\u2014who are\u2014the letters may have come in from some of your constituents\u2014not able to access the offer as things stand. We're using the definition by the Office for National Statistics, aren't we, in terms of education and training. And on 'on the cusp of work', maybe that will have to be something we have to look at differently\u2014those people who are actually maybe undertaking very short training programmes, preparation for work, maybe actually having interviews, where they need help with childcare, that they're sort of almost there. So, they may have to be dealt with in a different way, but I think we do want to look at those. This is expanding the offer; it's not making it universal, but it's moving on. dawn bowden am: So, what are the\u2014? Overall, then, what are the factors that you're having to take into account? Is it going to be what is needed in order to encourage people back into work? Is it going to be cost? Is it going to be a combination of all of those things? What are going to be the key factors that you're going to be looking at? julie morgan am: Well, the position now is that anybody who fulfills the criteria in terms of the number of hours they work, we would look at that in terms of education and training, and then, this expression 'on the cusp of work' we may have to look at differently, because they may not fulfil those numbers in terms of number of hours training. So, we'll get a criteria, and then they will have access to the childcare offer. But I just have to emphasise that there are ways of getting help with childcare already, and we wanted to make sure we don't duplicate. That's why this field is so complex, shall we say, because there's so many different ways that you can actually get help, and we want to be sure that we don't duplicate\u2014 dawn bowden am: Sorry, Julie. So, all of this is going to be incorporated in this announcement that you're going to be making shortly\u2014 julie morgan am: No, this review will report early next year. My final question\u2014 lynne neagle am: Before you move on, sorry, I've got a couple of supplementaries. suzy davies am: Just on the cost element, because if you do roll out this programme, obviously, on the back of evidence through a review, it is going to cost extra money. There are fairly generous Barnett consequentials coming from the comprehensive spending review and announcements on schools from the UK Government, and while I accept that you've only got annual commitments there, they're still substantial. How much money have you managed to secure for early years from the most recent announcement, and when have you planned to actually use that, maybe for some of this work? julie morgan am: Have you got some information on that? nicola edwards: The budget process is ongoing internally, so I think 'secured' is probably a slightly premature phrase. suzy davies am: Am I allowed to ask instead how much you've asked for, then? All I'm after is some reassurance that you will be getting some of this money, and as it is one of the eight priorities, certainly we would expect to see you getting a substantial amount of money for early years. julie morgan am: As one of the Government's priorities, we would expect to get any money that came as a result of any Barnett consequentials. julie morgan am: It's all in the process\u2014 lynne neagle am: And the committee will want to look very carefully at that, obviously. sian gwenllian am: How much would it cost to move to a child-centred approach, which means that every child would be able to access the childcare offer, rather than doing it from parents? julie morgan am: We are looking at that. We're having a longer-term review, in terms of what it would mean if every child had access to the childcare offer. That should report early next year, and then we've got another longer-term review, looking at what a universal offer would mean. sian gwenllian am: Do we know how many children we're talking about? nicola edwards: Yes. So, there are approximately, at any given time, around 73,000 three and four-year-olds in Wales. There's some slight rounding in the numbers there, but approximately 73,000 at any given time. Based on the current eligibility criteria for the offer, it's about 34,000 children, we believe, are eligible. This does, of course, vary, depending on a whole range of different factors, and we certainly know from what we're seeing from the offer that, even where people are entitled to something, they don't necessarily take it up. And even if they do take it up, they don't necessarily take up their full entitlement, which is also something that we'd have to think about in terms of any modelling on costings. nicola edwards: It's because of the requirement that, in a two-parent household, both parents must be in work. lynne neagle am: One of the points that the committee made very strongly in our report on the Bill was that we wanted to see a much more child-centred focus, and one of the issues that came out in scrutiny was whether, actually, three and four-year-olds were the right age to be actually targeting if we're looking at things like child development. Have you given any consideration to the actual age group that's covered when we know that, for many children, it's the first 1,000 days that makes that fundamental difference? julie morgan am: We are aware that there is a case that says that two years old is a very important time. dawn bowden am: Yes, my final question, Chair, thank you, is about the parent, childcare and employment programme, which is jointly funded by the European social fund and Welsh Government. It has been quite successful, in terms of its numbers anyway, in getting economically inactive parents into work. What are the plans for this programme, if and when we leave the EU and we lose the ESF funding for that? julie morgan am: Well, the programme has recently been extended, with delivery continuing until June 2022, with additional ESF funding of \u00a35.6 million. That's recently happened, and obviously this programme provides intensive employment to parents who are not in education, employment or training or economically inactive and where the childcare is the main barrier, and it has been a very, very successful programme. So, the UK has guaranteed funding for all EU projects approved by December 2020, and this includes the PaCE programme. I heard some other guarantees on the radio recently from the UK Treasury about guaranteeing some of these funds. But the Welsh Government can only draw on the UK Government guarantee for claims that aren't paid by the European Commission, and so the current arrangements are staying in place. To do that it would have to be part of Government planning in terms of\u2014 julie morgan am: Well, we don't know what's happening with that\u2014 dawn bowden am: \u2014what would happen beyond that. julie morgan am: \u2014funding, but there have been some promises from the UK Government recently, but nothing definite. sian gwenllian am: As we know, of course, the work with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs has ended, and I know you weren't the Minister who initiated this process, but what exactly has gone wrong? What are these issues that have come to light that have made you suspend that? It's very frustrating for us, as a committee, who scrutinised that extensively and raised a lot of concerns about that. And a lot of time has been spent talking about this funding Bill, and money\u2014\u00a31 million, I understand\u2014has been wasted, if you like, unnecessarily. So, what exactly has gone wrong? Why aren't you discussing these things with HMRC? julie morgan am:  sian gwenllian am: Yes. sian gwenllian am: Yes, but for your transparency around your particular\u00a0view that it needs to be more flexible and expanded upon and, therefore, going down the HMRC route was\u2014 julie morgan am: It would have restricted us a lot. So, it was a principle decision rather than any sort of technical matters to do with the Welsh language standards. But I'm really understanding more now that, really, what it's about is that you want to have a more flexible, and expand on the offer and that this would curtail\u2014going through HMRC would put limits on that. julie morgan am: That is one of the reasons, but there were issues about the Welsh language, which we can go into in detail, if you'd like. They would be able to process things bilingually, and I think that was probably told to the committee when we looked at the HMRC. But, in terms of the Welsh language standards that the Minister has to use, there would be some difficulties in them doing it. sian gwenllian am: But would you say that your main change came about because you wanted to be more flexible rather than any difficulties\u2014 julie morgan am: One of the major reasons, I think\u2014 sian gwenllian am: Okay. Those technical reasons probably do end up being quite important\u2014 sian gwenllian am: But the committee was told by the previous Minister that HMRC wouldn't have any problem at all with delivering according to the Welsh language standards. julie morgan am: Do you want to add something to this? nicola edwards: So, in terms of some of the technical issues we had, if you want to start with the bilingual provision and the Welsh language standards, HMRC do provide a bilingual service at the moment for their customers in line with their Welsh language scheme, and I think we can all appreciate that schemes are quite different from the requirements of the standards. And there were some issues when we got into the detail of the standards that the Welsh Ministers are required to deliver to that caused some concerns in terms of how HMRC were going to do it, particularly in terms of the multiple IT systems that go into building up the childcare services. So, for example, there are a number of what are called 'special characters' in the Welsh alphabet, such as the to bach, for example. sian gwenllian am: Yes, well, with due respect, the to bach has always been there\u2014 nicola edwards: Oh, yes, I completely agree. Unfortunately, however\u2014 sian gwenllian am: \u2014and HMRC would have been able to tell you, really early on, you would have thought, that it was\u2014. I don't really want to go into it, because I think we've got to the crux of why HMRC was dropped. I think it's been dropped because Julie feels that the offer needs to be more flexible, and I can understand why you would say that. julie morgan am: If we bring in training and education, for example, we wouldn't be able to do that via the HMRC, it would have to be done by the local authorities. Any people of immigration status of no resource from public funds, that would have to be done via the local authorities. , there are other things with using HMRC\u2014if any changes were made with the English offer, for example, because this would be delivered via HMRC with the English offer, that would cause difficulties for the Welsh offer. jo-anne daniels: The only thing I'd add is that\u2014and, again, I think the Minister has referred to this\u2014the costs that HMRC presented us with at the end of the discovery phase were significantly higher than the costs that had initially been outlined and that we outlined to the committee in the regulatory impact assessment. So, our conclusion is that we can deliver a cheaper system and a system that has the flexibility that the Deputy Minister has referred to by working with local authorities rather than HMRC. So, there is an important issue around value for money as well and making sure that the investment that we're making into developing the national system is one that\u2014that, in a sense, that investment stays in Wales. So, obviously, the money that we're paying over to HMRC to run the system would be supporting HMRC and their employees wherever they may be based, many of them not based in Wales; investment in local authorities to administer the system means that we're retaining more of that investment here. sian gwenllian am: Well, I congratulate you on persuading local government and WLGA to change their minds, because they actually told this committee that they favoured the HMRC option\u2014and this is only going back a few months\u2014because it will remove\u2014and this is quoting them\u2014 'it will remove the administrative burden of receiving applications and checking eligibility from local authorities'\u2014 blah, blah, blah, blah.\u00a0So, they've obviously changed their minds as well, which is, you know\u2014. I congratulate you on that, but it does present us as a committee with a little bit of a problem, really, because, if we're told one thing a few months ago and then we're told something completely different today, you know, evidence\u2014we have to go on evidence that we've heard, and the evidence has changed now. julie morgan am: I think, during the period since it was discussed on the committee, the work with the HMRC has helped highlight to us where we needed to go. So, I think we did learn a lot and it certainly has helped show to us where we think is the best place to go. I would like to pay tribute to the local authorities, because they've been great partners in this and they're very positive about moving forward keeping the work. And there's also a feeling that, because they are so much closer to the local public than HMRC is, they're able to build up links with families and help with some of these difficult issues. Because I'm sure many of you may have had individual cases\u2014I certainly have\u2014where there's been quite a lot of complexity about helping people fill in the forms and look at their eligibility. And thanks to the HMRC, because we've had nothing but a very positive relationship with them. How much is it actually going to cost to change this system from being a temporary arrangement with local authorities to a permanent one? And how much more is it going to cost for the more flexible system that you have in mind? They're not going to do this for nothing. How much extra are you giving them, and will they use it for this? How are you ensuring it's used for this? jo-anne daniels: So, at the moment, local\u2014. jo-anne daniels: So, part of the reason for using 10 is to try to ensure that we build economies of scale and that we have a more efficient operation.\u00a0Those authorities that undertake that function are given a specific grant in order to do that. suzy davies am: Could you give us an idea of the price tag? jo-anne daniels: At the moment, it's about \u00a32.5 million. jo-anne daniels: So that, as I said, is a ring-fenced sum that they use to administer the offer. We are now starting the detailed work to define the new system requirements so that we will have a single application process across Wales, moving forward. As part of that work, we'll need to consider the detailed costings, but our initial estimate suggests that it would be less than the cost proposed by HMRC. suzy davies am: Okay, when those costings are worked up, perhaps we could have a note comparing the two figures. sian gwenllian am: If it became a universal offer, would those costs reduce? Would there be so much bureaucracy involved in checking eligibility and stuff if every child was open to the offer? jo-anne daniels: So, clearly, if every child is eligible, then a large part of the process falls away in terms of the need to verify income and so on. For example, with the foundation phase, which is universally available, there is an application process and there is an administrative function that sits alongside that. At this point in time, I couldn't give you any indication of\u2014 sian gwenllian am: But it would be substantially less, wouldn't it, because they wouldn't have to do all these eligibility checks and all those things? nicola edwards: They wouldn't have to do the eligibility checks, but they would still have to make payments to the childcare providers and make sure they were paying for the right number of hours in respect of each child. So, parents would still need to tell them where their child was going, and there would still need to be some work alongside that. Si\u00e2n, do you want to ask about the Welsh language? sian gwenllian am: I think we've\u2014. lynne neagle am: Really\u2014? sian gwenllian am: I don't think that that was the real reason why the change happened. lynne neagle am: Nevertheless, the committee was given very concrete assurances that the Welsh language side of this was going to be covered off. Have you got anything that you want to add on that? Obviously, for us as a committee, we believe what we're told when we are given assurances. So, that's quite concerning for us, really, that that suddenly then became an issue, when both HMRC and the Minister at the time told us that this wasn't going to be a problem. There's a difference between a bilingual service in the context of what HMRC understood that to be, in the context of their scheme, and the very detail of the standards when they got into their IT systems. lynne neagle am: Shouldn't that have been something that was worked out at the beginning? nicola edwards: Possibly, but they did need to do quite detailed work, not just into their own IT systems, but the feed-in systems from the Home Office, the Department for Work and Pensions and the Post Office as well, to understand the full complexity of how the standards would comply across all of that. It was just some of the specific details of the requirements placed on the Welsh Ministers, because it is the Welsh Ministers' standards that they would need to deliver against that they were struggling with. lynne neagle am: I think that the committee would feel that that should have been bottomed out at the beginning, really. lynne neagle am: Okay, just before we move on to Flying Start, can I just ask: the Minister mentioned a longer term review of the childcare offer. Are you able to give us any indication of when that will report, please? julie morgan am: Would we have any idea? nicola edwards: We haven't set out a definitive timescale on that as of yet because we've been focusing very much on getting the review in terms of training, education and on the cusp of returning to work up and running. Can I just begin by asking you how you respond to the assertion that children from the most disadvantaged backgrounds do better in a mixed socioeconomic environment than in a targeted environment? julie morgan am: I think that's what Flying Start does, isn't it? Yes, I would have thought that was likely. suzy davies am: Well, the reason I'm asking you that, of course, is because this committee has suggested, perhaps, changes to the outreach system to target more disadvantaged children, and not necessarily capture people who happen to be in a geographic area. julie morgan am: So, you're saying that you feel that a universal offer in certain areas is not advantageous to\u2014 suzy davies am: Well, I'm asking you, really. If it's the case that we're only going after disadvantaged children, which would take very precise targeting\u2014 julie morgan am: I'm not only going after disadvantaged children. The reason we've targeted Flying Start is because it would be great if we had enough money to have Flying Start throughout the whole of Wales, but we just don't have that sort of money. Because just in response to this committee's 2018 report, you did say that: 'defined geographical targeting of Flying Start support will be considered as part of the Welsh Government\u2019s work on the Early Years system.' That suggests you still have geographic targeting in mind. So, if you're looking at a very mixed source of economic experience for children, what are the geographic boundaries you're considering? julie morgan am: At the moment, Flying Start can go beyond the geographical boundaries, with the extension\u2014 suzy davies am: With limits, yes. I think they can use 10 per cent of their income to go beyond the geographical boundaries, and many of them have done that. But, obviously, there are four elements to Flying Start, and only those geographical areas have got the four elements, but there could be the opportunity of extending some of that beyond the Flying Start geographical areas. suzy davies am: I accept what you say about the current system\u2014 julie morgan am: I believe it's much more\u2014. But, obviously, there are huge cost implications for that\u2014unless you're giving us some insight into what you're going to say next week, I don't know. But actually, defining anything geographically, which now seems to be fairly arbitrary, because it's not targeted purely at disadvantaged children\u2014on what basis are we choosing the geographic areas we are choosing at the moment? julie morgan am: Well, they're chosen then because of the benefit take-up in those particular areas. So, it's reaching some of the poorest children, but not all of the poorest children, but it's reaching the poorest children in a way that is not stigmatising, and where the services are open to everybody, and I think that's very important. Well, having established that, we have fairly recent research here that a third of children living in poverty in Wales are already falling behind at the age of five\u2014that suggests that two thirds of them aren't, but it's still a very worrying statistic. Not all children live in Flying Start areas; how are you going to reach that third who, even at such an early age, are already falling behind? How many of them are in Flying Start areas? julie morgan am: I think the actual number of children in poverty, the most disadvantaged that we reach through the Flying Start areas\u2014I think it's about 46 per cent. Is that\u2014? Do you know the actual percentage? suzy davies am: It's about a quarter of total children are in there, but\u2014 jo-anne daniels: So, just to give you a few of the numbers, there are just over 36,000 children benefiting from Flying Start services. And because of the nature of the benefit take-up data, and because we don't assess eligibility within a Flying Start area, we can't be absolutely certain how many children within a Flying Start area are actually in poverty. So, it's an estimate, and it's a range, and the range is that around 45 per cent of children in Flying Start areas would be in poverty.FootnoteLink suzy davies am: Well, that's interesting. I would have expected it to be much higher than that, particularly if the geographic areas had been targeted on benefit claims, effectively. Are you disappointed that the proportion is\u2014basically, 55 per cent of those children aren't living in poverty. That's what you're saying, isn't it? jo-anne daniels: Well, I'd offer two observations. One: the nature of poverty in Wales is actually, generally, more dispersed than perhaps sometimes is appreciated. Yes, we have very concentrated areas of\u2014 suzy davies am: Well, actually, we do appreciate it, which is why we're asking this question. Sorry, I've lost my train of thought now, in terms of the second\u2014oh, sorry: whether you're in or out of poverty is, in one sense, very black/white. But in reality of course\u2014in terms of the income definition, it's very black/white. But, of course, there will be a large number of people who are just above, but also families who move in and out, so it's quite a transient population in some senses, in terms of people having incomes that aren't stable, people having jobs that go with that that aren't stable. So, at any one point in time, you're only sort of capturing a snapshot of what's happening. I mentioned a third of children living in poverty had fallen behind at five; by the age of 14, half that number is still falling behind, so something has happened between that third and that half to improve the life chances of those individual children or young people. Is that attributable to Flying Start? Can you say that candidly? Or is it a happy coincidence, where there could be some causation, but we can\u2019t prove it? jo-anne daniels: We certainly think that Flying Start is making a positive impact, both on the point at which children go to school, and then subsequently. And I think as the committee knows, we\u2019ve been working with the SAIL\u2014secure anonymised information linkage\u2014and the databank there to look at how we can do longitudinal studies to track children\u2019s progress, to look at the extent to which outcomes are effected by Flying Start interventions. suzy davies am: We probably don't have time for this level of detail today, but half of those children are still behind at the age of 14. So, I'd be curious to know if there's any immediate plans to help them catch up or make sure that their successors don't fall into the same position, the same trap. Have you got anything high level that you can mention at this stage? julie morgan am: Just in terms of what we\u2019re thinking of doing with Flying Start\u2014. The key thing about Flying Start is the collaborative way that it works with the health visitors and all the speech and language therapists and childcare, and we\u2019re looking at ways of trying to get some of those elements to reach a wider group. And as I said, we talked about earlier the eight earlier years transformation pathfinders that we talked about in the local authorities\u2014we talked about that earlier\u2014so, that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to look at Flying Start and how we can try to make it more accessible to more children. We do want to make it available to more children, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at. And you'll have to wait to see what we come up with\u2014 suzy davies am: No, no\u2014we'll ask you more about that in due course. Actually, that job would be an awful lot easier if you knew how many children within Flying Start areas were taking up all four elements. Why don't you know that? Why is that data not collected? julie morgan am: Do we know why? jo-anne daniels: So, the approach that we\u2019ve taken to evaluation in Flying Start\u2014. The committee will have seen the various evaluation reports that have been published, and I know that you\u2019re familiar with the work that, as I say, we\u2019ve been doing with SAIL. We\u2019re currently focusing on individual data collection, and through that we want to be able to report on levels of engagement, but also outcomes for children. We hope to be able to extend that, and we hope to be able to provide more evidence about the interventions and the impact that they then achieve. Because, to be honest, I would want to know if a child\u2019s chances have improved primarily because they\u2019re getting good-quality childcare or primarily because their parents are taking up parenting courses. There\u2019s got to be some indication somewhere in here about which of these four elements is making the greatest difference. It will always be quite difficult to definitively provide answers to that, because many parents will be taking these things up in combination. So, disentangling which has had the effect is, obviously, quite tricky\u2014in particular, all parents will be getting the enhanced health visiting. Not every parent will take up parenting support, not every child will need speech and language help, so\u2014 suzy davies am: And that's why we need to know who is. jo-anne daniels: Disentangling what's helped and what hasn't I think will always be quite a difficult thing to do. Just on the final point from me\u2014yes, 88 per cent of Flying Start's childcare offers were taken up, but we've had some local authorities where the take-up has dropped dramatically. I think Denbighshire was down a fair bit, wasn't it, and Ceredigion, I think, had had a poor take-up. Have you got any indication why? I'm thinking of Denbighshire particularly, where there is a tradition\u2014taking up third-party childcare is cultural there, whereas in Ceredigion,\u00a0for example, there are far fewer places available in the first place and less of a tradition of children taking up childcare. But what's happened in Denbighshire? julie morgan am: I think there are a number of different reasons why parents do decide not to use a facility, and, obviously, that always exists, but each local authority has a Flying Start account manager in place to support them in the delivery of the programme and the account management activities, and there are formal account meetings that look at this sort of thing once a year\u2014 suzy davies am: So, what have they told you? julie morgan am: \u2014and these meetings will take place in November 2019. That's when the specific delivery issues will be discussed in depth, so that's when we'll find out what has happened and why there may have been a drop. suzy davies am: Can I just ask about the timing of that? Because if you already know that there's a 6 per cent drop, why will it take the best part of a year to\u2014well, November's only next month, to be fair, now, but why will it take that length of time to establish why there's a drop? You'd have thought if you'd seen a trend like that\u2014 julie morgan am: Obviously, they meet at certain times and they will assess what's happened. suzy davies am: Okay, but we'll get a note on that, is it? It's just that they knew this six months ago. julie morgan am: In November, we'll have more information about this, so we can let you have information about that. And then finally from me, Chair, if I may, Flying Start beneficiaries\u2014it's got a specific explanation of what a Flying Start beneficiary is, but I think, particularly in view of the evidence we've heard on this committee about parental support in connection with the removal of the defence of reasonable chastisement, for example, this committee is very concerned about what's out there in terms of parental support. Eighteen per cent of Flying Start beneficiaries have parents attending the informal parenting courses; that's 18 per cent, that's not very high. Any idea about what you might be able to do to encourage take-up or is that very locally decided? lynne neagle am: If I can add to that, obviously, somebody only has to attend one course\u2014we've got no way of knowing whether parents are completing the whole of a course, really. julie morgan am: Obviously, the offer is there for parents to take up the parenting courses, and there are four elements to Flying Start, and maybe some of the parents don't feel that they want to or need to. I don't think we've got any more evidence on that for take-up\u2014 suzy davies am: Well, the reach of this is going to be important, because we need the reassurance on the back of the legislation that is going through at the moment. jo-anne daniels: Parenting courses are, of course, one aspect of parenting support, but not the only one, and they'll be appropriate for a lot of parents, but for some not. What all parents do get at an enhanced level in Flying Start is the support of the health visitor, so the health visitor is, in effect, providing a significant amount of support for parenting. Now, that can be practical things like weaning or potty training et cetera, but, actually, it's also about managing a child's behaviour, managing how a parent develops that bonding and that attachment with their child. So, the role of the health visitor in supporting a parent to be a parent is absolutely critical, and every parent in Flying Start areas will be getting that enhanced level of support. Of course, it's not just in Flying Start areas now, because with the Healthy Child Wales programme, the universal programme of health visiting visits, we have a much more consistent and standardised set of visits and engagements with parents that cover a lot of these areas. In addition, I'd also add that when parents use the childcare in Flying Start, or childcare generally outside of Flying Start areas, there is often a lot of working between the childcare setting and the parent over parenting\u2014again, managing a child's behaviour, managing any issues that the childcare worker thinks are emerging in terms of whether it's eating or, again, toileting. So, parenting courses are important, but it's really essential that we see those in the broader context of the different ways in which lots of professionals interact with parents, providing them with advice, guidance and support, and actually what works for parents in terms of how they take on board some of that advice and that help. Sometimes a formal course is quite off-putting for parents, but the sort of quiet word, the top tips, the advice that a friendly professional gives can be very, very impactful. It does raise, unfortunately, another question about whether a health visitor in those circumstances might find themselves in a difficult position if they're dealing with a parent who has smacked a child, but we'll leave that for Stage 3. Well, can I thank the Minister and the officials for attending this morning? As usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you again for your attendance. There's just one today: the letter from the WLGA regarding the Childcare Funding (Wales) Act 2019 in response to our letter asking about the change in approach. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you.<doc-sep>We've received apologies for absence from Julie Morgan, and I'm very pleased to welcome David Rees, who is substituting for her today. Item 2 this morning, then, is a session with the Minister for Children and Social Care on the Welsh Government's childcare offer. So, I'm very pleased to welcome Huw Irranca-Davies, Minister for Children and Social Care, also Jo-Anne Daniels, director for communities and tackling poverty, and Owain Lloyd, deputy director for childcare, play and early years. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions from Members, and the first questions come from Hefin David. How has it gone in the early implementer local authority areas, and is it something of a mixed bag? huw irranca-davies am: It's gone well, but I'm glad we've done it through this process of early implementer, actually piloting it, because we're learning lessons as we go along. It's been encouraging, to the extent that we're at the point where we're expanding\u2014we've made announcements on expanding some of the early implementer areas so we can learn more lessons. But, in terms of what we're learning, one is the bureaucracy around the current approach that we're taking, because it's being done on the\u00a0seven early implementers. So, we're asking parents to come in, provide their wage slips, provide the birth certificates, and so on. You're dealing sometimes with parents and families with complex issues and complex backgrounds, so it's difficult. In one case, it's a whole authority, but it's only one\u2014that's in Blaenau Gwent. So, we're having parents, generally, who are outside the areas entirely saying, 'Why haven't we got this yet? Can we please get into it?', which is encouraging. But the other thing we're having is people who are within pilot authorities, where it doesn't extend to the whole authority, saying, 'Well, hold on now, we think we qualify for something under universal care, we think we qualify for something on tax credits. Why don't we qualify for this?' 'Well, you're not in the pilot area.' So, we're learning about these things, but the biggest one, I have to say, is the administrative burden, and I think that's interesting in how we take this forward for a wider roll-out. hefin david am: What is the administrative burden? What specifically is that? huw irranca-davies am: It is that sheer burden on each local authority, and each pilot area, to administer a scheme where we are asking parents to prove eligibility, to bring in documents to prove their eligibility, to make adjustments as it goes forward based on what their changing work patterns are, what their salary slips say. So, yesterday, when we made the statement following the announcement of the introduction of the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill, we made clear that our preferred option, as put within that framework Bill, is actually to build on, and to learn from the lessons as well, the model of the HM Revenue and Customs type of model, where you actually have\u2014and this, by the way, is supported by local authority providers out there\u2014one system that is a centralised system, where there is clarity, that is handled, that has elements of information sharing between Government departments, such as the Department for Work and Pensions, and so on, so that the work is done for the parents, and the work is done for the local authorities; much cleaner, much simpler. hefin david am: How confident are you that you can achieve that by 2020? huw irranca-davies am: We are very confident. But, as I say, I'm more confident in the fact that we're actually piloting it, and phasing this in, because I think we've learned from some of the experiences elsewhere, including just over the border in England, where they have a different version of a childcare offer, but they've gone for it in a big-bang approach. And it has led to technical issues, it's led to volume issues, where their anticipation of how many people would buy into it was overwhelmed by the numbers who actually then came forward for it, and the complexity, I have to say, of individual family situations, whereas what we are doing, Hefin, is taking this forward very, very carefully. Each roll-out, each expansion that we're doing of the pilot is not\u2014and I know this has caused some people to come back and say, 'Why can't we all have it now?' It's because we're only rolling out\u00a0to areas where we now need to learn a lesson about whether it's rurality or, as it will be within\u00a0densely urban areas,\u00a0where the cost might be slightly higher, and that's allowing us to have the confidence that we'll have it. We've expanded the whole offer across Gwynedd\u2014the whole of Gwynedd, Anglesey and Caerphilly. Flintshire now have a cross-authority offer.\u00a0Rhondda Cynon Taf is anticipating doing this by September. Swansea is planning to do it, they tell us, in due course\u2014in short order\u2014as well. So, we\u00a0have the confidence now that, with that learning going on from different pilot areas, we'll have the full roll-out by 2020. hefin david am: Is it true to say that, in the early adopter areas, the intensity of demand for\u00a0the services is not spread evenly across? huw irranca-davies am: Absolutely. hefin david am: And why is that? Is that going to cause a problem across Wales? huw irranca-davies am: No, it won't cause a problem. If we were doing this tomorrow, it would cause a problem, but what we're learning is that\u00a0there are some economic issues and then there are some cultural issues. We're not finding a problem here\u00a0with capacity,\u00a0whether it's in English language provision or whether it's in Welsh language provision,\u00a0whether it's in children with complex needs, we're not finding\u00a0that as an issue. But what we are finding is, for example, one of\u00a0the well-known ones\u2014and I've spoken\u00a0about\u00a0this before\u2014is that, in some of the south Wales Valleys constituencies, there is a\u00a0family tradition of doing childcare\u00a0within\u00a0the families. Grandparents, aunts, uncles and so on provide free, unregistered,\u00a0unlicensed childcare of a sort. So, some of the aspects are cultural, but what we're also doing\u00a0alongside this, whilst looking at the capacity and looking at how we\u00a0learnt from the pilot roll-out, is that communication with\u00a0parents and providers and local authorities as well. It's about communicating what the offer is, how\u00a0simple it is to get invovled in this and\u00a0where they go to, and, critically, I think, how we do that national roll-out would be important as well. hefin david am: So, given the point you've made about\u00a0grandparents and family, wouldn't it be sensible, then, to offer a subsidy to\u00a0grandparents to provide this kind of care? huw irranca-davies am: Unregistered grandparents? hefin david am: Well, through some kind of analysis of that. huw irranca-davies am: Well, we don't think so and there are good reasons behind this. hefin david am: Is it because you say that they wouldn't be registered as\u00a0carers for their own family member? huw irranca-davies am: Yes, but there's a deeper reason behind that\u00a0registration as well. The childcare offer isn't only to just provide childcare; it's the wider aspects\u00a0that come\u00a0with this.\u00a0This childcare offer ties into\u00a0the foundation years offer. There's an element of education linked to the\u00a0childcare offer\u2014there's that 10\u00a0hours of the early education foundation years as well. So, there's an issue here with quality, about socialisation and how children learn in an environment, as opposed to purely\u2014as great as all our grandparents and aunts and uncles are\u2014simply child-minding. So, the\u00a0focus of this scheme is very much on registered\u00a0licensed providers, which could be, by the way\u2014because we do have them, and we're discussing this at the moment internally and with the\u00a0Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years\u00a0and others\u2014grandparents\u00a0who are actually registered and\u00a0inspected by the care inspectorate? We're having\u00a0those discussions. hefin david am: How many of them are there? huw irranca-davies am: We don't think there is a huge number, but we're trying to\u00a0bottom this out at the moment. We haven't got\u00a0the exact number, but we don't think they are huge numbers, but there are, in our constituencies, registered, licensed, inspected grandparents who look after other\u00a0people's children in a little group of four or five or six or seven, but also their own grandchildren. Now that, I would say to you\u2014and I know that Darren raised this on the floor yesterday as well\u2014is markedly different in the nature of it, because it's\u00a0registered and licensed, than simply informal grandparents or aunts or uncles. I say that as well\u00a0because we also get\u00a0people who will say to us, 'I don't\u00a0want to be paid for looking after my grandchildren; I look after my grandchildren\u00a0because I look after them'. hefin david am: And what about the view, given that you said that\u00a0capacity\u00a0wasn't an issue, of the National Day Nurseries\u00a0Association, which says that Wales has the most fragile childcare sector in Great Britain? huw irranca-davies am: I don't agree we have the most fragile, but the childcare offer gives us an\u00a0opportunity to make it more\u00a0resilient and more robust. We know from the\u00a0early piloting, and as we roll it out, that there is the immense diversity\u00a0within the childcare sector, and we're talking about\u00a0everything from those very small terraced homes that have been licensed and registered to take six or seven children,\u00a0to large, complex environments that perhaps\u00a0are on maintained premises within school premises, provided by a voluntary or third sector organisation. So, there's immense complexity and we know that that differs across Wales, and we also know there's immense regional variation in the scale and the type of childcare offer. What the roll-out allows us to do, backed by \u00a360 million of capital money behind it, in terms of capital development of childcare facilities, backed by a 10-year workforce development plan for childcare\u2014and bear in mind this is bolted in as part of our foundational economy approach as well\u2014that means, by 2020, we get to the point where we're putting the money into the capital development but also to the workforce development, because\u00a0in some areas we're finding it's not to do with lack of provision and facilities, it's to do with lack of staff. hefin david am: That's fair enough, but is it realistic to think that there's going to be capacity growth in the next two to three years to deliver the product? Is that realistic to think that that foundational sector can provide that level of staffing? huw irranca-davies am: Yes, I think it is, absolutely, because, again, what we're finding is we've got several things going on at once in terms of how we monitor and assess the development\u00a0of this roll-out. One is the work that we're doing on the ground with the phased roll-out, so we're literally learning live time, and I have pretty much weekly or fortnightly updates on how things are going, but also there is a termly update as well. We've also commissioned additional work from\u00a0Arad to look at this first phase of the roll-out that we've done to see what that tells us as well. But the feedback that we're getting from the childcare providers themselves, on the basis that we're now identifying where either the gaps in the workforce or the physical facilities are, is that, 'Yes, we can do this', because\u00a0we're putting the money in, we have the strategy for the workforce development, and it's not going to be the same in all parts of Wales. It's not as if what we're saying is, 'Here's what we're going to do all of a sudden\u2014flick a switch and we have a universality of the same type of provision everywhere.' So, let me give you one key example. Alongside this, alongside\u00a0the \u00a360 million capital fund, alongside\u00a0the workforce development, we've also identified a separate\u00a0strain of money into cylch meithrin. We're specifically putting money into developing that, and, in fact, the first one of those will be, from\u00a0that new tranche of money, opening up, I think, in September. They anticipate, as part of our big strategy with Welsh language development, we'll have an additional 40 of those by\u2014 jo-anne daniels: Thirty. huw irranca-davies am: It's an additional 30 by 2020, and an additional doubling of that in the 10 years\u00a0after that.\u00a0We can't take this for granted, Hefin. hefin david am: The last thing from me: the \u00a34.50 single national rate\u2014is there a danger that we might be creating a kind of EasyJet-style nursery provision where you get the basics but the wealthier parents are going to be able to pay for better care within those settings because\u00a0of the add-ons? huw irranca-davies am: We really mulled over this a lot and discussed it, I have to say, not only internally but with childcare providers out there and with parents as well and with local authorities. The\u00a0first thing to say is the \u00a34.50 rate that we've set has been welcomed, and it's been welcomed because it's unlike the much more complex offer that's in England, where there's a variable rate and there are lots of determining factors on it and it's added complexity\u00a0and confusion. hefin david am: Can I just ask there, it's been welcomed perhaps\u00a0in Blaenau Gwent, but has it been equally welcomed in Cardiff? huw irranca-davies am: No, because\u00a0we haven't rolled it out in Cardiff yet, and that is a salient point. But will it be, then? huw irranca-davies am: Yes, it will be. Some of the more expensive areas like Cardiff and Newport are knocking on our door saying, 'Please can we have this offer?', and we are keen to give it to them. But, as I say\u2014 hefin david am: But do you anticipate\u00a0a capacity\u00a0problem with the \u00a34.50 in those areas, compared to, say, the Cynon valley? huw irranca-davies am: We can't anticipate\u00a0it yet,\u00a0Hefin, but that's exactly the reason\u00a0for going into that area and then assessing how it works. We're reasonably assured by the feedback that we're having that the \u00a34.50 might work as a universal amount. But if we learn, when we roll it out in Cardiff and Newport, that there needs to be some variation, we can look at that, because we're not doing a big-bang approach. So, that is part of why we will move to roll it out within Cardiff and Newport and other more expensive areas and learn from it, but at the moment, I have to say, the \u00a34.50 amount has been welcomed\u2014it's appropriate. You touched on the other aspect, though, of the wider aspects of beyond the \u00a34.50, because\u00a0the \u00a34.50 doesn't cover everything.\u00a0The \u00a34.50 is a contribution\u00a0towards the wraparound childcare element but it doesn't cover\u2014and we agonised over this\u2014the issues of things like transport out on trips or food or snacks and things like this. Now, we did agonise a number of things that brought us to the conclusion where we are. I have to say, this hasn't been ivory-tower stuff; it's been in discussion with the providers but also parents.\u00a0One: parents are quite used to\u2014with childcare settings and play care settings and so on\u2014the idea that providers are quite different. Some providers charge a fee that does everything in one; others provide simply the childcare element but they tell the parents\u2014and I'm used to this as a parent myself, although mine are older now\u2014'Mr Irranca-Davies, when you sign on, just to be aware, if we do take your kids down to St Fagans, there's going to be a little bit of a charge for that' and so on. hefin david am: That's fair enough, but it would be the lowest-income working families who would be most unduly affected by that, because the higher income families would be able to afford those add-ons, the lower income ones won't. Isn't that a concern? huw irranca-davies am: If money was absolutely no object, then I think you'd be looking at quite a different offer, but it has to be affordable within what we've got as well. The fact that parents, including those who are on lower incomes, are used to currently discriminating between providers, not only with childcare settings but also within school settings as well, where very often schools now will say, 'We're doing something extra'\u2014 hefin david am: That may be the case, but it's not fair, is it? huw irranca-davies am: In a pure argument about equity, and if funding was no object and if the burdens of austerity were released and we were told we had money\u2014'You can do what you want'\u2014I think you'd be looking at a very different approach. But within what we have, I think this works very, very well indeed, because it's very transparent for parents who are used to making these decisions. But\u00a0within those additional hours, you may be with a local provider in the middle of Powys that actually says, \"Within that we provide everything\"; you may be with a provider that says, \"Well, actually, we do a whistles and bells thing and we take them out on trips, but it's up to you if you want to come, and here's the additional cost\u2014\".' Parents are used to making that decision and realistically, in terms of what we can do with this offer, this is actually\u2014the arguments around this have been well rehearsed both with providers and with parents and we're not getting any concerns that this is going to unnecessarily\u00a0disadvantage. In a total fairness argument, would you make it universal and with no additional charges? Well, possibly you would. But we work within the realistic\u2014 hefin david am: Or have a lower top-end income limit. huw irranca-davies am: Depending on how the Bill progresses in the main Chamber and when it goes through committee, there's that flexibility built into the Bill that those things can be looked at over time and adjusted. For the moment, I think there is an attraction, in terms of the upper limit, of saying: one\u2014'Let's try not to add additional complexity, let's go with a scheme that's already working its way through the system, which is, if you like, what they're doing in England, and not add additional complexity. But, secondly, there is an appeal to universality, curiously, in saying to all parents\u2014and I say this regardless of political hues across the committee here\u2014there's an attraction when you say, 'Let's make an offer focused on working parents as it is', as universal to those working parents as possible, and avoid the administrative costs of saying, 'Well, let's take the upper limit down to \u00a380 or \u00a360 or \u00a355.' There's always the question of how much additional cost is incurred in actually doing that tweak of complexity. darren millar am: Just to ask, the labour market costs are changing, aren't they? You've got the national living wage increasing\u2014[Inaudible.]\u2014that's going to have a bearing, isn't it, on the affordability of this project in terms of the childcare offer and the suitability of the \u00a34.50 per hour regime? By the time it's fully rolled out, of course, that \u00a34.50 rate is going to be a number of years old, for example. Do you have plans to review that? Where is it headed? Because it's certainly not going to be enough in the future. huw irranca-davies am: It depends how far in the future you're looking. I have to say, the feedback that we're having at the moment from organisations like the Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years and from the National Day Nurseries Association Wales and others is that this is the right rate and it's suitable not only today but for the foreseeable\u00a0future of rolling this out. darren millar am: But they've raised concerns about the national living\u00a0wage implications, haven't they, as well? huw irranca-davies am: Of course, and I think it's incumbent on us as well to not\u2014 darren millar am: So, it's not fair to say that they haven't raised concerns about the rate. huw irranca-davies am: Yes, but what they're not arguing for at the moment is for this rate to be raised. darren millar am: But they have suggested that in meetings\u2014 huw irranca-davies am: That in future\u2014 darren millar am: Absolutely. huw irranca-davies am: Well, of course, in future, any Minister, any committee, will want to come back and look at\u2014is the hourly rate, as one element of the scheme, appropriate to the current financial challenges for the sector, and not least, by the way, as we try not only to develop the workforce, but to develop the career pathways through this as well? And I think that's the right discussion to be had, live time, as this is taken forward. But at this moment in time, we're not getting people saying within this part of the roll-out that we need to adjust this amount. darren millar am: So, have you forecasted\u00a0for any adjustment in the rate going forward in terms of affordability of the project? Because\u00a0you've still got this \u00a3100 million price tag on it, haven't you? huw irranca-davies am: Similar to the point that was raised with Hefin about Cardiff and Newport, if we identify that the rate is not appropriate, if it's\u2014. I don't think anybody's going to come back to us and say that it's too little. But do bear in mind that it's above where the average England rate is, even though there's this complex variability\u00a0within the English\u00a0rate that has caused some confusion there, which is why the universal rate with us has been welcomed. If we find, as we pilot it, or if we find because\u00a0there are more expensive areas for it to be delivered in, there needs to be adjustment, then we'll be back in front of the committee arguing why that needs to be the case. darren millar am: But that won't put the project at risk in terms of its finances? huw irranca-davies am: No, no. We are still very confident, looking forward, on the best projections we have, fed by the live input that's coming in from the pilot, which will be fed again in the autumn\u2014the Arad\u00a0report coming forward\u2014that we have not only the capacity to actually deliver this\u2014challenging as this is, we have the capacity to deliver it\u2014but also that the funding that's available, on our best estimate\u2014the estimate we've stood by, that broad ball park of that \u00a3100 million figure\u2014it's deliverable within that. And if it changes, I'll have to be sitting down with my boss, Vaughan Gething, and with Mark Drakeford, to argue the case on it. But that rate, combined with the other elements of this childcare offer\u2014there is sufficient there allocated to actually deliver the whole roll-out. mark reckless am: Minister, as a parent who's been researching childcare options, it's obvious to me that in Cardiff, and to a degree in Newport and Monmouthshire, costs are substantially higher than this, and I haven't\u00a0been able to find anywhere that has a six-hour day for \u00a327, which is implied by your rate. Isn't it the case that rents and wages are higher and therefore you're going to need a higher rate to make it work? Isn't that already obvious? Why are you postponing coming back and looking at this until some point in the future? huw irranca-davies am: Chair, my biggest fear is a parent who's actually involved in this area already, but, having been one myself\u2014. Mark, you may be right, that's exactly why we're piloting it and that's why when we pilot in Cardiff and Newport, we know we have lessons to learn over the affordability\u00a0and the \u00a34.50 per hour rate. mark reckless am: But you're not piloting it in any of the high-cost areas that I've referred to. mark reckless am: When are you starting? huw irranca-davies am: Cardiff and Newport\u2014September. The reason we've gone for the other areas first, by the way\u2014please take this back to any authorities affected\u2014is simply because we've done deep dives into areas that vary from very rural areas in mid Wales, areas in north Wales, areas around Welsh language provision, areas in deep valleys, understanding\u00a0the cultural and the economic impacts. So, we've held back a little bit from going into what we know is an obvious challenge within the more expensive areas of provision. But it's coming, it's imminent, and we'll learn the lessons from it. And do you know, you may be right? And if you are right, that it's more expensive, and we need a higher rate within\u00a0those areas, then we're going to have to come back and discuss it with the committee. lynne neagle am: Just before I bring David in on the issue that Hefin raised about the chargeable\u00a0items, your paper says that providers can charge up to \u00a37.50 a day for food, snacks, transport and consumables such as nappies. Now, that's \u00a337.50 a week, which is a lot of money for parents, and I just wondered if you wanted to comment on that figure?\u00a0But also, do you think there's a risk\u00a0that providers who maybe aren't charging at the moment may start charging because of any new pressures that arise because of this scheme? huw irranca-davies am: I think they're the right areas to flag up, and if I thought that was going to happen I'd be concerned as we take this forward and design this scheme. I think part of the evaluation from Arad will also show us that\u2014whether or not, within the pilot areas that we are already in, which are quite diverse, that is happening. We're only one term into learning the lessons, by the way, but I would want to make sure that we design a scheme where we are not heaping on disadvantage or where there was exploitation of disadvantaged families. I think also, by the way, that providers know that this is a collaborative effort to do this here. It's not in their interests, I have to say, as the umbrella bodies or individual providers, to see this as some way that they can unduly rake in additional income from this on the backs of poorer families. But especially, I have to say, the early evaluation that we've seen already suggests that the greatest proportion of those who are taking advantage of this scheme in the early parts\u2014in the early evaluation\u2014are those who are below the average working wage within in Wales. That's by far the greatest number of people who are doing it, and we don't want them then being priced out because of add-ons. So, there has to be some pragmatism, I have to say, and some open partnership working here with the sector, and we do have that. john griffiths am: I want to come back to the \u00a34.50 rate, but in terms of working with the sector, briefly, if I might, Chair, I just wonder, Huw, in terms of that \u00a34.50 figure and understanding the sector in Wales, to what extent are we talking about a market rate and to what extent are we talking about the increase in demand that will come from the scheme and how that relates to economies of scale and capacity? Is it purely a market rate or is there a conversation with the sector in terms of the benefits that will come from this scheme and how they should be recognised in terms of setting the rate? huw irranca-davies am: This has been a very open dialogue with the sector around affordability, around the hourly rate and around what might happen in future as well. This is not a pure hard data-driven analysis that says, 'Here we've calculated everything and this is the rate that will satisfy it', because we recognise that there's great diversity in provision out there, and we also recognise that things will change over time. I think we need to, as we take this scheme forward and look at the full roll-out, continue in that very open dialogue with the sector not about what is purely a market-driven amount but actually what is also affordable for the Welsh Government within the constraints that we have. Just to flag up one issue, it's right that we're focusing on those elements that aren't included within it, to some extent as well, and the effect of that on more disadvantaged families, but that has to be balanced with the pocket of affordability for this scheme as well. Let me give you a clear illustration: some of our calculations have suggested that if we included free food within this offer as well, it would add something like in the region of 50p to that \u00a34.50 rate. That would have, at this moment, impacts on the affordability of this and the roll-out of it. I would need to be going back to my seniors and arguing the case now, okay? But, it's that open dialogue with the sector that says, 'There's one thing about what you're saying you demand as a market; there's another thing about what we're saying that we have affordability from taxpayers' money to actually put into this'. They also understand, John, that as well as an enabling policy\u2014and we're seeing the evidence, by the way; I can cite it\u2014of individuals who are being helped into more flexible options to get back into work, increase their hours and so on, this is also about building capacity in a fundamental foundation sector that is in every single part of Wales. The sector itself understands that if we boost the childcare offer in all its diversity, including, by the way, not just the independent sector but social enterprises and third-sector organisations, such as exist in Neath and elsewhere that I was involved\u00a0in 20 or 30-odd years ago setting up\u2014that has an economic impact that goes beyond that immediate family who are receiving the provision to the wider communities as well. So, it's an open dialogue on what the rate should be rather than purely, 'Our wonks have crunched the numbers and we've come up with \u00a34.50.' lynne neagle am: David, you had a question on the pilots. Before I go to my question, I want to come back to Mark Reckless's question and the answer you gave. I got the impression that if there is a need to look at different rates because of the higher-end areas, you may therefore have different sets of rates and not a universal rate. Is that also on the cards? huw irranca-davies am: David, it's possible. I think our preference would be, I have to say, to stick with the universal rate, because we know it's\u2014. One of the defining hallmarks of the way that we've taken this scheme forward is learning in live time as we pilot and expand the pilots into different areas and different types of provision. If we learn lessons from that that suggest we need to come back and look at a differential in more-expensive-to-provide areas, then we'll have to look at that, but there might be other ways of splicing it. We might find, Mark, we might find, David, that we go in and when everything is tallied up, the \u00a34.50 per hour works in supporting provision there. If I can now remind you: I don't remember the word 'affordability' coming in the manifesto pledge of the Government. In the situation regarding Welsh-medium, you answered that a little bit earlier, but I have concerns about capacity. There's clearly a need to get more staff, because in your own paper you say that the report in 2016 said you do not have the childcare capacity in Wales at the moment. Do you believe that you can actually deliver the workforce to meet that capacity, first of all through the English medium, but secondly through the Welsh medium as well? Because there's a clear need to look at it. Do you actually think you've got that workforce capacity set up before this is fully rolled out? huw irranca-davies am: I hope, Chair, you'll appreciate that in our submission to you we've been very open. We have confidence that we can do this if everybody is working together across the sector, across the local authorities. Let me talk broadly about capacity, first of all, including English and Welsh-medium provision for children with complex needs, provision for children with disabilities\u2014all of this. The work that we're doing to increase both capacity in terms of trained staff and qualified staff: we have the 10-year plan that I mentioned, which has already been announced. So, we're identifying not only broadly at a national level where we need to develop those qualifications, but also at a regional, geographic level as well, and that's being taken forward. As you can see from what I've said before, it's rolling out progressively, but with all 22 authorities we're working with them on their childcare sufficiency assessments to identify where their shortages are. david rees am: What have the pilot programmes actually shown you about this, and how are you going to move this forward? huw irranca-davies am: Well, it's precisely that. So, within the pilot areas, we have a greater depth of analysis now of where both the workforce and the physical provisions are. Whether those are maintained or non-maintained or third sector or school facilities or whatever, we've got a much deeper granulation of identifying where that is, and we're working, then, with those authorities, with the capital moneys that we've allocated to this and the workforce development, and with local colleges, to develop the workforce and the physical constraints. But we're also doing that with the other 22, with all the 22 authorities as well, in anticipation of the wider roll-out. And by the way, it's not only the Cardiffs and the Newports; it's all the other ones where there isn't full roll-out. We're engaged with them deeply at the moment with that analysis on their childcare sufficiency assessments, both in terms of workforce, but also physical provision. It doesn't mean, by the way, that we exclude the third sector or social enterprise approach, or the independent sector, but co-location could be key to the roll-out of this in the right areas where it can be done, because then we avoid any\u00a0fracture between the education hours and the childcare hours: the physical transportation of children from one location to another. So, we're engaged with the 22 authorities on that: where could that be developed, who would be the providers that would do it and do they have the workforce to scale up to do it? If not, how do they talk to local colleges to do that? So, we're doing that at the moment. I mentioned we've put the \u00a31 million additional funding into the meithrin over the next two years, targeting\u00a040 new Welsh-medium groups by 2021, which pretty much coincides with the full roll-out of this. So, all of those things, David, give us a confidence that we're going to be in the right place. david rees am: But in particular, take the Welsh language\u2014I understand Gwynedd, and I won't ask another question on that for obvious reasons at this point in time\u2014but in some of the other areas where you've piloted, you've gone partial in some areas. When there's Welsh language education, and the three to five-year-olds go to schools, they go from all areas of the council, basically. They don't actually go necessarily from the local area, and therefore you're getting a different picture. Have you been able to assess the actual impact, properly, upon the Welsh-medium side of things? Because, for example, my grandchildren will go from my area, which may not be in one of the considerations, to a school that may be in that consideration, and that happens regularly. We know that historically we've got, across the country, a shortage of Welsh-language childcare provision\u2014meithrin and so on\u2014but we have not only a strategy in place, but the fact that we've got local authorities now doing their own assessments within their area, across the piste of childcare, but also in terms of Welsh language, that means then that we can start filling those gaps with the money we've put to it, and that includes in all parts of Wales, including those areas within south Wales and others that are less deep in their tradition of speaking Welsh over recent history, anyway, but where the demand for it is massive. So, local authorities are tasked with doing their own assessments of childcare sufficiency for this childcare offer. They're identifying the gaps, David, and we will work with them and with providers to fill those gaps, and that includes with the umbrella organisations for Welsh language childcare provision. And this does mean, Chair, that it will be different, as it currently is in different areas: the type of provision, where the provision is located. This offer won't happen unless the provision is there for those children with complex needs, children with disabilities, Welsh language provision, as well as more generic provision as well, but it will be diverse in its provision around areas. lynne neagle am: I do want to move on now, John, so if I can come back to your question. llyr gruffydd am: I would like to pick up on the last point, if I may. A question from me though, the wider question, is: how do we mainstream Welsh medium into childcare? Because, clearly, leaving it to meithrin is one way of doing it, but there's a lot of existing infrastructure out there that we need to upskill in terms of the provision of Welsh medium. So, it's not a question as such, but I'm sure you recognise that\u2014that there is a challenge there. Because if we are to get to where we want to get to, it isn't about growing meithrin, or Mudiad Ysgolion Meithrin; it's about mainstreaming Welsh-medium provision within the wider sector. So, looking at the manifesto commitment that was made in 2016, clearly the main or the principal aim of this policy is around removing some of the barriers to secure employment for parents, albeit with very positive outcomes for the children themselves, and we don't ignore or neglect that at any cost. But I'm just wondering: how would you then reconcile that with the findings of the Public Policy Institute for Wales report, which I mentioned to you yesterday, which was commissioned by the Government to look at policy options in this context, which concluded that there will be no 'substantial impacts on net income, poverty or work behaviour for families with children' and that 'the impact on work participation and work hours for mothers in families with a child of target age is extremely small'? huw irranca-davies am: Well, the first thing I would say is that what we're learning from the pilots is that it is having real-life impacts on parents, including in disadvantaged families, and we're having this fed back from real-life situations on the ground, where parents are making different choices in the areas where it's being piloted. So, the types of different choices they're making could be to expand the number of hours that they're in work, because they now have a choice, they're not constrained to certain hours or whatever, they have a wider choice, with a wider number of providers, and they're making that decision and they're able to expand their hours. Some, by the way, Llyr,\u00a0I have to say\u2014and, again, these are real-life situations\u2014are saying, 'What we're doing is not expanding our hours, but, because of the increased provision of childcare and the increased offer, we are now able to actually spend more time with our children, because we're adjusting our hours of work, based on the childcare provision offer.'\u00a0That in itself, I have to say, is a worthy aim. But I would say what we found out, in real-life examples\u2014I'm not saying that in direct contrast to what that paper was saying\u2014 llyr gruffydd am: That's what I was going to ask; it sounds as if you're saying they were wrong. huw irranca-davies am: But what we have is the advantage of this phased roll-out, where we are learning, live time, and I think the Arad report in October\u2014we're hoping to see the final report in October\u2014will help put some flesh on this as well. It is already having an effect: the majority of parents who are taking advantage of this are actually in those groups that are below the average wage, they are making positive choices to get into this offer and to either expand, take more hours, adjust their own lifestyles around it or more. I can cite to you examples, because I've asked my own officials on this, of families who tell us they're saving up to \u00a3250 a week on the basis of this offer within the pilot areas, who've increased their hours of employment, who've changed their working patterns to suit their work life, but also to suit their families. llyr gruffydd am: So, in effect, you are saying that the PPIW\u00a0report got it wrong, basically. huw irranca-davies am: No, I'm not saying that they got it wrong and it's wholly wrong, but it is interesting, within that report, that it did identify that there were a range of factors here that play upon this. It's not only the childcare; it is the transport, it's the training and education, it's the employment support and all of those. And we agree with that, but we do think, and what we're seeing, live time, at the moment\u2014maybe at some point, somebody else will produce a report beyond the Arad\u00a0report in October that will say, 'Well, actually, the way this is designed, that they've done it in Wales, is having a material effect on those families, particularly the most disadvantaged families.' llyr gruffydd am: But you're asking us to support a Bill here, albeit a framework Bill, to achieve a policy aim where you're giving us anecdotal evidence that it's having an impact, contrary to research that's previously been done, albeit with promises that, maybe, an evaluation sometime in the autumn might tell us a different story. huw irranca-davies am: We know, and we are constantly told\u2014I'm sure this is commonplace in constituency surgeries, as well\u2014by parents who say that the biggest mitigating factor for them, actually, either going into work at an earlier opportunity or expanding their hours is purely the cost of childcare in front of them. I think our further reports, both Arad and as we go forward with the pilots, will substantiate this more. It'll go beyond the anecdotal, it will show that parents are having an enhanced opportunity to balance their work life, to make better choices, either in terms of expanding the number of hours they're working and increasing their disposable income within their families, or actually making it simply better for them in their family situation, where they don't currently have that offer. So, I get the fact that we have one report out there, but it's one report. It's a report, and we're not dismissing it entirely, but what we are saying is: we are now working with real-life piloting of an offer, and we are seeing the benefits coming through. As we roll this out, we'll be back in front of this committee saying, 'Well, this is now what we're finding. We can go beyond the real-life stories that I'm relating to you now, and we can say, \"Well, here's some hard data that goes with this, as well.\"' llyr gruffydd am: Okay. You reference in your paper, as well, another report, which is the\u00a0Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u00a0report, 'Starting Strong 2017', and it highlights countries that have, maybe, the most similar childcare offer to what's being proposed here in Wales. I'm just wondering what assessment you've made of those similarities, because, clearly, there'll be different economic contexts in different countries and different levels of public expenditure, et cetera. huw irranca-davies am: We haven't done really detailed analysis of comparisons with other countries far from Wales, but we will be doing work\u00a0that will be doing some benchmarking against, where we can find similar models, where appropriate\u2014do some appropriate benchmarking. What we have been doing is looking at what's been happening across the border in England and trying to learn from the lessons there, and also the offer in Scotland as well, which are both close to hand. But we will do some work, Llyr, around benchmarking against good comparative international examples, where appropriate. llyr gruffydd am: Yes, there we are, because one of my concerns was that the focus in a number of the countries in the OECD report are for nought to three-year-olds, whereas, of course, the policy focus here is for a slightly older age group. huw irranca-davies am: Yes, and I fully get that, but again, and I know it can be said, 'Well, this is an example' but it's real-life examples. We are having people who are telling us that they're now making the choice to go to work earlier because\u00a0this is extended to three-year-olds, but they would have delayed. There is a direct outcome\u00a0there if this childcare offer enables somebody to say, 'Well, I'm going to go a year earlier back into work and bring income into the family.' llyr gruffydd am: Okay. So, moving on, then, to the impact on the child and this whole question around school readiness, of course, which is an important one to address. Clearly, one of the main outcomes of this policy will be the academic performance of children, hopefully, later on in life. I want to come back to this point that the Children's Commissioner for Wales and others have raised: the concern that, actually, the most disadvantaged\u2014those from workless households\u2014are being excluded from this policy. Isn't there therefore a risk that they'll be left even further behind? huw irranca-davies am: I've had long, detailed and positive discussions with the children's commissioner on this, and I know the children's commissioner would want a more universal offer, but I make two points on that: one is, that was not what the commitment in the manifesto was, and it's not the offer that's being taken forward now. It is a different thing, a universal offer, and there\u00a0are issues around that with complexity, and also affordability. But it isn't the offer that we took forward into Government; this is what we're taking forward. I'd say two significant things on it: one is, this doesn't stand alone purely as 30 hours of childcare. Within this, there are 10 hours of the foundation years, educational input, which is there for everybody. But before that, particularly for those disadvantaged families, before we even get to that stage, you have schemes such as Flying Start, and I know this committee has looked in detail at Flying Start and has said that it would like to see it rolled out everywhere. If I had all the money under the sun, I would really do that, Chair; I would really do it. huw irranca-davies am: Yes, but the fact that Flying Start, we know, is leading to those outcomes where those children, in quite challenged circumstances very often, are more ready to step up to the foundation year, are more ready, then, to step through into mainstream education in later years\u2014those things tie together. So, there are the 10 hours of education provision that sits here for every family, by the way, within this offer, let alone the childcare. That doesn't mean that everybody's excluded, but it does mean, yes, that this offer is focused on working parents. In fact, it does overlap with other offers that other political parties were taking forward into the last election, which was focusing on how we support the biggest thing that we often have in our constituency mailbags, which is, 'I can't afford to go back to work because I can't afford the childcare. Don't tell me to go back to work, I can't afford it.' llyr gruffydd am: The majority of disadvantaged children don't live in Flying Start areas, do they? huw irranca-davies am: Yes, indeed. llyr gruffydd am: So, there's a missing cohort there that can't access one or the other, and the school readiness gap is growing, and, really, are we focusing our resources in the right place here? huw irranca-davies am: Well, yes, in terms of this scheme, but it doesn't sit alone as this scheme\u2014it's the wider plethora of, I have to say, progressive and advanced initiatives that we have in Wales that take different\u00a0forms. It's not only Flying Start that provides that other support for parents, and readiness not only for the parents and for their children, but also the support into work. So, if, for example, you look at the Parents, Childcare and Employment programme, which is separate from this, there is support there for every parent in terms of helping them get supported into work from disadvantaged families. If you look at the support for the children, we've got the 10 hours that sits within the sphere of the education, but we've also got all the other family intervention programmes that help with socialisation, education and so on and so forth. If you look at this solely on its own and say, 'Well, there is nothing else there;\u00a0the rest of Wales is a desert and there's no support for parents, for getting parents back into work or for\u00a0those parents who are not seeking to go back into work but also need the support and for their children in education',\u00a0I'd be worried. But, actually, this fits as part of the jigsaw that we have in Wales, where I think we are well ahead of the other nations. Yes, we could do more, and I always say, Llyr; I always say, Chair, that if I had\u2014I don't have a chequebook at all, because it's not in my gift\u2014if I had a blank cheque I'd do a lot more, but we don't. But what we can do is get the right schemes in place, and if this helps drive more choices for working parents, including, by the way\u2014.\u00a0There are niceties within this as well; it doesn't have to be that both parents are working. darren millar am: I am surprised by the answer there,\u00a0particularly given that one of the ambitions of the Government is to close this attainment gap later in life when schoolchildren get to their examinations, when they're 16 years old. Yet this appears to be driving a bigger wedge in terms of development, which could, of course, lead to a perverse outcome later on in life, but I don't want to ask you about that. If I can just very quickly ask you: has consideration been given to making free childcare available to parents where they're in 16 hours or more of education each week? So, they may not be entering the labour market, but, of course, one of those barriers to them getting back into the labour market could well be their education, so what arrangements are in place there? huw irranca-davies am: Darren, we have considered it, and we haven't included it within the scheme because this is designed to enable parents to go into work, not into training to enable them to get into work. There are other forms of support available for parents in terms of college and so on and so forth, but it's not this scheme. darren millar am: But it's not prescribed support, is it? You know, it's not universally available to people who might be wanting to get back into the labour market over that barrier. You must have done some costings, then, if you've considered it, and you must have tried to identify numbers. huw irranca-davies am: We haven't\u2014 darren millar am: So, you haven't considered it that much, have you? huw irranca-davies am: We have actually considered\u2014. We consider it from the point of, 'What is this scheme set up to do?' It's very clear. But, very specifically, when you say you've considered it, what you mean is you thought about it but you've not costed it, you've not identified the numbers that might be involved\u2014 huw irranca-davies am: Absolutely, absolutely. darren millar am: And therefore you've not considered whether it might be affordable in addition to the policy objective that this is trying to meet. huw irranca-davies am: No, Darren, you're right: we haven't considered affordability because we've considered it on first principles to do with what this offer is trying to do. It doesn't fit within the offer so, as such, why would we do the costings? darren millar am: Perhaps I can frame my question in another way. Are you prepared to consider it if you're able to identify the numbers and potential cost? huw irranca-davies am: Ah, right, okay.\u00a0We'd be interested in your thoughts as a committee, but it doesn't actually fit within the first principles of what the\u00a0scheme is designed to do. Darren, can I just pick up on your point, in case you misinterpreted what I was saying to Llyr?\u00a0I drew attention in my answer to Llyr\u00a0to schemes such as the PaCE scheme.\u00a0In Gwynedd,\u00a0one of our pilot areas, they\u00a0are combining the Team Around the Family with this childcare offer. It is not the case, as you've suggested then, that there is somehow more disadvantage being heaped on other families. What this does is tie in in those pilot areas with the existing provision, and that's\u00a0the way we want to see it work. So, I wouldn't want you to be under any misapprehension that this makes conditions worse for families. Those families who have a registered carer in them where one parent works, and those families who have somebody on incapacity benefit will qualify for the scheme.\u00a0All families will qualify for the 10 hours\u00a0of education. In Gwynedd, they're wrapping the Team Around the Family with this offer\u2014 darren millar am: But on the other hand, Minister, you've also suggested that this will accelerate child development for those kids who are able to access it, and yet not all kids will be able to access it, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds. huw irranca-davies am: But all children can access the 10 hours, and they can access Flying Start\u2014 darren millar am: But 10 hours is very different to 30 hours, is it not? huw irranca-davies am: Yes, but they can access Flying Start or they can access the Team Around the Family\u2014 darren millar am: If they're in a Flying Start area. huw irranca-davies am: \u2014or they can be in a children's zone area or they can\u2014 darren millar am: If they're in those areas. lynne neagle am: Right, I've got John and then David, and the questions and answers are going to have to be brief, please. In terms of child development and how this fits with wider\u00a0Welsh Government strategy, Huw,\u00a0I'd be interested in what you'd have to say about the quality of childcare.\u00a0We're talking a lot about quantity, but obviously we want to up quality, and that's recognised by Welsh Government. I just wonder how that sits within the \u00a34.50, because there could be pressures in the opposite direction there, and some tension between wanting to up the qualifications and quality of workforce whilst keeping affordability in place. huw irranca-davies am: John, you're absolutely right, and two things on that: I visited one of the facilities in the Valleys the other day that was taking this forward\u2014a very good independent sector-run childcare provision, with Welsh language and English language running alongside each other, and I asked the point about the integration, curiously, but\u00a0what they were doing was\u2014. Their standard of staff was an exemplar of what we'd want to see: not only very well-qualified childcare staff who were qualified within not simply the child-minding but the wider child development aspects\u2014. So, it was hard to differentiate, in some ways, what was happening there from what would be happening in a child development educational surrounding, and including the nutritional stuff and all of that. Now, that is the model we need to see, and the \u00a34.50 seems to work, at the moment, for that. But the quality, I think, is key, and that's why we're focused very much on registered inspected providers, as opposed to every Tom, Dick and Harriet. john griffiths am: If we want to increase salary levels, though, which I think is a necessary part of this picture of improving quality, then obviously that might impact on the \u00a34.50 rate. huw irranca-davies am: Yes, indeed, and we are cognisant\u2014. It's interesting that we focus on whether the \u00a34.50 is affordable, but the \u00a34.50\u2014you know, we're having an interesting discussion internally about how that \u00a34.50 offer per hour sits alongside others, such as the foundation phase offer, and it's more generous. So, I think it's: how do we align, as time goes by, the child development aspects of the whole early years stuff? Now, we're doing some fascinating work that I think I've referred to on this committee before about aligning the early years development entirely. Now, this is an evolving piece of work, but I think the childcare offer should ultimately fit within that. How do you make sure that every offer that is Government-funded works on child development? It's not simply childcare. mark reckless am: In terms of child development and not accentuating disadvantage, another area where this may apply is the kids who are born in the summer term, compared to those who are born in Michaelmas. There's a lot of evidence to suggest that they start with a disadvantage at school and often don't make that up, even as they go through school. What is the rationale for providing the older children with five terms of this, compared to three terms for the younger children who already have the relative disadvantage? huw irranca-davies am: I'm looking to my colleagues here and\u2014 jo-anne daniels: Well, the criteria for eligibility for the offer are the term after the child's third birthday, which is equivalent to the eligibility criteria for the foundation phase early education offer. Clearly, then, the number of terms that a child is able to, or parents are able to, access the childcare offer will be influenced by when the child is born,\u00a0but I think you may be referring to a sort of parallel question, which is about whether\u2014. There have been questions raised about whether children who are summer-born should, in fact, start school in the term after they turn four, or whether actually they should be allowed the flexibility to start school at a later age, which I know is something that has been tested in England, and there is some mixed evidence about school starting age and the birth month of children. That's the compulsory school\u2014 jo-anne daniels: Well, that's the legal position, but, obviously, in practice, most children will start school in the term after they're four. mark reckless am: So, given the disadvantage we know that the younger children born in the summer have, relative to the older ones, why accentuate that by giving the older kids five terms of this project, which you tell us will have such positive effects on their child development, but the summer kids only get three? Doesn't\u00a0that make the situation worse? jo-anne daniels: I'm not 100 per cent sure I understand the question. So, children will stop being in receipt\u00a0of the childcare offer once they become eligible for a full-time school place, and most children will become eligible for a full-time school place in the term after their fourth birthday. mark reckless am: But the older kids become eligible for this five terms before they start school, where the younger kids, who're already disadvantaged, become eligible for it only three terms before, accentuating the problem, surely. Could more thought be given to this issue? huw irranca-davies am: We'll take that away. Minister, you got, or Welsh Government, really, got the Public Policy Institute for Wales to study this proposed policy and they concluded that it would have no substantial impacts on net income, poverty or work behaviour for families with children, and that the impact on work participation and work hours for mothers and families with a child of target age is extremely small. What do you say to that? huw irranca-davies am: Well, Mark, I can only refer to what\u00a0I said earlier. Our real-life evidence that is accumulating now is showing us examples of where people are making savings and increasing disposable income\u2014as I mentioned earlier, up to \u00a3250 per week within some poorer households; so, real-life examples\u2014but also where it's enabling them to make much better choices about when they work because there's more childcare offer available, or, alternatively, to work their childcare provision and their working hours around being able to spend more time with their children, which they currently can't do. lynne neagle am: And I don't want to go back over Llyr's questions. They said if you had a work requirement, as you do, it would cost \u00a361 million a year on their numbers, substantially less than you're saying, and then they said it would cost \u00a3144 million without a work requirement. Now, that implies to me that 57 per cent of the parents wouldn't be working and would continue not working even if there is this available with a work requirement. , are those numbers really credible from PPIW? huw irranca-davies am: It's not quite comparing like with like. Just to draw your attention, Mark, and the committee's attention to that the PPIW analysis was looking at a provision of 38 weeks. And the fact that we are having parents already saying to us that their ability to actually extend that into the 48 weeks\u2014beyond the term time and so on\u2014carries advantages that are not picked up in that report. mark reckless am: And what is your early assessment of the income levels of families who are finding this offer most attractive? huw irranca-davies am: I think, from recollection, we're one term in, so we're one term into the assessment, and I mentioned earlier that the majority of parents are below the average income of \u00a326,000 in Wales\u2014 it's around about 60 per cent of families are those. It's disproportionately towards those below the average income, and many of them amongst the most disadvantaged families are opting in to this offer where it is being offered. mark reckless am: And what consideration have you given to integrating this Welsh Government offer with the UK Government\u00a0offer of tax-free childcare that's applicable across the UK? huw irranca-davies am: Well, that offer, as you rightly say, is available across the UK and still is. The fact that it's more integrated within their scheme within England\u2014the tax offer is more integrated\u2014has caused them some problems in complexity and in the administration of this and the digital platforms that they've had. That offer is still available in Wales and it might well be that parents who opt in to that say, 'Well, we do want to buy additional hours beyond the 30 hours', but this 30 hours is there for every\u2014 mark reckless am: I wonder, Minister, whether what you're doing, in a very good way, to promote your project\u2014people will see that as the childcare offer and, at least in my experience, very few parents are aware of the tax-free childcare on a UK basis. That's absolutely one of the lessons we've learnt from even this early stage of the early implementers, because there are elements of a childcare offer within the tax offer, within universal credit, within working tax credit. So, one of the lessons that we've learnt from the Talk Childcare communication strategy alongside this is the importance of communicating to parents and providers who the parents go to what is best for them to access, how they access it easily, and we'll learn more as these pilots roll by. mark reckless am: So, as you go into the Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs criteria\u2014you have a \u00a3100,000 cap, as well as the \u00a36,000 minimum wage cap, and you're getting HMRC to say whether people are eligible, which requires them to set up that account with HMRC\u2014will you assure this committee that you will make sure that parents who are doing that are aware of the UK tax-free childcare offer, and that their providers also are? Because we've been looking, say, at the \u00a37.50 extra per day, but, if someone's eligible for this offer, they should also be eligible for the UK tax-free childcare offer and have set up the account to do that. So, will you make sure that those parents know to pay their provider out of tax-free funds, rather than paying them the fully taxed amounts, which might otherwise happen? huw irranca-davies am: Yes, absolutely. owain lloyd: Yes, just to say, as I understand how things currently work with the English offer and TFC, when a parent applies, that automatically happens in terms of, on the one hand, they're given a 'yes' or 'no' in terms of their eligibility for the 30-hours offer in England, but they will also be told in terms of the parental account that's set up under TFC. So, that is integrated in the offer, and we'll be looking to do the same in terms of the Welsh offer. But, obviously, what we're not looking at doing in terms of the 30-hours offer is the setting up of the parental account to make the payment; the payment currently is very much between local government and the provider directly, rather than the TFC model, where the parent pays the provider. Can I thank the Minister and the officials for attending? You are, of course, back with us on 16 May for Stage 1 of the Bill, so we will look forward to seeing you then. So, if Members are content, I'd suggest that we note all of them in a block, if that's okay. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Okay"

        "Query": "What were the Project Manager's thoughts on the conceptual design, symbol and colour, special button design for game players, shape, appearance, and buttons of the new remote control during the discussion?",
        "Summary": "The group discussed pricing the remote control at 25 euros, which was considered relatively high compared to existing options. To avoid losing potential consumers, the Project Manager decided to position the product as a universal remote control with unique features to attract more consumers and meet profit expectations. User Interface suggested designing symbols and colors for the remote, but the Project Manager emphasized the need to incorporate their own logo and color scheme. Marketing proposed self-intuitive buttons for game players, with Industrial Designer preferring a game control keypad over separate buttons. The Project Manager agreed, as keypads were common and user-friendly, allowing for easier navigation and joystick functionality. The shape of the remote was debated, with Marketing and User Interface suggesting an iPod square or a more innovative round shape. The Project Manager opted for a round shape with rounded corners to promote innovation. The idea of a multifunctional remote control was met with concerns about size and complexity. To address this, a touch screen remote control was proposed as a feasible solution.",
        "Article": "And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly . industrial designer: project manager: user interface: industrial designer: Well , I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and  user interface:  . B did you send us an email about this ? project manager: not yet , user interface: industrial designer: project manager: but if you want user interface: Yeah , we we received an email about this  d designs . project manager: Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ? industrial designer: user interface: Ah it's Okay . marketing: I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . user interface: 'Kay , we can project manager: So there are so we have three user interface: So there are three kinds of designs , that's all . project manager: So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? Any any volunteer ? industrial designer: I think our  responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager . user interface: Are you using the you are doing the in industrial designer: Yeah I I'm I'm Well , maybe we have okay so I industrial design . It was a little confusion about my  project manager: user interface: Ah industrial designer: but it's alright . industrial designer: Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done project manager: industrial designer: and what are your ideas about the project manager: About the design or Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ? industrial designer: Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess . industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno I project manager: And of course it should not be very costly . industrial designer: Well I I think that Norman and I would think about  the technical points and  we should discuss it in the next meeting , or user interface: Need to collect information .  , what is most important in a in a remote control ? What is the most important function aspect ?  . project manager: You won't user interface: Or or you can say for example ,  I want  to list all the programme tonight . Y you know , instead of  remote control it's doing the some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . project manager: I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . user interface: No , because no , project manager: S user interface: it's not very a lot . industrial designer: I I think if you want t to choose  from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use  w  I dunno marketing: I'm a okay . marketing:  the main  function of remote control is to have something in the hand project manager: In the hand . marketing: If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog user interface: Yeah . marketing: if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . industrial designer: marketing:  we have some or something , different technology but project manager: This is it's user interface: Yeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that  there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea project manager: industrial designer: but I I think that technically it would be  a little bit   more tricky to to achieve this than just to user interface: No . They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . user interface: And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons . industrial designer: Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to  navigate  through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so project manager: This is good idea . Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? industrial designer: Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen user interface: Good idea . industrial designer: and just  with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f user interface: I think I think that will be revol revolutionary . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: Because all the T_V_  the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . So I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff user interface: Okay . project manager: So we have five minutes to user interface: Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . project manager: Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we industrial designer: user interface: Five minutes . marketing: And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of user interface: Okay . marketing: So , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark  some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . industrial designer: Oh right so user interface: Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: Be before before writing you can  sit and that says what we what we said user interface:  . So so the most functional des  the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . The user can choose w which one they want , right ? industrial designer: Yeah , by content or by channel , user interface: By content or by channel . user interface: Okay , so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content . industrial designer: I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so user interface: Okay . And  industrial designer: I think that's the the things to do user interface: The main thing . user interface: So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get  the funct this is the functional designer ? That's the first aspect . project manager: So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ? And we'll discuss the other other aspects <doc-sep>industrial designer: How are you today ? How was your business trip to Boston ? project manager:  well , actually I didn't go , didn't feel like it . user interface: You have the same message of  Windows cannot  marketing: user interface: sen oh stand-by . user interface: project manager:  I'm sure you've had a mail from our account manager about it .  Ruud is here as the Marketing Expert , Roo is here as the User Interface Designer and Sebastian is here  in the role of Industrial Designer . project manager:  we're going to do    a little tool training  for the tools we are going to use  during  the meetings we are going to have here .  then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan ,  and we will have a discussion .  is there any room for a little presentation ?  maybe during the discussion  section ? project manager: There is ? Yeah , there is . user interface: project manager:  okay , this new product we are are g are going to develop ,  it's a remote control , a television remote control . Those are kind of easy    goals ,  and I'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop .  we will discuss  later on more ideas about  how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things .  we are going to use a a pred a project method  during  this development ,  which consists of three different design stages .  the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design ,  all of these stages   mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then  meet to discuss our   the the the progressions , yes . project manager:  the first stage , the functional design  we are going to search for the user requirements , and we will  make a specific  specification of that .  the second is the technical functional design ,  what effect should the remote have ? Well in this case control t the the television I think .  to  presentate , to show us  a file you'll need to  place it in your project documents folder , which is on your desktop , at least it should be . project manager: sensors , so do not grab it here , but a lit more a little bit more to the  to the end .  you can insert a new  slide or or white-board   file  by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button . user interface: or should we only use it in the in the meetings ? project manager: Yeah , in the meetings , only in the meetings .  to  oh well , I'm I wrote down the documents  should be in the project documents folder if you want to  discuss it with us .  as a little training  I will ask Ruud first to draw   your own animal on a new slide  with  a different colour and a different line width than the one  now selected . marketing: project manager:  Roo , could you do the same please ? But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width . Well , it looked more than a bunny than a cat , but it works , industrial designer: Well , I'll give it a try . user interface: project manager: Okay , so  you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to .  user interface: industrial designer: marketing: project manager: we  we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold  , if there is market  interest ,  in in more than one country . And  the production costs should not be more than  twelve Euro fifty , so we should keep that in mind by  w w during the development ,  because  , well , those are important numbers . industrial designer: Yes ,  I have some technical  issues which I would like to present to you  before we start the discussion , because  there might be some  project manager: Limitations . I would like to think about  the implementation of  of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities . So if someone of you comes up with  ideas ,  I'll try to translate them in technical functions , but  there might be some impossibilities .  and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product . industrial designer: I have some  initial ideas about some things  which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming  discussion . user interface: And for a cell phone ? industrial designer: Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them . We're not  living in the  nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not  project manager: industrial designer: is not really  hot  technical stuff anymore . user interface: But Yeah , but the infrared , it's  , well , a little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that . user interface: But all the T_V_s are  equipped with infrared , so industrial designer: But it's cost-effective . user interface: Or you shou sh use a industrial designer: So marketing: user interface: you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote . So that's just my role , I'll just  give you  everybody some technical input , and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what  the product should be and how it should look , project manager: Yeah . project manager: Okay , so the the main por  the main points you are  telling us are focus on the inter  operability , industrial designer: Yes , project manager: and industrial designer: so one thing  one remote control should  control one or more  pieces of equipment , project manager: Okay , and and  industrial designer: and the way of communicating with these equipments .  there are other things like  how to make it trendy , which is I think   most  Ru  Ruud's  role . project manager: H how do you think the remote should  function for the user ? user interface: Well , I had a few  things in mind .  well , the interoperability , just like  Sebastian said ,  the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different   Yeah  , what is it , devices ? project manager: Yep . user interface:  so i i I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in  a store . user interface: It's not for  for  for  Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product , project manager: Okay , so we're we're going business to consumer , user interface: right ? project manager: not we're we're it's not a user interface: Yeah , I do I don't know that . industrial designer: We're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ? project manager: No . industrial designer: we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad  public , so it should fit to every device . project manager:  Ruud , y do you agree ? marketing: Yeah , I think I think they're right , yeah . user interface:  Well , the techni fu technical function  what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the T_V_ . user interface: Well , that's just the fu the technical function is pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task  as an  as an  device .  but furthermore industrial designer: And you you see  the buttons as a as a means of doing this ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Or are there any o other controls ? user interface: Yeah , or maybe you want a touch-screen or industrial designer: Are there only any other cont Well , user interface: But industrial designer: I I've seen these remote controls with  this little stick  which you can move forward , sidewords . And  it's very easy for a user to to switch user interface: They're very vu vulnerable . industrial designer: to to switch b  between  channels or  change  between tracks on a on a C_D_ , on on a chapters , you know , on a D_V_D_ player .  point at a T_V_ , I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_ , industrial designer: user interface: Yeah , just don't even point it , so in that case infrared should  maybe  be restriction to that . project manager:  industrial designer:  is that  are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ? So when you're not able to point at the device  the range is very limited . For T_V_ , you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T_V_ , so I don't think think the range should be a problem to that , industrial designer: user interface: but if you want to  get it working with a radio , and you're in outside your garden with just one  speaker , then maybe the range should be  industrial designer: project manager: Okay , gentlemen ,   just a reminder , we d we have five minutes left for this meeting industrial designer: Okay . user interface:  You should able to feel the buttons without  it mis  you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons , so it should be as user interface  for feeling should be  good to understand . user interface: And of course you don't always know where all buttons are , so it should be visible al  in dark too . user interface: So when it's dark project manager: user interface: Those are two really  user interface project manager:  I'll write down glow in the dark . industrial designer: Do do you project manager:  do you have anything already w  ab idea about how the market  will respond to the such a product ? Or what we should take  in account when developing such a product ? marketing:  I think most most things have already been said , like  control multiple devices . project manager: Because ? marketing:  well , he said about n abo what he said about pointing . Okay , Sebastian , did you have any other ideas ? industrial designer:  well yes , I had ,  about three minutes ago , project manager: user interface: industrial designer: but I've seem to forget them forgot them . industrial designer:   would it be nice for a user to have display on this  remote control , on which you can see functions ? Which makes it easier to operate it . Well , maybe I  but it it can be quite simple , industrial designer: I I don't know . project manager: Yeah , yeah , okay , because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product . project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: Well , that's more project manager: twelve Euro fifty , yeah . I think the the financial part of this project  implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product . project manager: So  maybe we could  for example  only light the buttons that are   applicable at that moment or user interface: But  Necessary , yeah . user interface: 'Cause I think Bluetooth  industrial designer: It's use  a lot of  project manager: Well does it ? user interface: Yeah , I know it from the cell phone .  industrial designer: Well , cell phones have  integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it's it seems to work  quite okay . user interface: But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day .  next meeting starts in thirty minutes and  , well , you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it <doc-sep>industrial designer: Is there any time for a cup of coffee ? user interface: We have a slight problem . project manager: Sorry ? industrial designer: Can I get a cup of coffee ? project manager:  no . project manager:  then  the three of you  prepared a presentation , I think ? Sebastian ? industrial designer: I think so too . user interface: industrial designer: project manager: Then we'll do your one   as la  the last .  the top goal of this m user interface: But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe . project manager:  the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group  and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind .  the new project requirements , first of all ,  we didn't speak about it , but we should not  support teletext in the remote ,  because our b  board  feels that  teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext .  the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not  f  feasible , it's not  w user interface: Yeah . project manager:   we we cannot make it because of the time to market  that we have to deal with . project manager:  the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than  forty , which is important for you ,  Ruud , and as well for  Roo .  then for Roo , as well  important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product .  the individual presentations , I th  Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ? user interface: Yeah , I'll start .  the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . user interface: Then I found  two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function  remote control with many possibilities , but  the lack of the feeling I already mentioned  in the previous  discussion . user interface: And the ease-of-use remote control with  the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . My personal preferences were ease of  the easy to use remote control , because  the user-friendliness and  it can be more trendy in in user design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not  in our design . But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is  the best  possi possibility for us . project manager: Okay , so marketing: project manager: the important thing here is user interface: And it's also i indeed   Ruud's  insight in the in the topic . project manager: Yeah , okay , w we will s we all  user interface: Just for  for user desi  user  friendliness I  should choose for the the ease of use remote control .  well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . user interface: industrial designer:  basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by  sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to  implement a picture here , user interface: Energies and  industrial designer: but it's hardly readable . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using  infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . It's almost every piece of equipment  every piece of  every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . And I think that's what we w user interface: The glow in the dark  concept  we discussed . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . industrial designer: and I think we should  we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . industrial designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared , because  otherwise our device cannot  communicate with  almost every T_V_ set . And  if we want to use  a rechargeable design or  a energy-save design , we should really implement them .  for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost  circuit board ,  because most of the production cost are are in this  part of the equipment . industrial designer: And  the money we save on using this we can use  for elaborate fancy lighting  techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . user interface: And what's the  industrial designer: I think our  users will really  will really like that . user interface: if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or industrial designer: No , they're p f  power friendly LEDs also . user interface: For the same costs , it's can be  in our industrial designer:  no , they're  they're a little bit more expensive , but by    making user interface: Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's  industrial designer: We can we can make its I think . project manager: Yeah , but but the question is whether  two or four buttons makes  m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to  include fancy lightning techniques , I guess . user interface: Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , marketing: true . Well , it's not one light , it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . project manager: Okay well , industrial designer: project manager: we ar we are very curio curious to what the market  will feel about such a product . marketing: But  since  the other part is  forty percent of the market , I  thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . The buttons to zap are used the about  fifteen hundred times , when  the power button is only used one time . So user interface: Yeah , well it should just have a design The perfect design for those only those buttons . Just one thing I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? industrial designer: Well marketing: Yeah , that's  a problem . project manager: Well industrial designer: Usually project manager: maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , user interface: It should be   project manager: like  turning on and off the the the lights . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a  kind of weird sound , and your  remote controls then start to beep . project manager: But  th user interface: But but T_V_s don't have all   buttons . marketing: And you project manager: Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home  user interface: But I believe you will have an marketing: Yeah , and usually industrial designer: We do not control the T_V_ set so well . marketing: And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button ,  you would have to walk to your T_V_ , industrial designer: Yes , m yes . S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , marketing: and it's project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so we should think about project manager: So what about the clapping technique ?  because you se user interface: I'm convinced  Sebastian will  find  one solution for us . marketing: And b project manager: Well , you see it a lot in in light  lightning   industrial designer: Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics  the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , project manager: Yeah , a peak . industrial designer: But there are many other sounds  which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . industrial designer: Yes , user interface: But we can have just   a home stat  f a base station next to the T_V_ . user interface: Well if you lost th industrial designer: Well , project manager: Well  industrial designer: is there not something f something more easily user interface: I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . user interface:  that's just  industrial designer: No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and  b  perform a a some kind of  . You do not want another device , which can be  everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . project manager: Yeah , m maybe  w we  we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . project manager:  maybe Sebastian should have  a detailed look later on and  come up with a solution , industrial designer: But  before I do that I w I want to warn you that  by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated project manager: And there are some implepe imp user interface: And do we even  prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning  function ? industrial designer: Well , I I think so , because  when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . user interface: It's a unique item  project manager: Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . project manager: and  I think  it's worth   looking and and probably more i interesting than  than the lights . user interface: And just about  the user interface , I came up with  an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . marketing: Well , t  we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function . project manager: Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players  and all kind of stuff . user interface: So industrial designer: we should save costs  by not implementing a lot of functions and  the money that we can save from that we should use for  having a nice design and  thinking about the user interface project manager: Yeah . Okay , industrial designer: and project manager: Ruud , how do you feel about that ?  do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to  a simple marketing:  well if we  include other  innovative functions  then they  might , project manager: user interface:  just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated ,  because it has many functions . industrial designer: Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very  friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but  nevertheless project manager: But but are we not in in the in the manual   if you have few buttons , no display ,    I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and  one button can  industrial designer: Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . project manager: But but how does how does the remote  report  r  give back to the user w in what state it is ? user interface: Yeah , I don't know yet . There's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . project manager: I know , but but if we use  like a stick , for example ,  industrial designer: W When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe  a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just  pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t  turned up the volume . marketing: And if you use that stick for volume control and channel  selection , you have the m two most important functions in one  button . user interface: But does it  I then should n just use  i instead of the stick ,  like many cell phones , just a round m well , project manager: Yeah , draw draw it on the board . Oh user interface: It's just an easy  way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . user interface: A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down project manager: Yeah , it can break down . marketing: And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it  attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . project manager: Okay , but w we still we're still in the question of    putting in advanced options .  we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , I think . user interface: Yes ? project manager: We need to  have the  the user function  the functions decided and   our target audience . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ?  which  incorporates all function available on the device ? project manager:  well , I do not want a full  it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want  the kind of functions , for example  th the most important are volume and  programme selecting . l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but user interface: Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to  two channels , when you have  something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can  change industrial designer: project manager: Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last  Mielsen . industrial designer: but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . project manager: And and do we want  the ten digits ? user interface: The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so . industrial designer: Well , are are you sure ? marketing: Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . industrial designer: but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think but you should  shou you should know that . industrial designer: Okay , user interface:  and I think the most industrial designer: I can imagine when project manager: I agree actually . user interface: Just elder elder people would would buy it , industrial designer: I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . marketing: Well user interface: but industrial designer: But if you're  a regular T_V_ user , and you just want  to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can  you can use  about ten buttons . industrial designer: Well , marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: but how how often do you watch all these channels ? marketing: and if if we And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . Don't you think ? project manager: Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the industrial designer: The design . marketing: Well project manager: You c you can d make them very fancy marketing: And project manager: by   Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . industrial designer: Okay , so you can experiment by  with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .  it might be expensive and  hard to implement , but it would be a solution  for project manager: Okay , speech . industrial designer: So  when you add  speech recognition to your remote control ,  it's very easy to change  the channel . industrial designer: So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . project manager:  If if we would  drop the ten digits industrial designer: But maybe when we  project manager: but keep the programme and the volume , industrial designer: It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find  find the remote control button  remote control function . industrial designer: There are some  hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . industrial designer: So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . project manager: But But but can we manage it bu  for the costs ? industrial designer: You have to do nothing for it . marketing: And  if we if we could inc  include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be  a big problem . marketing: 'Cause when project manager: Is a cradle very cheap ? industrial designer: It's Oh , it's very cheap .  I would like to hear  maybe maybe you all have th  things not  spoken about , yeah , but that are important .  are there other things about the market we should know ? marketing:  I think we dealt with the most important information . project manager: Sebastian ? industrial designer:  I just want to make a summary of all all things  spoken and  the different possibilities . So on the outside it looks easy , but  we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by  implementing  speech techniques ,  voice recognition , that these kinds of things .  there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement  fancy techniques , which  I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about  the the costs and  the things like  battery lifetime , energy saving . industrial designer:  another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons . If we just add   a chip which does the voice recognition ,  our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another project manager: Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board industrial designer: well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . user interface: But the cheaper the ch  the the chip or th what was it ? industrial designer: project manager: No , it's th industrial designer: The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . user interface: Well it then we should just  take a look at the costs and  especially for the voice recognition . project manager: I'm not sure how how we'll f  determine the costs , I will have a look at it . project manager:  I'm not sure how how that industrial designer: Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will  have a lo  look at it . project manager:  I'm don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out . project manager:  then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work ,  and I'm sure your personal coaches will  assist you with it . project manager: User Interface Designer ,  Roo , I would like to see the user interface c  concept . project manager: And  user interface:  the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis  decisions Sebastian makes . industrial designer: Well project manager: Well , i it should be easy , user interface: Well project manager: that's w w what we concluded . industrial designer: So we drop the voice recognition ? project manager: No no no , we didn't industrial designer: Or project manager: but it shouldn't be integrated industrial designer: Oh . project manager: yeah , it's of course it's user interface , but  i I was talking about really the design of the industrial designer: Okay "

        "Query": "What were the reasons for Marketing's disagreement with the Project Manager and Industrial Design regarding the technical functions, advanced techniques, and touch screen of the new remote control, considering the budget limitations?",
        "Summary": "The Project Manager recognized the importance of targeting customers below the age of forty, as they have specific needs that should be addressed. However, Marketing disagreed and suggested that the project should cater to a larger group of people, rather than just those under forty. The Industrial Design team proposed incorporating advanced techniques, such as a touchscreen, to make the remote control more unique. Despite the advantages of a touchscreen, such as making the remote control smaller and easier to use, Marketing rejected the idea due to budget constraints. In order to balance cost and functionality, the Project Manager suggested giving up voice recognition and keeping the touchscreen. However, Marketing's research showed that interviewees had a strong preference for voice recognition, even when they were not informed about the touchscreen. Therefore, Marketing insisted on keeping voice recognition to cater to popular demand. The Industrial Designer believed that it was impossible to create a universal remote control that could accommodate different TV brands, as each brand has its own remote control. However, Marketing believed that this issue could be solved by developing a universal remote control with a code.",
        "Article": "And  I want to introduce myself ,  my name is  Shrida Daseri and  I'm a project manager for this new project which we are going to discuss now . And what you're  drawing ? user interface:  sure my name is Agnes and I'm an user usability user interface designer . So thanks for coming for the meeting first of all , and  we have a long time , just twenty-five minutes to discuss about  this project and the the project initiation . First of all I want to ask  Mister Ed about your  marketing plan and your product plan and  marketing: Well I think that we'll see that throughout the day in how we're going to put this together as a marketing to to market the product . We'll have to see on a through discussion on where we're gonna go from here and from with this . project manager: - but  do you already have like a functional design or a technical design or marketing:  for the moment not yet . project manager: Oh for the moment not yet , okay , but  what's what's your  do you have some project plan , something with you or marketing: Good question . No , this is like I said that we have to be discussed between all of us and we'll go from there . Okay , so  by when you think you can  give me some kind of  project plan , okay , a discussion with  marketing: Certainly by the next meeting .  Okay , so there's any questions or  first of all about  this project ? industrial designer: What is the goal of the project ? project manager:  the goal of the project I think maybe I'll  hand out to the Ed , okay , so to explain  what is the project because he's in the sales and the accounting . marketing: industrial designer: marketing: I'm in the sales I'm supposed to explain them what to do . We have to define exactly what our product is , from  project manager: Yes , so can you explain  what exactly the product is ? marketing: From what I had in mind we're supposed to be marketing coffee , is that right ? project manager: Oh I think  , if I'm not wrong , we're making the remote control . I had a first part of mine was to make a remote control for a new f remote control for television , and afterward I had a discussion about coffee so project manager: Yes . marketing: Something  visual that has something that will will draw people to buy the product , project manager: marketing: because I think everybody's experienced with  remote controls , and some remote controls are are worth  throwing out the window .  th most of them ar I don't know we're have to come up with a new idea on how to make it a lot easier to use , project manager: marketing: 'cause a lot of times  spend  half a day through the instruction book trying to figure out how to use it . project manager: And  what abo  Christine , what about your  the industrial design plan ? Are you have a design already on this product or  you're still working on the design ? industrial designer:  no , I I have not begun working on the design , project manager: industrial designer: and  I  I actually didn't know we were designing a remote control , I thought we were designing a new monitor .  the website I went to look at had some announcements about an introduction of a   some sort of a seven inch  monitor , and  I understood that that was the project goal . So  I'm glad I didn't d do any work  ahead of time because  I clearly didn't understand the project goal . industrial designer:  I just did s see that we were starting a new project together and there was going to be a four member team composed of these people , and  that's about  that's project manager: industrial designer: and I I read through the different steps , and what my responsibilities were relative to the steps . project manager: So  you'll be leading the team for your design team or how many members is working in the team , for the design ? industrial designer:  for the industrial design ? project manager: Yes . marketing: project manager: That's industrial designer:  because  , you know , you can  you can make it  you have different choices with different financial models . project manager: Yeah , but  before we talk about  the finance , okay ,  do you have some idea how we can  sell this product or project in the market and how much is going to benefit to the company and  of course it's to the individual also . industrial designer: Well , you know  , I kind of think that in general you have to do   y you have to have something that's very fashionable , that's  very attractive that  people see and recognize  its goal , and  they immediately wanna have it  have one of their own . So it would really would need to  something like the iPod would be good , seems to have caught on fairly well , project manager: industrial designer: so  d  you know , I don't care what it does , just so it looks cool . project manager: Okay , but   when you think you can give me like a kind of design on the functional design or the technical design ? industrial designer: Well ,  I've got a lot of other projects I'm doing right now  and so I'll have to wait and see how those  how those go . project manager: Yeah , but  I need something in the writing , so like  what's your functional design , what's your technical design , and  how many people you need for this project , and what's the time frame you're looking , okay , and what is the budget , maybe  initial budget you're looking , okay , and  how is going to the market , okay , industrial designer: project manager: so you've you've had to meet with the marketing team and how they're going to market and what are the marketing strategic plan , okay , when are you going to introduce , okay , and by the time you introduce the product and  you know there there would be a competition , okay , so I need some kind of   the plan in the writing from you . Okay , and it's po industrial designer: And when would you like that ? project manager: B as soon as possible . industrial designer:  well if  if we have enough time  then d do you think  two weeks is a is close enough ? project manager: Yes I think  that would be good , because I need to go to the management and  tell them what we are going to do , and  what cost is , okay , and what's the time frame and what's the project plan , because  without any  documentations , I cannot go to the management and say , so we are going to do this and we need this much money , okay , so then it's it's difficult for me to say , okay , that's the reason I need  some kind of plan from you , initially , okay , then we can have the further discussion again . industrial designer:  are there other people who will be contributing to the plan ? project manager: Yes , of course , if you need some help ,  so let me know . So , who are the people you need  from the marketing or  the technical side or  the administration point of view , okay , to add in any documentation , or some technical point of view , industrial designer: project manager: so just let me know so I can  coordinate all the teams . And  Ed  so what's what do you think about  this  project for the remote control and d do you have some already planned something for your marketing strategy or  the sales strategy ? marketing: Well not yet other than  doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do  , what they're building , their designs , their ideas , project manager:  . marketing: It should be a fairly large market because  the number of people that  the competition , project manager: marketing:  th I agree it has to be something it has to be something new , it has to be something that that draws people saying eh , I like this . Whether it works or not , they have to first say I like this , I like the design , and then it's gotta be simple to use . project manager: Yes , so what I  prefer maybe  you need to interact  more with the Christine , okay , because you know what she is going to do it , okay , and you know how to sell it . Okay , because  she is doing the design , but you are the core because you are in the marketing , okay , marketing: Yeah . project manager: so because you need to sell and you're the responsible for the all the money , the finance , okay , tomorrow . project manager: So , what I prefer , okay , so you need to interact with the Christine more and  within her team , okay , who is using the functional design or technical design , okay , marketing: project manager: and  you need to come up with some kind of plan , okay , how we are going to do the your sales plan , okay , th marketing: Do we already have a cost limit on this , th an idea of how much  we want to market this for , how much it's gonna sell for , project manager: Th That that's marketing: that's up that's up to us to decide , eh ? project manager: Yes , that's you have to decide , okay , so the best thing is you  both of  the Christine and you discuss with yourself , okay , and come up with the cost , and how we are going to compete in the market , okay , in the the technically , or in the sales wise , okay , the commercial wise , okay . Then  we have to design , okay , how long it will take the whole project , okay , how much is going to cost us , and how much we are going to benefit for the company . Okay , so I think it's  maybe if we can  give me some kind of your  the sales plan , okay , including the technical what  she's going to talk to you within the team , okay , then it will help me to discuss with the management for further , okay , and put it in the the proper project plan . Okay , and if you need  any coordination in between  compared to the maybe the some technical vendors or commercial vendors , okay , depends if you want to have some   marketing plan or technical plan , okay , so you let me know .  my job from what I understood was to look at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable , it's acceptable to the people who are gonna use it and look at the best ways to do that . user interface: So I think I'll have to interact with Christine and discuss with her , so that she's not designing something that my studies will show right off the bat that it's not going to work , project manager: Th Christine , yeah . Which is user interface: and so it's sort of it's a loop that feeds in , but I don't think necessarily that I'm in a coordinating position for it . Yeah , so basically you need to interact with Christine more , okay , for the user acceptability , okay , and the testing , okay , user interface: Yeah . project manager: then you will user interface: Which will also feed into the marketing , project manager: Yes . user interface: because depending on what users want , depends on how you sell it , what tag lines you attach to it , how you try to make it more attractive to users .  , and then I guess build the plan based on all of that , because I think you need to take all the factors into account . But what I request , okay , keep Ed in the loop , okay , in between your  meeting and Christine meeting , because  he should know what's happening . Okay and please please copy all the mails , okay , all the discussions to me , okay , so I need to submit to the management . user interface: So , the immediate next step is to start determining the functional design , or project manager: Yes . To come up with the functional design and  to discuss with Ed , okay , and how it's going to be work , and  first of all with your user acceptance , okay , how it looks like and how it's going to be work in the market , okay , user interface: industrial designer: Would you mind  at the conclusion of our meeting could could you send us a copy of your slides ? project manager: Yes , I will . project manager: I'll copy ,  le let us keep all the emails and all the copies , okay , share each other , okay , so you know everybody what's happening , okay ? user interface: Sure . project manager: And if anything you need anytime so please either you can call me , or just send me email , or  just come and  knock my door , okay , so I'm available here <doc-sep>marketing: user interface: industrial designer: marketing: industrial designer: project manager: user interface:  project manager: industrial designer: user interface: No , no . Not all the small buttons , you don't know project manager: Is this positive or negative , that  big buttons ? industrial designer: Big buttons , positive . industrial designer: All all small buttons like when you have  like a hundred buttons on your remote control , you won't know what they're working for . What are your experiences ? user interface:  well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the T_V_ set . And  I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED   a LED on the corner of the of the remote . And that if you push the button the LED  gives a light , and  and you see that it's working .  project manager: So and do they always have that ? user interface: Yeah , but No no no . marketing:  at home we have a T_V_ , a video  recorder , a D_V_D_ player , and a satellite receiver . But  i it it had a lot of buttons on it , and you didn't know which one was what . So what ideas do you have for it , for the new remote control ? What what does it have to have ? industrial designer: The weight . industrial designer: When you push a but a button on the T_V_ , then you hear some  some sort of bleep . industrial designer: marketing: Yeah I think it  from a marketing point of view , it also has to look nice . So you don't won't have to change the batteries  once a week or  once every two weeks <doc-sep>And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly . industrial designer: project manager: user interface: industrial designer: Well , I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and  user interface:  . B did you send us an email about this ? project manager: not yet , user interface: industrial designer: project manager: but if you want user interface: Yeah , we we received an email about this  d designs . project manager: Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ? industrial designer: user interface: Ah it's Okay . marketing: I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . user interface: 'Kay , we can project manager: So there are so we have three user interface: So there are three kinds of designs , that's all . project manager: So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? Any any volunteer ? industrial designer: I think our  responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager . user interface: Are you using the you are doing the in industrial designer: Yeah I I'm I'm Well , maybe we have okay so I industrial design . It was a little confusion about my  project manager: user interface: Ah industrial designer: but it's alright . industrial designer: Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done project manager: industrial designer: and what are your ideas about the project manager: About the design or Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ? industrial designer: Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess . industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno I project manager: And of course it should not be very costly . industrial designer: Well I I think that Norman and I would think about  the technical points and  we should discuss it in the next meeting , or user interface: Need to collect information .  , what is most important in a in a remote control ? What is the most important function aspect ?  . project manager: You won't user interface: Or or you can say for example ,  I want  to list all the programme tonight . Y you know , instead of  remote control it's doing the some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . project manager: I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . user interface: No , because no , project manager: S user interface: it's not very a lot . industrial designer: I I think if you want t to choose  from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use  w  I dunno marketing: I'm a okay . marketing:  the main  function of remote control is to have something in the hand project manager: In the hand . marketing: If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog user interface: Yeah . marketing: if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . industrial designer: marketing:  we have some or something , different technology but project manager: This is it's user interface: Yeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that  there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea project manager: industrial designer: but I I think that technically it would be  a little bit   more tricky to to achieve this than just to user interface: No . They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . user interface: And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons . industrial designer: Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to  navigate  through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so project manager: This is good idea . Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? industrial designer: Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen user interface: Good idea . industrial designer: and just  with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f user interface: I think I think that will be revol revolutionary . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: Because all the T_V_  the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . So I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff user interface: Okay . project manager: So we have five minutes to user interface: Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . project manager: Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we industrial designer: user interface: Five minutes . marketing: And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of user interface: Okay . marketing: So , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark  some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . industrial designer: Oh right so user interface: Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: Be before before writing you can  sit and that says what we what we said user interface:  . So so the most functional des  the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . The user can choose w which one they want , right ? industrial designer: Yeah , by content or by channel , user interface: By content or by channel . user interface: Okay , so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content . industrial designer: I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so user interface: Okay . And  industrial designer: I think that's the the things to do user interface: The main thing . user interface: So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get  the funct this is the functional designer ? That's the first aspect . project manager: So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ? And we'll discuss the other other aspects "

        "Query": "What was the final decision regarding the chip, feasibility of letting the user program the keys, and fulfilling user requirements?",
        "Summary": "The group made a decision to use a regular-style chip without an LCD display for the controller, opting for simple push buttons with the exception of a more advanced button for the interior lighting system. Concerns were raised by the industrial designer regarding the usability of the function, as it went against the product requirements. The user interface designer suggested that the usability would depend on the user's effort, leading to the decision to produce two versions of the controller - one with full user freedom and the other with some constraints. In order to meet the requirements of being fashionable and spongy, the group agreed to use wood and rubber for the controller. The buttons, which would be the part touched by users, would be made of rubber, while the rest of the controller would be made of wood to provide a natural feel.",
        "Article": "So , we will first start by summarizing the  the previous meeting and the decision we've taken .  I will take notes during this meeting so  that you can  look at my  folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards . We'll then t take decision in concert and then   we will  define the nest next task , to have to be done before the next meeting . We have also  the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find , and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no L_C_D_ no voice features . So the conceptual specification by Industrial Designer , the specification of the U_I_ by or U_I_ user interface: Abdul al-Hasred is my name . industrial designer: I_D_ you want ? project manager: Maybe I can switch slide  on your request . industrial designer: and I think a remote control is , as I s mentioned previously , you just have a a very simple chip and the  the user interface is just done usually by push button and in our case we are using a  a wheel control . So   I was looking basically for that chip , which is  very very standard , and  I just looked for the wheel sensor and the standard push button . The push button are usually extremely cheap , but I just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor , which seems to be quite expensive . industrial designer: And I think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not if if we could combine something with the push button . Yeah project manager: So will will will this with  including all possible things , so buttons , wheel and the chip , be  lower than twelve Euros to produce ? industrial designer: I I th But I don't think that  we should We should talk about  the design of the box also which needs some money . project manager: Okay user interface: Also have to say industrial designer: But user interface: Did you receive the email about the voice recognition ? industrial designer:  that's all user interface: No ? project manager: You received something industrial designer: yeah . But I guess it could be project manager: And could it be adapted ? user interface: I guess it's possible . project manager: Okay and there can  recognize some commands and stuff ? user interface: Yeah you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and stuff , so if they already have it as  as a chip project manager: Okay . project manager: Okay maybe we can just  listen to this presentation and then take decision later on according to those news . industrial designer: Yeah but I think it's yeah Sorry , I haven't written my personal references .  the I I just want to mention the the problem of the the r wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button , project manager: Okay .  , what is the purpose of the light ? industrial designer: Just to to make something which is  slightly more design that  a squarey box with a rubber user interface: Is project manager: You can easily find the button in the dark or so ? user interface: But But in th in the dark  Yeah but is going to be always turned on , the light ? project manager: It will be turned on when the when the user move the remote control I think , no ? user interface: But if you move it then you have it , you don't need to find it . user interface: But if you move it then you have to have some sensor to when you move it to detect your movement . industrial designer: I don't think that this is really expensive , but at the end this is plenty of unexpen eh very cheap devices but  the bill starts to be user interface: Okay . Yeah , but I expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so , industrial designer: First of all I was thinking to have a a continuous light user interface: yeah . industrial designer: and you w when t you you you you press the on button you have the light on your remote control , when you want to turn off your device user interface:  . project manager: But it can be  battery consuming , no ? To have the light always on ? industrial designer: Yeah , a little bit . user interface: So I just look at some current designs  on the web , of usually more complicated remote controls . And let's look at two of them because  th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple . And in our case we just  reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler . project manager: And also does it  fit well in hand ? Because it was  th your wrist problem with the usage . We have all these buttons as you can see , but most of them , we just need the ones in the middle . user interface: So , from the bottom or whatever is there ,  the  the numbers and then the top ,  until the ten also , this middle part , project manager: Yeah . So it's basically more or less how we would like it , with a big volume control , big channel control , and mute and power , yeah ? project manager: Yeah . user interface: So basically , w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two . user interface: Yeah , if you have , for example I think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb . Will be down or user interface: So that they're separate a bit , project manager: Okay .  and it's easy to press the other the big buttons , but  , it's not that difficult to press the the channel buttons either . Usually what I have noticed that people put the plastic cover on things that you normally don't mess with , like buttons for t  tuning the channels and stuff like that . user interface: We could use the some wheels can be pushed down , could use the push down of the wheel for the record if we want . user interface:  so we could just basically use one just wheel and  user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case . So we can move to the Is there any question ? For designer of user interface ? or we can move to the next part , maybe , and discuss afterwards ? Okay . marketing: Can I ? So now the recent investigation we we have done fo of the remote control  . So , the most important aspect for remote controls is to be fancy look and feel and not current functional look and feel . marketing: And the third most important aspect is to to is that the co remote control should be easy to use . And there is a fashion watchers in Paris and Milan that have detected the following trends ,  fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes , and furnitures . So , maybe if our remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form project manager: Okay . project manager: marketing:  I don't know which material can be spongy , project manager: Yeah . marketing: and if you project manager: This is good also for user interface: Well , wou wou I think we can certainly just put the electronics in a spongy thing , industrial designer: Yeah . We could say that if you throw it , you have a sensor , and you throw it and hits the television and turns it off . And you know here the more iz important aspect is the fancy look and feel , after is  technological innovative , and after the easy to use . marketing: Yeah that's why project manager: Has it ? marketing: Yeah that's why I think we have to keep that if it's possible . You know the pear , is like that and it's it's easy to to have in in hand project manager: Yeah , and it's ergonomic as well . D D Is is there anything you want to add ? user interface: Is there any fruit that is spongy ? marketing: project manager: I don't think so . I think we we can have like yeah a pear is good , fit well , or banana as you told . industrial designer: And for maybe look and feel , what about a a piece of ice , with blue L_E_D_ inside ? project manager: But that's not in the trend . user interface: You can make it  marketing: project manager: The trend is spongy , and vegetable fruits . marketing: project manager: I think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well . project manager: So , I think we can keep the wheel because it's  easy , it's innovative , even if the cost is a bit higher , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: and we also have to find a , so , a fruit like pear or banana wit  any others idea you have . What kind of fr fruit would you like to to control your T_V_ with ? marketing: user interface:  . industrial designer: You y you don't use the banana when the banana is curving like that , user interface: Two of the button , yeah . industrial designer: but when the banana is curving like that , with the wheel on the top and to control , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and here you have a a push button to marketing: But you don't have project manager: I think it's a good idea , yeah . user interface: Yeah so you can just have  just have this curve , yeah , and you move  your hand here to press the buttons and then you move  on the other side . user interface: So you can have it on on two sides and it'll be cool , project manager: Yeah . user interface: no ? project manager: I think it's a good design and it's innovative as well then . industrial designer: If you if you start with  fancy fruits and fra s and tha user interface: Ah-ha . industrial designer: Oh , yeah marketing: project manager: Yeah it's really  really a good point . marketing: user interface: Now who are recording this meeting ? project manager: I think it So One second . So ,  so for marketing: project manager: sorry , for  component , so industrial designer: So project manager: we have to think about those aspects , sorry .  what do you mean by case ? project manager: I think it's the box that should be spongy , banana's shape . project manager: industrial designer: I just want to have so something to prin to to fix my my components onto that box , and that's it . user interface: But  the thing is that the buttons and the wheel have to be industrial designer: Spongy also . user interface:  if it's spongy then the buttons and the wheel have to  if it's spongy then it's going to move , right ? So , it's going to be bend a lot . user interface: So if we try to push the buttons , it project manager: No the button would be user interface: You think it's possible ? project manager: In fact it it should be something odd shaped , with a spongy cover . Button , where do we want some buttons ? user interface: Well , usually hold 'Kay , we want it to be good also for the left-hand users , right ? industrial designer: Yeah . Sa let's say that th o It has to be basically you can only take two sides , one on ths this side where is the thumb and the other side where there is  yeah also the thumb . Or you could use use this one , but I don't know if it's very comfortable , to use this one for the wheel . user interface: This for the wheel and then this for the buttons ? project manager: Yeah I think it's okay for both right and left . user interface: So if the left , we have the op project manager: I think you can turn it this way also . user interface: Yeah , the problem is if you have buttons and wheel then when you turn it around , the buttons are on the other side . project manager: And moreover , th the button ar are lighted so you you immediately identify the right side , because you have light on buttons . user interface: So the buttons have to be here and the wheel has to be Y Yeah I know , but  if you hold with your left hand , and the wheel is here , and the buttons are here , then when you turn it around the buttons will be on the other side . No you you I think you will use it only on the right or left hand , whether you are righty or lefty . project manager: So , for interface we said also that we have  this banana shape with button on the s on the side . I think it's  we defined everything according to what we should what the decision we should take , yeah . That is to say ,  check if it fit the the requirement  given by the users , but according to  your presentation it seems to be okay . project manager: So so to prepare the prototype I would suggest that the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer  work together . project manager: You feel  free to express what you want to say ? You don't feel too constrained ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: user interface: Maybe you can make    project manager: Okay , so user interface: okay <doc-sep>So we have forty minutes to discuss and  finalise and close the product and project and to move further , okay , so Okay , let's talk about  maybe first  for the prototype . project manager: So I handle to user interface: I've done a presentation , but it pretty much covers work that we've both done , so if I'm missing anything , Christine can just correct me . user interface: It's not the biggest PowerPoint presentation in the world , but industrial designer: marketing: project manager: So in two or three or industrial designer: user interface: Three . industrial designer: marketing: user interface:  okay , can I have the mouse ? project manager: Yes . Alright , so from when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting , we decided that we wanted an ergonomic shape , the material that we chose was wood , and  the colour would be customisable , 'cause you can stain the wood whatever colour .  , so in terms of function , you have to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off , volume and channel control , menu control , voice recognition control , and we've incorporated the L_C_D_ screen on the flip panel as part of the design , if we figure out it's too expensive , well then you just take it off . marketing: user interface: So if you lift up the panel , you can see the lovely yellow L_C_D_ display . The yellow button you have is the on off button , so it's really big , hard to miss . And then you have the numeric pad in the dark blue at the bottom , and on the right-hand side you have the access to the menu on the T_V_ , and on the left-hand side you have the the the ability to turn off the voice recognition . industrial designer: Yeah the d user interface: Additional feature on the back is that you can have your own customised backing and I suppose you could do the same thing on the flip case on the front . That depends on the  s design of the circuit board inside and  what room is left  user interface: Yeah . project manager: I think the microphone is on on the top ,  on the middle , the under the flip . project manager: So that will be the safe , so p any the chip it's not on the chip because you need to have microphone to industrial designer: No ,  it depends on the design of the circuit board . user interface: But it shouldn't be under the flip either , because you can have the remote control closed , but you still might want to activate it by voice . project manager:  it's it's Yeah , but   my opinion I think it's better under the flip because whenever you want to  the talk , okay , so then you can speak then you can close it . But if you put it on the on the flip , okay , then  technical I don't think it's  feasible , 'cause most of the time you speak then it will be recognised . user interface: But if you've already got the remote control in your hand you need to open the flip to use the voice , why use the voice , why not just use your hand ?  the whole point of the voice is that if the remote control is sitting there and I'm too lazy to reach over and pick it up , I can just use my voice . industrial designer: Maybe I've got my hand in the popcorn bowl and I'm holding my cup of Coca-Cola in the other hand . user interface:  it doesn't have to be on the flip , it can be on the side somewhere . user interface: marketing: No , because y you can easily put a microphone on the side that would have no problem would haven't been not be damaged or anything , and it'd be accessible all the time to voice . S I'm fine , I'm satisfi user interface: And maybe the shape of the buttons , project manager: I'm satisfied . user interface: the little egg shapes aren't the most economical , but industrial designer: We're glad you're satisfied . project manager: Of course it's it's it's looks more heo heavy , but I think when it's completely maybe it's a less weight . But And part of the thing is m a lot of people say that they don't like something that's too light , because they don't feel like they have enough control over it . user interface: So  maybe this is excessively heavy , but I think it needs to have some weight , project manager: Yep . marketing: project manager: So any comments or  marketing: Well , the prototype is is very well within the design and ideas that we've we've talked about on the previous meetings . marketing: Now it goes into this next phase as the financial  marketing  project manager: Yes , that  So I'll come back to the So evaluation criteria , I think  that will be good , so then let's come to the finance  , I have some  calculations which I made  as for  the budget .  it's optional , somewhat optional and Ed wants the chip on print , that's what  we were talking about that . industrial designer: project manager: So then we have sample sensor and sample speaker , then  we have the wood material , then special colour and push button . So it's  actually , our budget was  twelve point five Euro , but  it's coming to nine point nine five Euro , so we are under  below the budget , okay , so still we are saving some money . marketing: Well we haven't come to mine yet , so industrial designer: Oh , okay user interface: industrial designer: . It's gonna cost a long way to c you know , cost a lot of money to market it , is it ? marketing: we're gonna have a bit of difference of opinion , yes . project manager: So maybe it's for some money we can utilise for our  marketing , for the sales , okay , and  marketing: Well , it just depends on if we're gonna add a o on this pr provisionary cost analysis , we do not have a L_C_ display . L_C_ display is gonna be very expensive , user interface: No we do , but it's not filled in . marketing: We don't have the price up there , user interface: Oh , yeah , yeah , project manager: Yeah . marketing: okay , so if we add approximately two to three Euro per remote , now we're up around about twelve , twelve and a half as to what  the company had initially  requested .  industrial designer: So that means we can put the  the L_C_D_ in , yeah . But as far as production  I'm putting up a question because we're talking about profit also , and in mine you'll see  the problem with  our survey , the p the possibility that how many units can be sold , what percentage of the market , etcetera etcetera because that has to be taken in into consideration . project manager: marketing:  this is just production cost , it is not  advertising cost , it's not transportation cost  project manager: Yes , so still  we have twelve point five Euro . marketing: And that will inflate quite a bit the cost of the  the cost of the unit for the company . marketing: So to come up with what the company wants is a fifty million Pound profit , we're gonna have to go a long ways . This we are talking about one unit , okay , so when it go into the quantity , okay , and the cost will come down . industrial designer: Although customisation , because this is being done , you know , the on on-order basis , it might be  the the quantity won't m won't  marketing: Slightly . industrial designer: the circuit board will b you're right , would be in producing quantity , but the cost of the case would  be fixed at the  you got some pretty cheap labour that can do this case for one Euro . industrial designer: That's really that's the cost of the material and lab wow , that's really outstanding . But anyhow , still we are under control , okay , so what  I will do is I will try to negotiate with the vendors , okay , to get  the production cost less , okay , so then we can save some money , okay , to put into th our marketing or  you know the promotions , whatever , okay , so that  I will look after . project manager: You're in four ? marketing: Yep The four gives me it's gotta be  TrendWatch . marketing: It shouldn't be user interface: That's no , I think it's the same one . marketing: Although since  we need to have some type of idea on a market  we had independent study that says it this this market has an availability to absorb eight mi eight million units per year . Okay ? Our internal company evaluation puts it between eight to nine million which is approximately the same as the independent study . Which means that  if we have a target of two million would the company has to take twenty five percent of the market in the first year , project manager: marketing: So , if we put an inflated price of fifty Euro at a production cost that cannot exceed twenty-five Euro , okay , we're already in that that price , okay , project manager: Yes . marketing: with transport , promotion , labour , because we hav gi included the promotion in the cost , transport for the material to the stores or whatever how however we're gonna break this down between our our retailers . At two million units , we have to have a profit of twenty-five Euro per unit to get to the fifty million unit Eu Euro profit . marketing: Okay ? So , obviously we w w I just did a run down the evaluation of the form , the fan  the fancy stylishness of the of the unit , the ease of use , speech recognition , cost , we've gone through these . Now , the company must evaluate the feasibility of being able to take enough of the market to justify in production . Or we project this over two years , but being that the market changes very very quickly , maybe there's no more interest in buying this thing in eighteen months from now . marketing: Can it sell it for fifty Euros ? industrial designer: Could could I go to findings ? project manager: Yep . industrial designer:    I would  like to explore the possibility of using  alternative  delivery and sales channel which would be  to use the internet for promotion and ordering project manager: Yes . industrial designer: That way you have no storage , you have no  you do have transportation , still have the labour cost , user interface: user interface: That actually makes more sense if we're gonna make it so highly customisable , 'cause on the web people can look at the different options they have , see maybe what other people have done , what the range of possibility as , industrial designer:  . user interface: whereas if you're in a store , you can't unless you're a highly imaginative person , you may not really know what it is you want , industrial designer:  . user interface: whereas on the web , if you have a bunch of pictures , it can sort of trigger ideas and industrial designer: And you can even have an a movie that you can rotate the object and look at the di the only thing that you're missing really is the weight . It's not quite like trying on a shoe , but people are getting used to buying things online that they can't touch before buying . You can customise a watch , you can see how it is at the f at the end of the production , industrial designer: -huh . marketing: you can change it  There's a lot of online that's that is doing this now . marketing: And when you're rotating , you'll look behind and look this way  it's possible to do with this , maybe there's a possibility of selling more than two million units in one year , which could you know , feasibili feasibility  lower the price of the unit . project manager: I don't think that's  not possible , it's  okay then , l  let's wait for the production , okay , then  you can evaluate the product , so how it looks like technically and  how it look like  the real . user interface: What turnaround time do we have ? project manager: T user interface: 'Cause  production evaluation can be very very quick or very very long . industrial designer: In  We probably should do some market tests  once we have the prototypes and do some orders and things like that and test-market it . marketing:  that'd have to be thrown out on the market for people to get an idea , project manager: So you can take a minimum two weeks to a maximum four weeks . Think minimum two weeks if we're gonna develop prototypes and then try to take them to different places and see how people use project manager: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , because we we are not going to do it in  our factory , okay , so we can give it a product evalua user interface: No no . industrial designer: project manager: So we'll do it in the other place , and I don't think it's take more than four weeks time . Or  Okay , so then the real production we will start once we product evaluation , okay , then  it's approve from  the technical team and  your team , okay ,  from the management , then we can launch in the market . Hm ? industrial designer: Any outstanding ? project manager: S Any any other  questions or  comments to be discuss ? industrial designer: No , I'm user interface: What ab industrial designer: go ahead . project manager: Okay , so then  industrial designer: Did you have something ? user interface: Well I was just wondering about if we're gonna do a product evaluation then what about time for redesign if the users come back and tell us no this is bad , this is bad , we want this done differently . industrial designer: project manager: So no more changes will be made , okay , in this the basic design . Okay ? So we will introduce m this model and  let's introduce in the market and let's take the feedback from the customers , then we can  go for the industrial designer: Second generation . industrial designer: user interface: The problem is there might not be a second generation if the first generation flops for some silly reason that we haven't thought of . Well , every customer , okay , they have their own ideas , they have their own test , okay , so there's no end , there's no limit . user interface: No , but there's a difference between releasing a product that has been minimally tested and fine-tuned to suit a general range of requirements versus releasing a product that we think will work but we don't really have anything to back it up . project manager: Yeah , so that's the reason you are here for  the design , okay , I hope you made a good design . We have our own motivations in mind , we have our own ideas in mind , but that doesn't mean that that's what's gonna sell . project manager: Yeah , but  see , we ought to take a few considerations , okay , one is the price consideration , one is future consideration , okay , like  you can eat  you can all eat more chi I can eat more chilli , okay , so i it's a depends on the individual taste , you know , industrial designer: project manager: so we have we have to balance somewhere . I'm just trying to point out that I think that your evaluation and redesign turnaround time is too short well you have no redesign not you personally , but in the project we have no redesign time and project manager: Yes . industrial designer: Ed , d do you know what season of the year or time of the year is the most important for T_V_ remote control sales ? marketing:  . marketing: they need those things that they have their hands g occupied and they need to be able to talk to the con remote control . industrial designer: maybe what user interface: industrial designer: So I think what we need to do is perhaps to synchronise the final the the launch of a user-tested device with some special event . industrial designer: so that gives us a little more time perhaps then we anticipated , because I don't know when the World Cup is , but I'm sure there's gonna be one . industrial designer: but , so , I'm just ig  pointing out a  a strategy to  do some additional user testing project manager: Research . industrial designer: or  perhaps to  also user interface: That's actually good place to advertise it too . industrial designer: There might be some motion pictures that are coming out  that are coming out on D_V_D_ that  they need to have a m special remote control to work with it , so we could maybe work out a campaign with  with Sony Pictures for example . user interface: It's just something to to keep in mind , 'cause it's really really important . user interface: A lot of products have gone out there without being properly user-tested and completely flopped , when in fact it gets re-released a few years down the line with proper testing and it takes off like crazy . user interface: Really ? industrial designer: Yes , it is one of the first consumer products that was launched about thirty years that was a disposable consumer product , user interface: That I didn't know . industrial designer: and  people the market hadn't really gotten on to the concept that you could use something and then throw it away , 'cause it wasn't  user interface: industrial designer: but then when they re-launched them thirty years later , they were virtually the same design , project manager: . industrial designer: but people had gotten the throw-away , you know , paper cups and napki y all kinds of things that they hadn't  so , you're right , timing is very important , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: You look very relaxed , considering h you know , the  the weight on your shoulders , yeah . user interface: project manager: Okay , so then  let's come to the closing and  are the costs within the budget marketing: Celebration . Okay for  but our time being , so thanks for all your efforts and great work and  great design and  let's leave it to the Ed for later for once production is over and the meantime let's celebrate . user interface: Thanks industrial designer: user interface: project manager: And see you in the evening for drinks <doc-sep>industrial designer: project manager: So in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare a prototype for the for the remote control . And  so we have and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes , because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an L_C_D_ or not because it's too expensive . industrial designer: You can  choose the direction and if you just push on it it's considered like a enter function . industrial designer: You have on the  on the side here the microphone for the for the speech recognition system here . user interface: industrial designer: And here the the switch that control if you want project manager: Why you why you you put it in the the side ? industrial designer: Well I I I think  it's the project manager: It's not a good place maybe . industrial designer: Yeah but user interface: No i i it's the all around camer  microphone isn't it . marketing: Is it an only a single mic or a microphone array ? industrial designer: Well so it's a microphone array . industrial designer: No user interface: Yeah industrial designer: it's just a single microphone , and you I I think  we we put it here because I think when you when you are browsing your L_C_D_ you will be close to user interface:  . industrial designer: well it's better to to to place it here th than here , for instance . industrial designer: And here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker  recognition system to  to be on or off . project manager: How much does it cost this one ? industrial designer: Well this this prototype is  made for about  well fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars user interface: For the project manager: Fifteen dollars ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: fifteen dollars , project manager: Ah it's above it's above the budget . industrial designer: but  well it's not it's not  yeah , but  it's just a prototype and if we  if we optimises the  the  voila . project manager: How many b battery is there ? industrial designer: How many , excuse me ? project manager: Battery . industrial designer: Well  f battery , we use  about  user interface: Is it n the two A_A_s batteries in it . industrial designer: Yeah and you just project manager: So one one battery ? industrial designer: On  yeah one battery . industrial designer: marketing: user interface: You just n  marketing: Now what is the whole day rating for that ? industrial designer: The excuse me ? marketing: Whole day's rating . user interface: marketing: What type of battery ? industrial designer: Oh yeah it's just a r  simple battery a rechargeable  user interface: Yeah yeah . industrial designer: So and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Then the next time you pick it , oh project manager: industrial designer: it works . user interface: I forgot to tell you there is only a single button there , b this button industrial designer: Yeah just explain the button  Norman . This button is like the mouse is like a joystick , industrial designer: user interface: you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction so you can make a turn and it the additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have a click you have a double click all in a single button . industrial designer: user interface: You can move up , down , left , right , or you can do a swing . So even though it's a single button , but it is pretty s flexible because of the three hundred and sixty degree movement . marketing: And the L_C_D_ is this one , on the remote ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: project manager: I think it's not a good idea because after maybe one or two months of function is getting destroyed . project manager: industrial designer: Yeah it's project manager: industrial designer: So we have the the second version also with the different  button configuration . marketing: industrial designer: So basically th it's the same  marketing: -huh and also the switch . user interface: marketing: And I think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger , user interface: Oh no marketing: because that's a major that's a user interface: th actually th we'll come to that point in our industrial designer: Yeah it's it's it's embed in the  speech recognition system . marketing: Okay industrial designer: So marketing: and if you disable speech recognition system then ? user interface: W w I'll I'll come to that point later on . user interface: Th they either these with the  the the charger any project manager: With the remote control . project manager: Okay so the price of the charger included in the user interface:  it's a standard module so you should get it for a cheap price  . user interface: It's that same charger that you can use for the hand-phone but  again depends on the types . I think we have to investigate more on that , but project manager: The price should be below twelve and a half Euro . Yeah project manager: Well that's so user interface: but as the Marketing Manager says , people is willing to people are willing to pay more for good design . project manager: We have we have just marketing: Yeah people are willing to pay more , user interface: industrial designer: marketing: but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment . project manager: And the price of production user interface: industrial designer: Alright please  go on Norman with the special features . marketing: Or  user interface: Yeah we'll we'll come up to that , the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular so you want more function you pay more . If you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system , marketing: user interface: so is  modular . user interface: Yeah yeah , project manager: user interface: for example the L_C_D_ , you can take it you can put it put it back in , or you can use the other one , marketing: Something like customised . industrial designer: user interface: You want a microphone to put in the speech recogniser you don't wan you pay less for the system you see . industrial designer: You also have the the the two other modules for the parental control project manager: But user interface:  yeah yeah you should present that . industrial designer: that that you ca you can add up to the to your remote control marketing: And this is other one ? user interface: industrial designer: i i if you  if you want to to have more more power on what you do , and  which channel you want to choose and so on . industrial designer: H here is just the the the module for the kids and th if the parents want to watch T_V_ , up they come up with their modules , marketing:     . industrial designer: they just plug in it user interface: Yeah industrial designer: and they can have all the control they want here . industrial designer: We also have this module for  old people with big buttons , clearly labelled , user interface:  . Simplicity meaning that we have few buttons , powerful is that all the controls with the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n but here you only have few buttons but you retain the  the same powerful functionalities . So that's the best idea , the cond that that's our  an innovation   i in this  design here . The first one is the speech recogniser , again it's detachable or add-on . And then we also have security feature for example this here oop industrial designer: user interface: it's very robust , it doesn't break and the material , what's the material again ? industrial designer: The titanium project manager: Titanium . industrial designer: and so it's very  user interface: Again  and the battery life is  is an is an endurable one , again because this is A_A_ batteries you can choose the types of battery you want . user interface: Lithium-ion may be a good one , but you can replace it with cheaper one , again you pay for what you get , and then  y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder . So when you finish watching your T_V_ and you the you t you turn off the T_V_ ,  and then there's this message coming out that  please put that back to the charger , so so that's the or is it marketing: Okay . Yeah and  And it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary , so we didn't define the vocabulary so it's up to the user to define marketing:     . user interface: so sorry ? project manager: industrial designer: marketing: user interface: And then  because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a a of T_V_ programmes by genre , and this can be used by the adult or by the children . So it's pretty powerful , and that's that's why the num buttons are reduced , because of this feature . project manager: What what's user interface: Maybe we can improve more on the design but project manager: Maybe yeah . industrial designer: project manager: What's the price to p to produce ? user interface:  this is the industrial designer: Well so the price to produce For  the simplest one , say we start from four dollars to produce such a device . project manager: With with with the charge ? industrial designer:  it's about it The without without the charger marketing: With the charger ? project manager: Okay . user interface: Yeah industrial designer: it's about  well two dollars to produce  the microphone and speech recognition systems . user interface: industrial designer: Two dollars for the  for the add-on modules , and finally three dollars for the charger . So if you  sum up  everything wi with the L_C_D_ , which costs two dollar , you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two . industrial designer: so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about  fifteen dollars . project manager: No it's industrial designer: But it's just if you want all functionalities . user interface: marketing: Yeah it's a nice input project manager: We marketing: but we have an other inputs from the l public demands . project manager: marketing: I think we will just have a rough look and then we can make our statements , and we can finalise the product based on this discu user interface: Yeah . user interface: marketing: So the marketing made an evaluation criteria and these were some of the findings , and  in the market the people are not really interested with L_C_D_ , without L_C_D_ , with speech recognition interface , or without speech recognition interface , but most of the people what they are interested is first thing is , they want to have an fancy look and feel , it should be very fancy with colourful and  very handy to hold . user interface: marketing: Of course in that we could put L_C_D_ or recognition to be more technologically innovative . industrial designer: Well I think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself since we haven't yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the T_V_ screen   with just four buttons . marketing: Okay and if we go to the next slide , here you can find these are the latest fashion updates , and so this in Paris and Milan they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable , so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable , or whatever they like . marketing: And the second thing is , and if the material , they really do not want it to be very hard , as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium , it should be somewhat spongy . user interface: But the the problem is that  is it robust to mishandling ? industrial designer: Okay . user interface: We have you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy . user interface: marketing: So these are the f  three criteria on which we are going to build our remote . marketing: say that we have a seven point scale , from one to seven , user interface: industrial designer: marketing: So now you have with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ , user interface:  . marketing: so on this scale , if it is true , if it is if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one , or if it is false , it doesn't it looks  it doesn't look much fancy , then you could just tell me seven . So user interface: So marketing: We can make our study on this and user interface: so is the e evaluation depending on us or other users ? marketing: No no we have you have designed two products now , project manager: Yeah . user interface: But who will give the scoring  we ourself or or a third party ? project manager: You . marketing: According to you , no according to you designers , how will feel does it  with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ ? user interface:  . marketing: D is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy ? industrial designer: Well it doesn't look much fancy I'll I'll say three or four . marketing: And you both agree for that ? project manager: And you ? user interface: I think we can improve on the design . It's it it project manager: user interface:  we have been focused all all this time on the on the technical aspect , functional aspect , but also the simplicity . marketing: So I take three on with L_C_D_ ? industrial designer: Yeah a three . marketing: So without L_C_D_ how would you rate it ? user interface: Yeah . I think it's it's  more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated marketing: Four . industrial designer: so removing the L_C_D_  gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look . industrial designer: Well it's it's the same for both so I will give a five , six . marketing: Five with L_C_D_ and user interface: industrial designer: Well five also  Norman please . user interface: Yeah project manager:  user interface: from the innovation aspect I feel that  what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting is that  the retrieval of T_V_ programmes by content , because  that is really innovative , and for now and another innovation we have is simplicity and simplicity , few buttons , we've  A lot of functionalities . user interface: So that is  that is  for both th marketing: So without L_C_D_ ? user interface: Our gi I think that the our our product is  has the best in all well this is a biased judgement industrial designer: user interface: because we designed them . marketing: No no according to design aspect we want to know how would you feel the innovativeness ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: And without L_C_D_ ? industrial designer:  for both it's the the same innovations . So I there is high innovativeness included if you make it with L_C_D_ y industrial designer: Yeah . user interface:    there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the L_C_D_ ? marketing: So we can't go project manager: industrial designer: Talk about user interface: We haven't really  determined what are actually actually project manager: marketing:  that what you are sayin that's what the design user interface: it's good to have a L_C_D_ but what are we gonna display on a L_C_D_ ? industrial designer: marketing: No it's like this , project manager: marketing:  on the L_C_D_ , according to what I understand from your model is , you have a joystick here , and you have L_C_D_ , you just press your joystick , you get here a programme . Yeah but industrial designer: Yeah project manager: But industrial designer: but you have the same programme on the T_V_ screen . marketing: No on the T_V_ you don't it doesn't display on the T_V_ now . industrial designer: If you have the L_C_D_ , but if n marketing: L_C_D_ ? Then  there is no meaning in having it on the T_V_ . marketing: Or then again you have a channels , volume and all the stuff and what a user interface: But you cannot display all on a L_C_D_ . marketing:  that depends upon your design , so user interface: Anyway for for the users who who who opt for L_C_D_ we'll give them the give them the L_C_D_ , marketing:  user interface: we give what the customer  wants , right . user interface: marketing: So without L_C_D_ you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness ? And which do you recommend e easy to use , with L_C_D_ or without L_C_D_ ? user interface: industrial designer: Well I think both are really easy to use because there are few button buttons , user interface: Yeah industrial designer: and  well t p the menu are clear , well-organised , so user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Well with little knowing of the technology you can you can easily use the product user interface: industrial designer: so I will give a six for the easy to use . user interface: Yeah I think project manager: No it's just if I I see the the f the rate I think it's better to do it without L_C_D_ . project manager: Because that's with L_C_D_ just will increase the price , marketing: Yeah . project manager: and I thi i they have the same rate so without L_C_D_ it will be user interface: Yeah . marketing: Or we can just go back to the previous slide  where we ha we have a few updates . S industrial designer: And  if the the well if we have less technology we have more liberty to  for the shape and  things like that so marketing: Yeah that's right . For kids they want simply the s similarit for the old people they want simplicity , marketing: Yeah yeah that's right .  we can ha have build a more complex design if if they want it , but but  what I'm trying to say here is that the  we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people . marketing: So without L_C_D_ I just take it five ? project manager: user interface: W  marketing: Or you want it to be six ? user interface: I think it's the same . industrial designer: Yes as you say , with better  project manager: Without L_C_D_ . marketing: S s oh I think it's better to have this without L_C_D_ . marketing: As our Programme Manager s Pro Project Manager says that without L_C_D_ it is going to reduce the cost also , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yes and to give us more liberty to have a fancy look so user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: so let's go back to our laboratory and user interface: To improve on the design . project manager: what about the integration of speech recognition ? user interface: Huh ? The speech recogniser is a add-on module . industrial designer: It's optional yeah , since well according to this study  people more likes more to have a spongy  remote control than project manager: I think it will be I think i user interface: marketing: Yeah . project manager: I think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control , because maybe parents will lose these  marketing: Yeah , but  if you have an add-ons , the kids may just  hide the parental module project manager: Yeah . project manager: Or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or , industrial designer: project manager: so mayb better if you have all this in the same marketing: In the same set , yeah , project manager: marketing: and and individual buttons to make them work . user interface: The problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component , and doesn't want the parental control because it's a couple who do not have children when you sell the product in the market you could meet any kind of people , and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them . I don't know , project manager: So you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional  will be optional . user interface: what do you think  ? Yes exa what do you think , I don't know . project manager:  marketing:  how to how to how to make a marketing survey that  how many married couple or how many couples have a T_V_ user interface: Yeah . But the the question is n does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost ? project manager: I think it inc increase . industrial designer: Oh no , project manager: industrial designer: because if you if you add  something well yeah maybe because it's three different pieces  to to to build but project manager:  . industrial designer: Yeah yeah yeah user interface: industrial designer: it's I think it's cheaper if you if you already built the all the functionalities  on the same module , but  user interface:  . marketing: On the same P_C_B_ user interface: Well well the other aspect is that if in the when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the you're gonna keep the same customer , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah i i so if don't don't buy now they can buy i in the future . So in in that way you're actually keeping the cus the same customer , attracting them to come back in again and again . industrial designer: user interface: We're not trying to follow the Microsoft and we don't want to the m project manager: marketing: Updates and we sell it . industrial designer: user interface: Yeah well if the buyers can be up the th would be can be upgraded , it would be a good thing right ? project manager: industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: And  what's the idea about  the shape of the remote controls ? industrial designer: Well so marketing:  can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types ? industrial designer: Yeah yeah marketing: Do you require different types of P_C_B_s and industrial designer: I think we are yeah but we are also the  well the components will have to change because  we have to deal with the shape and  but I don't think it will  increase the cost too much so user interface:  . marketing: Or  it could be like this the P_C_B_ would be the same for all , but only the exterior  shape is different o for all . industrial designer:  well but it's a bit complicated to if if if you need machines to different machines to  ah well user interface: Yeah . For example the i the mobile phones nowaday , they sell different kinds of skin marketing: Yeah , yeah that's right . industrial designer: and then  add on skins and with with this  tex spongy texture  things like that . project manager: So industrial designer: So we finished the prototype  presentation if you have  something else to say . user interface: marketing: I think the Project Manager would be interested to look about the financial issues in making these models . We have to give answers so marketing: user interface: I suppose that you this criteria , is it ? project manager: Project evaluation . This room is a bit small , but industrial designer: project manager: user interface: but I think it's okay for us to work with . marketing: I feel it's fine , we know we don't need  I think it's okay . marketing:   what type of product would you think could we make this more interesting ? user interface:  we I I know something , we need more cakes , more biscuits on the table while we have meetings . industrial designer: Yeah and also more well  more seriously I think it's it's a good idea to have  clear clear points whenever we do a meeting marketing: user interface:  . industrial designer:  prior to the meeting to have  well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that , but I think it's alright . marketing: And the evaluation was project manager: Without without L_C_D_ , without speech recognition , it will be simple . marketing: So project manager: Yeah free free coffee user interface: Alright then , we finished ? industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Yeah thank you for your work and marketing: Yeah thank you , thank you very much "

        "Query": "Summarize the discussion on the features, functions, evaluation criteria, and usability of the remote control, as well as the functional features to include.",
        "Summary": "The group reached a consensus on the features of the new remote control, including the use of normal batteries, a scroll wheel with rubber buttons and backlights, a round shape, and speech recognition with an advanced chip. They decided to forgo an LCD display due to cost constraints. Marketing initially suggested developing a multi-functional remote control that could control various appliances, but ultimately decided to design it solely for television use. The Industrial Designer emphasized the importance of a modern remote control being able to control a diverse range of equipment, which was agreed upon by the User Interface team. The group evaluated the remote control design based on user requirements and received a satisfactory average score of two. Marketing raised concerns about the ease of finding all the buttons, particularly the options button, while the Industrial Designer believed all the buttons were easier to find than a regular remote control. The team discussed the inclusion of a standard wheel, despite its higher cost, and debated whether to include a motion-activated light or continuous light.",
        "Article": "And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly . industrial designer: project manager: user interface: industrial designer: Well , I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and  user interface:  . B did you send us an email about this ? project manager: not yet , user interface: industrial designer: project manager: but if you want user interface: Yeah , we we received an email about this  d designs . project manager: Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ? industrial designer: user interface: Ah it's Okay . marketing: I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . user interface: 'Kay , we can project manager: So there are so we have three user interface: So there are three kinds of designs , that's all . project manager: So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? Any any volunteer ? industrial designer: I think our  responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager . user interface: Are you using the you are doing the in industrial designer: Yeah I I'm I'm Well , maybe we have okay so I industrial design . It was a little confusion about my  project manager: user interface: Ah industrial designer: but it's alright . industrial designer: Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done project manager: industrial designer: and what are your ideas about the project manager: About the design or Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ? industrial designer: Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess . industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno I project manager: And of course it should not be very costly . industrial designer: Well I I think that Norman and I would think about  the technical points and  we should discuss it in the next meeting , or user interface: Need to collect information .  , what is most important in a in a remote control ? What is the most important function aspect ?  . project manager: You won't user interface: Or or you can say for example ,  I want  to list all the programme tonight . Y you know , instead of  remote control it's doing the some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . project manager: I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . user interface: No , because no , project manager: S user interface: it's not very a lot . industrial designer: I I think if you want t to choose  from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use  w  I dunno marketing: I'm a okay . marketing:  the main  function of remote control is to have something in the hand project manager: In the hand . marketing: If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog user interface: Yeah . marketing: if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . industrial designer: marketing:  we have some or something , different technology but project manager: This is it's user interface: Yeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that  there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea project manager: industrial designer: but I I think that technically it would be  a little bit   more tricky to to achieve this than just to user interface: No . They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . user interface: And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons . industrial designer: Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to  navigate  through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so project manager: This is good idea . Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? industrial designer: Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen user interface: Good idea . industrial designer: and just  with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f user interface: I think I think that will be revol revolutionary . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: Because all the T_V_  the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . So I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff user interface: Okay . project manager: So we have five minutes to user interface: Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . project manager: Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we industrial designer: user interface: Five minutes . marketing: And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of user interface: Okay . marketing: So , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark  some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . industrial designer: Oh right so user interface: Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: Be before before writing you can  sit and that says what we what we said user interface:  . So so the most functional des  the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . The user can choose w which one they want , right ? industrial designer: Yeah , by content or by channel , user interface: By content or by channel . user interface: Okay , so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content . industrial designer: I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so user interface: Okay . And  industrial designer: I think that's the the things to do user interface: The main thing . user interface: So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get  the funct this is the functional designer ? That's the first aspect . project manager: So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ? And we'll discuss the other other aspects <doc-sep>industrial designer: Is there any time for a cup of coffee ? user interface: We have a slight problem . project manager: Sorry ? industrial designer: Can I get a cup of coffee ? project manager:  no . project manager:  then  the three of you  prepared a presentation , I think ? Sebastian ? industrial designer: I think so too . user interface: industrial designer: project manager: Then we'll do your one   as la  the last .  the top goal of this m user interface: But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe . project manager:  the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group  and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind .  the new project requirements , first of all ,  we didn't speak about it , but we should not  support teletext in the remote ,  because our b  board  feels that  teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext .  the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not  f  feasible , it's not  w user interface: Yeah . project manager:   we we cannot make it because of the time to market  that we have to deal with . project manager:  the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than  forty , which is important for you ,  Ruud , and as well for  Roo .  then for Roo , as well  important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product .  the individual presentations , I th  Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ? user interface: Yeah , I'll start .  the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . user interface: Then I found  two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function  remote control with many possibilities , but  the lack of the feeling I already mentioned  in the previous  discussion . user interface: And the ease-of-use remote control with  the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . My personal preferences were ease of  the easy to use remote control , because  the user-friendliness and  it can be more trendy in in user design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not  in our design . But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is  the best  possi possibility for us . project manager: Okay , so marketing: project manager: the important thing here is user interface: And it's also i indeed   Ruud's  insight in the in the topic . project manager: Yeah , okay , w we will s we all  user interface: Just for  for user desi  user  friendliness I  should choose for the the ease of use remote control .  well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . user interface: industrial designer:  basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by  sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to  implement a picture here , user interface: Energies and  industrial designer: but it's hardly readable . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using  infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . It's almost every piece of equipment  every piece of  every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . And I think that's what we w user interface: The glow in the dark  concept  we discussed . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . industrial designer: and I think we should  we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . industrial designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared , because  otherwise our device cannot  communicate with  almost every T_V_ set . And  if we want to use  a rechargeable design or  a energy-save design , we should really implement them .  for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost  circuit board ,  because most of the production cost are are in this  part of the equipment . industrial designer: And  the money we save on using this we can use  for elaborate fancy lighting  techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . user interface: And what's the  industrial designer: I think our  users will really  will really like that . user interface: if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or industrial designer: No , they're p f  power friendly LEDs also . user interface: For the same costs , it's can be  in our industrial designer:  no , they're  they're a little bit more expensive , but by    making user interface: Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's  industrial designer: We can we can make its I think . project manager: Yeah , but but the question is whether  two or four buttons makes  m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to  include fancy lightning techniques , I guess . user interface: Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , marketing: true . Well , it's not one light , it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . project manager: Okay well , industrial designer: project manager: we ar we are very curio curious to what the market  will feel about such a product . marketing: But  since  the other part is  forty percent of the market , I  thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . The buttons to zap are used the about  fifteen hundred times , when  the power button is only used one time . So user interface: Yeah , well it should just have a design The perfect design for those only those buttons . Just one thing I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? industrial designer: Well marketing: Yeah , that's  a problem . project manager: Well industrial designer: Usually project manager: maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , user interface: It should be   project manager: like  turning on and off the the the lights . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a  kind of weird sound , and your  remote controls then start to beep . project manager: But  th user interface: But but T_V_s don't have all   buttons . marketing: And you project manager: Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home  user interface: But I believe you will have an marketing: Yeah , and usually industrial designer: We do not control the T_V_ set so well . marketing: And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button ,  you would have to walk to your T_V_ , industrial designer: Yes , m yes . S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , marketing: and it's project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so we should think about project manager: So what about the clapping technique ?  because you se user interface: I'm convinced  Sebastian will  find  one solution for us . marketing: And b project manager: Well , you see it a lot in in light  lightning   industrial designer: Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics  the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , project manager: Yeah , a peak . industrial designer: But there are many other sounds  which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . industrial designer: Yes , user interface: But we can have just   a home stat  f a base station next to the T_V_ . user interface: Well if you lost th industrial designer: Well , project manager: Well  industrial designer: is there not something f something more easily user interface: I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . user interface:  that's just  industrial designer: No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and  b  perform a a some kind of  . You do not want another device , which can be  everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . project manager: Yeah , m maybe  w we  we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . project manager:  maybe Sebastian should have  a detailed look later on and  come up with a solution , industrial designer: But  before I do that I w I want to warn you that  by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated project manager: And there are some implepe imp user interface: And do we even  prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning  function ? industrial designer: Well , I I think so , because  when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . user interface: It's a unique item  project manager: Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . project manager: and  I think  it's worth   looking and and probably more i interesting than  than the lights . user interface: And just about  the user interface , I came up with  an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . marketing: Well , t  we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function . project manager: Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players  and all kind of stuff . user interface: So industrial designer: we should save costs  by not implementing a lot of functions and  the money that we can save from that we should use for  having a nice design and  thinking about the user interface project manager: Yeah . Okay , industrial designer: and project manager: Ruud , how do you feel about that ?  do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to  a simple marketing:  well if we  include other  innovative functions  then they  might , project manager: user interface:  just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated ,  because it has many functions . industrial designer: Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very  friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but  nevertheless project manager: But but are we not in in the in the manual   if you have few buttons , no display ,    I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and  one button can  industrial designer: Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . project manager: But but how does how does the remote  report  r  give back to the user w in what state it is ? user interface: Yeah , I don't know yet . There's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . project manager: I know , but but if we use  like a stick , for example ,  industrial designer: W When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe  a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just  pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t  turned up the volume . marketing: And if you use that stick for volume control and channel  selection , you have the m two most important functions in one  button . user interface: But does it  I then should n just use  i instead of the stick ,  like many cell phones , just a round m well , project manager: Yeah , draw draw it on the board . Oh user interface: It's just an easy  way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . user interface: A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down project manager: Yeah , it can break down . marketing: And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it  attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . project manager: Okay , but w we still we're still in the question of    putting in advanced options .  we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , I think . user interface: Yes ? project manager: We need to  have the  the user function  the functions decided and   our target audience . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ?  which  incorporates all function available on the device ? project manager:  well , I do not want a full  it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want  the kind of functions , for example  th the most important are volume and  programme selecting . l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but user interface: Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to  two channels , when you have  something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can  change industrial designer: project manager: Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last  Mielsen . industrial designer: but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . project manager: And and do we want  the ten digits ? user interface: The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so . industrial designer: Well , are are you sure ? marketing: Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . industrial designer: but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think but you should  shou you should know that . industrial designer: Okay , user interface:  and I think the most industrial designer: I can imagine when project manager: I agree actually . user interface: Just elder elder people would would buy it , industrial designer: I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . marketing: Well user interface: but industrial designer: But if you're  a regular T_V_ user , and you just want  to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can  you can use  about ten buttons . industrial designer: Well , marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: but how how often do you watch all these channels ? marketing: and if if we And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . Don't you think ? project manager: Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the industrial designer: The design . marketing: Well project manager: You c you can d make them very fancy marketing: And project manager: by   Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . industrial designer: Okay , so you can experiment by  with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .  it might be expensive and  hard to implement , but it would be a solution  for project manager: Okay , speech . industrial designer: So  when you add  speech recognition to your remote control ,  it's very easy to change  the channel . industrial designer: So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . project manager:  If if we would  drop the ten digits industrial designer: But maybe when we  project manager: but keep the programme and the volume , industrial designer: It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find  find the remote control button  remote control function . industrial designer: There are some  hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . industrial designer: So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . project manager: But But but can we manage it bu  for the costs ? industrial designer: You have to do nothing for it . marketing: And  if we if we could inc  include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be  a big problem . marketing: 'Cause when project manager: Is a cradle very cheap ? industrial designer: It's Oh , it's very cheap .  I would like to hear  maybe maybe you all have th  things not  spoken about , yeah , but that are important .  are there other things about the market we should know ? marketing:  I think we dealt with the most important information . project manager: Sebastian ? industrial designer:  I just want to make a summary of all all things  spoken and  the different possibilities . So on the outside it looks easy , but  we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by  implementing  speech techniques ,  voice recognition , that these kinds of things .  there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement  fancy techniques , which  I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about  the the costs and  the things like  battery lifetime , energy saving . industrial designer:  another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons . If we just add   a chip which does the voice recognition ,  our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another project manager: Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board industrial designer: well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . user interface: But the cheaper the ch  the the chip or th what was it ? industrial designer: project manager: No , it's th industrial designer: The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . user interface: Well it then we should just  take a look at the costs and  especially for the voice recognition . project manager: I'm not sure how how we'll f  determine the costs , I will have a look at it . project manager:  I'm not sure how how that industrial designer: Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will  have a lo  look at it . project manager:  I'm don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out . project manager:  then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work ,  and I'm sure your personal coaches will  assist you with it . project manager: User Interface Designer ,  Roo , I would like to see the user interface c  concept . project manager: And  user interface:  the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis  decisions Sebastian makes . industrial designer: Well project manager: Well , i it should be easy , user interface: Well project manager: that's w w what we concluded . industrial designer: So we drop the voice recognition ? project manager: No no no , we didn't industrial designer: Or project manager: but it shouldn't be integrated industrial designer: Oh . project manager: yeah , it's of course it's user interface , but  i I was talking about really the design of the industrial designer: Okay <doc-sep>project manager: Hello ,  this meeting we are it's fo should be focused on the conceptual design of the remote control . project manager:  the goal of this meeting is to reach a decision at the end on the concept and I think the last time we talked about an a lot and we had a rough idea of what is going to be , but  in th at the end of this meeting we have to to reach a decision . So ,  we will have again three presentation , from all of you , and  I hope it will be fast because I would like to have time to for long discussion and and decisions .  so basically I just want to presented to you present to you some recent results we've had from  looking at   some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world .  the fashion trends we got from talking to our our contacts in the fashion industry based in Paris and Milan .  so f from our market research basically we've come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel ,  as opposed to a functional look and feel , is our number one priority .  and third thirdly the easiness of use is is the  is is important as well , but again two times less important as the technologically innovativeness of the remote control . From our f fashion people in Paris and Milan ,  we've discovered that this year  fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in in clothes , shoes and furniture . marketing:  so in conclusion , we need a our remote control needs to be something that's really fancy ,  has lots of technolog tech technology in it . user interface: marketing: And that it's easy to use and from our last meeting our you know Fabian told us that w you know one of the requirements is that we have to reflect the look and feel of our of th the Real Reaction company . marketing: So  fanciness first and then two ti you know , half as important as that is technology technology , project manager: Okay . So I am going to talk about a little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use . I think  I think the feature easy to use is more important than being fancy , but okay , we can discuss about it  later .  generally , generally  this remote control   should be should be something , in my opinion ,  the first feature is just to be easy to use . So , the more frequent buttons should be larger , they should be placed in a good position   inside the remote control . And  s  I can conclude like this , that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it . It should be we shouldn't need to es open a a t book and  start reading and  learning how to use this  this  remote control . So what I found out that  as I said  I think it's better to put  more frequent    ke  buttons which are used more in the middle of the remote control , and they should be bigger in size . user interface: And maybe  just like some toys , some joystick which is easier to take inside the hand . And  also f   m because because customers doesn't like to buy lots of battery , it should not  consume lots of energy . And my personal p  preference is  , as I said ,  just putting this buttons in a special places and covered some buttons which are not used  that much like settings button , like mobile phone . Usually some mobile phone cover the dialling number part , so we can cover these buttons which are not used or  number buttons for the for the for the can channels , and just put  volume change or s ch can  channel change buttons   in the remote control . And if the user needed to do some more complex task  he he can open the cover and then change settings or something like this . And also  I think if we put some some some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier . For example , a sliding or rolling   d  stuff , if we put it inside then we can easily manipulate with  thumb . And  I dunno but  I think usage of a speech recogn  r recogniser can be good . I know that it consumes lots of energy , but if we do it in some way that it asleeps when there is no sound and when it detects some sound it may consume less energy . And I think it's good because it's something new and usually young people like something new . industrial designer:  okay , so good news from me   for me from Hamed , but bad news from Bob obviously , because spongy design , I don't like it as marketing: project manager: industrial designer: Okay , so could you please , Fabien , open it . I Most of the things I have to write myself on the board , but project manager: This one , yeah . This this is just  one thing I wanted to mention and show you that I just  I just found this , that our company  developed a s a seven f seven fingers or I'll just marketing: Inch . industrial designer: Yeah , seven seven inch T_ T_F_T_ screen , which is good news for us , since we wanted to include a display there . industrial designer: Okay , so the this will be like the overall scheme or overall requirements from the engineering point of view .  first thing is  this will be the overall shape , no  I'm not speaking about the real shape of the device , but the shape of the inside of the device .  the main energy will be taken from batteries that we can   And if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there , we must use additional source of energy , which I found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can  supply everything . I was computing all the all the things related to the speech recognition , and it's okay to use just  two batteries and solar cells , so .  the main board with all the circuits will take at least seven to seven centimetres , so this is my like hard requirement for the guys from the design . It depends where you put your screen , because the screen is  seven inch , so it depends on you where where you put it . Then the graphical card  for the T_F_T_ and the third unit is the I_R_ . The good news is that we can  we decided to use the infra-red unit because our company has also developed the chip for communication by the infra-red , including all the stuff inside , so it will be very cheap for us . So the once again the overall requirements , seven to seven centimetres for the board , which has to be which can be spongy but has to be this size , and the T_F_T_ which is seven inches .  I have to check what I wanted to  from my point of view I don't care about the about the material used for the overall des  ov all the device . project manager: Can you fit any  for example a T_F_T_ or any electronic device in a spongy thing , or is there any problem for that ? For example , put electronic card on a spongy thing , I can I can imagine it could be a problem . industrial designer: A all these things in in  in this box are okay to put in in any shape , basically . Maybe it a good feature , since it takes if it's around the T_F_T_ then it's good , because it's just keeps it safe , project manager: Okay . user interface: Well maybe it can have two shells , a hard shell inside and a spongy shell outside . marketing: This seven inch T_F_T_ screen , industrial designer: Yeah ? marketing: how big is it in reality ? industrial designer: Well , seven to seven inches . industrial designer: marketing:   have we decided that we're gonna use this T_F_T_ screen ? project manager: No , I don't think it's seven by seven , industrial designer: Yeah but project manager: I think it's seven the diagonal is seven . industrial designer: To be honest , I was project manager: Usually when they say seven inch I think it's the diagonal . industrial designer: Yeah , honestly speaking I was thinking that it was seven centimetres initially , marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , no no problem , user interface: industrial designer: because because because then the size of the graphic card will be one fourth . industrial designer: So marketing: industrial designer: Yeah , but no problem to to me to cut the screen . marketing: So , what's the size of the device ? industrial designer: Ah well this is like this is almost nothing . marketing: Even from my perspective seven t seven centimetres by seven centimetres is still industrial designer: Yeah , but we wanted the big buttons and stuff like that , you know . marketing: Is it Can you hold that , or ? industrial designer: Because if it's t too small we can we can lose it , at home , you know . project manager: A sm industrial designer: marketing: But is something that's seven centimetres square e easy to hold ? user interface: industrial designer: W I I think so . I if the roller buttons are on the side you don't have to catch it like that , but just like this , and you know follow follow Well , that's that's no task for me , but well seven to seven at least yeah , project manager: So maybe you can finish your presentation , user interface: project manager: and afterwards we will discuss about all this .  , so I think we have a lot We have to take decision today , so I think we have to do some work to finalise our idea and take decisions .  first I think energy it's a key problem because  it depend what can we have as feature if we use only batteries , for example , or something like that . Because can we have L_C_D_ and speech recognition with battery , and it's also r related to the size of the of the devi of the device ? industrial designer: Not J  just a point to the energy th things . If we use the batteries , and the additional so solar cell , then it's okay for L_  speech recognition and L_C_D_ , project manager: Okay . project manager: but using how many batteries , for example ? Are are what Maybe what is the size of the battery industrial designer: Yeah I was thinking just common A_A_ cells . marketing: So if we use s solar cells ,  where is the sun if someone's watching T_V_ inside ? industrial designer: S  d doesn't need to be sun . industrial designer: Yeah well I I suppose that I suppose that  that this remote control won't be in the in the room like this , where there is light only when when there are people , but . project manager: At least when there is T_V_ you can get light from the T_V_ . industrial designer: Ah it's a it's a compromise , no ? marketing: project manager: At least it's new and maybe technology New technology . industrial designer: Yeah , that's why I wanted to to include the speech recognition , because you wanted all the new things . user interface: project manager: So I think before talking about the other thing , it's important thing it's the case . industrial designer: project manager:  what what are gonna be the size , because its weight drives the other what we are going to use as features and so on . For example for the for the L_C_D_ , if we choose to have a small device , we cannot use this  a such a a a screen . Well what what would you guess as a shape ? Or what what would be the shape ? user interface:  . And I prefer to is it shouldn't have a uniform shape , so in the middle it should be a little bit thinner , maybe maybe . You can take  some some joystick you can take inside hand easier because it's it's designed for your f  taking into account your finger shape and your palm shape . So  seven not seven but let's say five by ten it's I think it's that's my opinion . industrial designer: Yeah , I think it's feasib Well one   How could we do it ? We could put the board next to , well , under the L_C_D_ and for example make the L_C_D_ be totally unrelated to the thing that you hold in your hand . industrial designer: Like holding something , and the L_C_D_ to be just on top of it , you know somehow . I've I s I think the easiest thing would be to to have a smaller L_C_D_ , if it's possible . industrial designer: Okay , so five to ten , I I think it's it's feasible . user interface: but I don't want to now invent something new , because we didn't discuss about it . So using some L_C_D_s we can touch , so we can remove  keys and just  having  , I dunno the name , L_C_D_ responding to fingers . user interface: So But for now if we don't want to use such kind of screens I I think we using a a smaller screen is better , project manager: Yeah . user interface: because project manager: The problem is we have a limit in a month of time , so we cannot do something very new . user interface: project manager: So let's go for a small L_C_D_ . marketing: So industrial designer: Okay , so Yeah , so so just just give me the the the five by ten numbers that you find the best and send it me user interface: A smaller s project manager: Yeah okay .  something easy to use , you said something easy to use but how does that fit in a fashion way , like with fruit and vegetable , and about the colour and logo of the of the company and so on , now , can we do that ? My first idea is because our colour is more yellow , and the it should be easy to take in a hand , I thought about banana , or something like that , which is fruits , and industrial designer: Seven to ten banana . marketing: Well it's it's definitely the obvious choice , with the colour of our company . user interface: marketing:  what other what other fruit and vegetables project manager: But it's just an idea . I dunno what you think about , but marketing: Do you know of any any other fruit and vegetables that are yellow ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: industrial designer: Well , but If it's If it If the banana is big enough . Well user interface: project manager: Yeah , and industrial designer: user interface: I think this is not good . project manager: The screen has to be square ? Or it can be like a a shape , quite ,  with curves . industrial designer: But if it's square then we get four screens out of one by cutting just . But if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches , so . I think that's more important than saving a bit of money on on the T_F_T_ screen . industrial designer: Yeah , m maybe the banana could be like a bit  fatter than than the c c common one . Yeah , it should remember banana , but it's not doesn't have to b to be   really the size and exactly the shape of a banana . project manager: So we are agree with the banana thing ? industrial designer: Well it we'll stick to banana , or ? user interface: Okay . project manager: So , the last point we decided it's infra-red , I guess . You have other thing to add to this point , or  no ? So ,  about the user interface , so we are going to use L_C_D_ . You talked about the buttons on the side industrial designer: Like like peeling of the banana you s user interface: Yeah , peeling of the banana . marketing: industrial designer: First layer obviously spo Yeah , project manager: So industrial designer: w It's it's like silly , but the people will really appreciate it , yeah I think . project manager: Is it is it possible to do that ? It would be a great idea , but is it possible technically ? user interface:  project manager: Like doing a spongy layer of the banana , and you open it . marketing: I think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that , project manager: Yeah . marketing: you know , to manipulate that to hav be a cover that you can pull off and user interface: user interface: Yeah , some Something like a plastic cover covering  some interface , U_S_B_ interface as in the in  digital camera . You open a plastic cover and you see some U_S_B_ interfaces , some some interfaces for adaptor . So keys can be  buttons can be covered like this , with a plastic cover and  when  and when you open this cover it's like peeling a banana . project manager: Yeah , but do you see that as a rigid thing , or like like a banana , something very soft , you can open like banana , or . industrial designer: Well is it possible to make it soft ? user interface: Yeah , yeah , yeah it's a lic like a plastic cover , so . industrial designer: So I think if it's so then it's cool ? project manager: So , I dunno what you think , Bob , but it would be great for users I think , and very good for marketing .  maybe , how can we , if we have a soft thing , like this , and to open it we have to attach it somewhere , I dunno how to do that technically , or . Yeah or a Yeah it can is it can be a plastic cover  sticking to the to the all the stuff like  with magnetic p  magnetic  magnetic  materials in the border , so it's it sticks like refrigerator door , completely . So you you can be sure that it will not be open while you're  while while  you are commonly using  buttons on the banana . industrial designer: Well since since the since the things like the like the screen and  how to say that , solar cell has to be has to be like kept kept in the shape , we cannot b  So we need that the that the peeling  I dunno but we should we should take care of these two two things . So , if if  the solar cell won't be visible while the banana is closed , then the material must be able to put the light inside , you know . So you're saying is it possible to have a solar cell and this removable cover and industrial designer: It is possible , but , well if it marketing: And a and a banana . industrial designer: I dunno how to how to do it if if t if to if it's better to put the solar cell to the t to the peeling or outside it , or or inside . project manager: And something we forgot , maybe ,  about the speech recognition system , are we going to use it , or not ? marketing: user interface: Yes , I think . project manager: So we have the de design , the a good shape , new and so on , user interface:  . marketing: user interface: project manager: And  , yeah , I  I think you should work together , s you  Hamed and Peter , to work  in a in a first prototype , and  more about the shape and so on and how you can manage to put everything together "

        "Summary": "The team discussed the best approach for incorporating the recording infrastructure in the room, considering options such as placing tapes in the lip of the table and using LEDs to indicate when the channel is live. Power issues were also a topic of discussion. In terms of representing the Bayes-net, an alternative approach was proposed that depicts context features as classes and their dependencies as relations. This model allows for instantiations of classes, which aligns better with the research objectives compared to the extended belief-net. Recent experiments revealed that adding more languages had a detrimental effect on model performance. However, it was noted that any form of normalization had a positive impact, while MSG had no effect. A demonstration was given on the structure and function of a toy version of the belief-net for the intentionality task. The feature nodes included prosody, discourse, verb choice, the \"landmark-iness\" of a building, time of day, and whether the admission fee was discussed.",

How was your business trip to Boston ? project manager:  well , actually I didn't go , didn't feel like it . user interface: You have the same message of  Windows cannot  marketing: user interface: sen oh stand-by . user interface: project manager:  I'm sure you've had a mail from our account manager about it .  Ruud is here as the Marketing Expert , Roo is here as the User Interface Designer and Sebastian is here  in the role of Industrial Designer . project manager:  we're going to do    a little tool training  for the tools we are going to use  during  the meetings we are going to have here .  then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan ,  and we will have a discussion .  is there any room for a little presentation ?  maybe during the discussion  section ? project manager: There is ? Yeah , there is . user interface: project manager:  okay , this new product we are are g are going to develop ,  it's a remote control , a television remote control . Those are kind of easy    goals ,  and I'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop .  we will discuss  later on more ideas about  how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things .  we are going to use a a pred a project method  during  this development ,  which consists of three different design stages .  the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design ,  all of these stages   mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then  meet to discuss our   the the the progressions , yes . project manager:  the first stage , the functional design  we are going to search for the user requirements , and we will  make a specific  specification of that .  the second is the technical functional design ,  what effect should the remote have ? Well in this case control t the the television I think .  to  presentate , to show us  a file you'll need to  place it in your project documents folder , which is on your desktop , at least it should be . project manager: sensors , so do not grab it here , but a lit more a little bit more to the  to the end .  you can insert a new  slide or or white-board   file  by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button . user interface: or should we only use it in the in the meetings ? project manager: Yeah , in the meetings , only in the meetings .  to  oh well , I'm I wrote down the documents  should be in the project documents folder if you want to  discuss it with us .  as a little training  I will ask Ruud first to draw   your own animal on a new slide  with  a different colour and a different line width than the one  now selected . marketing: project manager:  Roo , could you do the same please ? But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width . Well , it looked more than a bunny than a cat , but it works , industrial designer: Well , I'll give it a try . user interface: project manager: Okay , so  you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to .  user interface: industrial designer: marketing: project manager: we  we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold  , if there is market  interest ,  in in more than one country . And  the production costs should not be more than  twelve Euro fifty , so we should keep that in mind by  w w during the development ,  because  , well , those are important numbers . industrial designer: Yes ,  I have some technical  issues which I would like to present to you  before we start the discussion , because  there might be some  project manager: Limitations . I would like to think about  the implementation of  of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities . So if someone of you comes up with  ideas ,  I'll try to translate them in technical functions , but  there might be some impossibilities .  and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product . industrial designer: I have some  initial ideas about some things  which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming  discussion . user interface: And for a cell phone ? industrial designer: Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them . We're not  living in the  nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not  project manager: industrial designer: is not really  hot  technical stuff anymore . user interface: But Yeah , but the infrared , it's  , well , a little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that . user interface: But all the T_V_s are  equipped with infrared , so industrial designer: But it's cost-effective . user interface: Or you shou sh use a industrial designer: So marketing: user interface: you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote . So that's just my role , I'll just  give you  everybody some technical input , and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what  the product should be and how it should look , project manager: Yeah . project manager: Okay , so the the main por  the main points you are  telling us are focus on the inter  operability , industrial designer: Yes , project manager: and industrial designer: so one thing  one remote control should  control one or more  pieces of equipment , project manager: Okay , and and  industrial designer: and the way of communicating with these equipments .  there are other things like  how to make it trendy , which is I think   most  Ru  Ruud's  role . project manager: H how do you think the remote should  function for the user ? user interface: Well , I had a few  things in mind .  well , the interoperability , just like  Sebastian said ,  the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different   Yeah  , what is it , devices ? project manager: Yep . user interface:  so i i I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in  a store . user interface: It's not for  for  for  Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product , project manager: Okay , so we're we're going business to consumer , user interface: right ? project manager: not we're we're it's not a user interface: Yeah , I do I don't know that . industrial designer: We're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ? project manager: No . industrial designer: we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad  public , so it should fit to every device . project manager:  Ruud , y do you agree ? marketing: Yeah , I think I think they're right , yeah . user interface:  Well , the techni fu technical function  what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the T_V_ . user interface: Well , that's just the fu the technical function is pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task  as an  as an  device .  but furthermore industrial designer: And you you see  the buttons as a as a means of doing this ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Or are there any o other controls ? user interface: Yeah , or maybe you want a touch-screen or industrial designer: Are there only any other cont Well , user interface: But industrial designer: I I've seen these remote controls with  this little stick  which you can move forward , sidewords . And  it's very easy for a user to to switch user interface: They're very vu vulnerable . industrial designer: to to switch b  between  channels or  change  between tracks on a on a C_D_ , on on a chapters , you know , on a D_V_D_ player .  point at a T_V_ , I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_ , industrial designer: user interface: Yeah , just don't even point it , so in that case infrared should  maybe  be restriction to that . project manager:  industrial designer:  is that  are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ? So when you're not able to point at the device  the range is very limited . For T_V_ , you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T_V_ , so I don't think think the range should be a problem to that , industrial designer: user interface: but if you want to  get it working with a radio , and you're in outside your garden with just one  speaker , then maybe the range should be  industrial designer: project manager: Okay , gentlemen ,   just a reminder , we d we have five minutes left for this meeting industrial designer: Okay . user interface:  You should able to feel the buttons without  it mis  you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons , so it should be as user interface  for feeling should be  good to understand . user interface: And of course you don't always know where all buttons are , so it should be visible al  in dark too . user interface: So when it's dark project manager: user interface: Those are two really  user interface project manager:  I'll write down glow in the dark . industrial designer: Do do you project manager:  do you have anything already w  ab idea about how the market  will respond to the such a product ? Or what we should take  in account when developing such a product ? marketing:  I think most most things have already been said , like  control multiple devices . project manager: Because ? marketing:  well , he said about n abo what he said about pointing . Okay , Sebastian , did you have any other ideas ? industrial designer:  well yes , I had ,  about three minutes ago , project manager: user interface: industrial designer: but I've seem to forget them forgot them . industrial designer:   would it be nice for a user to have display on this  remote control , on which you can see functions ? Which makes it easier to operate it . Well , maybe I  but it it can be quite simple , industrial designer: I I don't know . project manager: Yeah , yeah , okay , because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product . project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: Well , that's more project manager: twelve Euro fifty , yeah . I think the the financial part of this project  implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product . project manager: So  maybe we could  for example  only light the buttons that are   applicable at that moment or user interface: But  Necessary , yeah . user interface: 'Cause I think Bluetooth  industrial designer: It's use  a lot of  project manager: Well does it ? user interface: Yeah , I know it from the cell phone .  industrial designer: Well , cell phones have  integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it's it seems to work  quite okay . user interface: But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day .  next meeting starts in thirty minutes and  , well , you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it <doc-sep>project manager:  for the aim of this meeting now is to to make presentation about  the work for each one . user interface: project manager: And take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote control . project manager: and I think we don't need lighting adaptive , so the remote control should be only used for the the television . industrial designer: So  Well I have a PowerPoint pr presentation stored in my in my personal folder project manager: Here . project manager: industrial designer: Right , so  I will talk about the the w working design and user interface: F_ five . industrial designer: And  well I I will present my my first idea on how to build the our new remote control for television . So I think the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve  what we want to do . user interface: industrial designer: So   I'm thin  I think  I I'll do a survey about what is  what is available on the market and what what is the the cheapest possible things we hav we can use . Then  I will try with the technical team to to build a prototype and to see  with  h how this little box would  look look like . user interface: industrial designer: And how an and we can  start troubleshooting first  com communication problems or things like that . user interface: industrial designer: And when we are ready with this first prototype I I think we can add some software functionalities on a programmable chip like browsing by content or  things like that . Okay so can you go down  So , wha what I think for now is we don't want to have a remote control w which is wired user interface: project manager: industrial designer: so  I think we u we can use a battery for the . And the communication with the T_V_ set is  made through  infrared communication So  this is the the schema of the o of the future  remote controls user interface: Did you draw it ? marketing: project manager: Wow . industrial designer: so  you can you can see the components ,  battery and  the two chips goes to the infrared  connection to the T_V_ set . industrial designer: The one on top is for the  well the functionali the functionalities user interface: marketing: One is a communication . industrial designer: and the the th red  sorry the green one is is to well , putting things together ,  f transform the data into  qu into the format to to  to communicate with the T_V_ set . I think we should use a F_P_G_A_ for for the functionalities which is easy to to t user interface:  . What is F_P_G_A_ ? industrial designer: It's field programmable  something array . user interface: So why's it how is it different from the Bluetooth ? industrial designer: Well ,  a F_P_G_A_ is just a chip you can  you can pr programme it  wi with wh whatever you want . industrial designer: And  well the Bluetooth chip is just responsible to  make the communication  between  the two devices .  So this are the they have to work together ? Or ? Do they have to work together or two separate choice industrial designer: No . marketing: Or it's something like isn't hardware the first one ? And the second one is for the software . marketing: Okay , and how about the battery power ?  you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared ? industrial designer:  no no no no , I think  we have  to to  have  embedded  b batteries in in the project manager: . user interface: industrial designer: And  I I don't think it will need  very  much power to make it run , so user interface:  . user interface: Because you are using because you are using Bluetooth , if some people have P_D_A_ they can use their P_D_A_ to control the T_V_ if they want to , right ? industrial designer: That's a good idea . marketing: project manager: Ma industrial designer: Also , but but I I I think  the the goal is to sell our remote control . So the the purpose is to to find  the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have . user interface: and  and I found that  the function of remote control is to send messages to television set . user interface: For example switch on , switch off , switch the next channel and so on and so on . marketing: G user interface: So I found two very good prototypes for for this interface from our competitors industrial designer: user interface: so can you industrial designer: project manager: This are usual functionality . industrial designer: user interface: But then  loo but then I found if you look at you see on the left one there are too many buttons industrial designer: project manager: And they are small . O on the right I tried to play with the problem is that  if I have hundred channels I have  I have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and I have to compose the number industrial designer: Yeah . And then I I look at the user manual they are a hundred pages thick , so we don't want that . You can navigate on T_V_ screen and we can the user's preference and we need to have the T_V_ connected to internet so we end in order to access the T_V_ programmes by X_M_L_ and we need some to do some preprocessing . From the technical aspect , the processing should be done on the T_V_ set than on the on the remote controller , right ? industrial designer: user interface: And then we the speech recognition as  Harry says we may just put in we may K_I_V_ . project manager: What do you mean by the pa pa processing will be done on the T_V_ user interface: Yeah , all the processing is done the T_V_ is a compu has some processing power the project manager: than the industrial designer: So we have to t project manager: So we should have specific T_V_ ? Or ? We can use this . project manager: Yeah , we don't marketing: user interface: Yeah because are you just wondering what controller okay . industrial designer: I think there there is there is al there there is a a technology like show view who is already available on most of the T_V_ set on recorders or thing like that user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and we can try t to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because user interface: Okay . user interface: So i the processing on on the remote controller project manager: Yeah , user interface: so it can u be used in any T_V_ , any conventional T_V_ sets ? project manager: we . project manager: Keep the navigation industrial designer: We d we don't we we don't need really much buttons to i if we have a screen to navigate on on the T_V_ so  project manager: but user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: It's easy to build , user interface: industrial designer: it does not consume much power . marketing: Oh , but you have a catch there ,  assume that  if you want to go to if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine , then . user interface: industrial designer: Well , then y you you go to the main menu and  you have  go to channel user interface:  . No , because you choose by channel , so you choose by T_V_ program industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: but  I I think i i if you if you want to to make  well a a big jump but  well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could marketing: But project manager: So you are user interface: Ah . user interface: A mouse or industrial designer: Well , not a mouse but  something that that says more clearly that  right , left , up , down , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: well , the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator , maybe directly , or marketing:    . So it'll beep if you wanna find it marketing: too small that it goes under the sofa and we can't find it . project manager: user interface: you just  shout y h just it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device . user interface: And responds to you , and industrial designer: marketing: Yeah , that's right . marketing: Okay , after having the inputs from industrial design and user interface , I think most of the points which I want to are already covered here . user interface: marketing: And to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested , then what we have done is we have put a feedback forms in all the magazines , and the users send the feedbacks , and based on that These are the findings which we got and yeah adding of a speech interface is always good for a T_V_ remote but the technology We already know that as discussed earlier industrial designer: Well I I think it will be a , yes , a bit complicated to  make a speech recognisers runs on the small  ts user interface: project manager: marketing: An it does how feasible it is . I if you just recognise  numbers is a limited you have limited vocabulary marketing: Oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones . industrial designer: And this can allow to choose the the program , for instance without  adding  buttons user interface: Yeah . And of course most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive , project manager: marketing: so this is an important criteria here is user interface: But project manager: But do you think what they sug suggested s possibility . user interface: I no I I think that  i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with  reasonable cost . marketing: user interface: Maybe not less , but they may be willing to pay little bit more for comfort , marketing: Little bit more if it's with extra features . industrial designer: Well ,  project manager: There is in the marketing: for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes . industrial designer: marketing: Or they say movie name or I don't go for movie names but only for the numbers on the channel , or volume up , volume down , brightness , contrast . industrial designer: we we just have to find a mean how to to add a m a a a microphone or  well yes a microphone into the the remote control , so marketing: I think user interface: industrial designer: I well project manager: I think i industrial designer: it will be alright . project manager: What about lighting adaptive options ? marketing: Yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting , but I think  not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required . user interface: So you need s special T_V_ sets to do that ? Or it's it's done via this remote controller ? It's very complex . marketing:  industrial designer: Yeah , I think it's a bit complex too user interface: marketing:  yeah , it's for the  industrial design and users interface designers to decide if it's going to be working or not . industrial designer: For our next product , our new T_V_ set with  automatical  sound adjustment light marketing: I think project manager: user interface: Yeah , then we can conclude that . So any things to to discuss ? Or any suggestions ? user interface: marketing: I think as I discussed th that four points would be good for  marketing . And regarding the teletext  these are the subtitl these are the text information which you got on the televisions . marketing: And  if you are a French guy watching an English movie you would like to have it in French . industrial designer: marketing: So , the remote it should have some it should give me some flexibility of choosing the ch languages . industrial designer: Yeah , but well what about the the new project's requirement ? I I I think we should give up with teletext , no ? project manager: I think we we can we is the . Well , so maybe we we can j we can already think  about a way to to access the internet via the television . industrial designer: Because if user interface: Using the T_V_ to access the internet ? Or what ? I didn't quite understand industrial designer: Yeah , but  we can think that in a few years there will be T_V_ set that can access the internet . industrial designer: So it's a good idea if i i if we i if if we  think about how to to to build up our remote  control w with this functionality in a w which will c which will come in a few years . industrial designer: So if we already have it in our remote control project manager: So you have to anticipate the the future ? industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: well , not not to implement it , but to well , to find a way to to add to add this functionality in a yeah , in an in an easy manner , if is possible <doc-sep>"

        "Summary": "The marketing team highlighted three important trends: the desire for fancy and identifiable products, the need for technological innovation, and the importance of ease of use. Additionally, they noted that fruit and vegetable themes were popular, and the idea of a spongy texture was well-received. The group agreed that the remote control should resemble fruit and vegetables in shape and color, but the specific design was not yet determined. The industrial designer proposed two options: a titanium material with a fruity scent or a spongy and fruity-like material. However, the project manager stated that they couldn't have both options and suggested painting the controller to mimic titanium instead. The final decision was not made. The user interface designer suggested a red and yellow color scheme and two basic shapes, a circle and a triangle, referred to as the mushroom design. However, the marketing team disagreed with the mushroom design and decided to change it to a pineapple shape. The group decided to produce a mid-sized remote control with various components such as a printed circuit board, chip, transistor, scroll wheel, power cradle, locator, radio transmitter, antenna, speaker, double curves, LEDs, and buttons. The casing material would be a combination of rubber and plastic. Based on previous experiments and questionnaires, the marketing team found that most users considered remote controls to be ugly. Therefore, the group aimed to create a fancy-looking product to justify a higher price. However, determining what constitutes \"fancy\" was challenging due to differing opinions. The project manager agreed that the product should be visually appealing but cautioned against using too many colors to avoid increasing costs. Additionally, the project manager suggested incorporating an image that represents society on the remote control for easy recognition.",
        "Article": "And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly . industrial designer: project manager: user interface: industrial designer: Well , I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and  user interface:  . B did you send us an email about this ? project manager: not yet , user interface: industrial designer: project manager: but if you want user interface: Yeah , we we received an email about this  d designs . project manager: Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ? industrial designer: user interface: Ah it's Okay . marketing: I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . user interface: 'Kay , we can project manager: So there are so we have three user interface: So there are three kinds of designs , that's all . project manager: So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? Any any volunteer ? industrial designer: I think our  responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager . user interface: Are you using the you are doing the in industrial designer: Yeah I I'm I'm Well , maybe we have okay so I industrial design . It was a little confusion about my  project manager: user interface: Ah industrial designer: but it's alright . industrial designer: Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done project manager: industrial designer: and what are your ideas about the project manager: About the design or Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ? industrial designer: Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess . industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno I project manager: And of course it should not be very costly . industrial designer: Well I I think that Norman and I would think about  the technical points and  we should discuss it in the next meeting , or user interface: Need to collect information .  , what is most important in a in a remote control ? What is the most important function aspect ?  . project manager: You won't user interface: Or or you can say for example ,  I want  to list all the programme tonight . Y you know , instead of  remote control it's doing the some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . project manager: I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . user interface: No , because no , project manager: S user interface: it's not very a lot . industrial designer: I I think if you want t to choose  from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use  w  I dunno marketing: I'm a okay . marketing:  the main  function of remote control is to have something in the hand project manager: In the hand . marketing: If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog user interface: Yeah . marketing: if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . industrial designer: marketing:  we have some or something , different technology but project manager: This is it's user interface: Yeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that  there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea project manager: industrial designer: but I I think that technically it would be  a little bit   more tricky to to achieve this than just to user interface: No . They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . user interface: And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons . industrial designer: Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to  navigate  through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so project manager: This is good idea . Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? industrial designer: Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen user interface: Good idea . industrial designer: and just  with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f user interface: I think I think that will be revol revolutionary . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: Because all the T_V_  the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . So I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff user interface: Okay . project manager: So we have five minutes to user interface: Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . project manager: Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we industrial designer: user interface: Five minutes . marketing: And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of user interface: Okay . marketing: So , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark  some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . industrial designer: Oh right so user interface: Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: Be before before writing you can  sit and that says what we what we said user interface:  . So so the most functional des  the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . The user can choose w which one they want , right ? industrial designer: Yeah , by content or by channel , user interface: By content or by channel . user interface: Okay , so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content . industrial designer: I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so user interface: Okay . And  industrial designer: I think that's the the things to do user interface: The main thing . user interface: So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get  the funct this is the functional designer ? That's the first aspect . project manager: So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ? And we'll discuss the other other aspects <doc-sep> and I  like to show you the agenda for the meeting , I don't know if it was sent round to all of you . project manager: this is the the plan for today's meeting is  firstly just to introduce the project briefly ,  although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already . project manager:  then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings ,  specifically the whiteboard over there .  then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan  and discuss come up with some preliminary ideas about it .  we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product . The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . We're going the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that .  similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together . industrial designer: I'm a bit confused about  what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ?  i is it just  more detail ,  as I understand it ? project manager: I think it th w we're talking the the functional design is more your  area of things where you'll be we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control industrial designer: Right . project manager: and what what specific things it it has to do industrial designer: project manager: but the conceptual design is  perhaps bigger than that and includes the how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing . So whe where do we identify the components of our  product ?  I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ? project manager:  I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then industrial designer: Okay .  what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for for the project , specifically the whiteboard . project manager: So each person in turn , I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project . industrial designer: marketing: Why are you looking at me ? user interface: marketing: project manager: Would you like to go first ? marketing: Do I have a choice ? industrial designer: marketing: Okay . marketing: So , my name's Cat and I'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey industrial designer: project manager: marketing: so  user interface: marketing: Okay . industrial designer: project manager: marketing: Yeah , I don't think it's furry enough , so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit . industrial designer: marketing:  okay and I like it because it's small and it's fluffy . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: And one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink . project manager: Excellent , and what's your what's your role within the team ? marketing: I am the  I need my notebook ,  ooh industrial designer: marketing: top banana . Okay , cool , I am the Marketing Expert  so like I'm gonna be doing the apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything the user g requirements specification of the functional design ,  trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design project manager: industrial designer: project manager: And more about yourself , you're from ? marketing:  I'm from Leicester , project manager:  what else do you want to know ? industrial designer: marketing: I like sports  yeah , aerobics , kickboxing , spinning project manager: marketing:  and  project manager: But not with rabbits . project manager: There's a an if you have not enough room there's an eraser there and you can rub it off .  so   I'm the Interface Designer in this project and my favourite animal , I m  I'm not so sure because I'm not so so very  familiar with all kinds of animals , but I do like dogs . project manager: user interface: Oh , sorry , maybe I should have shouldn't have said it beforehand but industrial designer:  . project manager: industrial designer: marketing: user interface:  well , there are different kinds of dogs , but okay  . user interface:  yeah and I do like dogs because they are good friends to people and they are loyal . project manager: user interface:  yeah maybe maybe the fact that they protect their home as well , yeah . project manager: user interface:  I hope to be loyal to the project industrial designer: marketing: user interface: and not to n not to  let people doing similar projects know the details of our project or something , yeah . industrial designer: project manager: And where where are you from ? user interface: I'm from Estonia project manager: Estonia .  so is there anything else you'd like to know ? Oh , right , my roles , industrial designer: . user interface:  so  in the different  stages of the design , so at first I will be responsible for  for yeah , designing the technical functions of the   of the remote control  then in the in the conceptual design stage I need to  come up with  interface concept and then in the last  stage I will be responsible for the int infa for the user interface design . Okay  I'll do some I'll rub the features project manager: industrial designer: and let the drawing stay . user interface: industrial designer:  this is going to be marketing: They're not just like a big round body and then some really skinny legs industrial designer: Yeah , that'll do . industrial designer: Big , round body , really skinny legs marketing: project manager: industrial designer: and they've got a long tail marketing: industrial designer: and a long face . industrial designer: So this is what I like about cows marketing: Horns , project manager: user interface: industrial designer: that they just keeps sitting there eating grass , marketing: draw some horns . industrial designer: they do not disturb anybody  marketing: project manager: industrial designer: they're kind of Buddhist in a way .  my my role in the project is   the industrial designer , so I'm supposed to design all the details of of the product  ho how it works and whatever it'll  take during the functional role , what are the various functions that have to be performed by it  during the  conceptual design , what are the various components of it and  finally , I'm not too sure what was the last part .  the detailed design , I I guess it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other .  I'm doing my P_H_D_ in Psycholinguistics , I sit at the Department of Psychology . industrial designer: That doesn't look like a cow , does it ? project manager: Okay , here's a space . project manager:  I like dogs too , but I can't do that already because I can't draw a dog as well as you can . marketing: Is there a difference ? user interface: Is a ar are they also like lizards or are they project manager: They're Yeah , they're l it's a kind of lizard . user interface: yeah , they are project manager: And I I like geckos user interface: project manager: and , and where I was living in Cambodia they used to live in my house user interface: Ah . marketing: project manager: and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening . industrial designer: user interface: I hope you don't like snakes , do you ? project manager: I don't like snakes . project manager: I'm from Melbourne and I'm your Project Manager for today industrial designer:  . project manager: and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way , so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product . So , I've just thought marketing: If you right click on it you can project manager: yeah I've just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally as marketing: industrial designer: We've got  we're planning to sell these remote controls for let's make that go away , that means we've got five minutes .  so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target . Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about  what we're thinking of this remote control ? user interface: Yep . I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones . I think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us , industrial designer: project manager: but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be  included in this remote control that that are out of the ordinary . industrial designer: I think  i in the beginning  one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be  trendy , user friendly and original so  I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this . marketing: and the other things that they've made and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures . marketing: and  so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , you know ? project manager: marketing: So I'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that . marketing: You know , so something heading towards that , so it's not overly  I don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so I figure how many do you need , you know ? project manager: project manager: So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or industrial designer: marketing: Something that's a little less crowded than this , like  you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ? project manager: marketing: They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again . industrial designer: There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time , marketing: Sometimes they play a movie . marketing: there's no need to have buttons on it to do that , project manager: So , no . project manager: It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that . marketing: So , if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that's fine project manager: industrial designer:  . marketing: and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . marketing: 'Cause like if you look at the train , it's just very like , there's no extra bits on it , the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing project manager: Oh I haven't had a look yet , yep . marketing:  but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people , but it looks really pretty too .  we can aim for  we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although I don't think that  it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life , project manager: user interface: Yeah but   e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't  go like too far away from from the usual ones , because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems industrial designer: Yeah . So , i it should kind of fit in as well , and the stereotype of a project manager: It's like those fancy websites that you can't access industrial designer: yeah . project manager: because you have no idea how to get in , but the designers thought they were great . Okay , so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this .  we've got another meeting in thirty minutes , so you're you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im basically you're looking at the working design , industrial designer: Alright . project manager: you're looking at the technical functions design , and for you it's the user requirements specification , marketing: - <doc-sep>industrial designer: How are you today ? How was your business trip to Boston ? project manager:  well , actually I didn't go , didn't feel like it . user interface: You have the same message of  Windows cannot  marketing: user interface: sen oh stand-by . user interface: project manager:  I'm sure you've had a mail from our account manager about it .  Ruud is here as the Marketing Expert , Roo is here as the User Interface Designer and Sebastian is here  in the role of Industrial Designer . project manager:  we're going to do    a little tool training  for the tools we are going to use  during  the meetings we are going to have here .  then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan ,  and we will have a discussion .  is there any room for a little presentation ?  maybe during the discussion  section ? project manager: There is ? Yeah , there is . user interface: project manager:  okay , this new product we are are g are going to develop ,  it's a remote control , a television remote control . Those are kind of easy    goals ,  and I'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop .  we will discuss  later on more ideas about  how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things .  we are going to use a a pred a project method  during  this development ,  which consists of three different design stages .  the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design ,  all of these stages   mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then  meet to discuss our   the the the progressions , yes . project manager:  the first stage , the functional design  we are going to search for the user requirements , and we will  make a specific  specification of that .  the second is the technical functional design ,  what effect should the remote have ? Well in this case control t the the television I think .  to  presentate , to show us  a file you'll need to  place it in your project documents folder , which is on your desktop , at least it should be . project manager: sensors , so do not grab it here , but a lit more a little bit more to the  to the end .  you can insert a new  slide or or white-board   file  by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button . user interface: or should we only use it in the in the meetings ? project manager: Yeah , in the meetings , only in the meetings .  to  oh well , I'm I wrote down the documents  should be in the project documents folder if you want to  discuss it with us .  as a little training  I will ask Ruud first to draw   your own animal on a new slide  with  a different colour and a different line width than the one  now selected . marketing: project manager:  Roo , could you do the same please ? But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width . Well , it looked more than a bunny than a cat , but it works , industrial designer: Well , I'll give it a try . user interface: project manager: Okay , so  you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to .  user interface: industrial designer: marketing: project manager: we  we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold  , if there is market  interest ,  in in more than one country . And  the production costs should not be more than  twelve Euro fifty , so we should keep that in mind by  w w during the development ,  because  , well , those are important numbers . industrial designer: Yes ,  I have some technical  issues which I would like to present to you  before we start the discussion , because  there might be some  project manager: Limitations . I would like to think about  the implementation of  of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities . So if someone of you comes up with  ideas ,  I'll try to translate them in technical functions , but  there might be some impossibilities .  and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product . industrial designer: I have some  initial ideas about some things  which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming  discussion . user interface: And for a cell phone ? industrial designer: Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them . We're not  living in the  nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not  project manager: industrial designer: is not really  hot  technical stuff anymore . user interface: But Yeah , but the infrared , it's  , well , a little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that . user interface: But all the T_V_s are  equipped with infrared , so industrial designer: But it's cost-effective . user interface: Or you shou sh use a industrial designer: So marketing: user interface: you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote . So that's just my role , I'll just  give you  everybody some technical input , and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what  the product should be and how it should look , project manager: Yeah . project manager: Okay , so the the main por  the main points you are  telling us are focus on the inter  operability , industrial designer: Yes , project manager: and industrial designer: so one thing  one remote control should  control one or more  pieces of equipment , project manager: Okay , and and  industrial designer: and the way of communicating with these equipments .  there are other things like  how to make it trendy , which is I think   most  Ru  Ruud's  role . project manager: H how do you think the remote should  function for the user ? user interface: Well , I had a few  things in mind .  well , the interoperability , just like  Sebastian said ,  the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different   Yeah  , what is it , devices ? project manager: Yep . user interface:  so i i I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in  a store . user interface: It's not for  for  for  Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product , project manager: Okay , so we're we're going business to consumer , user interface: right ? project manager: not we're we're it's not a user interface: Yeah , I do I don't know that . industrial designer: We're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ? project manager: No . industrial designer: we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad  public , so it should fit to every device . project manager:  Ruud , y do you agree ? marketing: Yeah , I think I think they're right , yeah . user interface:  Well , the techni fu technical function  what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the T_V_ . user interface: Well , that's just the fu the technical function is pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task  as an  as an  device .  but furthermore industrial designer: And you you see  the buttons as a as a means of doing this ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Or are there any o other controls ? user interface: Yeah , or maybe you want a touch-screen or industrial designer: Are there only any other cont Well , user interface: But industrial designer: I I've seen these remote controls with  this little stick  which you can move forward , sidewords . And  it's very easy for a user to to switch user interface: They're very vu vulnerable . industrial designer: to to switch b  between  channels or  change  between tracks on a on a C_D_ , on on a chapters , you know , on a D_V_D_ player .  point at a T_V_ , I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_ , industrial designer: user interface: Yeah , just don't even point it , so in that case infrared should  maybe  be restriction to that . project manager:  industrial designer:  is that  are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ? So when you're not able to point at the device  the range is very limited . For T_V_ , you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T_V_ , so I don't think think the range should be a problem to that , industrial designer: user interface: but if you want to  get it working with a radio , and you're in outside your garden with just one  speaker , then maybe the range should be  industrial designer: project manager: Okay , gentlemen ,   just a reminder , we d we have five minutes left for this meeting industrial designer: Okay . user interface:  You should able to feel the buttons without  it mis  you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons , so it should be as user interface  for feeling should be  good to understand . user interface: And of course you don't always know where all buttons are , so it should be visible al  in dark too . user interface: So when it's dark project manager: user interface: Those are two really  user interface project manager:  I'll write down glow in the dark . industrial designer: Do do you project manager:  do you have anything already w  ab idea about how the market  will respond to the such a product ? Or what we should take  in account when developing such a product ? marketing:  I think most most things have already been said , like  control multiple devices . project manager: Because ? marketing:  well , he said about n abo what he said about pointing . Okay , Sebastian , did you have any other ideas ? industrial designer:  well yes , I had ,  about three minutes ago , project manager: user interface: industrial designer: but I've seem to forget them forgot them . industrial designer:   would it be nice for a user to have display on this  remote control , on which you can see functions ? Which makes it easier to operate it . Well , maybe I  but it it can be quite simple , industrial designer: I I don't know . project manager: Yeah , yeah , okay , because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product . project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: Well , that's more project manager: twelve Euro fifty , yeah . I think the the financial part of this project  implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product . project manager: So  maybe we could  for example  only light the buttons that are   applicable at that moment or user interface: But  Necessary , yeah . user interface: 'Cause I think Bluetooth  industrial designer: It's use  a lot of  project manager: Well does it ? user interface: Yeah , I know it from the cell phone .  industrial designer: Well , cell phones have  integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it's it seems to work  quite okay . user interface: But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day .  next meeting starts in thirty minutes and  , well , you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it "

        "Query": "What were the group's thoughts on the safety design, kinetic battery idea, wood case, and shape of the remote control during their discussion on the design and concept decisions?",
        "Summary": "The team reached a consensus that the remote control should have a waterproof design and be baby-proof to prevent any accidents. It was also agreed that the remote should have voice control functionality for children who may not be tall enough to operate it manually. Additionally, a child lock feature was deemed necessary. The group acknowledged the benefits of using a kinetic battery, but cost and reliability were concerns compared to a regular battery. They suggested using a cheaper chip to balance out the cost of the kinetic battery technology. The User Interface team expressed difficulty in keeping the remote small with a wood case, as the Industrial Designer believed it would be prone to breakage. The Project Manager proposed using rubber or plastic instead, considering practicality and ease of cleaning. The idea of creating fruit or vegetable-shaped remotes was discussed, with the understanding that only the exterior shape would change while the PCB remained the same. The team also considered offering customers customizable skins.",
        "Article": "industrial designer: Is there any time for a cup of coffee ? user interface: We have a slight problem . project manager: Sorry ? industrial designer: Can I get a cup of coffee ? project manager:  no . project manager:  then  the three of you  prepared a presentation , I think ? Sebastian ? industrial designer: I think so too . user interface: industrial designer: project manager: Then we'll do your one   as la  the last .  the top goal of this m user interface: But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe . project manager:  the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group  and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind .  the new project requirements , first of all ,  we didn't speak about it , but we should not  support teletext in the remote ,  because our b  board  feels that  teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext .  the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not  f  feasible , it's not  w user interface: Yeah . project manager:   we we cannot make it because of the time to market  that we have to deal with . project manager:  the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than  forty , which is important for you ,  Ruud , and as well for  Roo .  then for Roo , as well  important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product .  the individual presentations , I th  Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ? user interface: Yeah , I'll start .  the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . user interface: Then I found  two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function  remote control with many possibilities , but  the lack of the feeling I already mentioned  in the previous  discussion . user interface: And the ease-of-use remote control with  the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . My personal preferences were ease of  the easy to use remote control , because  the user-friendliness and  it can be more trendy in in user design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not  in our design . But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is  the best  possi possibility for us . project manager: Okay , so marketing: project manager: the important thing here is user interface: And it's also i indeed   Ruud's  insight in the in the topic . project manager: Yeah , okay , w we will s we all  user interface: Just for  for user desi  user  friendliness I  should choose for the the ease of use remote control .  well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . user interface: industrial designer:  basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by  sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to  implement a picture here , user interface: Energies and  industrial designer: but it's hardly readable . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using  infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . It's almost every piece of equipment  every piece of  every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . And I think that's what we w user interface: The glow in the dark  concept  we discussed . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . industrial designer: and I think we should  we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . industrial designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared , because  otherwise our device cannot  communicate with  almost every T_V_ set . And  if we want to use  a rechargeable design or  a energy-save design , we should really implement them .  for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost  circuit board ,  because most of the production cost are are in this  part of the equipment . industrial designer: And  the money we save on using this we can use  for elaborate fancy lighting  techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . user interface: And what's the  industrial designer: I think our  users will really  will really like that . user interface: if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or industrial designer: No , they're p f  power friendly LEDs also . user interface: For the same costs , it's can be  in our industrial designer:  no , they're  they're a little bit more expensive , but by    making user interface: Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's  industrial designer: We can we can make its I think . project manager: Yeah , but but the question is whether  two or four buttons makes  m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to  include fancy lightning techniques , I guess . user interface: Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , marketing: true . Well , it's not one light , it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . project manager: Okay well , industrial designer: project manager: we ar we are very curio curious to what the market  will feel about such a product . marketing: But  since  the other part is  forty percent of the market , I  thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . The buttons to zap are used the about  fifteen hundred times , when  the power button is only used one time . So user interface: Yeah , well it should just have a design The perfect design for those only those buttons . Just one thing I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? industrial designer: Well marketing: Yeah , that's  a problem . project manager: Well industrial designer: Usually project manager: maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , user interface: It should be   project manager: like  turning on and off the the the lights . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a  kind of weird sound , and your  remote controls then start to beep . project manager: But  th user interface: But but T_V_s don't have all   buttons . marketing: And you project manager: Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home  user interface: But I believe you will have an marketing: Yeah , and usually industrial designer: We do not control the T_V_ set so well . marketing: And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button ,  you would have to walk to your T_V_ , industrial designer: Yes , m yes . S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , marketing: and it's project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so we should think about project manager: So what about the clapping technique ?  because you se user interface: I'm convinced  Sebastian will  find  one solution for us . marketing: And b project manager: Well , you see it a lot in in light  lightning   industrial designer: Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics  the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , project manager: Yeah , a peak . industrial designer: But there are many other sounds  which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . industrial designer: Yes , user interface: But we can have just   a home stat  f a base station next to the T_V_ . user interface: Well if you lost th industrial designer: Well , project manager: Well  industrial designer: is there not something f something more easily user interface: I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . user interface:  that's just  industrial designer: No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and  b  perform a a some kind of  . You do not want another device , which can be  everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . project manager: Yeah , m maybe  w we  we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . project manager:  maybe Sebastian should have  a detailed look later on and  come up with a solution , industrial designer: But  before I do that I w I want to warn you that  by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated project manager: And there are some implepe imp user interface: And do we even  prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning  function ? industrial designer: Well , I I think so , because  when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . user interface: It's a unique item  project manager: Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . project manager: and  I think  it's worth   looking and and probably more i interesting than  than the lights . user interface: And just about  the user interface , I came up with  an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . marketing: Well , t  we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function . project manager: Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players  and all kind of stuff . user interface: So industrial designer: we should save costs  by not implementing a lot of functions and  the money that we can save from that we should use for  having a nice design and  thinking about the user interface project manager: Yeah . Okay , industrial designer: and project manager: Ruud , how do you feel about that ?  do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to  a simple marketing:  well if we  include other  innovative functions  then they  might , project manager: user interface:  just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated ,  because it has many functions . industrial designer: Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very  friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but  nevertheless project manager: But but are we not in in the in the manual   if you have few buttons , no display ,    I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and  one button can  industrial designer: Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . project manager: But but how does how does the remote  report  r  give back to the user w in what state it is ? user interface: Yeah , I don't know yet . There's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . project manager: I know , but but if we use  like a stick , for example ,  industrial designer: W When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe  a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just  pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t  turned up the volume . marketing: And if you use that stick for volume control and channel  selection , you have the m two most important functions in one  button . user interface: But does it  I then should n just use  i instead of the stick ,  like many cell phones , just a round m well , project manager: Yeah , draw draw it on the board . Oh user interface: It's just an easy  way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . user interface: A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down project manager: Yeah , it can break down . marketing: And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it  attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . project manager: Okay , but w we still we're still in the question of    putting in advanced options .  we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , I think . user interface: Yes ? project manager: We need to  have the  the user function  the functions decided and   our target audience . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ?  which  incorporates all function available on the device ? project manager:  well , I do not want a full  it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want  the kind of functions , for example  th the most important are volume and  programme selecting . l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but user interface: Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to  two channels , when you have  something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can  change industrial designer: project manager: Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last  Mielsen . industrial designer: but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . project manager: And and do we want  the ten digits ? user interface: The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so . industrial designer: Well , are are you sure ? marketing: Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . industrial designer: but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think but you should  shou you should know that . industrial designer: Okay , user interface:  and I think the most industrial designer: I can imagine when project manager: I agree actually . user interface: Just elder elder people would would buy it , industrial designer: I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . marketing: Well user interface: but industrial designer: But if you're  a regular T_V_ user , and you just want  to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can  you can use  about ten buttons . industrial designer: Well , marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: but how how often do you watch all these channels ? marketing: and if if we And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . Don't you think ? project manager: Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the industrial designer: The design . marketing: Well project manager: You c you can d make them very fancy marketing: And project manager: by   Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . industrial designer: Okay , so you can experiment by  with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .  it might be expensive and  hard to implement , but it would be a solution  for project manager: Okay , speech . industrial designer: So  when you add  speech recognition to your remote control ,  it's very easy to change  the channel . industrial designer: So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . project manager:  If if we would  drop the ten digits industrial designer: But maybe when we  project manager: but keep the programme and the volume , industrial designer: It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find  find the remote control button  remote control function . industrial designer: There are some  hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . industrial designer: So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . project manager: But But but can we manage it bu  for the costs ? industrial designer: You have to do nothing for it . marketing: And  if we if we could inc  include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be  a big problem . marketing: 'Cause when project manager: Is a cradle very cheap ? industrial designer: It's Oh , it's very cheap .  I would like to hear  maybe maybe you all have th  things not  spoken about , yeah , but that are important .  are there other things about the market we should know ? marketing:  I think we dealt with the most important information . project manager: Sebastian ? industrial designer:  I just want to make a summary of all all things  spoken and  the different possibilities . So on the outside it looks easy , but  we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by  implementing  speech techniques ,  voice recognition , that these kinds of things .  there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement  fancy techniques , which  I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about  the the costs and  the things like  battery lifetime , energy saving . industrial designer:  another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons . If we just add   a chip which does the voice recognition ,  our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another project manager: Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board industrial designer: well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . user interface: But the cheaper the ch  the the chip or th what was it ? industrial designer: project manager: No , it's th industrial designer: The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . user interface: Well it then we should just  take a look at the costs and  especially for the voice recognition . project manager: I'm not sure how how we'll f  determine the costs , I will have a look at it . project manager:  I'm not sure how how that industrial designer: Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will  have a lo  look at it . project manager:  I'm don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out . project manager:  then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work ,  and I'm sure your personal coaches will  assist you with it . project manager: User Interface Designer ,  Roo , I would like to see the user interface c  concept . project manager: And  user interface:  the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis  decisions Sebastian makes . industrial designer: Well project manager: Well , i it should be easy , user interface: Well project manager: that's w w what we concluded . industrial designer: So we drop the voice recognition ? project manager: No no no , we didn't industrial designer: Or project manager: but it shouldn't be integrated industrial designer: Oh . project manager: yeah , it's of course it's user interface , but  i I was talking about really the design of the industrial designer: Okay <doc-sep>marketing: user interface: industrial designer: marketing: industrial designer: project manager: user interface:  project manager: industrial designer: user interface: No , no . Not all the small buttons , you don't know project manager: Is this positive or negative , that  big buttons ? industrial designer: Big buttons , positive . industrial designer: All all small buttons like when you have  like a hundred buttons on your remote control , you won't know what they're working for . What are your experiences ? user interface:  well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the T_V_ set . And  I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED   a LED on the corner of the of the remote . And that if you push the button the LED  gives a light , and  and you see that it's working .  project manager: So and do they always have that ? user interface: Yeah , but No no no . marketing:  at home we have a T_V_ , a video  recorder , a D_V_D_ player , and a satellite receiver . But  i it it had a lot of buttons on it , and you didn't know which one was what . So what ideas do you have for it , for the new remote control ? What what does it have to have ? industrial designer: The weight . industrial designer: When you push a but a button on the T_V_ , then you hear some  some sort of bleep . industrial designer: marketing: Yeah I think it  from a marketing point of view , it also has to look nice . So you don't won't have to change the batteries  once a week or  once every two weeks <doc-sep>And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly . industrial designer: project manager: user interface: industrial designer: Well , I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and  user interface:  . B did you send us an email about this ? project manager: not yet , user interface: industrial designer: project manager: but if you want user interface: Yeah , we we received an email about this  d designs . project manager: Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ? industrial designer: user interface: Ah it's Okay . marketing: I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . user interface: 'Kay , we can project manager: So there are so we have three user interface: So there are three kinds of designs , that's all . project manager: So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? Any any volunteer ? industrial designer: I think our  responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager . user interface: Are you using the you are doing the in industrial designer: Yeah I I'm I'm Well , maybe we have okay so I industrial design . It was a little confusion about my  project manager: user interface: Ah industrial designer: but it's alright . industrial designer: Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done project manager: industrial designer: and what are your ideas about the project manager: About the design or Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ? industrial designer: Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess . industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno I project manager: And of course it should not be very costly . industrial designer: Well I I think that Norman and I would think about  the technical points and  we should discuss it in the next meeting , or user interface: Need to collect information .  , what is most important in a in a remote control ? What is the most important function aspect ?  . project manager: You won't user interface: Or or you can say for example ,  I want  to list all the programme tonight . Y you know , instead of  remote control it's doing the some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . project manager: I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . user interface: No , because no , project manager: S user interface: it's not very a lot . industrial designer: I I think if you want t to choose  from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use  w  I dunno marketing: I'm a okay . marketing:  the main  function of remote control is to have something in the hand project manager: In the hand . marketing: If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog user interface: Yeah . marketing: if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . industrial designer: marketing:  we have some or something , different technology but project manager: This is it's user interface: Yeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that  there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea project manager: industrial designer: but I I think that technically it would be  a little bit   more tricky to to achieve this than just to user interface: No . They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . user interface: And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons . industrial designer: Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to  navigate  through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so project manager: This is good idea . Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? industrial designer: Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen user interface: Good idea . industrial designer: and just  with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f user interface: I think I think that will be revol revolutionary . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: Because all the T_V_  the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . So I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff user interface: Okay . project manager: So we have five minutes to user interface: Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . project manager: Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we industrial designer: user interface: Five minutes . marketing: And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of user interface: Okay . marketing: So , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark  some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . industrial designer: Oh right so user interface: Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: Be before before writing you can  sit and that says what we what we said user interface:  . So so the most functional des  the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . The user can choose w which one they want , right ? industrial designer: Yeah , by content or by channel , user interface: By content or by channel . user interface: Okay , so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content . industrial designer: I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so user interface: Okay . And  industrial designer: I think that's the the things to do user interface: The main thing . user interface: So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get  the funct this is the functional designer ? That's the first aspect . project manager: So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ? And we'll discuss the other other aspects "

        "Query": "What are the current thoughts on using XML tools and the status of transcription?",
        "Summary": "Summary:\nGrad H mentioned that they were working on standardizing data in XML format, but expressed dissatisfaction with the current format. They were also developing tools to extract information from XML files using Java and Perl. The transcriber pool has been meeting expectations in terms of work completed within the allocated time. Grad D explained the importance of combining different experts in the network to adapt to various situations, suggesting dividing the network into parts and allowing it to determine which experts to trust in each situation. The transcriber pool is making good progress and may be utilized for other coding tasks in the future, such as analyzing speaker overlap. They are also coding non-speech gestures like breaths and laughter to improve recognition results. The group reviewed transcription checking procedures and discussed coordinating data channelization and presegmentation with tighter time bins.",
        "Article": "But  we 're gonna try to make this an abbreviated meeting cuz the the next next occupants were pushing for it , so . Agenda is according to this , is transcription status , DARPA demos XML tools , disks , backups , et cetera and grad h: Does anyone have anything to add to the agenda ? professor b: OK . grad h:  phd d: I g grad h: as a somewhat segue into the next topic ,  could I get a hold of  the data even if it 's not really corrected yet just so I can get the data formats and make sure the information retrieval stuff is working ? postdoc a: Certainly . So I 'll I 'll probably just make some copies of those rather than use the ones that are there . grad h:  and then just we 'll have to remember to delete them once the corrections are made . professor b: OK , wh phd d: I also got anot a short remark to the transcription . I 've  just processed the first five EDU meetings and they are chunked up so they would they probably can be sent to IBM whenever they want them . phd d: but the other ones phd f: That 's the one that we 're waiting to hear from them on . postdoc a: These are separate from the ones that phd f: As soon as postdoc a: these are phd f: They 're the IBM set . And so as soon as we hear from Brian that this one is OK grad h: Is my mike on ? Yeah . phd f: and we get the transcript back and we find out that hopefully there are no problems matching up the transcript with what we gave them , then  we 'll be ready to go and we 'll just send them the next four as a big batch , postdoc a: Excellent . grad h: And so we 're doing those as disjoint from the ones we 're transcribing here ? phd f: Yes , exactly . phd f: We 're sort of doing things in parallel , that way we can get as much done a at once . grad h: Yeah , I think that 's the right way to do it , phd f: Yeah . grad h: Right , which  So I 've been working on using the THISL tools to do information retrieval on meeting data and the THISL tools are there 're two sets , there 's a back - end and a front - end , so the front - end is the user interface and the back - end is the indexing tool and the querying tool . So at least on the one meeting that I had the transcript for  conveniently you can now do information retrieval on it , do type in a a string and get back a list of start - end times for the meeting , phd f: What what kind of  what does that look like ? The string that you type in . phd f: What are you are you are they keywords , or are they ? grad h: Keywords . grad h: Right ? And so and then it munges it to pass it to the THISL IR which uses an SGML - like format for everything . professor b: And then does it play something back or that 's something you 're having to program ? grad h: right now , I have a tool that will do that on a command line using our standard tools , professor b: Yeah . grad h: but my intention is to do a prettier user interface based either So so that 's the other thing I wanted to discuss , is well what should we do for the user interface ? We have two tools that have already been written . grad h:  the other option is Dan did the Tcl - TK THISL GUI front - end for Broadcast News professor b: Yeah . postdoc a: I Can I ask a question ? So  as it stands within the the Channeltrans interface , it 's possible to do a find and a play . So e Are you So you 're adding like  , I don't know ,  are they fuzzy matches or are they  ? grad h: It 's a sort of standard , text - retrieval - based So it 's  term frequency , inverse document frequency scoring . grad h:  and then there are all sorts of metrics for spacing how far apart they have to be and things like that . So it it 's postdoc a: It 's a lot more sophisticated than the  the basically Windows - based grad h: i it 's like doing a Google query or anyth anything else like that . grad h: So i it uses So it pr produces an index ahead of time so you don't you 're not doing a linear search through all the documents . Cuz you can imagine if with if we have the sixty hours ' worth you do wouldn't wanna do a search . grad h:  you have to do preindexing and so that these tools do all that . And so the work to get the front - end to work would be porting it well  to get it to work on the UNIX systems , our side is just rewriting them and modifying them to work for meetings . grad h: So that it understands that they 're different speakers and that it 's one big audio file instead of a bunch of little ones and just sorta things like that . phd f: So what does the user see as the result of the query ? grad h: On which tool ? phd f: THISL . grad h: The THISL GUI tool which is the one that Dan wrote , Tcl - TK phd f: Yeah . grad h:  you type in a query and then you get back a list of hits and you can type on them and listen to them . professor b: Mmm phd f: So if you typed in \" small heads \" or something you could grad h: Right , you 'd get phd f: get back a   something that would let you click and listen to some audio where that phrase had occurred grad h: something You you 'd get to listen to \" beep \" . It 's too bad that that couldn't come into the grad h: You couldn't get a video . phd g: Guess who I practice on ? postdoc a: At some point we 're gonna have to say what that private joke is , that keeps coming up . Yeah , it loo it my my recollection of it is it 's it 's a pretty reasonable  demo sort of format . grad h: And so I think there 'd be minimal effort to get it to work , minimally phd f: That sounds really neat . grad h: and then we 'd wanna add things like query by speaker and by meeting and all that sort of stuff .  Dave Gelbart expressed some interest in working on that so I 'll work with him on it . And it it 's looking pretty good , you know , the fact that I got the query system working . grad h: If we wanna get it to Windows it 's gonna be a little more work because the THISL IR , the information retrieval tool 's  , I had difficulty just compiling them on Solaris . phd f: But you were saying that that the  that there 's that set of tools , Cygnus tools , that grad h: So . grad h: But what those they what those do is provide sort of a BSD compatibility layer , professor b:   phd f: And you have to have all the o grad h: But the problem is that that the THISL tools didn't use anything like Autoconf and so you have the normal porting problems of different header files and th some things are defined and some things aren't and  different compiler work - arounds and so on . So the fact that  it took me a day to get it c to compile under Solaris means it 's probably gonna take me s significantly more than that to get it to compile under Windows . professor b: How about having it run under free BSD ? phd e: Well what you need grad h: Free BSD would probably be easier . phd e: All you need to do is say to Dan \" gee it would be nice if this worked under Autoconf \" and it 'll be done in a day . phd d:  phd e: Right ? grad h: Actually you know I should check because he did port it to SPRACHcore phd e: Right . professor b: So grad h: I 'll check at that professor b: But it would what would serve would serve both purposes , is if you contact him and ask him if he 's already done it . phd e: What I phd f: How does it play ? grad h: Yeah , right . professor b: If he has then you learn , if he hasn't then he 'll do it . So , and I 've been corresponding with Dan and also with   , SoftSound guy ,  postdoc a: It 's amazing . professor b: Tony Robinson ? phd f: Tony Robinson ? grad h: Do  Tony ? I guess I do . grad h: Which one do  ? phd e: Steve Renals is not SoftSound , is he ? professor b: No . grad h: so that 's all going pretty well , professor b: Assuming we 're phd e: Right . phd f: What about issues of playing sound files @ @ between the two platforms ? grad h: I think we 'll be OK with that . phd e: Why don't you try and merge Transcriber and THISL IR ? They 're both Tcl interfaces . grad h: Well this is one of the reasons This is the one of the reasons that I 'm gonna have  Dave Gelbart Gelbart Having him volunteer to work on it is a really good thing because he 's worked on the Transcriber stuff phd e: Right . But the point is that the Transcriber uses Snack and then you can but you can use a a lot of the same functionality and it 's grad h: Yeah , yeah , I I think THISL THISL GUI probably uses Snack . Well my thought was is that it would be nice it would be nice to have the running transcripts  eh you know , from speaker to speaker . grad h: And if it doesn't phd e: Right ? Do you have you have , you know , a speaker mark here and a speaker mark here ? grad h: Right , we 'll have to figure out a user interface for that , so . It might be fairly difficult to get that to work in the little short segments we 'd be talking about and having the search tools and so on . grad h: but professor b: The thing I was asking about with , free BSD is that it might be easier to get PowerPoint shows running in free BSD than to get this other package running in grad h: Yeah ,  we have to I have to sit down and try it before I make too many judgments , professor b: Yeah . grad h: so   My experience with the Gnu compatibility library is really it 's just as hard and just as easy to port to any system . grad h: It 's just , you know , just like all of them , the \" include \" files are a little different and the function calls are a little different . grad h: So I it might be a little easier but it 's not gonna be a lot easier . So there was that demo , which was one of the main ones , then we talked about  some other stuff which would basically be  showing off the the Transcriber interface itself and as you say , maybe we could even merge those in some sense , but but  ,  and part of that was showing off what the speech - non  nonspeech stuff that Thilo has done s looks like . postdoc a: Can I ask one more thing about THISL ? So with the IR stuff then you end up with a somewhat prioritized  ? grad h:   phd g: So another idea I w t had just now actually for the demo was whether it might be of interest to sh to show some of the prosody  work that Don 's been doing . phd g:  actually show some of the features and then show for instance a task like finding sentence boundaries or finding turn boundaries . professor b: Well I think at at the very least we 're gonna want something illustrative with that phd g: I don't know if that would be of interest or not . professor b: cuz I 'm gonna want to talk about it and so i if there 's something that shows it graphically it 's much better than me just having a bullet point phd g: Yeah . professor b: pointing at something I don't know much about , phd g: you 're looking at this now professor b: so . phd g: Are you looking at Waves or Matlab ? grad c:  yeah I 'm starting to and  Yeah we can probably find some examples of different type of prosodic events going on . phd g: Yeah def professor b: S so when we here were having this demo meeting , what we 're sort of coming up with is that we wanna have all these pieces together , to first order , by the end of the month phd g: I professor b: and then that 'll give us a week or so . The end of phd g: Oh , the end of this month or next month ? Oh , you mean like today ? grad h: This month . professor b:  that 'll that 'll give us that 'll give us a week or so to  to port things over to my laptop and make sure that works , phd e: Exactly . phd g: Yeah if d if Don can sort of talk to whoever 's professor b: Yeah . phd g: cuz we 're doing this anyway as part of our you know , the research , visualizing what these features are doing professor b: Yeah . professor b: so  , you know , to let s the goal is to let them know what it is we 're doing . professor b: So that 's phd g: I don't think anyone has done this on meeting data so it might be neat , you know . So I 've been doing a bunch of XML tools where you we 're sort of moving to XML as the general format for everything and I think that 's definitely the right way to go because there are a lot of tools that let you do extraction and reformatting of XML tools . So yet again we should probably meet to talk about transcription formats in XML because I 'm not particularly happy with what we have now .  it works with Transcriber but it it 's a pain to use it in other tools  because it doesn't mark start and end .  , but I 've installed XML tools of various sorts in various languages and so if people are interested in doing extracting any information from any of these files , either  information on users because the user database is that way I 'm converting the Key files to XML so that you can extract m  various inf  sorted information on individual meetings grad c: Cool . And so l just let me know there it 's mostly Java and Perl but we can get other languages too if if that 's desirable . Is do we have the the seat information ? In in the Key files now ? postdoc a:   grad h: The seat information is on the Key files for the ones which postdoc a: Ah . phd g: Oh in For the new one grad h: it 's been recorded , phd g: OK . phd g: I 'm just trying to figure out , you know , when Morgan 's voice appears on someone 's microphone are they next to him or are they across from him ? professor b: Yeah . phd f: how how w eh where is it in the Key file ? grad h: Right . phd g: Cuz  I haven't been putting it in and in by grad h: You haven't been putting it in . postdoc a: Isn't it always on the digits ? professor b: Some of these are missing . phd g: And professor b: Aren't they ? postdoc a: Isn't it always on the digits forms ? professor b: Some fall out of phd g: Well it grad h: Yeah so we can go back and fill them in for the ones we have . phd g:  they 're on th right , these , but I just hadn't ever been putting it in the Key files . phd f: Yeah I I never phd g: And I don't think Chuck was either phd f: I never knew we were supposed to put it in the Key file . phd g: cuz grad h: I had told you guys about it phd f: Oh really ? phd g: Oh , so we 're both sorry . grad h: but phd g: So grad h:  this is why I wanna use a g a tool to do it rather than the plain text phd g: OK . grad h: I think it 's Edit - key , command Did I show you guys that ? phd d: Yep . phd f: You mentioned it , grad h: I did show it to you , phd f: yeah . grad h: but I think you both said \" no , you 'll just use text file \" . grad h: Yeah , and so if you don't fill it in , you 're not gonna get it in the meetings . grad c: u grad h: Yeah and then the other thing also that Thilo noticed is , on the microphone , on channel zero it says hand - held mike or Crown mike , phd g: Yeah . phd g: maybe I forgot to d phd f: Takes me no time at all to edit these . grad h: Yeah that 's cuz you kn phd f: I 'm not doing anything . phd g: And I was I was looking at Chuck 's , like , \" oh what did Chuck do , OK I 'll do that \" . grad h: And then  also in a couple of places instead of filling the participants under \" participants \" they were filled in under \" description \" . Oh  also I 'm working on another version of this tool , the the one that shows up here , that will flash yellow if the mike isn't connected . And it 's not quite ready to go yet because  it 's hard to tell whether the mike 's connected or not because the best quality ones , the Crown ones , are about the same level if they 're off and no one 's o off or if they 're on and no one 's talking . So I 'm working on that and it it sorta works and so eventually we will change to that and then you 'll be able to see graphically if your mike is dropping in or out . grad c: Will that also include like batteries dying ? Just a any time the mike 's putting out zeros basically . phd f: But with the screensaver kicking in , it phd d: But grad h: Now phd d: y yeah . grad h:  the other thing is as I 've said before , it is actually on the thing . postdoc a: It would be nice if if these had little light indicators , little L E Ds for grad h:  buzzer . grad h: \" Bamp , bamp ! \" professor b: Small shocks postdoc a: Yeah . Oh grad h: OK , disk backup , et cetera ?  I spoke with Dave Johnson about putting all the Meeting Recorder stuff on non - backed - up disk to save the overhead of backup and he pretty much said \" yeah , you could do that if you want \" but he thought it was a bad idea . In fact what he said is doing the manual one , doing  NW archive to copy it is a good idea and we should do that and have it backed up . grad h: And so if a mistake is made and we lose the backup we should have the archive and if then a mistake is made and we lose the archive we should have the backup . professor b: Well I guess it is true that even with something that 's backed up it 's not gonna if it 's stationary it 's not going to go through the increment it 's not gonna burden things in the incremental backups . But he said that that we sh shouldn't worry too much about that , that we 're getting a new backup system and we 're far enough away from saturation on full backups that it 's w probably OK . professor b: Really ? grad h: And  , so the only issue here is the timing between getting more disks and  recording meetings . professor b: So I guess the idea is that we would be reserving the non - backed - up space for things that took less than twenty - four hours to recreate or something like that , right ? grad h: Things that are recreatable easily and also Yeah , basically things that are recreatable . professor b: Well I was allowing someone else to come up with something related that they had  phd e: I thought you guys were gonna burn C Ds ? grad h:  unfortunately we could burn C Ds but first of all it 's a pain . grad h: Because you have to copy it down to the PC and then burn it and that 's a multi - step procedure . And second of all the the write - once burners as opposed to a professional press don't last . grad h: So I think burning them for distribution is fine but burning them for backup is not a good idea . Can I add one top topic ? We have time ? I wanted to ask , I know that  that Thilo you were , bringing the Channeltrans interface onto the Windows machine ? And I wanted to know is th phd d: Yeah it 's it Basically it 's done , postdoc a: It 's all done ? That 's g wonderful . grad h: Yes , since Tcl - TK runs on it , basically things 'll just work . phd d: Yeah it Yeah , it was just a problem with the Snack version and the Transcriber version but it 's solved . Does this mean that the that this could be por  ported to a Think - Pad note or some other type of  phd d: Yeah , basically  I did install it on my laptop and yeah postdoc a: Wonderful . CrossPads ? CrossPads ? grad h:  got an email from  James Landay who basically said \" if you 're not using them , could you return them ? \" So he said he doesn't need them , he just periodically w at the end of each term sends out email to everyone who was recorded as having them and asks them if they 're still using them . professor b: Once ? grad h: We we used them a couple times , postdoc a:   phd f: Them ? There 's more than one ? grad h: but postdoc a: Yeah . professor b: But grad h: My opinion on it is , first , I never take notes anyway so I 'm not gonna use it ,  and second , it 's another level of infrastructure that we have to deal with . postdoc a: And I have  so my my feeling on it is that I think in principle it 's a really nice idea , and you have the time tags which makes it better tha than just taking ra raw notes . On the other hand , I the down side for me was that I think the pen is really noisy . And I and I don't know if it 's audible on the but I I sort of thought that was a disadvantage . I do take notes , I could be taking notes on these things and I guess the plus with the CrossPads would be the time markings but I don't know . phd d: what is a CrossPad ? professor b: So it 's it 's  it 's a regular pad , just a regular pad of paper but there 's this pen which indicates position . grad h: And then you can download it and they have OCR and searching and all sorts of things . grad h: But I don't take notes , professor b: And one of the reasons that it was brought up originally was because  we were interested in in higher - level things , grad h: so . professor b: not just the , you know , microphone stuff but also summarization and so forth and the question is if you were going to go to some gold standard of what wa what was it that happened in the meeting you know , where would it come from ? And  I think that was one of the things , phd d: Yeah . We 'll have a you know , have a scribe , have somebody  take good notes and then that 's part of the record of the meeting . And then we did it once or twice and we sort of grad h: Yep , and then just sort of died out . professor b: probably chose the wrong scribe but it was It 's  phd g:  grad h: Yeah that 's right . postdoc a: u but I guess the the other thing I 'm thinking is if we wanted that kind of thing I wonder if we 'd lose that much by having someone be a scribe by listening to the tape , to the recording afterwards and taking notes in some other interface . phd f:  we 're transcribing it anyways , why do we need notes ? postdoc a: Oh it 's la it 's useful , grad h: Because that 's summary . phd g: I think there 's also there 's this use that phd f: Summarize it from the transcription . phd g: the Well , what if you 're sitting there and you just wanna make an X and you don't wanna take notes and you 're you just wanna phd f: Doodle . phd g: get the summary of the transcript from this time location like you know , and and then while you 're bored you don't do anything and once in a while , maybe there 's a joke and you put a X and But in in other words you can use that just to highlight times in a very simple way . Also with I was thinking and I know Morgan disagrees with me on this but suppose you have a group in here and you wanna let them note whenever they think there might be something later that they might not wanna distribute in terms of content , they could just sort of make an X near that point or a question mark that sort of alerts them that when they get the transcript back they c could get some red flags in that transcript region and they can then look at it . I know we haven't been using it but I w I can imagine it being useful just for sort of marking time periods grad h: Right . professor b: I guess so , you know , what what makes one think i is maybe we should actually schedule some periods where people go over something later phd g: so . professor b: and and and put some kind of summary or something  you know , some there 'd be some scribe who would actually listen , w who 'd agreed to actually listen to the whole thing , not transcribe it , but just sort of write down things that struck them as important . But then you don't you don't have the time reference  that you 'd have if you had it live . And you don't have a lot of other cues that might be useful , professor b: Yeah . phd f: How do you synchronize the time in the CrossPad and the time of the recording ? phd g: so . grad h:  that was one of the issues we talked about originally and that that 's w part of the difficulty is that we need an infrastructure for using the time the CrossPads and so that means synchronizing the time phd g:  postdoc a:   grad h: You know you want it pretty close and there 's a fair amount of skew because it 's a hand - held unit with a battery postdoc a: Well when when I d grad h: and so you postdoc a: OK . grad h: so you have to synchronize at the beginning of each meeting all the pads that are being used , so that it 's synchronized with the time on that and then you have to download to an application , and then you have to figure out what the data formats are and convert it over if you wanna do anything with this information . phd e: Why grad h: And so there 's a lot of infrastructure which postdoc a: There is an alternative . grad h: unless someone postdoc a: There is an alternative , it 's still , there 's  you know , your point stands about there be needing to be an infrastructure , but it doesn't have to be synchronized with the little clock 's timer on it . You c  , I when I when I did it I synchronized it by voice , by whispering \" one , two , three , four \" onto the microphone grad h:  . grad h: Well , but then there 's the infrastructure at the other end phd e: Right . grad h: which someone has to listen to that and find that point , postdoc a: Yeah , it 's transcribed . phd g: Well , could we keep one of these things for another year ? Would h  is there a big cau grad h: We can keep all both of them for the whole whole year . phd g: just just in case we grad h: it 's just phd g: even maybe some of the transcribers who might be wanting to annotate  f just there 's a bunch of things that might be neat to do but I it might not be the case that we can actually synchronize them and then do all the infrastructure but we could at least try it out . professor b: Well one thing that we might try  is on some set of meetings , some collection of meetings , maybe EDU is the right one or maybe something else , we we get somebody to buy into the idea of doing this as part of the task . professor b:  part of the reason I think part of the reason that Adam was so interested in  the SpeechCorder sort of f idea from the beginning is he said from the beginning he hated taking notes and grad h: Yep . professor b: and so forth so and and Jane is more into it but eh  you know I don't know if you wanna really do do this all the time so I think the thing is to to get someone to actually buy into it and have at least some series of meetings where we do it . The p the the problem with the the more extended view , all these other you know with  quibbling about particular applications of it is that it looks like it 's hard to get people to   routinely use it ,  it just hasn't happened anyway . But maybe if we can get a person to phd g: Yeah I don't think it has to be part of a what everybody does in a meeting but it might be a useful , neat part of the project that we can , you know , show off as a mechanism for synchronizing events in time that happen that you just wanna make a note of , like what Jane was talking about with some later browsing , just just as a convenience , even if it 's not a full - blown note taking substitute . phd e: Well if you wanted to do that maybe the right architecture for it is to get a PDA with a wireless card . And and that way you can synchronize very easily with the the the meeting because you 'll be synchroni you can synchronize with the the Linux server and  phd g: So what kind of input would you be ? phd e: so so , if you 're not worried about grad h: Buttons . phd g: You 'd just be pressing like a a phd e: Well well you have a PDA and may and you could have the same sort of X interface or whatever , you 'd have to do a little eh a little bit of coding to do it . phd e: if if all you really wanted was you didn't want this secondary note - taking channel but just sort of being able to use m markers of some sort , a PDA with a l a wireless card would be the probably the right way to go . grad h:  for what what you 've been describing buttons would be even more convenient than anything else , phd g: M right . grad h: right ? You have the phd g: I don't have , you know , grandiose ideas in mind but I 'm just sort of thinking well we 've we 're getting into the next year now and we have a lot of these things worked out at in terms of the speech maybe somebody will be interested in this and postdoc a: I like this PDA idea . professor b: where like one one button was \"  - oh \" and then another button was \" that 's great \" and another button \" that 's f \" phd g: Or like this is my \" I 'm supposed to do this \" kind of button , postdoc a: Yeah . phd g: Yeah something like that or postdoc a: And then grad h:  I think the CrossPad idea is a good one . grad h: It 's just a question of getting people to use it and getting the infrastructure set up in such a way that it 's not a lot of extra work .  that 's part of the reason why it hasn't happened is that it 's been a lot of extra work for me phd g: Yeah . grad h: and postdoc a: But it 's also , it has this problem of having to go from an analog to a d a digital record too , phd g: W postdoc a: doesn't it ?  grad h: Well it 's digital but it 's in a format that is not particularly standard . postdoc a: But  , say , if i if if you 're writing if you 're writing notes in it does it it can't do handwriting recognition , right ? professor b: No , no , but it 's just it 's just storing the pixel informa position information , postdoc a: OK . postdoc a: I I guess what I 'm thinking is that the PDA solution you h you have it already without needing to go from the pixelization to a to a  professor b: Right . You don't have to phd e: The transfer function is less errorful , postdoc a: Oh , nicely put . phd g: Well it also it 's maybe realistic cuz people are supposed to be bringing their P D As to the meeting eventually , right ? That 's why we have this little I don't know what I don't wanna cause more work for anyone but I can imagine some interesting things that you could do with it and so if we don't have to return it and we can keep it for a year I don't know . grad h: Well w we don't we certainly don't have to return it , as I said . All all he said is that if you 're not using it could you return it , if you are using it feel free to keep it . The point is that we haven't used it at all and are we going to ? professor b: So we have no but  by I I would suggest you return one . phd g: We c professor b: We have some aspirations of using them phd g: One would probably be fine . professor b: and phd g: Maybe we could do like a student project , you know , maybe someone who wants to do this as their main like s project for something would be cool .  if we had them out and sitting on the table people might use them a little more professor b: Maybe Jeremy could sit in some meetings and press a button when there when when somebody laughed . grad h: although there is a little phd g: Well , I 'm yeah , that 's not a bad professor b: Yeah , yeah . phd g: Jeremy 's gonna be an he 's a new student starting on modeling brea breath and laughter , actually , which sounds funny but I think it should be cool , professor b: Yeah . phd g: You 're you 're gonna tease me ? grad h: Oh , equipment . grad h: And then at the same time I 'll probably rewire the room as per Jane 's suggestion so that  the first N channels are wireless , eh are the m the close - talking and the next N are far - field . professor b: You know what he means but isn't that funny sounding ? \" We ordered more wireless . \" It 's like wires are the things so you 're wiring you 're you 're you we 're we ordered more absence of the thing . phd g: I just it 's sort of a anachronism ,  it 's like It 's great . professor b:  there 's there 's all this stuff going on  between  Andreas and and and Dave and Chuck and others with various kinds of runs   recognition runs , trying to figure things out about the features but it 's it 's all sort of in process , so there 's not much to say right now . grad h: So just the transcript number and then the then the phd e: This is Yes , this is number two for me today . professor b: See all you have to do is go away to move way up in the phd e: Oh . grad h: Should we do simultaneous ? phd g: Well , I 'm just thinking , are you gonna try to save the data before this next group comes in ? professor b: Yeah . phd g: You have to plug your ears , by the way  Eric , grad h: Well I have to , phd d: You don't have to <doc-sep>grad a: So , I think this is gonna be a pretty short meeting because I have four agenda items , three of them were requested by Jane who is not gonna be at the meeting today . Does anyone besides Jane know what the transcription status is ? phd f: sort of , I do , peripherally . phd c: Is that English ? phd f:  Well first of all with IBM I got a note from Brian yesterday saying that they finally made the tape for the thing that we sent them a week or week and a half ago phd d: That 's our system . grad a: Ugh ! phd f: and that it 's gone out to the transcribers and hopefully next week we 'll have the transcription back from that . grad a: C can I have a pen ? phd f:  Jane seems to be  moving right along on the transcriptions from the ICSI side . phd f: Yeah , so  , I guess she 's hired some new transcribers phd d: Speaking grad e: Which meetings is she transcribing ? phd f: and  well we 've we 've run out of E D Us because a certain number of them are  , sort of awaiting to go to IBM . phd d: So does she have transcribers right now who are basically sitting idle because there 's no data back from IBM grad e: So we 're doing some in parallel . phd d: Because I I need to ask Jane whether it 's it would be OK for her  , s some of her people to transcribe  some of the initial data we got from the SmartKom data collection , which is these short like five or seven minute sessions . phd d:  and we want it You know , we need The Again , we we have a similar  logistic set - up where we are supposed to send the data to Munich grad a: Right . phd d: And so  I wanted to ask Jane if if  , you know , maybe one of their transcribers could could do  since these are very short , that should really be  , professor b:   And it 's One session is only  like seven professor b: So that should have ma many fewer And it 's also not  a bunch of interruptions with people and all that , phd d: Right . And some of it is read speech , so we could give them the the thing that they 're reading professor b: right ? So . phd d: And so  , I guess since she 's I was gonna ask her but since she 's not around I maybe I 'll professor b: Yeah , well it certainly seems phd d:  if if that 's OK with you to to , you know , get that stuff  to ask her for that , then I 'll do that . Yeah , if we 're held up on this other stuff a little bit in order to encompass that , that 's OK because I I  ,  I still have high hopes that the that the IBM pipeline 'll work out for us , so it 's phd d: Yeah . phd f: Oh , yeah , and also related to the transcription stuff , so I 've been trying to keep a web page  up to date f showing what the current status is of the trans of all the things we 've collected and what stage each meeting is in , in terms of whether it 's grad a: Can you mail that out to the list ? phd f:  -  , yeah I will . I That 's the thing that I sent out just to foo people saying can you update these pages grad a: Oh , OK , OK . phd f: and so that 's where I 'm putting it but I 'll I 'll send it out to the list telling people to look at it . So Jane also wanted to talk about participant approval , but I don't really think there 's much to talk about . professor b: You are going to grad a: I 'm gonna send out to the participants , with links to web pages which contain the transcripts and allow them to suggest edits .  phd c: So but it 's just transcripts , not the not the audio ? grad a: Nope , they 'll have access to the audio also . phd f: So ,  the audio that they 're gonna have access to , will that be the uncompressed version ? Or will you have scripts that like uncompress the various pieces and grad a: Oh , that 's a good point . Yeah , it 's it 's probably going to have to be the uncompressed versions because , it takes too long to do random access decompression . Yeah , I was just wondering because we 're  running out of the un - backed - up disk space on grad a: Well , that was the other point . phd f: Oh , was that another one ? grad a: Yep , that 's another agenda item . grad a: So ,  But that is a good point so we 'll get to that , too . I 've added some stuff that  indes indexes by the meeting type MR , EDU , et cetera and also by the user ID .  The back - end is  , going more slowly as I s I think I said before just cuz I 'm not much of a Tcl - TK programmer . So I think Don and I are gonna work on that and and you and I can just talk about it off - line more .  grad e: And , also  , I was just showing Andreas , I got  an X Waves kind of display , and I don't know how much more we can do with it with like the prosodic stuff where we have like stylized pitches and signals and the transcripts on the bottom grad a: Oh , cool . grad e: so , right now it 's just an X Waves and then you have three windows but I don't know , it looked pretty nice and I 'm sure it think it has potential for a little something , grad a: For a demo ? grad e: yeah , for a demo . grad e: So professor b: OK , so again , the issue is For July , the issue 's gonna be what can we fit into a Windows machine , and so on , but grad e: Oh . grad e: Well , we 'll see ,  phd c: I 've been putting together  Transcriber things for Windows so i And I installed it on Dave Gelbart 's PC and it worked just fine . phd d: Really ? So is that Because there 's some people  It would be cool if we could  get that to work  at at SRI phd c: Yeah . phd d: because the  grad a: Well Transcriber is Tcl - TK , very generic with Snack , phd d: we have m m We have more Windows machines to run the phd c: Yeah . Yeah but But the problem is the version Transcriber works with , the Snack version , is one point six whatever and that 's not anymore supported . But I just wrote an email to to the author of to the Snack author and he sent me to one point six whatever library grad a: Well I thought it was packaged with Transcriber ? phd c: and so it works . Yeah , but then you can't add our patches and then the the new version is is totally different grad a: Oh . phd c: and you can't you can't access that so you have to install First install Tcl then install Snack and then install the Transcriber thing and then do the patches . Ugh ! phd d: I I wonder if if we should contribute our changes back to the authors so that they maintain those changes along phd c: Yeah . grad a: We have Yeah b it 's just hasn't made it into the release yet . phd f: So did you  put the  the NT version out on the  Meeting Recorder page ? Or phd c: No , I haven't done that yet . professor b: So , can some of the stuff that Don 's talking about somehow fit into this  , mean you just have a set of numbers that are associated with the grad e: Yeah . phd c: So grad e: Yeah , it 's basically ASCII files or binary files , whatever representation . Just three different It 's a waveform and just a stylized pitch vector basically so it 's phd d: So So Well grad e:  we could do it in Matl -  you could do it in a number of different places I 'm sure . phd d: But But it would be cool if the Transcriber interface had like another window for the you know , maybe above the waveform where it would show some arbitrary valued function that is that is you know time synchron ti ti time synchronous with the wavform . Again it 's it 's It 's more Tcl - T grad e: Yeah . grad a: So someone who 's familiar with Tcl - TK has to do it , phd d: Right . grad a: But it it seems to me that I c phd c: And grad a: It doesn't seem like having that real time is that necessary . grad e:  What do you mean by real time ? Do you mean like phd f: Like being able to scroll through it and stuff for the demo . phd f: Is that what you mean ? grad a: It just seems to me jus grad e: It would be cool to see it phd f: Yeah . grad e: It would be cool like to see to hear it and see it , phd c: And to hear it . grad a: Sure , but I don't think I You can do all that just statically in phd c: Yeah . grad e: I think it would lose Yeah ,  y grad a: Just record the audio clip and show an image and I think that 's grad e: Right , right .  , no , we 're talking about on the computer and and  , I think when we were talking about this before we had littl this little demo meeting , grad e: Right . professor b: we sort of set up a range of different degrees of liveness that you could have and , the more live , the better , but  , given the crunch of time , we may have to retreat from it to some extent . So I think For a lot of reasons , I think it would be very nice to have this Transcriber interface be able to show some other interesting signal along with it phd d:   But ,  Anyway , jus just looking for ways that we could actually show what you 're doing , in to people . professor b: Cuz a lot of this stuff , particularly for Communicator ,  certainly a significant chunk of the things that we waved our arms about th originally had t had to do with prosodics It 'd be nice to show that we can actually get them and see them . So , we have a little bit of time before that becomes critical , but we are like ninety five percent , ninety eight percent on the scratch disks for the expanded meetings . grad a: And , my original intention was like we would just delete them as we needed more space , but unfortunately we 're in the position where we have to deal with all the meeting data all at once , in a lot of different ways . grad a: Yeah , there 're a lot of transcribers , phd c: Yeah . grad a: so all of those need to be expanded , and then people are doing chunking and I want to do  , the permission forms , phd f:   grad a: so I want those to be live , so there 's a lot of data that has to be around . One of the things I was thinking is we we just got these hundred alright , excuse me ten ,  SPARC - Blade SUN - Blades . grad a: And so it seems to me we could hang scratch disk on those because they 'll be in the machine room , they 'll be on the fast connection to the rest of the machines . phd f: Well , is there Why not just hang them off of Abbott , is there a grad a: Because there 's no more room in the disk racks on Abbott . phd f: You can put two phd d: Oh you mean you put them inside the pizza boxes for the grad a: Sure . grad a: So you can just go out and buy a PC hard drive and stick it in . professor b: But if Abbott is going to be our disk server it it file server it seems like we would want to get it , a second disk rack or something . What I 'm looking for is where do we s expand the next meeting ? phd c: Yep . professor b: Well , for the next meeting you might be out of luck with those ten , mightn't you ?  , you know Dave Johnson is gone for , like , ten days , grad a: Oh , I didn't know he had left already . grad e: How much space do you need for these ? professor b: I don't know what his schedule is . phd f: I I thi grad e: I have  I have an eighteen gig drive hanging off of my computer . grad a: Alright ! What 's your computer 's name ? grad e: So  , Samosa . grad a: And you 're o you 're offering ? grad e:  I 'm not doing anything on it right now until I get new meetings to transcri or that are new transcriptions coming in I really can't do anything . grad e:  not that I can't do anything , I jus phd f: I I jus I just gave Thilo some about ten gigs , the last ten gigs of space that there was on on  Abbott .  And  So but that But grad a: Which one was that , X G ? X G ? phd c: XG . phd d: That 's also where we store the The  Hub - five training set waveforms , phd c: Oops . grad a: But that won't be getting any bigger , phd d: right ? phd f: No . grad a: will it ? phd f: I don't think that 's on XG . phd d: But I 've also been storing I 've been storing the feature files there and I guess I can s start deleting some because we now know what the best features are grad e: Well phd d: and we won't be using the old ones anymore . phd d:  Oh thats XA Oh that 's X phd c: Isn't that XH ? phd f: I th grad a: Not not for long . grad e: I have a lot of space and it 's not it 's n There 's very little  Yeah not for long . phd d: Maybe I 'm confu grad e: But  it 's not going f phd d: Oh no I 'm sorry . grad a: Yeah , it 's probably Probably only about four gig is on X on your X drive , phd c: So . grad a: but we 'll definitely take it up if you grad e: I th phd d: I think you 're right . It 's XH and D grad e: I think it 's about four or five gig cuz I have four meetings on there , phd d: The b I 'm also using DG I got that confused . grad a: The \" more disk space \" button ? professor b: Just press Press each meeting saying \" we need more disk space \" \" this week \" . professor b: And And how much does each meeting take ? phd f: And it 's about a gig uncompressed . phd c: It 's It 's a little bit more as I usually don't do not uncompress the all of the PZM and the PDA things . So there 's what thirty some gig of just meetings so far ? professor b: So - so So maybe there 's a hundred gig or something . Well we We haven't uncompressed all the meetings , but grad a: I would like to .  it 's just a question of figuring out where they should be and hanging them , grad a: Yep . professor b: but But  , we could You know , if you want to get four disks , get four disks . Well I sent that message out to , I guess , you and Dave asking for if we could get some disk . phd f: I s I sent this out a a day ago grad a: And put it where ? professor b: Right . phd f: but and Dave didn't respond so I don I don't know how the whole process works .  does he just go out and get them and if it 's OK , and grad a: Yep . And just say an - e just ask him that , you know , wha what should you do . And in my answer back was \" are you sure you just want one ? \" So  I think that what you want to do is plan ahead a little bit and figure \" well , here 's what we pi figure on doing for the next few months \" . So this is a question that 's pretty hard to solve without talking to Dave , phd d: Th - The phd f: I think part of the reason why Dave can't get the the new machines up is because he doesn't have room in the machine room right now . phd d: One One On - One thing to in to  t to do when you need to conserve space is phd f: So he has to re - arrange a bunch of stuff . phd d: I bet there are still some old , like , nine gig disks , around and you can probably consolidate them onto larger disks and and you know recover the space . An - and so , he always has a a lot of plans of things that he 's gonna do to make things better in many ways an and runs out of time . And so I think what he 's been concentrating on is  the back the back up system , rather than on new disk . Basically , we can easily get one to four disks ,  you just go out and get four and we 've got the money for it , it 's no big deal .  , but the question is where they go , and I don't think we can solve that here , you just have to ask him . grad a: Yeah , it 's just It 's not on the net , so it 's a little awkward phd d: The only phd f:  . phd d: What do you mean it 's not on the net ? grad a: It 's not phd c: It 's not bad . grad a: It 's behind lots of fire walls that don't allow any services through except S S phd d: Oh because it 's because it 's an ACIRI machine ? grad a: Yep . grad a: And also on the list is to get it into the normal ICSI net , but Who knows when that will happen ? phd d: But that can't be that hard . phd d:  grad a: No , the the problem with that apparently is that they don't currently have a wire running to that back room that goes anywhere near one of the ICSI routers . If there was a person dedicated to doing it they would happen pretty easily but it 's it 's jus every ever everybody everybody has a has grad a: But Dave has to do all of them . But at any rate I think that there 's a there 's a longer term thing and there 's immediate need and I think we need a a conversation with  , maybe maybe after after tea or something you and I can go down and and talk to him about it Just say \" wha you know , what should we do right now ? \" phd f: How long is David gonna be gone ? professor b: eleven days or something ? grad a: Oh my ! professor b: Yeah basically tomorrow and all of the week after . The only oth thing other thing I was gonna add was that   , I talked briefly to Mari and  we had both been busy with other things so we haven't really connected that much since the last meeting we had here but we agreed that we would have a telephone meeting the Friday after next . And I I I wanted to make it ,  after the next one of these meetings , so something that we wanna do next meeting is is  to put together  , a kind of reasonable list for ourselves of what is it , that we 've done .  just sort of bulletize  o e do do I can I can dream up text but this is basically gonna lead to the annual report . grad a: This is the fifteenth ? So just a week from tomorrow ? professor b: that would grad a: OK . So , we can This So that 's an phd d: Is this gotta be in the morning ? professor b:  phd d: Or Because you know I Fridays I have to leave  like around  two . So if it could be before that would be be professor b: No , no but I I I don't need other folks for the meeting . professor b: Yeah so what I meant was on the me this meeting if I wa something I I I 'm making a major thing in the agenda is I wanna help in getting together a list of what it is that we 've done so I can tell her . professor b: but but   , and then the next day  , late in the day I 'll be having that that discussion with her . phd d:   One thing  we in past meetings we had  also a you know various variously talked about the  work that w  was happening sort of on the on the recognition side professor b:   And I wondered whether we should maybe have  a separate meeting and between you know , whoever 's interested in that because I feel that  there 's plenty of stuff to talk about but it would be sort of  maybe the wrong place to do it in this meeting if  professor b: Think so ? phd d: Well , it 's that It 's just gonna be ver very boring for people who are not you know , sort of really interested in the details of the recognition system . professor b: Well , OK , so how many how many people here would not be interested in  in a meeting about recognition ? phd c: Me too . phd d: Well I know Well , Jane an Well you mean in a separate meeting or ha ha talking about it in this grad a: No . professor b: Real grad e: Watch a ball game ? professor b: Yeah , real real real men \" Real men do decoding \" or something like that . phd d:  it it 's sort of  when when the talk is about data collection stuff , sometimes I 've you know , I I 'm bored . grad a: The Nod off ? phd d: So it 's I c I can sympathize with them not wanting to i to to be  you know If I cou you know this could professor b: It 's cuz y you have a So you need a better developed feminine side . phd d: I 'm professor b: There 's probably gonna be a lot of \" bleeps \" in this meeting . You know , whatev or whenever we feel like we phd f: Right , I was Why don't we alternate this meeting every other week ? grad a: Or just alternate the focus . grad a: Oh sor phd f: But I do I don't  a lot of times lately it seems like we don't really have enough for a full meeting on Meeting Recorder . phd f: So if we could alternate the focus of the meeting grad a: Let 's read digits and go . professor b: And then if we find , you know we 're just not getting enough done , there 's all these topics not coming up , then we can expand into another meeting . Let 's chat about it with Liz and Jane when we get a chance , see what they think and phd d:   phd f: and there 's lots of things , you know , details and stuff that would I think people 'd be interested in and I 'd you know , where do we go from here kind of things and So , it would be good . professor b: Yeah , and you 're you 're attending the  the front - end meeting as well as the others so you have you have probably one of the best you and I , I guess are the main ones who sort of see the bridge between the two . phd d:  I jus So the latest result was that   yot I tested the  the sort of final version of the PLP configuration  on development test data for for this year 's Hub - five test set . phd d: And the recognition performance was exactly , and  exactly up to the you know , the first decimal , same as with the  Mel Cepstra front - end .  , well i there was a little bit of a phd f: Oh ! phd d: i overall . phd d: And then the really nice thing was that if if we combine the two systems we get a one and a half percent improvement . phd d: Which u actually uses the whole N - best list from both systems to mmm ,  c combine that . professor b: So except  the only key difference between the two really is the kind of smoothing at the end which is the auto - regressive versus the cepstral truncation . phd d: And , the phd f: But a percent and a half ? grad a: Yeah , it 's pretty impressive . phd f: That 's phd d: And And so  after I told the my  colleagues at SRI about that , you know , now they definitely want to , you know , have a Next time we have an evaluation they want to do  , you know , basically a at least the system combination .  , and , you know , why not ? professor b: Sure , why not ? phd d:  . phd d:  w what do you mean ? More features in the sense of front - end features or in the sense of just bells and whistles ? grad a: No ,  front - end features . Let 's , you know , try RASTA and MSG , and phd d: Oh  Yeah . That 's the the the There 's one thing   you don't want to overdo it because y every front - end You know , if you you know you basically multiply your effort by N , where N is a number of different systems phd f: Oh . So one one compromise would be to only to have the everything up to the point where you generate lattices be basically one system and then after that you rescore your lattices with the multiple systems and combine the results and that 's a fairly painless  thing . phd f: Do you think we 'd still get the one and a half  phd d: I I think so . Maybe a little less because at that point the error rates are lower and so if You know , maybe it 's only one percent or something but that would still be worthwhile doing .  Jus - You know , just wanted to let you know that that 's working out very nicely . phd d: And then we had some results on digits , with  We We So this was  really really sort of just to get Dave going with his  experiments . But as a result , you know , we were sort of wondering why is the Hub - five system doing so well on the digits . phd d: And the reason is basically there 's a whole bunch of read speech data in the Hub - five training set . phd d: And you c And Not all of No it 's actually , digits is only a maybe a fifth of it . professor b: A fifth of it is how much ? phd d: The rest is is read is read TIMIT data and  ATIS data and Wall Street Journal and stuff like that . But a fi a fifth is how much ? phd d: A fifth would be maybe  two hours something . professor b: Yeah , so  that 's actually not that different from the amount of training that there was . phd d: But it definitely helps to have the other read data in there professor b: Oh yeah phd d: because we 're doing professor b: w phd d: You know the error rate is half of what you do if you train only on ti  TIMIT  not TIMIT  TI - digits , professor b:   phd d: That 's e professor b: Because because  , it was apparent if you put in a bunch more data it would be better , phd d: That was e Right , right . So we only for the Hub - five training , we 're only using  a fairly small subset of the Macrophone database . grad a: I could also put in  focus condition zero from Hub - four from Broadcast News , which is mostly prepared speech . So , you know that might be useful for the people who train the the digit recognizers to to use  something other than TI - digits . They they  they experimented for a while with a bunch of different databases with French and Spanish and so forth cuz they 're multilingual tests phd d:   professor b: But but yeah certainly if we ,  If we knew what the structure of what we 're doing there was . professor b: Once we know , then the trainable parts of it it 'd be great to run lots of lots of stuff through . And then I th guess Chuck and I had some discussions about how to proceed with the tandem  system and You wanna You wanna see where that stands ? phd f: Well , I 'm phd d:  phd f: Yeah , so Andreas  brought over the  alignments that the SRI system uses . And so I 'm in the process of  converting those alignments into  label files that we can use to train  a new net with . phd d: An - And one side effect of that would be that it 's  that the phone set would change . So the MLP would be trained on I think only forty - six or forty - eight phd f: Right . phd d:  which is smaller than the  than the phone set that that we 've been using so far . phd d: And that that that will probably help , actually , phd f: So it 's a little different ? phd d: because  the fewer dimensions  e the less trouble probably with the as far as just the  ,  Just You know we want to try things like deltas on the tandem features . And so , you know , fewer dimensions in the phone set would be actually helpful just from a logistics point of view . Although we  , it 's not that many fewer and and and we take a KLT anyway so we could phd d: Right . And then we wanted to s just limit it to maybe  something on the same order of dimensions as we use in a standard  front - end . So that would mean just doing the top I don't know ten or twelve or something of the KLT dimensions . My impression was that when we did that before that had very little  he didn't lose very much . phd d: But then And then something Once we have the new M L P trained up ,  one thing I wanted to try just for the fun of it was to actually run  like a standard hybrid system that is based on you know , those features  and  retrain MLP and also the you know , the dictionary that we use for the Hub - five system . professor b: And the b And the base u starting off with the base of the alignments that you got from i from a pretty decent system . phd d:  because you know , compared to what Eric did a while ago , where he trained up , I think , a system based on Broadcast News and then  tra retraining it on Switchboard or s  and professor b: Yeah . phd d: But he I think he d he didn't he probably didn't use all the training data that was available . We we made some improvements to the dictionary 's  to the dictionary about two years ago which resulted in a  something like a four percent absolute error rate reduction on Switchboard , which professor b: Well the other thing is , dipping deep into history and into  our resource management days , when we were collaborating with SRI before , phd d:   professor b:  it was I think , it is was a really key  starting point for us that we actually got our alignment . professor b: When we were working together we got our initial alignments from Decipher ,  at the time . Later we got away from it because because once we had decent systems going then it was it was typically better to use our own systems phd f: Yeah . professor b: cuz they were self consistent but but certainly to start off when we were trying to recover from our initial hundred and forty percent error  rate . professor b: And we 're not quite that bad with our our Switchboard systems but it was they certainly aren't as good as SRI 's , phd d: OK . phd f: W What is the performance on s the best Switchboard system that we 've done ? Roughly ? professor b: Well , the hybrid system we never got better than about fifty percent error . And  it was I think there 's just a whole lot of things that  no one ever had time for .  we always had a list of a half dozen things that we were gonna do and and a lot of them were pretty simple and we never did . professor b: we never did an never did any adaptation phd d: But that w Even that that number professor b: we never did any phd d: Right . And And that number I think was on Switchboard - one data , right ? Where the error rate now is in the twenties . phd d: So it would be So it would be good t to sort of r re  professor b: Yeah . And the other thing that that would help us to evaluate is to see how well the M L P is trained up . phd d: So it 's sort of a sanity check of the M L P outputs before we go ahead and train up the  you know , use them as a basis for the tandem system . Not phd f: Should we Should we bother with  using the net before doing  embedded training ? professor b: But . phd d: But phd f:  should should we even use that ? phd d: Oh oh that 's a good question . phd f: Or should I just go straight to phd d: Yeah , we we weren't sure whether it 's worth to just use the alignments  from the S R I recognizer or whether to actually go through one or more iterations of embedded training where you realign . You run it ? Keep keep both versions ? See which one 's better ? professor b: yeah . professor b: And while it 's training you may as well test the one you have and see how it did . You know , it 's phd d: But But so I grad a: Sort of given up guessing . phd d: Well but i But in your experience   have you seen big improvements in s on some tasks with embedded training ? Or was it sort of small - ish  improvements that you got professor b:  well . professor b: because we 're coming from  , alignments that were achieved with an extremely different system . grad a: Although ,  we 've done it with When we were combining with the Cambridge recurrent neural net , embedded training made it worse . phd d: So you you started training with outputs from a with alignments that were generated by the Cambridge  system ? grad a: Yep . professor b: Oh ! phd d: No  it 's weird that it did I 'm sorry . Tha - u we we 've see  and wi with the numbers OGI numbers task we 've seen a number of times people doing embedded trainings and things not getting better . phd d: Oh actually it 's not that weird because we have seen We have seen cases where acoustic retraining the acoustic models after some other change made matters worse rather than better . professor b: But I But I would I would suspect that something that that had  a very different  feature set , for instance  they were using pretty diff similar feature sets to us . professor b: I I would expect that something that had a different feature set would would  benefit from phd d:   professor b: sorry , it was the other thing is that what was in common to the Cambridge system and our system is they both were training posteriors . professor b: So  , that 's another pretty big difference grad a: That 's another big difference . professor b: and  , one bac at least Back at phd d: You mean with soft targets ? Or ? Sorry , I 'm sor I missed What What 's the key issue here ? professor b: Oh , that  both the Cambridge system and our system were were training posteriors . And if we 're we 're coming from alignments coming from the SRI system , it 's a likelihood - based system . You know , there 's diffe different front - end different different  , training criterion  , I would think that in a that an embedded  embedded  training would have at least a good shot of improving it some more . I was wondering  you know what size net I should Anybody have any intuitions or suggestions ? professor b: how much training data ? phd f: Well , I was gonna start off with the small train set . professor b: And how How many hours is that ? phd f: That 's why I was I I 'm not sure how much that is . phd d: I think that has about Well i you 'd would be gender - dependent training , right ? So So I think it 's  that 's about mmm , something like thirty hours . phd f: In the small training set ? grad a: Hello ? phd d: I I think so . I 'll grad a: Excuse me ? phd d: It 's definitely less than a hundred grad a: Alright . It 's it 's th the thing I 'll I 'll think about it a little more phd d:   It 's m It 's more than phd f: And a thousand is too small ? professor b: Oh let me think about it , but I think that that  th at some point there 's diminishing returns . professor b: but it but but there is diminishing returns and you 're doubling the amount of time . phd d: Remember you 'll have a smaller output layer so there 's gonna be fewer parameters there . phd d: And then professor b: Fifty s Fifty four to forty eight ? grad a: Vast majority is from the input unit . grad a: Right , because you used the context windows and so the input to hidden is much , much larger . professor b: Yeah , so it 's it 'd be way , way less than ten percent of the difference . What am I trying to think of ? phd f: The The net that that we did use already  was eight thousand hidden units and that 's the one that Eric trained up . professor b: So , yeah definitely not the one thousand  two thousand fr  the four thousand will be better and the two thousand will be almost will be faster and almost as good .  a four thousand is well within the range that you could benefit from but the two thousand 'd be faster so phd d: Right <doc-sep>grad d: and  pick out the ones that have problems , and either correct them or have them re - read . So we probably have like four or five more forms to be read , to be once through the set . I extracted out about an hour 's worth which are the f digits with for which whose speaker have speaker forms , have filled out speaker forms . So I extracted one for speakers who have speaker forms and for meetings in which the \" key \" file and the transcript files are parsable . Some of the early key files , it looks like , were done by hand , and so they 're not automatically parsable and I have to go back and fix those .  , Liz professor f: So you think two you think two hours is the is the total that we have ? grad d: Yep , yeah . professor f: And you think we th  , I I didn't quite catch all these different things that are not quite right , but you think we 'll be able to retrieve the other hour , reasonably ? grad d: Yes , absolutely . grad d: So it 's just a question of a little hand - editing of some files and then waiting for more people to turn in their speaker forms . I have this web - based speaker form , and I sent mail to everyone who hadn't filled out a speaker form , and they 're slowly s trickling in . professor f: So the relevance of the speaker form here , s grad d: It 's for labeling the extracted audio files . grad d: No , I spoke with Jane about that and we sort of decided that it 's probably not an issue that We edit out any of the errors anyway . So the other topic with digits is  , Liz would like to elicit different prosodics , and so we tried last week with them written out in English . So in conversations with Liz and  Jane we decided that if you wrote them out as numbers instead of words it would elicit more phone number , social security number - like readings . When I look at this , that first line is \" sixty one , sixty two , eighteen , eighty six , ten . \"  , and so the question is does anyone care ?  , I 've already spoken with Liz and she feels that , correct me if I 'm wrong , that for her , connected numbers is fine , postdoc e: I think two hours is probably fine for a test set , but it may be a little short if we actually wanna do training and adaptation and all that other stuff . professor f: Yeah  , do  you want different prosodics , so if you always had the same groupings you wouldn't like that ? Is that correct ? phd g: Well , we actually figured out a way to grad d: Yeah , the the phd g: the the groupings are randomly generated . professor f: No but , I was asking if that was something you really cared about because if it wasn't , it seems to me if you made it really specifically telephone groupings that maybe people wouldn't , go and do numbers so much . You know if it if it 's phd a:  phd g: I think they may still do it , professor f: Maybe some , but I probably not so much . phd b: What about putting a hyphen between the numbers in the group ? phd g: And professor f: Right ? So if you if if you have  grad d: Six dash one , you mean ? professor f: if you go six six six  dash  two nine three one . phd g: I well OK I it might help , I would like to g get away from having only one specific grouping . phd g: but  it seems to me that , at least for us , we can learn to read them as digits postdoc e: Yeah . phd g: and it seems like that might be better for you guys since then you 'll have just more digit data , grad d: Right . phd g: It 's a little bit better for me too because the digits are easier to recognize . Right , read them as single digits , so sixty - one w is read as six one , postdoc e:   phd g: and if people make a mistake we grad d: How about \" O \" versus \" zero \" ? professor f: the other thing is we could just bag it because it 's it 's it 's - I 'm not worrying about it  , because we do have digits training data that we have from  from OGI . I 'm sorry , digits numbers training that we have from OGI , we 've done lots and lots of studies with that . phd g: But it 's nice to get it in this room with the acous professor f: Yeah . phd g:  for it 's professor f: No , no , I guess what I 'm saying is that grad d: Just let them read it how they read it . professor f: to some extent maybe we could just read them have them read how how they read it and it just means that we have to expand our our vocabulary out to stuff that we already have . Well that 's fine with me as long as It 's just that I didn't want to cause the people who would have been collecting digits the other way to not have the digits . phd g: So professor f:  we s we we 've We can do this for awhile phd g: OK . Do yo  , do you want do you want this Do you need training data or adaptation data out of this ? phd g: OK . professor f: How much of this do you need ? with  the phd g: It 's actually unclear right now . I just thought well we 're if we 're collec collecting digits , and Adam had said we were running out of the TI forms , I thought it 'd be nice to have them in groups , and probably , all else being equal , it 'd be better for me to just have single digits professor f: OK . phd g: since it 's , you know , a recognizer 's gonna do better on those anyway , and it 's more predictable . So we can know from the transcript what the person said and the transcriber , in general . professor f: OK , well if you pre phd g: But if they make mistakes , it 's no big deal if the people say a hundred instead of \" one OO \" . and also w maybe we can just let them choose \" zero \" versus \" O \" as they as they like because even the same person c sometimes says \" O \" and sometimes says \" zero \" in different context , professor f: Yeah . So I don't have a Specific need cuz if I did I 'd probably try to collect it , you know , without bothering this group , but If we can try it grad d: OK so so I can just add to the instructions to read it as digits not as connected numbers . phd g: Right , and you can give an example like , you know , \" six sixty - one would be read as six one \" . And is the spacing alright or do you think there should be more space between digits and groups ? professor f: OK . phd g: and grad d: Or is that alright ? phd g:  what do other people think cuz you guys are reading them . postdoc e: I it it to me it looks like you 've got the func the idea of grouping and you have the grou the idea of separation phd g: OK . postdoc e: and , you know , it 's just a matter of u i the instructions , that 's all . grad d: And I think there are about ten different gouping patterns professor f: Let 's try it . phd g: Righ - right , and you just they 're randomly generated and randomly assigned to digits . professor f: Sorry , I I was just gonna say , so we have in the vicinity of forty hours of of recordings now . And you 're saying two hours , is digits , so that 's roughly the ratio then , grad d: Yep . professor f: yeah like you say , I think a couple hours for a for a for a test test set 's OK . It 'd be nice to get , you know , more later because we 'll we might use use this up , in some sense , postdoc e:   professor f: but but  postdoc e: Yeah , I also would like to argue for that cuz it it seems to me that , there 's a real strength in having the same test replicated in a whole bunch of times and adding to that basic test bank . postdoc e:  ? Cuz then you have , you know , more and more , u chances to get away from random errors . And I think , the other thing too is that right now we have sort of a stratified sample with reference to dialect groups , and it might be there might be an argument to be made for having  f for replicating all of the digits that we 've done , which were done by non - native speakers so that we have a core that totally replicates the original data set , which is totally American speakers , and then we have these stratified additional language groups overlapping certain aspects of the database . I think that  trying to duplicate , spending too much effort trying to duplicate the existing TI - digits probably isn't too worthwhile because the recording situation is so different . postdoc e: Except that if you have the stimuli comparable , then it says something about the the contribution of setting professor f: No it 's it 's not the same . postdoc e: and professor f: A little bit , but the other differences are so major . professor f: They 're such major sources of variance that it 's it 's it 's  postdoc e: What 's an example of a of m some of the other differences ? Any other a difference ? professor f: Well i i individual human glottis is going to be different for each one , postdoc e: OK .  , we 're collecting it in a read digit in a particular list , and I 'm sure that they 're doing more specific stuff . grad d: Was it read ? professor f: Yeah , I think the reading zipcode stuff you 're thinking of would be OGI . professor f: Yeah , no TI - digits was read in th in read in the studio I believe . grad d: But but regardless it 's gonna it 's hard to compare cross - corpus . professor f: And they 're different circumstances with different recording environment and so forth , so it 's it 's it 's really pretty different . But I think the idea of using a set thing was just to give you some sort of framework , so that even though you couldn't do exact comparisons , it wouldn't be s valid scientifically at least it 'd give you some kind of  frame of reference .  , you know it 's not phd b: Hey Liz , What what do the groupings represent ? postdoc e: OK . phd b: You said there 's like ten different groupings ? phd g: Right , just groupings in terms of number of groups in a line , and number of digits in a group , and the pattern of groupings . Are the patterns like are they based on anything or phd g: I I just roughly looked at what kinds of digit strings are out there , and they 're usually grouped into either two , three , or four , four digits at a time . In the old days you probably only had three sequences , and telephone numbers were less , and so forth . So , there 's between ,  Well if you look at it , there are between like three and five groups , and each one has between two and four groupings and I purposely didn't want them to look like they were in any kind of pattern . phd g: So grad d: And which group appears is picked randomly , and what the numbers are are picked randomly . grad d: So unlike the previous one , which I d simply replicated TI - digits , this is generated randomly . phd g: But I think it 'd be great i to be able to compare digits , whether it 's these digits or TI - digits , to speakers , and compare that to their spontaneous speech , and then we do need you know a fair amount of of digit data because you might be wearing a different microphone grad d:   phd g: and ,  so it 's it 's nice to have the digits you know , replicated many times . phd g: so we have a problem with acoustic adaptation , and we 're not using the digit data now , but you know grad d: Oh , you 're not . v W we 're not we were running adaptation only on the data that we ran recognition on and I 'd As soon as someone started to read transcript number , that 's read speech and I thought \" well , we 're gonna do better on that , grad d: Oh I see . So those speakers who are very quiet , shy grad d: That would be interesting to see whether that helps . phd g: r Right phd b: Like Adam ? grad d: Do you think that would help adapting on Yeah . phd g: Well , it sh  it 's the same micropho see the nice thing is we have that in the in the same meeting , grad d: Right . phd g: and so you don't get grad d: same microphone , phd a: Yeah . professor f: Yeah  , for the for the  acoustic research , for the signal - processing , farfield stuff , I see it as as as the place that we start . But , th  , it 'd be nice to have twenty hours of digits data , but but  the truth is I 'm hoping that we we through the the stuff that that you guys have been doing as you continue that , we get , the best we can do on the spontaneous stuff  ,  nearfield , and then  , we do a lot of the testing of the algorithms on the digits for the farfield , and at some point when we feel it 's mature and we understand what 's going on with it then we we have to move on to the spontaneous data with the farfield . phd g: The only thing that we don't have , I know this sounds weird , and maybe it 's completely stupid , but we don't have any overlapping digits . phd g: An - yea I know it 's weird , but  phd a: Overlapping digits ! grad d: The the problem I see with trying to do overlapping digits is the cognitive load . grad d: No it 's it 's not stupid , it 's just  , try to do it . phd g: I 'm just talkin for the stuff that like Dan Ellis is gonna try , grad d: here , let 's try it . phd g: OK So but grad d: So so you read the last line , I 'll read the first line . professor f: No , I 'll p phd g: So you plu you plug your ears . grad d: Oh I guess if you plug you 're ears you could do it , but then you don't get the the same effects . phd g: Well , what  is actually no not the overlaps that are well - governed linguistically , but the actual fact that there is speech coming from two people grad d: Yeah . phd g: and the beam - forming stuf all the acoustic stuff that like Dan Ellis and and company want to do . phd g: It would take one around amount of ti phd b: It 's the P - make of digit reading . I I mea I 'm I was sort of serious , but I really , I 'm I don't feel strongly enough that it 's a good idea , professor f: See , y grad d: You do the last line , I 'll do the first line . I 'm mean I think it 's doable , grad d: The poor transcribers phd g: I 'm just grad d: they 're gonna hate us . phd g: So , we we could have a round like where you do two at a time , and then the next person picks up when the first guy 's done , or something . professor f: Oh like a round , yeah , like in a a phd g: Like a , phd a: Yeah , just pairwise , professor f: yeah . phd g: I 'm actually sort of serious if it would help people do that kind o but the people who wanna work on it we should talk to them . professor f: I don't think we 're gonna collect vast amounts of data that way , phd g: So . professor f: but I think having a little bit might at least be fun for somebody like Dan to play around with , phd g: OK . grad d: I think maybe if we wanted to do that we would do it as a separate session , professor f: yeah . grad d: something like that rather than doing it during a real meeting and you know , do two people at a time then three people at a time and things like that . postdoc e: c c Can I can I have an another another question w about this ? grad d: Oh well . postdoc e: So , there are these digits , which are detached digits , but there are other words that contain the same general phon phoneme sequences . Like \" wonderful \" has \" one \" in it and and Victor Borge had a had a piece on this where he inflated the digits . Well , I wonder if there 's , an if there would be a value in having digits that are in essence embedded in real words to compare in terms of like the articulation of \" one \" in \" wonderful \" versus \" one \" as a digit being read . grad d: Oh ! grad c: It only sounds w good when you scream it , though . postdoc e: Well , I just wanted to offer that as a possible task professor f: Yes . postdoc e: because , you know , if we were to each read his embedded numbers words in sent in sentences cuz it 's like an entire sketch he does and I wouldn't take the inflated version . So he talks about the woman being \" two - derful \" , and and a But , you know , if it were to be deflated , just the normal word , it would be like a little story that we could read . postdoc e: I don't know if it would be useful for comparison , but it 's embedded numbers . grad d: I think for something like that we 'd be better off doing like  TIMIT . Well I think the question is what the research is , so  , I presume that the reason that you wanted to have these digits this way is because you wanted to actually do some research looking at the prosodic form here . professor f: So if somebody wanted to do that , if they wanted to look at the the the difference of the  phones in the digits in the context of a word versus  the digits a a non - digit word versus in digit word ,  that would be a good thing to do , but I think someone would have to express interest in that . professor f: I think , to  if you were interested in it then we could do it , for instance . grad d: We have ASR results from Liz , transcript status from Jane , and disk space and storage formats from Don . Does do we have any prefer preference on which way we wanna we wanna go ? phd g: Well I was actually gonna skip the ASR results part , in favor of getting the transcription stuff talked about grad d:   phd g: since I think that 's more important to moving forward , but  Morgan has this paper copy and if people have questions , it 's pretty preliminary in terms of ASR results because we didn't do anything fancy , but I think e just having the results there , and pointing out some main conclusions like it 's not the speaking style that differs , it 's the fact that there 's overlap that causes recognition errors . And then , the fact that it 's almost all insertion errors , which you would expect but you might also think that in the overlapped regions you would get substitutions and so forth , leads us to believe that doing a better segmentation , like your channel - based segmentation , or some kind of  , echo cancellation to get basically back down to the individual speaker utterances would be probably all that we would need to be able to do good recognition on the on the close - talking mikes . phd a: So these grad d: why don't you , if you have a hard copy , why don't you email it to the list . professor f: Yeah , so it 's the same thing ? phd g:  he he professor f: It 's the same thing I mailed to every everybody that w where it was , phd g: it it 's that paper . phd g: and it 's Let 's see , th I guess the other neat thing is it shows for sure w that the lapel , you know within speaker is bad . grad d: Horrible ? phd g: And it 's bad because it picks up the overlapping speech . phd a: So , your your ASR results were run on the channels synchronized , phd g: Yes , cuz that 's all that w had been transcribed at the time , phd a: OK . phd g: the closer t that would be very interesting for us phd b: So if phd g: because we professor f: Yeah , that 's that 's why I only used the part from use phd a: Yeah . phd b: So if there was a segment of speech this long phd g: cuz phd a: Yeah . phd b: and oh and someone said \" oh , \" the whole thing was passed to the recognizer ? grad d: And someone said \" oh \" in the front in the middle . In fact I I pulled out a couple classic examples in case you wanna u use them in your talk of phd b: That 's why there 's so many insertion errors ? grad c:   phd g: Chuck on the lapel , so Chuck wore the lapel three out of four times . phd g: yeah , and I wore the lapel once , and for me the lapel was OK . phd g: Right , but when Chuck wore the lapel and Morgan was talking there 're a couple really long utterances where Chuck is saying a few things inside , and it 's picking up all of Morgan 's words pretty well and so the rec you know , there 're error rates because of insertion Insertions aren't bounded , so with a one - word utterance and ten insertions you know you got huge error rate . So I this is sort of what we expected , but it 's nice to be able to to show it . phd g: And also I just wanted to mention briefly that ,  Andreas and I called up Dan Ellis who 's still stuck in Switzerland , and we were gonna ask him if if there 're you know , what 's out there in terms of echo cancellation and things like that . \" phd g: And he We 've given him the data we have so far , so these sychronous cases where there are overlap . phd g: And he 's gonna look into trying to run some things that are out there and see how well it can do phd b: So phd g: because right now we 're not able to actually report on recognition in a real paper , like a Eurospeech paper , because it would look sort of premature . phd b: So So the idea is that you would take this big hunk where somebody 's only speaking a small amount in it , and then try to figure out where they 're speaking based on the other peopl phd g: Right . Or who 's At any point in time who 's the foreground speaker , who 's the background speaker . phd g: So there 's like grad d: But how would you do that automatically ? phd g: Well ther there 's phd a: I 've actually done some experiments with cross - correlation phd b: Right . phd a: and it seems to work pretty well to to get rid of those those overlaps , grad d:  that that 's the sort of thing that you would do . Exactly , so it 's it 's a phd b: So why do you want to do echo cancellation ? phd g: it would be techniques used from adaptive adaptive echo cancellation which I don't know enough about to talk about . phd g: But , right , and that would be similar to what you 're also trying to do , but using  , you know , more than energy phd a: Yeah . phd b: So it would be phd g: So the idea is to basically run this on the whole meeting . and get the locations , which gives you also the time boundaries of the individual speak phd b: OK . professor f: Yeah , Dave Dave  is , also gonna be doin usin playing around with echo cancellation for the nearfield farfield stuff , phd g: So . professor f: so we 'll be phd g: And I guess Espen ? This is  is he here too ? professor f: Yeah . phd g: May also be working So it would just be ver that 's really the next step because we can't do too much , you know , on term in terms of recognition results knowing that this is a big problem phd b:   phd b: I think this also ties into one of the things that Jane is gonna talk about too . grad d: I also wanted to say I have done all this chopping up of digits , postdoc e:   Definitely grad d: And and I have scripts that will extract it out from \" key \" files phd g: and Don should grad d: and and do all the naming automatically , phd g: OK . grad c: You 've compiled the list of , speaker names ? phd g: So that that 's it for the grad d:   grad d: and it does all sorts of matches because the way people filled out names is different on every single file so it does a very fuzzy sort of match . phd g: So at this point we can sort of finalize the naming , and so forth , grad c:   phd g: and we 're gonna basically re rewrite out these waveforms that we did because as you notice in the paper your \" M O in one meeting and \" M O - two \" in another meeting and it 's we just need to standardize the grad c: Yeah . phd g: no it 's it 's professor f: No , I didn't notice that actually . So th I now have a script that you can just say basically look up Morgan , phd g: So professor f: Yeah . Is that something we need to talk about at the meeting , or should you just talk with Chuck at some other time ? grad c: I had some general questions just about the compression algorithms of shortening waveforms and I don't know exactly who to ask .  , yeah , which is grad d: And I assume half of it is scratch and half of it is ? grad c: I 'm not exactly sure how they partitioned it . grad c: yeah , I don't know what 's typical here , but  , it 's local though , so grad d: That doesn't matter . How do you do that ? professor f: In fact , this is an eighteen gig drive , or is it a thirty six gig drive with eighteen grad d: N grad c: Eighteen . It was a spare that Dave had around grad d: Slash N slash machine name , slash X A in all likelihood . grad d: so the the only question is how much of it The distinction between scratch and non - scratch is whether it 's backed up or not . grad d: So what you wanna do is use the scratch for stuff that you can regenerate . grad d: So , the stuff that isn't backed up is not a big deal because disks don't crash very frequently , grad c: Right .  all of this stuff can be regenerated , phd g: Yeah it 's grad c: it 's just a question grad d: Then put it all on scratch phd g: Well the grad d: because we 're ICSI is is bottlenecked by backup . grad d: So we wanna put phd g: Well I 'd leave all the All the transcript stuff shouldn't should be backed up , postdoc e:   phd g: but all the waveform Sound files should not be backed up , grad c: Yeah , I guess Right . So , I guess th the other question was then , should we shorten them , downsample them , or keep them in their original form ?  grad d: It just depends on your tools .  , because it 's not backed up and it 's just on scratch , if your sc tools can't take shortened format , I would leave them expanded , grad c: Right . grad d: so you don't have to unshorten them every single time you wanna do anything . phd g: We can downsample them , grad c: Do you think that 'd be OK ? phd g: so . phd g:  the r the front - end on the SRI recognizer just downsamples them on the fly , grad c: Yeah , I guess the only argument against downsampling is to preserve just the original files in case we want to experiment with different filtering techniques . phd g: so So that 's professor f: I I I 'm sorry phd g: Yeah , if professor f: Yeah , l  over all our data , we we want to not downsample . phd g: So we 're what we 're doing is we 're writing out  , this is just a question . We 're writing out these individual segments , that wherever there 's a time boundary from Thilo , or or Jane 's transcribers , you know , we we chop it there . phd g: And the reason is so that we can feed it to the recognizer , professor f:   grad d: Yeah , as I said , since that 's it 's regeneratable , what I would do is take downsample it , phd g: So Yeah . grad d: and compress it however you 're e the SRI recognizer wants to take it in . professor f: ye phd g: So we can't shorten them , grad c: Right . professor f: As yeah , as long as there is a a form that we can come from again , that is not downsampled , then , grad c: r Yeah . That that 's why we need more disk space professor f: uuu phd g: cuz we 're basically duplicating the originals ,  professor f: Yeah . But for for fu future research we 'll be doing it with different microphone positions and so on phd g: Oh yeah . professor f: we would like to phd b: So the SRI front - end won't take a  an an a large audio file name and then a a list of segments to chop out from that large audio file ? professor f: Yeah . phd b: They actually have to be chopped out already ? phd g: it 's better if they 're chopped out , phd b:  - huh . phd g: and and it it will be yeah , y we could probably write something to do that , but it 's actually convenient to have them chopped out cuz you can run them , you know , in different orders . grad d: And that 's the whole point about the naming conventions phd g: you can get rid of grad d: is that you could run all the English speaking , phd g: Yeah , it it 's a lot faster . grad d: all the native speakers , and all the non - native speakers , phd g: Right . You can grab everything with the word \" the \" in it , grad d: and all the men , and all the women . phd g: and it 's That 's a lot quicker than actually trying to access the wavefile each time , find the time boundaries and So in principle , yeah , you could do that , phd b: I don't I don't think that 's really right . phd g: but it 's but it 's  grad d: \" That 's just not right , man . \" The the point phd g: These are long These are long grad d: So so s For example , what if you wanted to run run all the native speakers . grad d: Right , so if if you did it that way you would have to generate a program that looks in the database somewhere , extracts out the language , finds the time - marks for that particular one , do it that way . The way they 're doing it , you have that already extracted and it 's embedded in the file name . And so , you know , you just say phd g: We - yeah that 's so that 's part of it grad d: y so you just say you know \" asterisk E asterisk dot wave \" , and you get what you want . And the other part is just that once they 're written out it it is a lot faster to to process them . Otherwise , you 're just accessing grad d: This is all just temporary access , so I don't I think it 's all just It 's fine . Two gig ? phd g: So we 're also looking at these in Waves like for the alignments and so forth . phd g: You need to s have these small files , and in fact , even for the Transcriber program  grad d: Yes you can . phd g: Yeah , if you try to load s really long waveform into X Waves , you 'll be waiting there for phd b: No , I I 'm not suggesting you load a long wave file , phd g: Oh phd b: I 'm just saying you give it a start and an end time . grad d: I th w The transcribers didn't have any problem with that did they Jane ? postdoc e: What 's th u w in what respect ? phd g: Loading the long phd a: No , with the Transcriber tool , it 's no problem . phd g: It takes a very long ti phd a: Yeah just to load a transcription postdoc e: In the in   grad d: Are you talking about Transcriber or X Waves ? phd g: Huh . phd g: Actually , you 're talking about Transcriber , right ? phd a: Yeah . grad d: And they were loading the full mixed files then , postdoc e: Yeah . Well we we have a problem with that , you know , time - wise on a It - it 's a lot slower to load in a long file , grad d:  . phd g: and also to check the file , so if you have a transcript , grad d: Well regardless , it 's professor f: Yeah . phd g:  it 's I I think overall you could get everything to work by accessing the same waveform and trying to find two you know , the begin and end times .  , but I think it 's more efficient , if we have the storage space , to have the small ones . grad d: and , it 's no problem , right ? phd g: Yeah , it 's grad d: Because it 's not backed up . grad d: So we just phd g: It 's it 's just grad d: If we don't have a spare disk sitting around we go out and we buy ourselves an eighty gigabyte drive and make it all scratch space . phd g: Yeah , so these wouldn't be backed up , the postdoc e: Yeah . grad d: So remind me afterward phd g: And grad d: and I 'll and we 'll look at your disk and see where to put stuff .  , I could just u do a DU on it right ? And just see which how much is on each So . Alright so , first of all , there was a an interest in the transcribe transcription , checking procedures and and I can tell you first , to go through the steps although you 've probably seen them .  , as you might imagine , when you 're dealing with , r really c a fair number of words , and  , @ @ natural speech which means s self - repairs and all these other factors , that there 're lots of things to be , s standardized and streamlined and checked on . And , so , I did a bunch of checks , and the first thing I did was obviously a spell - check . And at that point I discovered certain things like , \" accommodate \" with one \" M \" , that kind of thing . And then , in addition to that , I did an exhaustive listing of the forms in the data file , which included n detecting things like f faulty punctuation and things phd b: I 'm I 'm sorry to interrupt postdoc e: Yeah ? phd b: you could could I just back up a little bit postdoc e: Sure , please , phd b: and postdoc e: yeah , please , please . phd b: So you 're doing these So the whole process is that the transcribers get the conversation postdoc e: Yeah , yeah , yeah . phd b: And then when they 're finished with it , it comes to you , postdoc e: That 's right . And so , I do a an exhaustive listing of the forms Actually , I will go through this in in order , so if if we could maybe wait and stick keep that for a second cuz we 're not ready for that . grad d: So on the fifth page , seven down postdoc e: Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . Exactly ! Exactly ! Alright so , a spelling check first then an exhaustive listing of the ,  all the forms in the data with the punctuation attached and at that point I pick up things like , oh , you know , word followed by two commas . But there 's w And that that 's done with the assumption that pronunciation variants can be handled . So for things like \" and \" , the fact that someone doesn't say the \" D \" ,  that 's not important enough to capture in the transcription because a a good pronunciation , you know , model would be able to handle that . However , things like \" cuz \" where you 're lacking an entire very prominent first syllable , and furthermore , it 's a form that 's specific to spoken language , those are r reasons f for those reasons I I kept that separate , and used the convention of using \" CUZ \" for that form , however , glossing it so that it 's possible with the script to plug in the full orthographic form for that one , and a couple of others , not many . So \" wanna \" is another one , \" going \"  , \" gonna \" is another one , with just the assumption , again , that this th these are things which it 's not really fair to a c consider expect that a pronunciation model , to handle . And Chuck , you in you indicated that \" cuz \" is is one of those that 's handled in a different way also , didn't you ? Did I phd b: I don't remember . postdoc e: but someone told me that in fact \" cuz \" is treated differently in , i u in this context because of that r reason that , it 's a little bit farther than a pronunciation variant . OK , so after that , let 's see , phd b: So that was part of the spell - check , or was that that was after the spell - check ? postdoc e:  . Well so when I get the exhau So the spell - check picks up those words because they 're not in the dictionary . postdoc e: So it gets \" cuz \" and \" wanna \" and that grad d: And then you gloss them ? postdoc e: Yeah ,   Run it through I have a sed You know , so I do sed script saying whenever you see \" gonna \" you know , \" convert it to gonna \" , you know , \" gloss equals quote going - to quote \" , you know . OK , I also wrote a script which will , retrieve anything in curly brackets , or anything which I 've classified as an acronym , and a pronounced acronym . So if it 's \" ACL \" then it 's \" A \" underscore \" C \" underscore \" L \" . grad d: And so so your list here , are these ones that actually occurred in the meetings ? postdoc e: And the th Yes . phd g: can I ask a question about the glossing ,  before we go on ? postdoc e: Yeah . phd g: So , for a word like \" because \" is it that it 's always predictably \" because \" ?  , is \" CUZ \" always meaning \" because \" ? postdoc e: Yes , but not the reverse . So sometimes people will say \" because \" in the meeting , and if if they actually said \" because \" , then it 's written as \" because \" with no w \" cuz \" doesn't even figure into the equation . professor f: But but in our meetings people don't say \" hey cuz how you doing ? \" phd g: Beca - because Right . phd g: so , I guess So , from the point of view of postdoc e: That 's a good point . phd g: The the only problem is that with for the recognition we we map it to \" because \" , grad d: Well , phd g: and so if we know that \" CUZ \" postdoc e: That 's fine . phd g: but , we don't grad d: You have the gloss form so you always replace it . postdoc e: and he 's bee he has a glo he has a script that grad c: I replace the \" cuz \" with \" because \" if it 's glossed . grad c: And phd g: But then there are other glosses that we don't replace , right ? Because postdoc e: Yes . postdoc e: on the different on the different types of comments , which we 'll which we 'll see in just a second . postdoc e: So the pronounceable acronyms get underscores , the things in curly brackets are viewed as comments . w And maybe we 'll expand that grad d:  postdoc e: but the but the comments are , of four types mainly right now . grad d: Can ca postdoc e: Another type is ,  grad d: So a are we done with acronyms ? Cuz I had a question on what what this meant . postdoc e: OK so , gloss is things like replacing the full form u with the , more abbreviated one to the left .  , then you have if it 's  , there 're a couple different types of elements that can happen that aren't really properly words , and wo some of them are laughs and breathes , so we have  that 's prepended with a v a tag of \" VOC \" . phd a: Whew !  postdoc e: And the non - vocal ones are like door - slams and tappings , and that 's prepended with a no non - vocalization . phd b: So then it just an ending curly brace there , or is there something else in there . postdoc e: Oh yeah , so i e this would grad d: A comment , basically . postdoc e: And then the no non - vocalization would be something like a door - slam . And then the third type right now , is m things that fall in the category of comments about what 's happening . So it could be something like , you know , \" referring to so - and - so \" , \" talking about such - and - such \" , you know , \" looking at so - and - so \" . phd b: on the middle t So , in the first case that gloss applies to the word to the left . But in the middle two Th - it 's not applying to anything , right ? postdoc e: Yeah , and this gets substituted here . grad d: Well the \" QUAL \" can be The \" QUAL \" is applying to the left . postdoc e: Well , and actually , it is true that , with respect to \" laugh \" , there 's another one which is \" while laughing \" , grad d: \" While laughing \" . postdoc e: and that is , i i An argument could be made for this tur turning that into a qualitative statement because it 's talking about the thing that preceded it , but at present we haven't been , coding the exact scope of laughing , you know , and so to have \" while laughing \" , you know that it happened somewhere in there which could well mean that it occurred separately and following , or , you know , including some of the utterances to the left . Haven't been awfully precise about that , but I have here , now we 're about to get to the to this now , I have frequencies . But , the very front page deals with this , final c pa  , aspect of the standardization which has to do with the spoken forms like \"  -  \" and \"  -  \" and \" ha \" and \"  -  \" and all these different types . And , someone pointed out to me , this might have been Chuck , about ,  about how a recognizer , if it 's looking for \"  - hmmm \" with three M 's , and it 's transcribed with two M 's , that it might  , that it might increase the error rate which is which would really be a shame because  , I p I personally w would not be able to make a claim that those are dr dramatically different items . postdoc e: I I should say grad d: So it 's a small list . So , I 'm gonna I 'm gonna I 'm gonna check grad d: That that 's known as \" found data \" . I got It was stored in a place I didn't expect , grad c: It 's like the z Zapruder Film . So I 'll I 'll be able to get through that tonight , and then everyth i well , actually later today probably . postdoc e: And I made it so that these are , with a couple exceptions but , things that you wouldn't find in the spell - checker so that they 'll show up really easily . And ,  grad c: Jane , can I ask you a question ? What 's that very last one correspond to ? postdoc e: Sure . grad c: is that like someone 's like burning or some such thing ? postdoc e: So - c I haven't listened to it so I don't know . grad c: Like their hair 's on fire ? postdoc e: I haven't heard it actually . grad d: Ah ! phd a: It 's the Castle of Ah ! phd g: Actually we we gave this to our pronunciation person , grad c: it looks like that . postdoc e: Did she hear the th did she actually hear it ? Cuz I haven't heard it . phd g: No , we just gave her a list of words that , you know , weren't in our dictionary and so of course it picked up stuff like this , and she just didn't listen so she didn't know . Yeah I 'm curious to se hear what it is , but I didn't know wanna change it to something else until I knew . phd g: Maybe it 's \" argh \" ? postdoc e: Well , sss , you know phd g:  grad c: But that 's not really like postdoc e: Hhh . grad c: No one really says \" argh , \" you know , postdoc e:  phd g: Yeah . Right , no one say grad c: it 's not professor f: Well , you just did . phd b: Except for now ! grad c: Well , there 's another there 's another word error . grad d: Ah ! postdoc e: phd g: So , Jane , what 's the d grad d: Maybe he died while dictating . phd g: I have one question about the the \" EH \" versus like the \" AH \" and the \"  \" . postdoc e: That 's partly a nonnative - native thing , phd g: OK . phd g:  postdoc e: But it 's mostly non - native phd a: H phd b: That 's \" eh \" versus \" ah \" ? phd g: S OK . grad d: Eh ? phd g: \" Eh , \" yeah right , cuz there were were some speakers that did definite \" eh 's \" postdoc e:   phd g: but right now we phd b: They were the Canadians , right ? professor f: Canadians , yeah , yeah , yeah . phd g: So , it it 's actually probably good for us to know the difference between the real \" eh \" and the one that 's just like \"  \" or transcribed \" aaa \" postdoc e: Exactly . phd g: cuz in like in Switchboard , you would see e all of these forms , but they all were like \"  \" . grad d: You mean just the single letter \" a \" as in the particle ? phd a: The transcription or grad d: Article . phd g: No , no ,  like the the \"  \" , postdoc e: \"  \" . grad d: I 'm just these poor transcribers , they 're gonna hate this meeting . phd g: But you 're a native German speaker so it 's not a not a issue for phd a: Yeah . phd g: So it 's like Japanese and Spanish postdoc e: Yeah I I think you 've  - huh , yeah . phd g: and grad d: I didn't get that , postdoc e: That makes sense . postdoc e: Yeah , and so , you know , th th I have there are some , Americans who who are using this \" eh \" too , and I haven't listened to it systematically , maybe with some of them , they 'd end up being \"  's \" but , I my spot - checking has made me think that we do have \" eh \" in also , American e e data represented here . But any case , that 's the this is reduced down from really quite a long a much longer list , phd g: Yeah this is great . grad d: Yeah , it 's good , postdoc e: and this is grad d: yeah . postdoc e: functionally pretty , you know , also It was fascinating , I was listening to some of these , I guess two nights ago , and it 's just hilarious to liste to to do a search for the \"  -  's \" . postdoc e: Just I wanted to say I w think it would be fun to make a montage of it because there 's a \"   postdoc e: All these different vocal tracts , you know , but it 's it 's the same item .  , then the acronyms y and the ones in parentheses are ones which the transcriber wasn't sure of , grad d: Oh I see . postdoc e: and I haven't been able to listen to to to clarify , but you can see that the parenthesis convention makes it very easy to find them grad d: o How about question mark ? postdoc e: cuz it 's the only place where where they 're used . grad d: So they so it 's \" PLP ? \" postdoc e: Exactly . Sometimes the contrastive stress is showing up , and ,  professor f: I 'm sorry , I I got lost here . What - w what 's the difference between the parenthesized acronym and the non - parenthesized ? postdoc e: The parenthesized is something that the transcriber thought was ANN , but wasn't entirely sure . So I 'd need to go back or someone needs to go back , and say , you know , yes or no , professor f: Ah . postdoc e: But the parentheses are used only in that context in the transcripts , of of noti noticing that there 's something uncertain . grad d: Yeah , P - make is phd g: Yeah  cuz they they have no idea , grad d: That 's a good one . phd g: but it 's professor f: I I don't recognize a lot of these . grad d: I know ! I I was saying that I think a lot of them are the Networks meeting . phd g: and the PTA was in these , topics about children , postdoc e: Yeah . phd g: Is the P - PTA working ? postdoc e: Right and sometimes , you see a couple of these that are actually \" OK 's \" so it 's it 's may be that they got to the point where  it was low enough understandable understandability that they weren't entirely sure the person said \" OK . \" You know , so it isn't really necessarily a an undecipherable acronym , grad c: There 's a lot of \" OK 's \" . This professor f: The number to the left is the number of incidences ? grad d: Count . professor f: So CTS is really big here , grad d: Yeah , I wonder what it is . phd a: So what is the difference between \" papers rustling \" and \" rustling papers \" ? professor f: IP , I know what IP is . postdoc e: But , I I 'm a little hesitant to to collapse across categories unless I actually listen to them . OK well professor f: Wh - the self - referential aspect of these these p phd g: I 'm wai grad c: Yeah . phd g: Well this is exactly how people will prove that these meetings do differ because we 're recording , right ? grad d: Yes . phd g: Y no normally you don't go around saying , \" Now you 've said it six times . phd g: Now you 've said \" postdoc e: But did you notice that there were seven hundred and eighty five instances of \" OK \" ? phd a: Seven hundred eighty - five instances . grad d: And that 's an underestimate postdoc e: Extra forty one if it 's questioned . grad c: Is this after like did you do some  replacements for all the different form of \" OK \" to this ? professor f: Yeah . phd b: Wait a minute , w s professor f: So now we 're up to seven hundred and eighty eight . postdoc e: Yeah that 's grad c: Although , what 's there 's one with a slash after it . phd b: Was that somewhere where they were gonna say \" new speaker \" or something ? postdoc e: No , I looked for that , but that doesn't actually exist . postdoc e: I i it 's the only grad c: There 's postdoc e: it 's the only pattern that has a slash after it , and I think it 's it 's an epiphenomenon . grad d: So I 'll just I was just looking at the bottom of page three there , is that \" to be \" or \" not to be \" . phd b: There 's no tilde in front of it , postdoc e: Oh that 's cute . \" postdoc e: There is th one Y well , no , that 's r that 's legitimate . So now , comments , you can see they 're listed again , same deal , with exhaustive listing of everything found in everything except for these final th thirty minutes . grad d: OK so , on some of these QUALs , postdoc e: Yeah . grad d: are they really QUALs , or are they glosses ? So like there 's a \" QUAL TCL \" . professor f: What 's a QUAL ? grad d: Oh I see , I see . grad c: Sh - shouldn't it be \" QUAL TICKLE \" or something ? grad d: It wasn't said \" TCL \" . grad c: Like it 's not postdoc e: On the in the actual script in the actual transcript , I s I So this this happens in the very first one . postdoc e: Because we they didn't say \" TCL \" , they said \" tickle \" . professor f: I f I forget , what 's QUAL ? postdoc e: Qual - qualifier . grad c: It 's not something you wanna replace with postdoc e: Comment or contextual comment . phd b: So they didn't mean \" tickle \" as in Elmo , grad c: but phd a: Tickle ? professor f: Yeah . phd g: But at some point  , we probably shoul grad d: We 'll probably add it to the language model . phd b: Add what , Liz ? grad d: We can go on lan lan add it to both dictionary and language model . phd g: it 's in the language model , w yeah , but it so it 's the pronunciation model that has to have a pronunciation of \" tickle \" . Right ? phd a: \" tickle \" is pronounced \" tickle \" ? phd b: What are you saying ? grad d: It 's pronounced the same it 's pronounced the same as the verb . phd g: I 'm sorry ! grad d: So I think it 's the language model that makes it different . What I meant is that there should be a pronunciation \" tickle \" for TCL as a word . phd g: And that word in the in , you know , it stays in the language model wherever it was . phd g: Yeah you never would put \" tickle \" in the language model in that form , postdoc e:  grad d: Right . There 's actually a bunch of cases like this with people 's names and phd b: So how w there 'd be a problem for doing the language modeling then with our transcripts the way they are . Yeah so th th there there 's a few cases like that where the  , the word needs to be spelled out in in a consistent way as it would appear in the language , but there 's not very many of these . grad d: And and you 'll ha you 'll have to do it sychronously . grad d: Right , so y so , whoever 's creating the new models , will have to also go through the transcripts and change them synchronously . We have this there is this thing I was gonna talk to you about at some point about , you know , what do we do with the dictionary as we 're up updating the dictionary , these changes have to be consistent with what 's in the Like spelling people 's names and so forth . If we make a spelling correction to their name , like someone had Deborah Tannen 's name mispelled , and since we know who that is , you know , we could correct it , grad d: You can correct it . phd g: but but we need to make sure we have the mispel If it doesn't get corrected we have to have a pronunciation as a mispelled word in the dictionary . postdoc e: Well , of course now the the Tannen corre the spelling c change . So if there 's things that get corrected before we get them , it 's it 's not an issue , postdoc e:   phd g: but if there 's things that  , we change later , then we always have to keep our the dictionary up to date . And then , yeah , in the case of \" tickle \" I guess we would just have a , you know , word \" TCL \" which phd b:   phd g: which normally would be an acronym , you know , \" TCL \" grad d: Right . postdoc e: \" ICSI \" is is one of those that sometimes people pronounce and sometimes they say \" ICSI . postdoc e: So , those that are l are listed in the acronyms , I actually know phd g: Oh yeah . The others , e those really do need to be listened to cuz I haven't been able to go to all the IC ICSI things , phd g: Right , exactly . postdoc e: and and until they 've been listened to they stay as \" ICSI \" . professor f: Don and I were just noticing , love this one over on page three , \" vocal vocal gesture mimicking sound of screwing something into head to hold mike in place . postdoc e: It was ! In fact , it was ! Yeah ! grad d: A lot of these are me the the \" beep is said with a high pit high pitch and lengthening . grad d: That was the I was imitating  , beeping out postdoc e: Yeah , that 's it . phd g: Oh there is something spelled out \" BEEEEEEP \" grad c:  postdoc e: That 's it . Because he was saying , \" How many E 's do I have to allow for ? \" grad c: You need a lot of grad d: What I meant was \" beep \" . postdoc e: And those of course get get picked up in the frequency check grad d: glosses . postdoc e: and you know  it gets kicked out in the spelling , and it also gets kicked out in the , freq frequency listing . postdoc e: I have the there 're various things like \" breathe \" versus \" breath \" versus \" inhale \" and , hhh , you know , I don't know . I I think they don't have any implications for anything else so it 's like I 'm tempted to leave them for now an and It 's easy enough to find them when they 're in curly brackets . professor f: \" Sings finale - type song \" grad c: Yeah , that was in the first meeting . grad d: postdoc e: Yeah , but I don't actually remember what it was . \" postdoc e:  Chuck Chuck led to a refinement here which is to add \" NUMS \" if these are parts of the read numbers . Now you already know i that I had , in places where they hadn't transcribed numbers , I put \" numbers \" in place of any kind of numbers , but there are places where they , it th this convention came later an and at the very first digits task in some transcripts they actually transcribed numbers . And , d Chuck pointed out that this is read speech , and it 's nice to have the option of ignoring it for certain other prob  p  , things . And that 's why there 's this other tag here which occurs a hundred and five or three hundred and five times right now which is just well n n \" NUMS \" by itself grad d: \" NUMS \" , yeah .  , i with the sed command you can really just change it however you want because it 's systematically encoded , you know ? grad d: Yep . postdoc e: Have to think about what 's the best for for the overall purposes , but in any case , \" numbers \" and \" NUMS \" are a part of this digits task thing . And actually , th  , the reason I b did it this way was because I initially started out with the other version , you have the numbers and you have the full form and the parentheses , however sometimes people stumble over these numbers they 're saying . And there 's no way of capturing that if you 're putting the numbers off to the side . You can't have the seven and grad d: So what 's to the left of these ? postdoc e: The left is i so example the very first one , grad d:   postdoc e: And then , in here , \" NUMS \" , so it 's not going to be mistaken as a gloss . grad d: OK now , the other example is , in the glosses right there , postdoc e: Thank you . grad d: What what 's to the left of that ? postdoc e: Well now In that case it 's people saying things like \" one one one dash so - and - so \" or they 're saying  \" two  zero \" whatever . postdoc e: And in that case , it 's part of the numbers task , and it 's not gonna be included in the read digits anyway , phd b: So there will be a \" NUMS \" tag on those lines ? postdoc e: so I m in the  There is . postdoc e: So , so gloss in the same line that would have \" gloss quote one one one dash one thirty \" , you 'd have a gloss at the end of the line saying , \" curly bracket NUMS curly bracket \" . postdoc e: So if you if you did a , a \" grep minus V nums \" phd g: Oh , so you could do \" grep minus V nums \" . phd g: So there wouldn't be something like i if somebody said something like , \" Boy , I 'm really tired , OK . Cuz I was doing the \" grep minus V \" quick and dirty and looked like that was working OK , postdoc e:   Now why do we what 's the reason for having like the point five have the \" NUMS \" on it ? Is that just like when they 're talking about their data or something ? postdoc e: This is more because phd g: Or postdoc e: Yeah . Oh these are all these , the \" NUMS point \" , this all where they 're saying \" point \" something or other . phd g: These are all like inside the spontaneous postdoc e: And the other thing too is for readability of the transcript .  if you 're trying to follow this while you 're reading it it 's really hard to read , you know eh , \" so in the data column five has \" , you know , \" one point five compared to seventy nine point six \" , it 's like when you see the words it 's really hard to follow the argument . And this is just really a a way of someone who would handle th the data in a more discourse - y way to be able to follow what 's being said . postdoc e: So this is where Chuck 's , overall h architecture comes in , phd g: I see .  , there will be scripts that are written to convert it into these t these main two uses and th some scripts will take it down th e into a f a for ta take it to a format that 's usable for the recognizer an  , other scripts will take it to a form that 's usable for the for linguistics an and discourse analysis . These will just be things that are generated , grad d: Right postdoc e: and e by using scripts . postdoc e: When things change then the the script will cham change but the but there won't be stored copies of in different versions of things . phd g: So , I guess I 'd have one request here which is just , maybe to make it more robust , th that the tag , whatever you would choose for this type of \" NUMS \" where it 's inside the spontaneous speech , is different than the tag that you use for the read speech . phd g: that way w if we make a mistake parsing , or something , we don't see the \" point five \" , or or it 's not there , then we phd b:   phd g: a Just an And actually for things like \" seven eighths \" , or people do fractions too I guess , you maybe you want one overall tag for sort of that would be similar to that , postdoc e: Except phd g: or As long as they 're sep as they 're different strings that we that 'll make our p sort of processing more robust . postdoc e: Well phd g: Cuz we really will get rid of everything that has the \" NUMS \" string in it . phd b: I suppose what you could do is just make sure that you get rid of everything that has \" curly brace NUMS curly brace \" . postdoc e: You know , as I said I was considering changing it to \" digits \" . And , it just i you know , it 's just a matter of deciding on whatever it is , and being sure the scripts know . phd g: It would probably be safer , if you 're willing , to have a separate tag just because  , then we know for sure .  , phd b: Yeah , and it makes it I guess the thing about phd g: but it it 's probably not hard for a person to tell the difference phd b: Yeah . phd g: because one 's in the context of a you know , a transcribed word string , phd b: Right . postdoc e: The other thing is you can get really so minute with these things phd g: and So postdoc e: and increase the size of the files and the re and decrease the readability to such an extent by simply something like \" percent \" . Now I I could have adopted a similar convention for \" percent \" , but somehow percent is not so hard , you know ? grad d:  . postdoc e: i It 's just when you have these points and you 're trying to figure out where the decimal places are And we could always add it later . And you 'll find both of those in one of these meetings , where he 's saying \" well the first point I wanna make is so - and - so \" and he goes through four points , and also has all these decimals . phd b: what does the SRI recognizer output for things like that ? \" seven point five \" . phd b: Right , the word \" seven \" ? grad d: Well , the numbers ? phd b: The number \" seven \" ? phd g: The word . professor f: So I 'd so \" I 'd like I 'd like to talk about point five \" . phd g: it 's the same point , actually , the the p you know , the word \" to \" and the word y th \" going to \" and \" to go to \" those are two different \" to 's \" and so there 's no distinction there . phd g: It 's just just the word \" point \" has Yeah , every word has only one , yeah e one version even if even if it 's A actually even like the word \" read \" and \" read \" Those are two different words . phd g: So , yeah , I I like the idea of having this in there , I just I was a little bit worried that , the tag for removing the read speech because i What if we have like \" read letters \" or , I don't know , grad d: We might wanna just a separate tag that says it 's read . OK ? Are we done ? postdoc e: Well I wanted to say also regarding the channelized data , grad d: Oh , I guess we 're not done . postdoc e: that , Thilo requested , that we ge get some segments done by hand to e e s reduce the size of the time bins wh like was Chuc - Chuck was mentioning earlier that , that , if you if you said , \" Oh \" and it was in part of a really long , s complex , overlapping segment , that the same start and end times would be held for that one grad d: Well postdoc e: as for the longer utterances , grad d: We did that for one meeting , right , postdoc e: and grad d: so you have that data don't you ? phd a: Yeah , that 's the training data . postdoc e: And he requested that there be , similar , samples done for five minute stretches c involving a variety of speakers and overlapping secti sections . postdoc e: He gave me he did the very nice , he he did some shopping through the data and found segments that would be useful . In addition the I 've I have the transcribers expanding the amount that they 're doing actually . postdoc e: So right now , I know that as of today we got an extra fifteen minutes of that type , and I 'm having them expand the realm on either side of these places where they 've already started . postdoc e: But if if you know , and I and he 's gonna give me some more sections that that he thinks would be useful for this purpose . postdoc e: Because it 's true , if we could do the the more fine grained tuning of this , using an algorithm , that would be so much more efficient . phd a: So I I thought we we sh we sh perhaps we should try to to start with those channelized versions just to just to try it . Give it Give one tr transcriber the the channelized version of of my speech - nonspeech detection and look if if that 's helpful for them , or just let them try if if that 's better or If they if they can postdoc e: You mean to start from scratch f in a brand new transcript ? phd a: Yeah . As it stands we 're still in the phase of sort of , cleaning up the existing data getting things , in i m more tight tightly time  , aligned . I also wanna tell  , I also wanted to r raise the issue that OK so , there 's this idea we 're gonna have this master copy of the transcript , it 's gonna be modified by scripts t into these two different functions . postdoc e: So right now we 've taken this i initial one , it was a single channel basically the way it was input . And now , thanks to the advances made in the interface , we can from now on use the channelized part , and , any changes that are made get made in the channelized version kind of thing . But I wanted to get all the finished all the checks phd b: Yeah , so that has implications for your script . So , have those e e the vis the ten hours that have been transcribed already , have those been channelized ? And I know I 've seen @ @ I 've seen they 've been channelized , postdoc e: Yes , they have . grad d: All ten hours ? grad c: but postdoc e: Except for the missing thirty minutes . grad c: have they  have they been has the time have the time markings been adjusted , p on a per channel grad d: Great . postdoc e: for for a total of like twenty m f for a total of Let 's see , four times total of about an thirty minutes . grad c: I guess , I don't know if we should talk about this now , or not , but I grad d: Well it 's just we 're missing tea . grad c: No , but  my question is like should I wait until all of those are processed , and channelized , like the time markings are adjusted before I do all the processing , and we start like branching off into the into the our layer of  transcripts . postdoc e: Well , you know the problem the problem is that some some of the adjustments that they 're making are to bring are to combine bins that were time bins which were previously separate . postdoc e: And so , i i i it 's true that it 's likely to be adjusted in the way that the words are more complete . postdoc e: so I it 's gonna be a more reliable thing and I 'm not sure grad c:  I 'm sure about that , postdoc e: Yeah . grad c: but do you have like a time frame when you can expect like all of it to be done , or when you expect them to finish it , or postdoc e: Well partly it depends on how  , how e effective it will be to apply an algorithm because i this takes time , grad c: Yeah . phd b: So right now the what you 're doing is you 're taking the  , the o original version and you 're sort of channelizing yourself , right ? grad c: Yeah .  i if the time markings aren't different across channels , like the channelized version really doesn't have any more information . grad c: So , I was just  , originally I had done before like the channelized versions were coming out . grad c: phd b: So I I th I think probably the way it 'll go is that , you know , when we make this first general version and then start working on the script , that script @ @ that will be ma you know primarily come from what you 've done , we 'll need to work on a channelized version of those originals . phd b: And so it should be pretty much identical to what you have t except for the one that they 've already tightened the boundaries on . phd b: So postdoc e: Yeah ,  phd b: and then probably what will happen is as the transcribers finish tightening more and more , you know , that original version will get updated postdoc e: yeah . phd b: But the I guess the ef the effect for you guys , because you 're pulling out the little wave forms into separate ones , that would mean these boundaries are constantly changing you 'd have to constantly re rerun that , grad c: I know . phd g: I I think the harder part is making sure that the transc the transcription phd b: OK . phd g: So if you b merge two things , then you know that it 's the sum of the transcripts , but if you split inside something , you don't where the word which words moved . phd g: And that 's wh that 's where it becomes a little bit  , having to rerun the processing . grad c: You know , if I just have to run three scripts to extract it all and let it run on my computer for an hour and a half , or however long it takes to parse and create all the reference file , that 's not a problem . And I know exactly like what the steps will work what 's going on , in the editing process , phd b: Yeah . postdoc e: So that 's I  I could there were other checks that I did , but it 's I think that we 've unless you think there 's anything else , I think that I 've covered it "

        "Query": "Summarize the discussion on the problems, solutions, and ideas about recording data and the current status of the recordings.",
        "Summary": "To ensure accuracy, a small percentage of transcripts will be modified to correct any misread or uncorrected digits. In order to establish consistent links between speakers and their corresponding identification tags, a speaker database will be compiled. The initial test set of digits has been completed, consisting of 4,000 lines with each line containing 1-10 digits. To explore different prosodic groupings of numbers, new digit forms were distributed. The group also discussed new naming conventions to facilitate the sorting process. In order to standardize file names, existing files will be modified to have equal lengths. Similar changes will be made to speaker identification tags. Additionally, files will include information specifying the channel, microphone, and broadcaster details. PhD F suggested recording different meetings with the same group to aid in tasks like summarization, while Professor D advocated for random meeting participants to ensure diversity for acoustical research purposes.",
        "Article": "But all all I know is that it seems like every time I am up here after a meeting , and I start it , it works fine . And if I 'm up here and I start it and we 're all sitting here waiting to have a meeting , it gives me that error message and I have not yet sat down with been able to get that error message in a point where I can sit down and find out where it 's occurring in the code . professor d: So  so the  , the new procedural change that just got suggested , which I think is a good idea is that  , we do the digit recordings at the end . And that way , if we 're recording somebody else 's  meeting , and a number of the participants have to run off to some other meeting and don't have the time , then they can run off . It 'll mean we 'll get somewhat fewer  , sets of digits , but  , I think that way we 'll cut into people 's time , if someone 's on strict time  , less .  , so , let 's see , we were having a discussion the other day , maybe we should bring that up , about  , the nature of the data that we are collecting .  @ @ that  , we should have a fair amount of data that is  , collected for the same meeting , so that we can ,  I don't know . Wh - what what were some of the points again about that ? Is it phd f: well , OK , I 'll back up . phd f: at the previous at last week 's meeting , this meeting I was griping about wanting to get more data and I I talked about this with Jane and Adam , and was thinking of this mostly just so that we could do research on this data  , since we 'll have a new this new student di does wanna work with us , phd a: Well , great . phd f: And he 's already funded part - time , so we 'll only be paying him for sort of for half of the normal part - time , phd a: What a deal . grad b: And what 's he interested in , specifically ? phd f: So he 's comes from a signal - processing background , but I liked him a lot cuz he 's very interested in higher level things , like language , and disfluencies and all kinds of eb maybe prosody , grad b:   Anyway , I thought OK , maybe we should have enough data so that if he starts he 'd be starting in January , next semester that we 'd have , you know , enough data to work with . phd f: But , Jane and Adam brought up a lot of good points that just posting a note to Berkeley people to have them come down here has some problems in that you m you need to make sure that the speakers are who you want and that the meeting type is what you want , and so forth . So , I thought about that and I think it 's still possible , but I 'd rather try to get more regular meetings of types that we know about , and hear , then sort of a mish - mosh of a bunch of one one - time grad b: One offs ? phd f: Yeah , just because it would be very hard to process the data in all senses , both to get the ,  to figure out what type of meeting it is and to do any kind of higher level work on it , like well , I was talking to Morgan about things like summarization , or what 's this meeting about .  it 's very different if you have a group that 's just giving a report on what they did that week , versus coming to a decision and so forth . Then I was  , talking to Morgan about some new proposed work in this area , sort of a separate issue from what the student would be working on where I was thinking of doing some kind of summarization of meetings or trying to find cues in both the utterances and in the utterance patterns , like in numbers of overlaps and amount of speech , sort of raw cues from the interaction that can be measured from the signals and from the diff different microphones that point to sort of hot spots in the meeting , or things where stuff is going on that might be important for someone who didn't attend to listen to . And in that  , regard , I thought we definitely w will need it 'd b it 'd be nice for us to have a bunch of data from a few different domains , or a few different kinds of meetings . So this this meeting is one of them , although I 'm not sure I can participate if I You know , I would feel very strange being part of a meeting that you were then analysing later for things like summarization . phd f: and then there are some others that menti that Morgan mentioned , like the front - end meeting and maybe a networking group meeting . phd f: But basically , for anything where you 're trying to get a summarization of some kind of meeting meaning out of the meeting , it would be too hard to have fifty different kinds of meetings where we didn't really have a good grasp on what does it mean to summarize , grad b: Yeah . phd f: but rather we should have different meetings by the same group but hopefully that have different summaries . And then we need a couple that of We don't wanna just have one group because that might be specific to that particular group , but @ @ three or four different kinds . So , in general , I was thinking more data but also data where we hold some parameters constant or fairly similar , grad b:   phd f: like a meeting about of people doing a certain kind of work where at least half the participants each time are the same . grad b:  professor d: Now , let l l let me just give you the other side to that cuz I ca because I I don't disagree with that , but I think there is a complimentary piece to it too . professor d: As many people here a a and talking about the kind of thing that you were just talking about it would have  too few people from my point of view . So ,  I think I would also very much like us to have a fair amount of really random scattered meetings , of somebody coming down from campus , and and  , phd c:   professor d: sure , if we can get more from them , fine , postdoc e:   professor d: but if we only get one or two from each group , that still could be useful acoustically just because we 'd have close and distant microphones with different people . postdoc e: Can I can I say about that that the the issues that I think Adam and I raised were more a matter of advertising so that you get more native speakers . Because I think if you just say an And in particular , my suggestion was to advertise to linguistics grad students because there you 'd have so people who 'd have proficiency enough in English that that  , it would be useful for for purposes You know . postdoc e: But you know , I think I 've been I 've I I 've gathered data from undergrads at on campus and if you just post randomly to undergrads I think you 'd get such a mixed bag that it would be hard to know how much conversation you 'd have at all . And and the English you 'd have The language models would be really hard to build professor d: Well , you want to i postdoc e: because it would not really be it would be an interlanguage rather than than a professor d: Well , OK , first place , I I I don't think we 'd just want to have random people come down and talk to one another , I think there should be a meeting that has some goal and point cuz I I think that 's what we 're investigating , postdoc e: OK . phd f: It has to be a a pre - existing meeting , like a meeting that would otherwise happen anyway . professor d: So I was I was thinking more in terms of talking to professors  , and and and  , senior  , d and  , doctoral students who are leading projects and offering to them that they have their hold their meeting down here . The second point is  I think that for some time now , going back through BeRP I think that we have had speakers that we 've worked with who had non - native accents and I th I think that postdoc e: Oh , oh . postdoc e: No , it 's more a matter of  , proficiency , e e just simply fluency . postdoc e: I deal with people on on campus who I think sometimes people , undergraduates  in computer science  , have language skills that make , you know that their their fluency and writing skills are not so strong . professor d: You 're just talking about postdoc e: Well , e I just think , grad b: We all had the same thought . postdoc e: but you know , it 's like when you get into the graduate level , no problem . professor d: But grad b: Well , I think that ,  I think that the only thing we should say in the advertisement is that the meeting should be held in English . And and I think if it 's a pre - existing meeting and it 's held in English , I I think it 's probably OK if a few of the people don't have  , g particularly good English skills . postdoc e: OK , now can I can I say the other aspect of this from my perspective which is that  , there 's there 's this this issue , you have a corpus out there , it should be used for for multiple things cuz it 's so expensive to put together . postdoc e: And if people want to approach  , i so I know e e You know this The idea of computational linguistics and probabilistic grammars and all may not be the focus of this group , professor d:  - huh . postdoc e: but the idea of language models , which are fund you know generally speaking  , you know , t t terms of like the amount of benefit per dollar spent or an hour invested in preparing the data , professor d:   postdoc e: if you have a choice between people who are pr more proficient in  , i more fluent , more more close to being academic English , then it would seem to me to be a good thing . I postdoc e: Because otherwise y you don't have the ability to have  , so if if you have a bunch of idiolects that 's the worst possible case . If you have people who are using English as a as an interlanguage because they they don't  , they can't speak in their native languages and but their interlanguage isn't really a match to any existing , language model , professor d:  - huh . professor d: Well , that 's pretty much what you 're going to have in the networking group . But the thing is , I think that these people are of high enough level in their in their language proficiency that professor d: I see . postdoc e: I I 'm I 'm just thinking that we have to think at a at a higher level view , could we have a language model , a a grammar a grammar , basically , that  , wo would be a a possibility . postdoc e: So y so if you wanted to bring in a model like Dan Jurafsky 's model , an and do some top - down stuff , it to help th the bottom - up and merge the things or whatever , it seems like  , I don't see that there 's an argument professor d:   postdoc e: I 'm I what I think is that why not have the corpus , since it 's so expensive to put together , useful for the widest range of of central corp things that people generally use corpora for and which are , you know , used in computational linguistics . professor d: OK , well , i i let 's let 's see what we can get .  , it it I think that if we 're aiming at at  , groups of graduate students and professors and so forth who are talking about things together , and it 's from the Berkeley campus , probably most of it will be OK , postdoc e: Yes , that 's fine . And my point in m in my note to Liz was I think that undergrads are an iff iffy population . grad b: Well , not to mention the fact that I would be hesitant certainly to take anyone under eighteen , probably even an anyone under twenty - one . professor d: Oh , you age - ist ! grad b: What 's that ? Well , age - ist . Well , Morgan , you were mentioning that Mari may not use the k equipment from IBM if they found something else , cuz there 's a professor d: They 're they 're yeah , they 're d they 're  assessing whether they should do that or y do something else , hopefully over the next few weeks . phd f: Cuz  , one remote possibility is that if we st if we inherited that equipment , if she weren't using it , could we set up a room in the linguistics department ? And and  , there there may be a lot more or or in psych , or in comp wherever , in another building where we could  , record people there . I think we 'd have a better chance grad b: I think we 'd need a real motivated partner to do that . But if there were such a  it 's a remote possibility , then  , you know , one of us could you know , go up there and record the meeting or something rather than bring all of them down here . phd f: So it 's just a just a thought if they end up not using the the hardware . professor d: Well , the other thing Yeah ,  the other thing that I was hoping to do in the first place was to turn it into some kind of portable thing so you could wheel it around .  , and grad b: Well , I know that space is really scarce on at least in CS . phd f: But you may not need a separate room , you know , grad b: That 's true . phd f: the idea is , if they have a meeting room and they can guarantee that the equipment will be safe and so forth , and if one of us is up there once a week to record the meeting or something grad b: True . professor d: Well , maybe John would let us put it into the phonology lab or something . grad b: Yeah , I think it would be interesting because then we could regularly get another meeting . phd c: But I I I think you need , another portable thing a another portable equipment to to do , eh , more e easier the recording process , eh , out from ICSI . phd c: Eh , if you you want to to record , eh , a seminar or a class , eh , in the university , you you need It - it would be eh eh very difficult to to put , eh , a lot of , eh , head phones eh in different people when you have to to record only with , eh , this kind of , eh , d device . grad b: Yeah , but I think if we if we wanna just record with the tabletop microphones , that 's easy . grad b: Right ? That 's very easy , phd c: Ye - Yeah , yeah . professor d: Actually , that 's a int that raises an interesting point that came up in our discussion that 's maybe worth repeating . We realized that , when we were talking about this that , OK , there 's these different things that we want to do with it . So , it 's true that we wanna be selective in some ways , the way that you were speaking about with , not having an interlingua and  , these other issues . But on the other hand , it 's not necessarily true that we need all of the corpus to satisfy all of it . So , a a as per the example that we wanna have a fair amount that 's done with a small n recorded with a small , typ number of types of meetings But we can also have another part that 's , just one or two meetings of each of a of a range of them and that 's OK too .  , i We realized in discussion that the other thing is , what about this business of distant and close microphones ?  , we really wanna have a substantial amount recorded this way , that 's why we did it . But what about For th for these issues of summarization , a lot of these higher level things you don't really need the distant microphone . phd f: Right , I c I think there 's grad b: And you don't really need the close microphone , you mean . phd f: Yea - yeah yeah , you actually don't really even need any fancy microphone . postdoc e: Which one did you mean ? professor d: You d You don't ne it doesn't you just need some microphone , somewhere . professor d: but  phd f: use  , but I think that any data that we spend a lot of effort to collect , professor d: Yeah . phd f: you know , each person who 's interested in  , we have a cou we have a bunch of different , slants and perspectives on what it 's useful for , they need to be taking charge of making sure they 're getting enough of the kind of data that they want . phd f: And So in my case , I think there w there is enough data for some kinds of projects and not enough for others . phd f: And so I 'm looking and thinking , \" Well I 'd be glad to walk over and record people and so forth if it 's to help th in my interest . phd f: And other people need to do that for themselves , h or at least discuss it so that we can find some optimal professor d: Right . professor d: But I think that I 'm raising that cuz I think it 's relevant exactly for this idea up there that if you think about , \" Well , gee , we have this really complicated setup to do , \" well maybe you don't . professor d: Maybe if if If really all you want is to have a a a recording that 's good enough to get a  , a transcription from later , you just need to grab a tape recorder and go up and make a recording . professor d: we we could have a fairly We could just get a DAT machine and phd f: Well , I agree with Jane , though , on the other hand that phd c: Yeah . phd f: So that might be true , you may say for instance , summarization , or something that sounds very language oriented . You may say well , \" Oh yeah , you just do that from transcripts of a radio show . phd f: But what you what I was thinking is long term what would be neat is to be able to pick up on  Suppose you just had a distant microphone there and you really wanted to be able to determine this . phd f: So I do think that long term you should always try to satisfy the greatest number of of interests and have this parallel information , which is really what makes this corpus powerful . phd f: Otherwise , you know , lots of other sites can propose individual studies , so professor d:  but I I think that the  i We can't really underestimate the difficulty shouldn't really u underestimate the difficulty of getting a setup like this up . professor d: And so ,  it took quite a while to get that together and to say , \" Oh , we 'll just do it up there , \" phd f: OK . professor d: If you 're talking about something simple , where you throw away a lot of these dimensions , then you can do that right away . Talking about something that has all of these different facets that we have here , it won't happen quickly , it won't be easy , and there 's all sorts of issues about th you know keeping the equipment safe , or else hauling it around , and all sorts of o phd f: So then maybe we should try to bring people here . professor d: I think the first priority should be to pry to get try to get people to come here . phd f: that 's that 's OK , so professor d: We 're set up for it . phd f: Yeah , I And I think we can get people to come here , that But the issue is you definitely wanna make sure that the kind of group you 're getting is the right group so that you don't waste a lot of your time and the overhead in bringing people down . professor d: Yeah , they have to do their digits or they don't get they don't get their food . professor d: Yeah grad b: Should I pursue that ? phd f: Oh , definitely , yeah . grad b: So I 'm not sure whether they 'll still be so willing to volunteer , but I 'll send an email and ask . phd f: I 'd love to get people that are not linguists or engineers , cuz these are both weird grad b: Right . professor d: The the The oth the other h phd f: well , I know , I shouldn't say that . The o the o the other The other thing is , that we we talked about is give to them  , burn an extra CD - ROM . professor d: and give them So if they want a basically and audio record of their phd f: Well , I thought that was I thought he meant , \" Give them a music CD , \" like they g Then he said a CD of the of their speech professor d: Oh . phd f: and I guess it depends of what kind of audience you 're talking to , but You know , I personally would not want a CD of my meeting , grad b: Mmm . Of the meeting ? phd f: but maybe yeah , maybe you 're professor d: If you 're having some planning meeting of some sort and  you 'd like phd f: right . professor d: We 're saying , \" Look , you know , you 're gonna get this . It 's actually p It 's probably gonna be pretty useless to you , grad b: Yep . professor d: but you 'll ge appreciate , you know , where it 's useful and where it 's useless , phd f: Right . professor d: and then , we 're gonna move this technology , so it 'll become useful . phd a: What if you could tell them that you 'll give them the the transcripts when they come back ? postdoc e: Alth phd f: But we might need a little more to incentivize them , that 's all . postdoc e: I hav I have to  raise a little eensy - weensy concern about doing th giving them the CD immediately , because of these issues of , you know , this kind of stuff , where maybe You know ? professor d: Good point . professor d: So we can so we can postdoc e: We could burn it after it 's been cleared with the transcript stage . phd f: If It should be the same CD - ROM that we distribute publically , grad b: That 's a good point . phd f: right ? professor d: Although it 's phd f: Otherwise they 're not allowed to play it for anyone . postdoc e: Yeah , that 's right , say \" Yeah , well , I got this CD , and , Your Honor , I \" grad b: Yeah . So that was that topic , and then  , I guess another topic would be where are we in the whole disk resources question for grad b: We are slowly slowly getting to the point where we have  enough sp room to record meetings . So I  did a bunch of archiving , and still doing a bunch of archiving , I I 'm in the midst of doing the P - files from  , Broadcast News . phd c: Eleven ? grad b: And it 'll take another eleven to do the clone . phd a: Where did you copy it to ? grad b: Well , it 's Abbott . professor d: Sk - It 's copying from one place on Abbott to another place on Abbott ? grad b: Tape . phd a: Ah ! grad b: So I 'm archiving it , and then I 'm gonna delete the files . postdoc e: One thing The good news about that that is that once once it 's archived , it 's pretty quick to get back . professor d: Is it ? postdoc e: it it it The other direction is fast , but this direction is really slow . phd a: Generating a clone ? postdoc e: Yeah , that 's a good point . phd a: Oh ! Hunh ! professor d: S postdoc e: Now , what will  Is the plan to g to So stuff will be saved , it 's just that you 're relocating it ?  , so we 're gonna get more disk space ? Or did I ? grad b: No , the the these are the P - files from Broadcast News , which are regeneratable regeneratable postdoc e: OK . grad b: And so they they were two gigabytes per file and we had six of them or something . professor d: Or maybe six ? grad b: The SUN , ha  , takes more disks than the Andatico one did . The SUN rack takes Th - One took four and one took six , or maybe it was eight and twelve . professor d: How many How much phd a: Is there a difference in price or something ? grad b: Well , what happened is that we we bought all our racks and disks from Andatico for years , according to Dave , and Andatico got bought by another company and doubled their prices . I 've been looking at the , Aurora data and , first first look at it , there were basically three directories on there that could be moved . One was called Aurora , one was Spanish , which was Carmen 's Spanish stuff , and the other one was , SPINE . phd a: And so , I wrote to Dan and he was very concerned that the SPINE stuff was moving to a non - backed - up disk . So , I realized that well , probably not all of that should be moved , just the CD - ROM type data , the the static data . So I moved that , and then  , I asked him to check out and see if it was OK . I told him he could delete it if he wanted to , I haven't checked today to see if he 's deleted it or not . And then Carmen 's stuff , I realized that when I had copied all of her stuff to XA , I had copied stuff there that was dynamic data . professor d: So , but ,  y you 're figuring you can record another five meetings or something with the space that you 're clearing up from the Broadcast News , but , we have some other disks , some of which you 're using for Aurora , but are we g do we have some other other space now ? grad b: Yep . So , so , we have space on the current disk right now , where Meeting Recorder is , and that 's probably enough for about four meetings . phd a: OK , I but the stuff I 'm moving from Aurora is on the DC disk that we grad b: I don't remember . Yeah ,  we were at a hundred percent and then we dropped down to eighty - six for reasons I don't understand . And then with Broadcast News , that 's five or six more meetings , so , you know , we have a couple weeks .  , so , yeah , I think I think we 're OK , until we get the new disk . phd a: So should ,  One question I had for you was , we need we sh probably should move the Aurora an and all that other stuff off of the Meeting Recorder disk . Is there another backed - up disk that you know of that would ? grad b: We should put it onto the Broadcast News one . grad b: But , so we could ' jus just do that at the end of today , once the archive is complete , and I 've verified it . professor d: OK , @ @ So , then I guess th the last thing I 'd had on my my agenda was just to hear hear an update on what what Jose has been doing , phd c:  - huh . professor d: so phd c: I have , eh , The result of my work during the last days . Eh , and the the last , eh , days , eh , I work , eh , in my house , eh , in a lot of ways and thinking , reading eh , different things about the the Meeting Recording project . phd c: But for me , eh is interesting because , eh , eh , here 's i is the demonstration of the overlap , eh , problem . phd c: It 's a real problem , a frequently problem  , because you have overlapping zones eh , eh , eh , all the time . phd c: Eh , by a moment I have , eh , nnn , the , eh , n I I did a mark of all the overlapped zones in the meeting recording , with eh , a exact mark . Oh , you did that by hand ? phd c: Heh ? That 's eh , yet b b Yeah , by b b by hand by hand because , eh , eh \" Why . \" grad b: Can I see that ? Can I get a copy ? professor d: Oh . phd c: My my idea is to work phd a: Wow ! phd c: I I I do I don I don't @ @ I don't know , eh , if , eh , it will be possible because I I I haven't a lot eh , enough time to to to work .  , only just eh , six months , as you know , but , eh , my idea is , eh , is very interesting to to work in in the line of , eh , automatic segmenter . phd c: Eh but eh , eh , in my opinion , we need eh , eh , a reference eh session to t to to evaluate the the the tool . And so are you planning to do that or have you done that already ? phd c: And No , no , with i grad b: Have you done that or are you planning to do that ? phd c: Sorry ? No , I I plan to do that . Darn ! phd c: I plan I plan , but eh , eh , the idea is the is the following . I I will I will eh , talk about eh , in the in the blackboard about the my ideas . phd c: Eh , eh This information eh , with eh , exactly time marks eh , for the overlapping zones eh overlapping zone , and eh , a speaker a a pure speech eh , eh , speaker zone .  , eh zones eh of eh speech of eh , one speaker without any any eh , noise eh , any any acoustic event eh that eh , eh , w eh , is not eh , speech , real speech . And , I need t true eh , silence for that , because my my idea is to to study the nnn the the set of parameters eh , what , eh , are more m more discriminant to eh , classify . The idea is to eh to use eh , I 'm not sure to eh yet , but eh my idea is to use a a cluster eh algorithm or , nnn , a person strong in neural net algorithm to eh to eh study what is the , eh , the property of the different feat eh feature , eh , to classify eh speech and overlapping eh speech . phd c: And my idea is eh , it would be interesting to to have eh , a control set . And my control set eh , will be the eh , silence , silence without eh , any any noise . postdoc e: Which means that we 'd still You 'd hear the grad b: Yeah , fans . phd c: Eh , I  eh , noise eh , eh claps eh , tape clips , eh , the difference eh , professor d:   phd c: eh , eh , event eh , which , eh , eh , has , eh eh , a hard effect of distorti spectral distortion in the in the eh speech . grad b: So so you intend to hand - mark those and exclude them ? professor d:   phd c: Yeah , I have mark in in in in that Not in all in all the the file , grad b:   phd c: only eh , eh , nnn , mmm , I have eh , ehm I don't remind what is the the the the quantity , but eh , I I have marked enough speech on over and all the overlapping zones . I have , eh , two hundred and thirty , more or less , overlapping zones , and is similar to to this information , grad b: Whew !   phd c: because with the program , I cross the information of  , of Jane with eh , my my segmentation by hand . phd c: And the the idea is , eh , I I will use , eh , I want My idea is , eh , to eh to classify . phd c: I I need eh , the exact eh , mark of the different , eh , eh , zones because I I want to put , eh , for eh , each frame a label indicating . I I I put , eh , eh , for each frame a label indicating what is th the type , what is the class , eh , which it belong . phd c: Eh , the class you will overlapping speech \" overlapping \" is a class , eh , \" speech \" @ @ the class that 's grad b: Nonspeech . phd a: These will be assigned by hand ? phd c: a I I I ha I h I I put the mark by hand , phd a: Based on the  - huh . phd c: because , eh , my idea is , eh , in in the first session , I need , eh , I I need , eh , to be sure that the information eh , that , eh , I I will cluster , is is right . Because , eh , eh , if not , eh , I will I will , eh , return to the speech file to analyze eh , what is the problems , grad b: Well , training , and validation . And I I 'd prefer I would prefer , the to to have , eh , this labeled automatically , but , eh , eh , fro th I need truth . So , the difference between the top two , i So so I start at the bottom , so \" silence \" is clear . By \" speech \" do you mean speech by one sp by one person only ? phd c: Speech Yeah . postdoc e: So this is un OK , and then and then the top includes people speaking at the same time , or or a speaker and a breath overlapping , someone else 's breath , or or clicking , overlapping with speech So , that that 's all those possibilities in the top one . phd c: Eh , in the first moment , because , eh , eh , I I have information , eh , of the overlapping zones , eh , information about if the , eh , overlapping zone is , eh , from a speech , clear speech , from a one to a two eh speaker , or three speaker , or is is the zone where the breath of a speaker eh , overlaps eh , onto eh , a speech , another , especially speech . postdoc e: So it 's basi it 's basically speech wi som with with something overlapping , which could be speech but doesn't need to be . phd c: No , no , es especially eh , overlapping speech from , eh , different eh , eh , speaker . Eh professor d: No , but there 's but , I think she 's saying \" Where do you In these three categories , where do you put the instances in which there is one person speaking and other sounds which are not speech ? \" phd c: Ah ! professor d: Which category do you put that in ? postdoc e: Yeah , that 's right . Yeah , he here I I put eh speech from eh , from , eh , one speaker without , eh , eh , any any any events more . postdoc e: Oh ! professor d: Right , so where do you put speech from one speaker that does have a nonspeech event at the same time ? phd c: Where ? Where What is the class ? professor d: Which catege which category ? postdoc e: Like a c phd c: No . phd c: For for the by the @ @ no , @ @ because I I I I want to limit the the nnn , the the study . grad b: Yeah , so that 's what he was saying before , is that he excluded those . phd c: \" Why ? Why ? What 's the reason ? \" because i it 's the first study . In the in the future , the the idea is to to extend the class , phd a: Is is phd c: to consider all the all the information , you you mentioned before professor d: Yeah . phd c: but eh , the the first idea Because eh , I don't know what hap what will happen with the study . i it 's pure phd a: What if there was a door - slam or something ? phd c: No , no , it 's pure silence . professor d: What you Well w I I think what you m I think what you mean is that it 's nonspeech segments that don't have impulsive noises . professor d: Right ? Cuz you 're calling what you 're calling \" event \" is somebody coughing or clicking , or rustling paper , or hitting something , which are impulsive noises . Right ? phd c: h here yet , yet I I I I I think I I think , eh , there are that some kind of noises that , eh , don't don't wanted to to be in that , eh , in that control set . phd c: But I prefer , I prefer at at the first , eh , the the silence with eh , this eh this kind of the of eh of noise . professor d: Right , it 's  , it 's \" Background \" might be might be a better word than \" silence \" . phd c: And , with this information The idea is eh , eh , nnn , I have a label for for each , eh , frame and , eh with a cluster eh algorithm I and postdoc e: Well , we needed to get the categories , yeah . And eh I am going to prepare a test bed , eh , well , eh , a a set of feature structure eh , eh , models . phd c: I have to to test , but eh I phd a: You have your own ? phd c: Yeah , yeah , yeah . Is a modified version of of of a pitch tracker , eh , from , eh , Standar - eh Stanford University in Stanford ? No . phd a: Oh ! What 's it written in ? phd c: Eh , em , I I I don't remember what is the the name of the of the author , because I I have several I have eh , eh , em , eh , library tools , from eh , Festival and of from Edinburgh eh , from Cambridge , eh , and from our department . phd c: And And I have to because , in general the pitch tracker , doesn't work very well and grad b: Bad . This this is And th the idea is to to , eh , to obtain , eh , for example , eh , eh diff eh , eh , different well , no , a great number of eh FEC for example , eh , eh , twenty - five , eh , thirty thirty parameters , eh , for for each one . And in a first eh , nnn , step in the investi in the research in eh , my idea is try to , eh , to prove , what is the performance of the difference parameter , eh to classify the different , eh , what is the the the the front - end approach to classify eh , the different , eh , frames of each class eh and what is the the , nnn , nnn , nnn , eh , what is the , the error eh , of the data grad b: Supervised clustering . phd c: and the second is try to eh , to use some ideas eh , similar to the linear discriminant analysis . phd c: Eh ? Eh , similar , because the the idea is to to study what is the contribution of eh , each parameter to the process of classify correctly the different the different parameters . What sort of classifier ar ? phd c: Eh , the the the classifier is nnn by the moment is eh is eh , similar , nnn , that the classifier used eh , in a quantifier vectorial quantifier is eh , used to to eh , some distance to to put eh , a vector eh , in in a class different . grad b: Unimodal ? phd c: Is Yeah ? W with a model , is is only to cluster using a eh , @ @ or a similarity . grad b: So is it just one cluster per phd c: A another possibility it to use eh a netw netw a neural network . phd c: But eh what 's the p What is my idea ? What 's the problem I I I I see in in in if you you use the the neural network ? If w when this kind of eh , mmm , cluster , clustering algorithm to can test , to can eh observe what happened you you can't you can't eh , eh put up with your hand in the different parameter , grad b: Right , you can't analyse it . phd c: but eh If you use a neural net is is a good idea , but eh you don't know what happened in the interior of the neural net . professor d: Well , actually , you can do sensitivity analyses which show you what the importance of the different parce pieces of the input are . professor d: It 's hard to w w what you It 's hard to tell on a neural net is what 's going on internally . professor d: But it 's actually not that hard to analyse it and figure out the effects of different inputs , especially if they 're all normalized . professor d: Well , this isn't tru if if if you really wonder what different if if phd c: Yeah . phd c: But professor d: Yeah , then a decision tree is really good , but the thing is here he 's he 's not he 's not like he has one you know , a bunch of very distinct variables , like pitch and this he 's talking about , like , a all these cepstral coefficients , and so forth , grad b: Right . professor d: in which case a a any reasonable classifier is gonna be a mess , and it 's gonna be hard to figure out what what  phd c: And grad b: Right . professor d: I  , I think the other thing that one  , this is , I think a good thing to do , to sort of look at these things at least See what I 'd I 'd Let me tell you what I would do . Instead of taking all the MFCC 's , or all the PLP 's or whatever , I would just take a couple . professor d: OK ? Like like C - one , C - two , something like that , so that you can visualize it . professor d: OK , so before you do build up any kind of fancy classifiers , just take a look in two dimensions , at how these things are split apart . professor d: That I think will give you a lot of insight of what is likely to be a useful feature when you put it into a more complicated classifier . professor d: And the second thing is , once you actually get to the point of building these classifiers , @ @ what this lacks so far is the temporal properties . So if you 're just looking at a frame and a time , you don't know anything about , you know , the structure of it over time , and so you may wanna build @ @ build a Markov model of some sort  , or or else have features that really are based on  on on some bigger chunk of time . But don't  anyway , this is my suggestion , is don't just , you know , throw in twenty features at it , the deltas , and the delta del and all that into some classifier , even even if it 's K - nearest - neighbors , you still won't know phd c: Yeah . professor d: what it 's doing , even You know it 's  , I think to know what it 's to have a better feeling for what it 's grad b: Yep . professor d: look at at som some picture that shows you , \" Here 's These things  ,  are offer some separation . \" And , in LPC , the thing to particularly look at is , I think is something like , the residual phd c: Yeah . S postdoc e: Can I ask ? It strikes me that there 's another piece of information  , that might be useful and that 's simply the transition . So , w if you go from a transition of silence to overlap versus a transition from silence to speech , there 's gonna be a b a big informative area there , it seems to me . phd c: I eh the the Meeting Recorder project , for me , has eh , two eh , w has eh several parts , several p objective professor d:   But eh , at the first , in the acoustic , eh , eh , parts of the project , eh I think you eh we have eh two main eh objective . And for that , if you don't use , eh , eh , a speech recognizer , eh broad class , or not broad class to to try to to to label the different frames , I think the Ike criterion or BIC criterion eh will be enough to detect the change . When you you have , eh , eh s eh the transition of speech or or silence eh to overlap zone , this criterion is enough with probably with , eh , this kind of , eh , eh the the the more eh use eh use eh used eh em normal , regular eh parameter MF - MFCC . But eh eh I I understand that you your objective is to eh classify , to know that eh that zone not is only a new zone in the in the file , that eh you have eh , but you have to to to know that this is overlap zone . because in the future you will eh try to to process that zone with a non - regular eh eh speech recognizer model , I suppose . phd c: you you will pretend to to to process the overlapping z eh zone with another kind of algorithm professor d:   phd c: because it 's very difficult to to to obtain the transcription from eh using eh eh a regular , normal speech recognizer . phd c: A model to detect more acc the mor most accurately possible that is p  , will be possible the , eh the mark , the change and another another model will @ @ or several models , to try s but eh several model eh robust models , sample models to try to classify the difference class . grad b: I 'm I 'm I 'm sorry , I didn't understand you what you said . What what model ? postdoc e:  phd c: Eh , the the classifiers of the of the n to detect the different class to the different zones before try to to recognize , eh with eh to transcribe , with eh a speech recognizer . phd c: And my idea is to use eh , for example , a neural net postdoc e: So p phd c: with the information we obtain from this eh this eh study of the parameter with the selected parameter to try to eh to put the class of each frame . phd c: you you eh , eh have obtained in the first eh , step with the for example , BIC eh , eh criterion compare model postdoc e:   phd c: And You I don't - u professor d: OK , but , I I think in any event we 're agreed that the first step is phd c: i postdoc e: Yeah . professor d: Because what we had before for for  , speaker change detection did not include these overlaps . professor d: So the first thing is for you to to build up something that will detect the overlaps . professor d: Right ? So again , I think the first thing to do to detect the overlaps is to look at these  , in in in in grad b: Features ? phd c: Yeah . professor d: Well , I again , the things you 've written up there I think are way too way too big . professor d: OK ? If you 're talking about , say , twelfth twelfth - order  MFCC 's or something like that it 's just way too much . All you 'll be able to do is put it into a classifier and see how well it does . professor d: Whereas I think if you have things if you pick one or two dimensional things , or three of you have some very fancy display , and look at how the the different classes separate themselves out , you 'll have much more insight about what 's going on . professor d: Well , you 'll you 'll get a feeling for what 's happening , you know , phd c: Yeah . professor d: so if you look at Suppose you look at first and second - order cepstral coefficients for some one of these kinds of things and you find that the first - order is much more effective than the second , and then you look at the third and there 's not and not too much there , you may just take first and second - order cepstral coefficients , phd c: Yeah . professor d: right ? And with LPC , I think LPC per se isn't gonna tell you much more than than than the other , maybe .  , and  on the other hand , the LPC residual , the energy in the LPC residual , will say how well ,  the low - order LPC model 's fitting it , which should be pretty poorly for two two or more people speaking at the same time , and it should be pretty well , for w for for one . professor d: And so I i again , if you take a few of these things that are are prob  promising features and look at them in pairs , I think you 'll have much more of a sense of \" OK , I now have  , doing a bunch of these analyses , I now have ten likely candidates . phd c: but eh , eh eh eh eh I don't know it is the first eh way to to do that and I would eh like to to know what eh , your opinion . Eh all this study in the f in the first moment , I I w I I will pretend to do with eh eh equalizes speech . grad b: With postdoc e: With what ? With what ? grad b: Right . phd c: Eh , why ? Because eh the spectral distortion is more eh a lot eh clearer , very much clearer if we compare with the PDA . phd c: fff ! Because the n the noise eh to sp the signal - to - noise relation is eh is is low . phd c: I don't know eh  i i that eh the the result of the of the study eh with eh with eh this eh this speech , the mix speech eh will work exactly with the eh PDA files . phd c: eh What , I  , what what is the effect of the low ' signal to to to noise relation , you know , eh with professor d: N u We Well , I think I think I think it 's not a it 's not at all unreasonable . It makes sense to start with the simpler signal because if you have features which don't aren't even helpful in the high signal - to - noise ratio , then there 's no point in putting them into the low signal ratio , one would think , anyway . professor d: And so , if you can get @ @  again , my prescription would be that you would , with a mixed signal , you would take a collection of possible  , features look at them , look at how these different classes that you 've marked , separate themselves , and then collect ,  in pairs , and then collect ten of them or something , and then proceed with a bigger classifier . professor d: And then if you can get that to work well , then you go to the other signal . And then , and you and you know , they won't work as well , but how m you know , how much grad b: Right . Because it I think it would be interesting to see if some features work well with close mixed , and And don't professor d:  . professor d: That 's well , the It it 's it 's true that it also , it could be useful to do this exploratory analysis where you 're looking at scatter plots and so on in both cases . phd c: I I I I think that the the eh parameter we found , eh , eh worked with both eh , speech file , postdoc e: That 's good . phd c: but eh what is the the the relation of eh of the performance when eh you use eh the , eh eh speech file the PDA speech files . Is eh is not easy eh to to solve , because if you I I I have seen the the the speech file from eh PDA , and s some parts is very difficult because you you don't see the spectrum the spectrogram . phd c: Is very difficult to apply eh , eh a parameter to detect change when you don't see . Well , that that that 's another reason why very simple features , things like energy , and things things like harmonicity , and residual energy are  , yeah are are better to use than very complex ones because they 'll be more reliable . phd a: Yeah , I maybe this is a dumb question , but w I thought it would be I thought it would be easier if you used a PDA professor d: Nah . phd a: because can't you , couldn't you like use beam - forming or something to detect speaker overlaps ?  grad b: Well , if you used the array , rather than the signal from just one . professor d: Yeah , no , you you 're you 're right grad b: But that 's professor d: that In fact , if we made use of the fact that there are two microphones , you do have some location information . which we don't have with the one and and so that 's phd a: Is that not allowed with this project ? professor d: well , no , we we don't have any rules , r really . professor d: I think I I think I think it 's it 's it 's a it 's an additional interesting question . professor d: I think you wanna know whether you can do it with one , because you know it 's not necessarily true that every device that you 're trying to do this with will have two . professor d: if , on the other hand , we show that there 's a huge advantage with two , well then that could be a real point . professor d: But , we don't n even know yet what the effect of detecting having the ability to detect overlaps is . postdoc e: There there is a complication though , and that is if a person turns their back to the to the PDA , then some of the positional information goes away ? phd c: Yeah . professor d: Well , it it it does , i it d it does , but the the the issue is that that phd a: No , it 's not it 's not that so much as postdoc e: And then , And if they 're on the access on the axis of it , that was the other thing I was thinking . postdoc e: He You mentioned this last time , that that if if you 're straight down the midline , then then the r the left - right 's gonna be different , grad b: Yeah , we hav need to put it on a little turntable , phd c: I I I I I th grad b: and phd a: Well , it 's phd c: Yeah . postdoc e: It seems to me that that it 's not a p  , you know , it 's this the topograph the topology of it is is a little bit complicated . phd a: I don't I don't know ho phd c: I I I think Sorry . I I I think because the the the distance between the two microph eh , microphone , eh , in the PDA is very near . But it 's  from my opinion , it 's an interesting idea to to try to study the binaural eh problem eh , with information , because I I found difference between the the speech from from each micro eh , in the PDA . It - it 's not amplitude , postdoc e: Oh yeah ! Oh I agree ! And we use it ourselves . postdoc e: But I 'm just I 'm just saying that the way we 're seated around a table , is not the same with respect to each to each person with respect to the PDA , phd c: No . postdoc e: so we 're gonna have a lot of differences with ref respect to the speaker . phd c: But professor d: That 's So so i @ @ I think the issue is , \" Is there a clean signal coming from only one direction ? \" phd a: Right . professor d: If it 's not coming from just one direction , if it if th if there 's a broader pattern , it means that it 's more likely there 's multiple people speaking , phd c: Yeah . phd a: So it 's sort of like how how confused is it about where the beam is . professor d: Yeah , is there a narrow Is there a narrow beam pattern or is it a a distributed beam pattern ? So if there 's a distributed beam pattern , then it looks more like it 's it 's  , multiple people . OK , it just it just seemed to me that  , that this isn't the ideal type of separation .  , I I think it 's I can see the value o professor d: Oh , ideal would be to have the wall filled with them , but  But the thing is just having two mikes If you looked at that thing on on Dan 's page , it was When when there were two people speaking , and it looked really really different . phd a: Did - Sorry , b  I 'm not sure what Dan 's page is that you mean . professor d: You take the signal from the two microphones and you cros and you cross - correlate them with different lags . So when one person is speaking , then wherever they happen to be at the point when they 're speaking , then there 's a pretty big maximum right around that point in the l in in the lag . professor d: So if at whatever angle you are , at some lag corresponding to the time difference between the two there , you get this boost in the in in the cross - correlation value function . phd a: So so if there 's two grad b: And if there are multiple people talking , you 'll see two peaks . postdoc e: Well , let me ask you , if if both people were over there , it would be less effective than if one was there and one was across , catty - corner ? phd c: Yeah . The - the Oh , I 'm sorry , postdoc e: No ? professor d: if they 're right next to one another ? phd a: If I was if I was here and Morgan was there and we were both talking , it wouldn't work . professor d: i i postdoc e: Next next one over n over on this side of the P PDA . postdoc e: Versus you versus you know , and we 're catty - corner across the table , and I 'm farther away from this one and you 're farther away from that one . grad b: Or or even if , like , if people were sitting right across from each other , you couldn't tell the difference either . Yeah , so it 's postdoc e: And so my point was just that it 's it 's gonna be differentially differentially varia valuable . postdoc e: it 's not to say  , I certainly think it 's extremely val And we we humans n n depend on you know , these these binaural cues . professor d: But it 's almost but it 's almost a I think what you 're talking about i there 's two things . professor d: There 's a sensitivity issue , and then there 's a pathological error  issue . professor d: If someone just happens to be sitting right there then we won't get good information from it . and i and if there So it And if it 's the two of you guys on the same side professor d: if they 're if they 're close , it 's just a question of the sensitivity . professor d: So if the sensitivity is good enough and we just we just don't have enough , experience with it to know how postdoc e: Yeah . postdoc e: Oh I 'm not I 'm not trying to argue against using it , by any means . I just wanted to point out that that weakness , that it 's topo topologically impossible to get it perfect for everybody . professor d: the other thing you can do  , if  , i We 're assuming that it would be a big deal just to get somebody convince somebody to put two microphones in the PDA . And then you know then you 're sort of Yeah , then then you pretty much could cover phd a: Once you got two postdoc e: Interesting . phd a: Well what about just doing it from these mikes ? postdoc e: Interesting . phd c: It will be more interesting to study the PZM because the the the separation I I think professor d:  @ @ But - but that 's  , we can we 'll be all of this is there for us to study . professor d: But but but the thing is , one of the at least one of the things I was hoping to get at with this is what can we do with what we think would be the normal situation if some people get together and one of them has a PDA . phd a: That 's what I was asking about , what are the constraints ? phd c: Yeah . professor d: Well , that 's that 's the constraint of one question that I think both Adam and I were were were interested in . professor d: but you know if you can instrument a room , this is really minor league compared with what some people are doing , right ? Some people at at  , yeah , at Brown and and and and at   and at Cape , grad b: Big micro @ @ arrays . phd a: Didn't they have something at Cape ? professor d: they both have these , you know , big arrays on the wall . And you know , if you could do that , you 've got microphones all over the place grad b: Very finely . professor d: you know p tens of microphones , and and  phd a: Oh ! I saw a demo . professor d: And if you do that then you can really get very nice  kind of selectivity phd a: Yeah . grad b: Oh , I saw one that was like a hundred microphones , a ten by ten array . phd a: And you could In a noisy room , they could have all kinds of noises and you can zoom right in on somebody . grad b: It was all in software and they and you could pick out an individual beam and listen to it . professor d: But , the reason why I haven't focused on that as the fir my first concern is because  , I 'm interested in what happens for people , random people out in some random place where they 're p having an impromptu discussion . And you can't just always go , \" well , let 's go to this heavily instrumented room that we spent tens of thousands of dollars to se to set up \" . phd a: No , what you need to do is you 'd have a little fabric thing that you unroll and hang on a wall . phd a: It has all these mikes and it has a plug - in jack to the PDA . grad b: But I think professor d: The other thing actually , that gets at this a little bit of something else I 'd like to do , is what happens if you have two P D grad b: Yep . professor d: and they communicate with each other ? And then You know , they 're in random positions , the likelihood that  , basically there wouldn't be any l likely to be any kind of nulls , if you even had two . grad b: Though All sorts of interesting things you can do with that , postdoc e: Interesting . grad b: not only can you do microphone arrays , but you can do all sorts of  multi - band as well . postdoc e: Ah ! phd a: I still like my rug on the wall idea , so if anybody patents that , then grad b: But I think postdoc e: Well , you could have strips that you stick to your clothing . phd a: Hats ? grad b: In terms of the research th research , it 's really it 's whatever the person who is doing the research wants to do .  , I i I i I would actually kind of like us to wind it down , see if we can still get to the end of the , birthdays thing there . professor d: So grad b: Well , I had a couple things that I did wanna bring out . grad b: One is , do we need to sign new these again ? postdoc e: Well , it 's slightly different . phd a: Are they new ? postdoc e: Cuz it it 's slightly different . professor d: Oh , this morning we didn't sign anything cuz we said that if anybody had signed it already , we didn't have to . grad b: Yeah , I I should 've checked with Jane first , but the ch the form has changed . grad b: I had some things I wanted to talk about with the thresholding stuff I 'm doing . postdoc e: I had to make one grad b: But , if we 're in a hurry , we can put that off . postdoc e: Well , should I  I have some results to present , but  I guess we won't have time to do that this time . But it seems like  the anonymization is  , is also something that we might wanna discuss in greater length .  , wha what postdoc e: If if we 're about to wind down , I think what I would prefer is that we  , delay the anonymization thing till next week , and I would like to present the results that I have on the overlaps . @ @ It sounds like u  , there were there were a couple technical things people would like to talk about . Why don't we just take a couple minutes to to briefly do them , and then and then and then and then and then we grad b: OK , go ahead , Jane . postdoc e: I 'd Oh , I 'd prefer to have more time for my results . postdoc e: And I think the anonymization , if y if you want to proceed with that now , I just think that that 's that 's a discussion which also n really deserves a lo a you know , more that just a minute . postdoc e: I really do think that , because you raised a couple of possibilities yourself , you and I have discussed it previously , and there are different ways that people approach it , e and I think we should grad b: Alright . We 're we 're just We 're getting enough data now that I 'd sort of like to do it now , before I get overwhelmed with once we decide how to do it postdoc e: Well , OK . I I 'll give you the short version , but I do think it 's an issue that we can't resolve in five minutes . postdoc e: OK , so the the short thing is  , we have  , tape recording  , sorry , digitized recor recordings . postdoc e: Now , in terms of like the transcript , the question becomes what symbol are you gonna put in there for everybody 's name , and whether you 're gonna put it in the text where he says \" Hey Roger \" or are we gonna put that person 's anonymized name in instead ? grad b: No , because then that would give you a mapping , and you don't wanna have a mapping . postdoc e: OK , so first decision is , we 're gonna anonymize the same name for the speaker identifier and also in the text whenever the speaker 's name is mentioned . Because that would give you a mapping between the speaker 's real name and the tag we 're using , and we don't want postdoc e: I I don't think you understood what I what I said . postdoc e: So  , so in within the context of an utterance , someone says \" So , Roger , what do you think ? \" OK . Then , it seems to me that Well , maybe I  it seems to me that if you change the name , the transcript 's gonna disagree with the audio , and you won't be able to use that . grad b: We don't we wanna we ha we want the transcript to be \" Roger \" . grad b: Because if we made the the transcript be the tag that we 're using for Roger , someone who had the transcript and the audio would then have a mapping between the anonymized name and the real name , and we wanna avoid that . postdoc e: OK , well , but then there 's this issue of if we 're gonna use this for a discourse type of thing , then and , you know , Liz was mentioning stuff in a previous meeting about gaze direction and who 's who 's the addressee and all , then to have \" Roger \" be the thing in the utterance and then actually have the speaker identifier who was \" Roger \" be \" Frank \" , that 's going to be really confusing and make it pretty much useless for discourse analysis . postdoc e: Now , if you want to , you know , in some cases , I I I know that Susan Ervin - Tripp in some of hers , actually did do  , a filter of the s signal where the person 's name was mentioned , except professor d: Yeah Yeah , once you get to the publication you can certainly do that . postdoc e: And and I cer and I So , the question then becomes one level back .  , how important is it for a person to be identified by first name versus full name ? Well , on the one hand , it 's not a full identity , we 're taking all these precautions ,  and they 'll be taking precautions , which are probably even the more important ones , to they 'll be reviewing the transcripts , to see if there 's something they don't like OK . On the other hand , this is a small this is a small pool , and people who say things about topic X e who are researchers and well - known in the field , they 'll be identifiable and simply from the from the first name . However , taking one step further back , they 'd be identifiable anyway , even if we changed all the names . postdoc e: So , is it really ,  You know ? grad b: Ugh ! postdoc e: Now , in terms of like so I I did some results , which I 'll report on n next time , which do mention individual speakers by name . Now , it would be very possible for me to take those data put them in a in a study , and just change everybody 's name for the purpose of the publication . And someone who looked professor d: You can go , you know , \" Z \"  , for instance .  , yeah , t it doesn't  , I 'm not knowledgeable about this , but it certainly doesn't bother me to have someone 's first name in in the in the transcript . postdoc e: Yeah , and and in the form that they sign , it does say \" your first name may arise in the course of the meetings \" . So again , th the issue is if you 're tracking discourse things , you know , if someone says , \" Frank said this \" and then you wanna connect it to something later , you 've gotta have this part where that 's \" Frank colon \" . grad b: Yeah , shoot ! professor d: Right ? postdoc e: Yeah , and and you know , even more i i  , immediate than that just being able to ,  Well , it just seems like to track track from one utterance to the next utterance who 's speaking and who 's speaking to whom , cuz that can be important . postdoc e: S i You know , \" You raised the point , So - and - so \" , it 's be kind of nice to be able to know who \" you \" was . postdoc e: And ac and actually you remember furthermore , you remember last time we had this discussion of how you know , I was sort of avoiding mentioning people 's names , professor d: Yeah , I was too . Well , if we 're going to step in after the fact and change people 's names in the transcript , we 've basically done something one step worse . Well , I would sug I I don't wanna change the names in the transcript , phd c: Yeah . grad b: but that 's because I 'm focused so much on the acoustics instead of on the discourse , and so I think that 's a really good point . L let me just back up this to make a a brief comment about the , what we 're covering in the meeting .  I realize when you 're doing this that   , I didn't realize that you had a bunch of things that you wanted to talk about . So I think what would be helpful would be  , i and I 'll I 'll mention this to to Liz and Andreas too , that  , before the meeting if anybody could send me , any any , agenda items that they were interested in and I 'll I 'll take the role of organizing them  , into into the agenda , postdoc e: OK . I 've no desire to to make it up , but if if no one 's told me things , then I 'm just proceeding from my my guesses , and and  , and i ye yeah , I I 'm sorry it ended up with your out your time to  , I 'm just always asking Jose what he 's doing , you know , and and so it 's There 's  , there 's obviously other things going on . grad b: How will we how would the person who 's doing the transcript even know who they 're talking about ? Do you know what I 'm saying ? phd a: \" The person who 's doing the transcript \" The IBM people ? grad b: Yeah .  , so so how is that information gonna get labeled anyway ? postdoc e: How do you mean , who what they 're who they 're talking about ? grad b: so if I 'm saying in a meeting , \" oh and Bob , by the way , wanted wanted to do so - and - so \" , postdoc e: How do you mean ? phd a: They 're just gonna write \" Bob \" on it or do @ @ grad b: if you 're doing Yeah , @ @ they 're just gonna write \" Bob \" . If you 're if you 're doing discourse analysis , postdoc e: They won't be able to change it themselves . professor d: What ar how are they gonna do any of this ? grad b: Yeah , really . postdoc e: Well , I I 'm betting we 're gonna have huge chunks that are just totally un untranscribable by them . professor d: they 're gonna say speaker - one , or speaker - two or speaker  I I phd a: They can't do that . phd c: Yeah , I think grad b: Well , the current one they don't do speaker identity . phd c:  grad b: because in NaturallySpeaking , or , excuse me , in ViaVoice , it 's only one person . I think that My understanding from Yen Is it Yen - Ching ? Is that how you pronounce her name ? professor d:  Yu - Ching , Yu - Ching . postdoc e: Oh ,  Yu - Ching ? Yu - Ching ? grad b: y Yu - Ching . postdoc e: was that  , they will that they will adopt the part of the conventions that that we discussed , where they put speaker identifier down . But , you know , h they won't know these people , so I think it 's Well , they 'll they 'll adopt some convention but we haven't specified to them So they 'll do something like speaker - one , speaker - two , is what I bet , but I 'm betting there 'll be huge variations in the accuracy of of their labeling the speakers . professor d: And it and it may very well be  , since they 're not going to sit there and and and worry ab about , it being the same speaker , they may very well go the eh the the first se the first time it changes to another speaker , that 'll be speaker - two . professor d: And the next time it 'll be speaker - three even if it 's actually speaker - one . grad b: Yeah we we can probably regenerate it pretty easily from the close - talking mikes . phd c:  postdoc e: Yes , I was thinking , the temp the time values of when it changes . grad b: The p It 's a good point , \" which what do you do for discourse tracking ? \" phd c: Because y y you don't know to know , eh you don't need to know what i what is the iden identification of the of the speakers . If if if if someone says , \" what what is Jose doing ? \" and then Jose says something , you need to know that that was Jose responding . postdoc e: Unless we adopt a different set of norms which is to not id to make a point of not identifying people by name , which then leads you to be more contextually ex explicit . You know ?  , so when we did this las last week , I felt that you know , now , Andreas may , @ @  , he he i sometimes people think of something else at the same time and they miss a sentence or something , and and because he missed something , then he missed the r the initial introduction of who we were talking about , and was was unable to do the tracking . postdoc e: But I felt like most of us were doing the tracking and knew who we were talking about and we just weren't mentioning the name . phd a: But , you know , like , at the beginning of this meeting Or , you I think said , you know , or s Liz , said something about  , \" is Mari gonna use the equipment ? \"  , how would you say that ? postdoc e: Yeah ? phd a: you have to really think , you know , about what you 're saying bef grad b: if you wanted to anonymize . Yeah , is professor d: \" Is you know who up in you know where ? \" phd a: Yeah . professor d: Right ? Use the phd a: I think it would be really hard if we made a policy where we didn't say names , plus we 'd have to tell everybody else . grad b: Yeah , darn !  , what I was gonna say is that the other option is that we could bleep out the names . phd a: I I think the I think I don't know , my own two cents worth is that you don't do anything about what 's in the recordings , you only anonymize to the extent you can , the speakers have signed the forms and all . grad b: Well , but that but that as I said , that that that works great for the acoustics , but it it hurts you a lot for trying to do discourse . grad b: Because you don't have a map of who 's talking versus their name that they 're being referred to . phd a: I thought we were gonna get it labelled speaker - one , speaker - two grad b: Sure but , h then you have to know that Jose is speaker - one and phd a: Why do you have to know his name ? professor d: OK , so suppose someone says , \" well I don't know if I really heard what  , what Jose said . professor d: So  u phd a: Oh , I see , you wanna associated the word \" Jose \" in the dialogue with the fact that then he responded . professor d: And so , if we pass out the data to someone else , and it says \" speaker - five \" there , we also have to pass them this little guide that says that speaker - five is Jose , grad b: And that violates our privacy . professor d: and if were gonna do that we might as well give them \" Jose \" say it was \" Jose \" . postdoc e: Now , I I think that we have these two phases in the in the data , which is the one which is o our use , University of Washington 's use , IBM , SRI . postdoc e: And within that , it may be that it 's sufficient to not  change the to not incorporate anonymization yet , but always , always in the publications we have to . postdoc e: And I think also , when we take it that next step and distribute it to the world , we have to . But I but I don that 's that 's a long way from now and and it 's a matter of between now and then of d of deciding how grad b: Making some decisions ? postdoc e: i i it You know , it may be s that we we 'll need to do something like actually X out that part of the  the audio , and just put in brackets \" speaker - one \" . phd c: the ? ? grad b: You know , what we could do also is have more than one version of release . professor d: I I think that we we have a need to have a consistent licensing policy of some sort , and postdoc e: But I also think a consistent licensing policy is important . phd a: Well , one thing to to take into consideration is w are there any  For example , the people who are funding this work , they want this work to get out and be useful for discourse . phd a: If we all of a sudden do this and then release it to the public and it 's not longer useful for discourse , you know grad b: Well , depending on how much editing we do , you might be able to still have it useful . grad b: But , n excuse me , but you could bleep out just the names . professor d: She No , but she 's saying , from the argument before , she wants to be able to say if someone said \" Jose \" in their in their thing , and then connect to so to what he said later , then you need it . But in the transcript , you could say , everywhere they said \" Jose \" that you could replace it with \" speaker - seven \" . But I I also wanna say that people grad b: And then it wouldn't meet match the audio anymore . professor d: And th and the other thing is if if if Liz were here , what she might say is that she wants to look if things that cut across between the audio and the dialogue , postdoc e: Well , you see ? So , it 's complicated . postdoc e: But it 's g but I think it was good to introduce the thing and we can do it next time . grad b: I didn't think when I wrote you that email I wasn't thinking it was a big can of worms , but I guess it is . postdoc e: Well it Discourse , you know Also I wanted to make the point that that discourse is gonna be more than just looking at a transcript . postdoc e: It 's gonna be looking at a t You know , and prosod prosodic stuff is involved , and that means you 're going to be listening to the audio , and then you come directly into this confronting this problem . phd a: Maybe we should just not allow anybody to do research on discourse , postdoc e: So . professor d: maybe we should only have meetings between people who don't know one another and who are also amnesiacs who don't know their own name . grad b: Did you read the paper on Eurospeech ? postdoc e: We could have little labels . I I I wanna introduce my Reservoir Dogs solution again , which is everyone has like \" Mister White \" , \" Mister Pink \" , \" Mister Blue \" . Did you read the paper a few years ago where they were reversing the syllables ? They were di they they had the utterances . phd a: But so , the syllables were in the same order , with respect to each other , but the acous grad b: Everything was in the same order , but they were the individual syll syllables were played backwards . phd a: What did it sound like ? grad b: People had no difficulty in interpreting it . So what we need is something that 's the reverse , that a speech recognizer works exactly the same on it but people can't understand it . professor d: What , what does the speech recognizer care ? grad b: Ah , anyway . professor d: postdoc e: Oh , do we do digits ? Or ? What do we do ? grad b:  OK , we 'll quickly do digits . like as if you were talking like , \" nine eight six eight seven ? \" postdoc e: Well , you know , in the in the one I transcribed , I did find a couple instances I found one instance of contrastive stress , where it was like the string had a li So it was like \" nine eight two four , nine nine two four \" . So they were like looking ahead , postdoc e: And phd a: huh ? postdoc e: Well , they differed .  , I 've I am sort of interested in in And sometimes , you know , I s And I I never know . phd a: Well , I was thinking that it must get kind of boring for the people who are gonna have to transcribe this postdoc e: and I phd a: They may as well throw in some interesting intonations <doc-sep>grad e: I think it 's actually phd d: What is what is that ? grad e: it depends on if the temp files are there or not , that at least that 's my current working hypothesis , phd d: Ah . grad e: that I think what happens is it tries to clear the temp files and if they 're too big , it crashes . phd b: When the power went out the other day and I restarted it , it crashed the first time . grad e: no , it doesn't it doesn't clear those necessarily , phd d: Oh wait It it doesn't clear them , OK . grad e: It 's i they 're called temp files , but they 're not actually in the temp directory they 're in the scratch , so . phd d: But that 's usually the meeting that I recorded , and it neve it doesn't crash on me . phd b: Well this wasn't Actually , this wasn't a before your meeting , this was , Tuesday afternoon when , Robert just wanted to do a little recording , grad e: Oh well . professor c: I don't know when would be a good excuse for it , but I just can't wait to be giving a talk t and and and use the example from last week with everybody t doing the digits at once . You know ? You wanted to pe keep people from listening in , you could like have that playing outside the room . Everybody give the reports about what they were doing at exactly the same time , phd d: And we 'll just all leave , phd b: And then we 'll we 'll go back later and review the individual channels , professor c: yeah . phd b: If you wanna know what professor c: Actually isn't that what we have been doing ? phd d: Yeah . professor c: What are we doing ? grad e: I Since I 've been gone all week , I didn't send out a reminder for an agenda , so . professor c: Yeah , and I 'm just grad e: Do we have anything to talk about or should we just read digits and go ? phd b: I wouldn't mind hearing how the conference was . professor c: What conference ? phd d: I had one question about grad e: Yeah , really . The next , phd d: Next weekend ? grad e: Next weekend , week from phd f: right ? professor c: That is right . phd d: Sorry , not not not the days coming up , but phd f: It 's like the grad e: A week from Saturday . phd d: So , are we do we have like an agenda or anything that we should be professor c: No , but that would be a good idea . professor c: Why don't we w phd f: So so the deal is that I can , I can be available after , like ten thirty or something . I don't know how s how early you wanted to professor c: They 're not even gonna be here until eleven or so . grad e: Eurospeech is due on Friday and then I 'm going down to San  , San Jose Friday night , so , if you know , if we start nice and late Saturday that 's a good thing . grad e: They 're flying from somewhere to somewhere , professor c: Yeah , and they 'll end up here . professor c: So , i I I will be  , he 's taking a very early flight phd f: Oh . professor c: and we do have the time work difference running the right way , but I still think that there 's no way we could start before eleven . grad e: But , yeah maybe an agenda , or at least some things to talk about would be a good idea . professor c: Well we can start gathering those those ideas , but then we we should firm it up by next next Thursday 's meeting . postdoc a: Will we have time to , to prepare something that we in the format we were planning for the IBM transcribers by then , or ? grad e: Oh yeah . grad e: So have you heard back from Brian about that , Chuck ? phd b: Yes , he 's I I 'm sorry , I should have forwarded that along .  , oh I I think I mentioned at the last meeting , he said that , he talked to them and it was fine with the beeps they would be That 's easy for them to do . So , oh , though Thi - Thilo isn't here , but , I I have the program to insert the beeps . What I don't have is something to parse the output of the channelized transcripts to find out where to put the beeps , but that should be really easy to do . So do we have a meeting that that 's been done with , postdoc a: He 's he 's grad e: that we 've tightened it up to the point where we can actually give it to IBM and have them try it out ? postdoc a: He generated , a channel - wise presegmented version of a meeting , but it was Robustness rather than EDU so I guess depends on whether we 're willing to use Robustness ? phd b: Well for this experiment I think we can use pre pretty much anything . phd b: This experiment of just grad e: Well we had we had talked about doing maybe EDU as a good choice , though . phd b: Well we 've talked about that as being the next ones we wanted to transcribe . phd b: But for the purpose of sending him a sample one to f grad e: Yeah , maybe it doesn't matter . phd b: I I don't think it matte postdoc a: I 'll I 'll I 'll , get make that available . grad e: OK , and has it been corrected ? postdoc a: Oh , well , wait .  grad e: Hand - checked ? Cuz that was one of the processes we were talking about as well . phd b: Right , so we need to run Thilo 's thing on it , postdoc a: That 's right . postdoc a: I think they 're coming phd b: And we probably don't have to do necessarily a whole meeting for that if we just wanna send them a sample to try . What would be a good number of minutes ? phd b: I don't know , maybe we can figure out how long it 'll take @ @ to to do . grad e: I don't know , it seems to me w we probably should go ahead and do a whole meeting because we 'll have to transcribe the whole meeting anyway sometime . professor c: Yes except that if they had if there was a choice between having fifteen minutes that was fully the way you wanted it , and having a whole meeting that didn't get at what you wanted for them It 's just dependent of how much grad e: Like I  I guess if we have to do it again anyway , but ,  professor c: Yeah . phd b: I guess , the only thing I 'm not sure about is , how quickly can the transcribers scan over and fix the boundaries , postdoc a:   phd b: and  , is it pretty easy ? grad e: I think it 's gonna be one or two times real time at Wow , excuse me , two or more times real time , right ? Cuz they have to at least listen to it . professor c: Can we pipeline it so that say there 's , the transcriber gets done with a quarter of the meeting and then we you run it through this other other stuff ?  , grad e: Well the other stuff is I B I 'm just thinking that from a data keeping - track - of - the - data point of view , it may be best to send them whole meetings at a time and not try to send them bits and pieces . So the first thing is the automatic thing , and then it 's then it 's then it 's the transcribers tightening stuff up , grad e: Right . professor c: OK , so you might as well ha run the automatic thing over the entire meeting , and then and then , you would give IBM whatever was fixed . postdoc a: And have them fix it over the entire meeting too ? grad e: Right . professor c: Well , yeah , but start from the beginning and go to the end , right ? So if they were only half way through then that 's what you 'd give IBM . The I guess the question on my mind is do we wait for the transcribers to adjust the marks for the whole meeting before we give anything to IBM , or do we go ahead and send them a sample ? Let their professor c: Why wouldn't we s @ @ w i if they were going sequentially through it , why wouldn't we give them  i are we trying to get something done by the time Brian comes ? phd b: Well I I  , I don't know . professor c: So if we if we were , then it seems like giving them something , whatever they had gotten up to , would be better than nothing . grad e: Well , I don't think  , h they they typically work for what , four hours , something like that ? postdoc a: I gue  . grad e: I think the they should be able to get through a whole meeting in one sitting . I would think , unless it 's a lot harder than we think it is , which it could be , certainly . postdoc a: If it 's got like for speakers then I guess  if phd b: We 're just doing the individual channels , grad e: Or seven or eight . phd b: So it 's gonna be , depending on the number of people in the meeting , postdoc a: I guess there is this issue of , you know , if if the segmenter thought there was no speech on on a particular stretch , on a particular channel , grad e: Well postdoc a: and there really was , then , if it didn't show up in a mixed signal to verify , then it might be overlooked , so , the question is \" should should a transcriber listen to the entire thing or can it g can it be based on the mixed signal ? \" And I th eh so far as I 'm concerned it 's fine to base it on the mixed signal at this point , and grad e: That 's what it seems to me too , in that if they need to , just like in the other cases , they can listen to the individual , if they need to . postdoc a: What what aspect ? professor c: So you 're talking about tightening up time boundaries ? phd b: Yeah . professor c: So how do you grad e: So , they have the normal channeltrans interface where they have each individual speaker has their own line , phd b: Yeah . grad e: but you 're listening to the mixed signal and you 're tightening the boundaries , correcting the boundaries . grad e: Right , so so you 'll have to I phd d: It will miss them . It will it will miss grad e:  - huh ! phd d: Yeah , you have to say \"  - huh \" more slowly to to get c grad e: Sorry . phd d: So it will miss stuff like that which phd b: I grad e: Well , so so that 's something that the transcribers will have to have to do . postdoc a: Yeah , but presumably , most of those they should be able to hear from the mixed signal unless they 're embedded in the heavil heavy overlap section when in which case they 'd be listening to the channels anyway . phd b: That 's that 's what I 'm I 'm concerned about the part . phd b: Can't we  couldn't we just have , I don't know , maybe this just doesn't fit with the software , but I guess if I didn't know anything about Transcriber and I was gonna make something to let them adjust boundaries , I would just show them one channel at a time , with the marks , and let them adju postdoc a: Oh they can grad e: Well , but then they have to do but then they for this meeting they would have to do seven times real time , and it would probably be more than that . grad e: Right ? Because they 'd have to at least listen to each channel all the way through . postdoc a: And if phd b: But i but it 's very quick , postdoc a:  - huh . postdoc a: w Well , the other problem is the breaths grad e: I just don't think postdoc a: cuz you also see the breaths on the waveform . I 've I 've looked at the int  , s I 've tried to do that with a single channel , and and you do see all sorts of other stuff besides just the voice . grad e: Yeah , and I I think that they 're going much more on acoustics than they are on visuals . postdoc a: What you the digital what the digital task that you had your interface ?  , I know for a fact that one of those sh she could really well she could judge what th what the number was based on the on the waveform . Yeah , I found the same thing that when I was scanning through the wave form I could see when someone started to read digits just by the shapes . professor c: So I don't I 'm I 'm now entirely confused about what they do . grad e: But professor c: So , they 're they 're looking at a mixed signal , or they 're looking what what are they looking at visually ? postdoc a: Well , they have a choice . But I 've I 've tried looking at the single signal and and in order to judge when it when it was speech and when it wasn't , grad e: Oh . postdoc a: but the problem is then you have breaths which which show up on the signal . professor c: But the procedure that you 're imagining , people vary from this , is that they have the mixed signal wave form in front of them , postdoc a: Yes . professor c: and they have multiple , well , let 's see , there isn't we don't have transcription yet . So but there 's markers of some sort that have been happening automatically , postdoc a: Yes . professor c: and those show up on the mixed signal ? postdoc a: Oh , professor c: There 's a @ @ clicks ? grad e: N the t postdoc a: they show up on the separate ribbons . postdoc a: and and i i it 'll be because it 's being segmented as channel at a time with his with Thilo 's new procedure , then you don't have the correspondence of the times across the bins  across the ribbons  you could have professor c: And is there a line moving across the waveform as it goes ? grad e: Yes . professor c: OK , so The way you 're imaging is they kind of play it , and they see oh this happened , then this happened , then and if it 's about right , they just sort of let it slide , postdoc a: Yeah . professor c: and if it if it there 's a question on something , they stop and maybe look at the individual wave form . professor c: They they might look at it , right ? grad e: Well , the problem is that the the interface doesn't really allow you to switch visuals . grad e: The problem is that that the Tcl - TK interface with the visuals , it 's very slow to load waveforms . grad e: And so when I tried that that was the first thing I tried when I first started it , postdoc a: Oh , oh . You can you can switch quickly between the audio , grad e: right ? postdoc a: but you just can't get the visual display to show quickly . So you have to It takes , I don't know , three , four minutes to Well , it takes it takes long enough phd d: Yeah , it 's very slow to do that . postdoc a: It takes long enough cuz it has to reload the I I don't know exactly what it 's doing frankly cuz but it t it takes long enough that it 's just not a practical alternative . phd d: That w grad e: Well it it does some sort of shape pre - computation so that it can then scroll it quickly , grad g: But you can cancel that . grad g: Oh , really ? postdoc a: Now you could set up multiple windows , each one with a different signal showing , and then look between the windows . grad e: we we could do different interfaces , grad g: What if you preload them all ? grad e: right ?  , so so we could use like X Waves instead of Transcriber , postdoc a: Yeah . grad g: What if you were to preload all the channels or or initially grad e: Well that 's what I tried originally . grad g: like doesn't grad e: So I I actually before , Dave Gelbart did this , I did an interface which showed each waveform and ea a ribbon for each waveform , grad g:   grad e: but the problem with it is even with just three waveforms it was just painfully slow to scroll . So you just scroll a screen and it would , you know go \" kur - chunk ! \" grad g: Oh , OK . postdoc a: You know , I am thinking if we have a meeting with only four speakers and , you know , you could fire up a Transcriber interface for , y you know , in different windows , multiple ones , one for each channel . And it 's sort of a a hack but  it would be one way of seeing the visual form . grad e: I think that if we decide that we need that they need to see the visuals , we need to change the interface so that they can do that . professor c: So phd d: That 's actually what I thought of , loading the chopped up waveforms , you know , that that would make it faster grad e: An But isn't grad g:  . phd b: The problem is if if anything 's cut off , you can't expand it from the chopped up phd d: So . phd d: Right , but if you a at some point grad e: And wouldn't that be the same as the mixed signal ? phd d: No ,  the individual channels that were chopped up that it 'd be nice to be able to go back and forth between those short segments . phd d: Cuz you don't really nee like nine tenths of the time you 're throwing most of them out , but what you need are tho that particular channel , or that particular location , grad e: Yeah . phd d: might be nice , cuz we save those out already , to be able to do that . But it won't work for IBM of course , it only works here cuz they 're not saving out the individual channels . postdoc a: Well , I I do think that this this will be a doable procedure , professor c: Yeah . postdoc a: and , then when they get into overlaps , just have them systematically check all the channels to be sure that there isn't something hidden from from audio view . Yeah , hopefully ,  The mixed signal , the overlaps are pretty audible because it is volume equalized . The only problem is is , you know , counting how many and if they 're really correct or not . phd d: I don't know that you can locate them very well from the mixed signal , grad e: Right but but once once you know that they happen , you can at least listen to the close talking , phd d: but you would know that they were there , and then you would switch . professor c: But right now , to do this limitation , the switching is going to be switching of the audio ? Is what she 's saying . professor c: So grad e: Right , so so professor c: so they 're using their ears to do these markings anyway . grad e: did Dave Did Dave do that change where you can actually just click rather than having to go up to the menu to listen to the individual channels ? postdoc a: Yes . postdoc a: I 'm not sure what click what click on the ribbon ? Yeah , you can get that grad e: Yeah . postdoc a: oh , oh , get you can get the ,  you can get it to switch audio ?  , not last I tried , grad e: Yeah . grad e: We should get him to do that because , I think that would be much , much faster than going to the menu . There 's a reason I disagree , and that is that , you it 's very good to have a dissociation between the visual and the audio . There 're times when I wanna hear the mixed signal , bu but I want to transcribe on the single channel . postdoc a: Maybe , I just don't I don't see that it 's a grad e: Just something so that it 's not in the menu option so that you can do it much faster . postdoc a: Well , that 's the i I I think that might be a personal style thing . grad e: Well it just seems to me that if you wanna quickly \" well was that Jane , no , was that Chuck , no , was that Morgan \" , right now , you have to go up to the menu , and each time , go up to the menu , select it , listen to that channel then click below , and then go back to the menu , select the next one , and then click below . postdoc a: Yeah , it could be faster , but , you know , th in the ideal world Yeah . grad e: What ? postdoc a: No I I agree that 'd be nice . professor c: So , Done with that ?  Does any I forget , does anybody , working on any any Eurospeech submission related to this ? grad e: I would like to try to do something on digits but I just don't know if we have time . Yeah there was that we that 's right , we had that one conversation about , what what what did it mean for , one of those speakers to be pathological , was it a grad e: Right , and I haven't had s chance to sit down and listen . phd f: Oh , I haven't I haven't listened to them either , grad e: I was going to do that this afternoon . phd f: but there must be something wrong , grad e: Well , Morgan and I were were having a debate about that . phd f: unless our grad e: Whereas I think it it 's probably something pathologic and actually Stephane 's results , I think confirm that . He s he did the Aurora system also got very lousy average error , like fifteen or or , fifteen to twenty percent average ? But then he ran it just on the lapel , and got about five or six percent word error ? So that that means to me that somewhere in the other recordings there are some pathological cases . So I 'll I 'll listen to it and find out since you 'd actually split it up by segment . phd b: Did you run the Andreas the r SRI recognizer on the digits ? grad e: Oh , I thought he had sent that around to everyone , phd f: Yeah . grad e: did you just sent that to me ? phd f: No , I d I didn't . phd b: I it wasn't phd f: But , yeah , if you take grad e: It was bimodal . phd f: So if you Yeah , it 's actually , it  it was trimodal , actually grad e: Oh , was it trimodal , OK . phd f: trimodal , so professor c: There 's zero , a little bit , and a lot . phd f: there were t there was there was one h one bump at ze around zero , which were the native speakers , professor c: Yeah . phd b: This is error you 're talking about ? professor c: Oh was it fifteen ? phd f: whe phd b: OK . And then there was another distinct bump at , like , a hundred , which must have been some problem . phd f: I can't imagine that grad g: What is patho what do you mean by pathological ? grad e: Just just something really wrong with grad g: I 'm sorry , I don't grad e: A bug is what  , phd f: In the recording grad g: Oh . phd f: And there was this one meeting , I forget which one it was , where like , six out of the eight channels were all , like had a hundred percent error . grad e: Which probably means like there was a th the recording interface crashed , grad g: Right . grad e: or there was a short you know , someone was jiggling with a cord phd f: But grad e: or , I extracted it incorrectly , phd f: But grad e: it was labeled grad g:   grad e: it was transcribed incorrectly , something really bad happened , and I just haven't listened to it yet to find out what it was . phd f: So , if I excluded the pathological ones , by definition , those that had like over ninety - five percent error rate , and the non - natives , then the average error rate was like one point four or something , professor c: What we 're calling . phd f: which which seemed reasonable given that , you know , the models weren't tuned for for it . phd b: And it didn't matter whether it was the lapel or whether it was the phd f: It was just a @ @ . I haven't split it up that way , phd d: But there 's no overlap during the digit readings , so it shouldn't really matter . professor c: No , but there 's a little difference , phd f: So it should grad e: There 's a lot . professor c: And so , cuz because what he was what I was saying when I looked at those things is it it I was almost gonna call it quadrimodal because because there was a whole lot of cases where it was zero percent . But if you p if you actually histogrammed it , and it was a nice  , you know , it it was zero was the most of them , professor c: Yeah . phd f: And then there was the bump for the non - natives and then the pathological ones , professor c: I see . postdoc a: You did you have , something in the report about , about , for f  , forced alignment ? professor c: Yeah . postdoc a: Have you have you started on that ? phd f: Oh , well , yeah , so I 've been struggling with the forced alignments . So the scheme that I drew on the board last time where we tried to ,  allow reject models for the s speech from other speakers , most of the time it doesn't work very well . So , and the I haven't done  , the only way to check this right now was for me to actually load these into X Waves and , you know , plus the alignments , and s play them and see where the professor c:  . phd f: And it looks And so I looked at all of the utterances from you , Chuck , in that one conversation , I don't know which You probably know which one  , it 's where you were on the lapel and Morgan was sitting next to you and we can hear everything Morgan says . phd f: But and and some of what you  , you also appear quite a bit in that cross - talk . So , I actually went through all of those , there were I think fifty - five segments , in in X Waves , and and sort of did a crude check , and more often than not , it it gets it wrong . So there 's either the beginning , mostly the beginning word , where th you , you know , Chuck talks somewhere into the segment , but the first , word of what he says , often \" I \" but it 's very reduced \" I , \" that 's just aligned to the beginning of someone else 's speech ,  in that segment , which is cross - talk . So , I 'm still tinkering with it , but it might well be that we can't get clean alignments out of this out of those , channels , so . phd d: Right , but that 's  , that was our plan , phd f: Yeah , right . phd d: but it 's clear from Dan that this is not something you can do in a short amount of time . phd d: So so we you know , we had spent a lot of time , writing up the HLT paper and we wanted to use that , kind of analysis , professor c: Yeah . phd d: but the HLT paper has , you know , it 's a very crude measure of overlap . It 's not really something you could scientifically say is overlap , it 's just whether or not the , the segments that were all synchronized , whether there was some overlap somewhere . phd d: And , you know , that pointed out some differences , so he thought well if we can do something quick and dirty because Dan said the cross - cancellation , it 's not straight - forward . If it were straight - forward then we would try it , but so , it 's sort of good to hear that it was not straight - forward , thinking if we can get decent forced alignments , then at least we can do sort of a overall report of what happens with actual overlap in time , but ,  phd b: I didn't think that his message said it wasn't straight - forward . grad e: Well if we 'd just professor c: Well phd b: I thought he 's just saying you have to look over a longer time window when you do it . phd d: and the but there are some issues of this timing , in the recordings professor c: Yeah . phd d: and phd b: So you just have to look over longer time when you 're trying to align the things , you can't you can't just look grad e: Well . are you talking about the fact that the recording software doesn't do time - synchronous ? Is that what you 're referring to ? professor c:  grad e: That seems to me you can do that over the entire file and get a very accurate phd f: I don't thi I d I don't think that was the issue . phd f: The issue was that you have to you have have you first have to have a pretty good speech detection on the individual channels . phd d: And it 's dynamic , so I guess it was more dynamic than some simple models would be able t to so so there are some things available , and I don't know too much about this area where if people aren't moving around much than you could apply them , and it should work pretty well if you took care of this recording time difference . phd d: but then if you add the dynamic aspect of adapting distances , then it wasn't I guess it just wasn't something that he could do quickly and not in time for us to be able to do something by two weeks from now , so . So  , so I don't know what we can do if anything , that 's sort of worth , you know , a Eurospeech paper at this point . phd b: Well , Andreas , how well did it work on the non - lapel stuff ? grad e: Yeah . phd f: we would really need , ideally , a transcriber to time mark the you know , the be at least the beginning and s ends of contiguous speech .  , and , you know , then with the time marks , you can do an automatic comparison of your of your forced alignments . phd b: Because really the the at least in terms of how we were gonna use this in our system was to get an ideal an idea , for each channel about the start and end boundaries . phd b: We don't really care about like intermediate word boundaries , so phd f: No , that 's how I 've been looking at it . phd f: I don't care that the individual words are aligned correctly , phd b: Yeah . phd f: but you don't wanna , infer from the alignment that someone spoke who didn't . So that 's why I was wondering if it phd f: so , so phd b: maybe if it doesn't work for lapel stuff , we can just not use that phd f: Yeah . phd b: and phd f: I haven't I ha just haven't had the time to , do the same procedure on one of the so I would need a k I would need a channel that has a speaker whose who has a lot of overlap but s you know , is a non - lapel mike . grad e:  ! phd f: So , I grad e: So a meeting with me in it . phd f: maybe someone can help me find a good candidate and then I would be willing to phd b: We c you know what ? Maybe the best way to find that would be to look through these . phd f: you know , hand phd b: Cuz you can see the seat numbers , and then you can see what type of mike they were using . And so we just look for , you know , somebody sitting next to Adam at one of the meetings phd d: Actually y we can tell from the data that we have , phd f: From the insertions , maybe ? phd d: yeah , there 's a way to tell . phd f: fr fr from the phd d: It might not be a single person who 's always overlapping that person but any number of people , phd f: Right . phd d: and , if you align the two hypothesis files across the channels , you know , just word alignment , you 'd be able to find that . So so I guess that 's sort of a last ther there 're sort of a few things we could do . Another one was to try to get somehow align Thilo 's energy segmentations with what we have . But then you have the problem of not knowing where the words are because these meetings were done before that segmentation . phd b: What what is why do you need the , the forced alignment for the HLT  for the Eurospeech paper ? phd d: Well , I guess I I wanted to just do something not on recognition experiments because that 's ju way too early , but to be able to report , you know , actual numbers . Like if we if we had hand - transcribed pe good alignments or hand - checked alignments , then we could do this paper . But without knowing where the real words are , in time phd b: So it was to get it was to get more data and better to to squeeze the boundaries in . phd d: To to know what an overlap really if it 's really an overlap , or if it 's just a a a segment correlated with an overlap , phd b: Ah , OK . phd d: and I guess that 's the difference to me between like a real paper and a sort of , promissory paper . So , if we d it might be possible to take Thilo 's output and like if you have , like right now these meetings are all , grad e: Ugh ! I forgot the digital camera again . phd d: grad e: Every meeting ! phd d: you know , they 're time - aligned , so if these are two different channels and somebody 's talking here and somebody else is talking here , just that word , if Thilo can tell us that there 're boundaries here , we should be able to figure that out grad e:   phd d: Yeah , if you have two and they 're at the edges , it 's like here and here , and there 's speech here , then it doesn't really help you , so ,  phd b: Thilo 's won't put down two separate marks in that case phd d: Well it w it would , but , we don't know exactly where the words are because the transcriber gave us two words in this time bin grad e: Thilo 's will . phd d: and we don't really know , postdoc a: Well it 's a merging problem . If you had a if you had a s if you had a script which would phd d: yeah it 's postdoc a: I 've thought about this , and I 've discussed I 've discussed it with Thilo , phd d: if you have any ideas . I would postdoc a: the , I I in principle I could imagine writing a script which would approximate it to some degree , but there is this problem of slippage , grad e: Well maybe Maybe that will get enough of the cases to be useful . grad e: You know s cuz it seemed like most of the cases are in fact the single word sorts , or at least a single phrase postdoc a: Well they they can be stretched . postdoc a: I wouldn't make that generalization cuz sometimes people will say , \" And then I \" and there 's a long pause phd d: Yeah . postdoc a: and finish the sentence and and sometimes it looks coherent and and the  it 's it 's not a simple problem . But it 's really And then it 's coupled with the problem that sometimes , you know , with with a fricative you might get the beginning of the word cut off and so it 's coupled with the problem that Thilo 's isn't perfect either .  , we 've i th it 's like you have a merging problem plus so merging plus this problem of , not grad e: Right .  ! postdoc a: y i i if the speech - nonspeech were perfect to begin with , the detector , that would already be an improvement , but that 's impossible , you know , i that 's too much to ask . postdoc a: And so i and may you know , it 's I think that there always th there would have to be some hand - tweaking , but it 's possible that a script could be written to merge those two types of things . I 've I 've discussed it with Thilo and  in terms of not him doing it , but we we discussed some of the parameters of that and how hard it would be to in principle to write something that would do that . phd d: I guess in the future it won't be as much as an issue if transcribers are using the tightened boundaries to start with , then we have a good idea of where the forced alignment is constrained to . postdoc a: Well , it 's just , you know , a matter of we had the revolution we had the revolution of improved , interface , one month too late , phd d: So I 'm no I don't know if this grad e: Oh . postdoc a: but it 's like , you know , it 's wonderful to have the revolution , phd d: Oh it 's it 's a postdoc a: so it 's just a matter of of , you know , from now on we 'll be able to have things channelized to begin with . grad e: I was just thinking about the fact that if Thilo 's missed these short segments , that might be quite time - consuming for them to insert them . phd d: But he he also can adjust this minimum time duration constraint and then what you get is noises mostly , postdoc a: Yeah . phd d: but that might be OK , an grad e: It might be easier to delete something that 's wrong than to insert something that 's missing . And you can also see in the waveform exac grad e: What do you think , Jane ? phd d: yeah . professor c: If you can feel confident that what the yeah , that there 's actually something phd d: Yeah . Cuz then then you just delete it , and you don't have to pick a time . phd d: I think it 's postdoc a: Well the problem is I you know I I it 's a it 's a really good question , and I really find it a pain in the neck to delete things because you have to get the mouse up there on the t on the text line and i and otherwise you just use an arrow to get down  , i it depends on how lar th there 's so many extra things that would make it one of them harder than the other , or or vice versa . But , you know , in principle , like , you know , if one of them is easier then to bias it towards whichever one 's easier . grad e: Yeah , I guess the semantics aren't clear when you delete a segment , right ? Because you would say You would have to determine what the surroundings were . phd d: You could just say it 's a noise , though , and write , you know , a post - processor will just all you have to do is just grad e: If it 's really a noise . phd d: or just say it 's just put \" X , \" you know , like \" not speech \" or something , postdoc a: I think it 's easier to add than delete , frankly , phd d: and then you can get Yeah , or postdoc a: because you have to , maneuver around on the on both windows then . grad e: But I think it 's the semantics that are that are questionable to me , that you delete something So let 's say someone is talking to here , and then you have a little segment here . Well , is that part of the speech ? Is it part of the nonspeech ?  , w what do you embed it in ? phd d: There 's something nice , though , about keeping , and this is probably another discussion , keeping the stuff that Thilo 's detector detected as possible speech and just marking it as not speech than deleting it . Because then when you align it , then the alignment can you can put a reject model or whatever , grad e: Oh , I see . So then they could just like put Oh that 's what you meant by just put an \" X \" there . phd d: and you 're consistent with th the automatic system , grad e: that 's an interesting idea . phd d: whereas if you delete it grad e: So so all they So that all they would have to do is put like an \" X \" there . phd d: Yeah , or some , you know , dummy reject mod grad e: So blank for blank for silence , \" S \" \" S \" for speech , \" X \" \" X \" for something else . That 's actually a better way to do it cuz the a the forced alignment will probably be more consistent than postdoc a: Well , like , I think there 's a complication which is that that you can have speech and noise in s phd d:  if it 's just as easy , but postdoc a: you know , on the same channel , the same speaker , so now sometimes you get a ni microphone pop and , there 're these fuzzy hybrid cases , and then the problem with the boundaries that have to be shifted around . phd d: Anyway , quick question , though , at a high level do people think , let 's just say that we 're moving to this new era of like using the , pre - segmented t you know , non - synchronous conversations , does it make sense to try to take what we have now , which are the ones that , you know , we have recognition on which are synchronous and not time - tightened , and try to get something out of those for sort of purposes of illustrating the structure and the nature of the meetings , or is it better to just , you know , forget that and tr  , it 's grad e: Well , I think we 'll have to , eventually . grad e: But if we can't phd d: And maybe we can for the non - lapel , but grad e: But if we can't , then maybe we just have to phd d: is it worth if we can't then we can fake it even if we 're we report , you know , we 're wrong twenty percent of the time or ten percent of the time . grad e: Well , I 'm thinking are you talking about for a paper , or are talking about for the corpus . grad e:  cuz for the corpus it would be nice if everything were phd d: Actually that 's a good question because we 'd have to completely redo those meetings , and we have like ten of them now . grad e: We wouldn't have to re - do them , we would just have to edit them . postdoc a: Well , and also , I still haven't I still haven't given up on forced alignment . phd d: No , you 're right , actually postdoc a: I think that when Brian comes , this 'll be  an interesting aspect to ask him as well b grad e: When postdoc a: when Brian Kingsbury comes . And it 's like , \" Who 's Ryan ? \" postdoc a: Yeah , good question . phd d: no , that 's a good point , though , because for feature extraction like for prosody or something , the meetings we have now , it 's a good chunk of data grad e: Yep . postdoc a: That 's what my hope has been , phd d: So we should at least try it even if we can't , postdoc a: and that 's what that 's what you know , ever since the the February meeting that I transcribed from last year , forced alignment has been on the on the table as a way of cleaning them up later . phd d: right ? grad e: On the table , right ? postdoc a: And and so I 'm hopeful that that 's possible . I know that there 's complication in the overlap sections and with the lapel mikes , phd f: There 's postdoc a: but phd f: Yeah . phd d: we might be able , at the very worst , we can get transcribers to correct the cases where  , you sort of have a good estimate where these places are because the recognition 's so poor . Right ? phd b: Yeah , we were never just gonna go with these as the final alignments . phd d: So we need some way to push these first chunk of meetings into a state where we get good alignments . phd f: I 'm probably going to spend another day or so trying to improve things by , by using , acoustic adaptation .  , the Right now I 'm using the unadapted models for the forced alignments , and it 's possible that you get considerably better results if you , manage to adapt the , phone models to the speaker and the reject model to the to to all the other speech .  , so phd b: Could you could you at the same time adapt the reject model to the speech from all the other channels ? professor c: That 's what he just said . phd b: Oh , not just the speech from that of the other people from that channel , phd f: Right . I don't think that would work , phd f: No , it grad e: right ? Because you 'd A lot of it 's dominated by channel properties . phd d: But what you do wanna do is take the , even if it 's klugey , take the segments the synchronous segments , the ones from the HLT paper , where only that speaker was talking . phd f: So you want to u phd d: Use those for adaptation , cuz if you if you use everything , then you get all the cross - talk in the adaptation , and it 's just sort of blurred . I thought it was higher than that , that 's pr phd d: It really it depends a lot . professor c: Well I know what we 're not turning in to Eurospeech , a redo of the HLT paper . professor c: That I don't wanna do that , grad e: Yeah , I 'm doing that for AVIOS . phd d: I think Morgan 's talk went very well it woke postdoc a: Excellent . phd d: you know , it was really a well presented and got people laughing postdoc a: Yeah . phd f: Some good jokes in it ? grad e: Especially the batteried meter popping up , phd d: Yeah . professor c: You know , that wa that was the battery meter saying that it was fully charged , grad e: It 's full . grad e: He he he was onto the bullet points about talking about the you know the little hand - held , and trying to get lower power and so on , phd f: Po - low power grad e: and Microsoft pops up a little window saying \" Your batteries are now fully charged . grad e: I 'm thinking about scripting that for my talk , you know , put put a little script in there to say \" Your batteries are low \" right when I 'm saying that . No  , i in in your case , you were joking about it , but , your case the fact that your talking about similar things at a couple of conferences , it 's not these are conferences that have d really different emphases . Whereas HLT and and Eurospeech , pretty pretty pretty similar , so I I I can't see really just putting in the same thing , grad e: Are too close , yeah . phd d: No , I d I don't think that paper is really professor c: but phd d: the HLT paper is really more of a introduction - to - the - project paper , and ,  professor c: Yeah . phd d: Well , yeah , it it 's probably wouldn't make sense , professor c: Or some or some  , I would see Eurospeech if we have some Eurospeech papers , these will be paper p p  , submissions . phd d: but professor c: These will be things that are particular things , aspects of it that we 're looking at , rather than , you know , attempt at a global paper about it . I had , one of the transcribers go through and tighten up the bins on one of the , NSA meetings , and then I went through afterwards and double - checked it so that one is really very very accurate . I sent You know that one ? phd d: Oh , so grad g: The which one ? I 'm sorry . postdoc a: I 'm trying to remember I don't remember the number off hand . grad e: Those are all postdoc a: It 's one of the NSA 's . postdoc a: I 'm sure that that one 's accurate , I 've been through it myself . phd f: oh , Darn ! grad g: Yeah , that 's the problem with the NSA speakers . phd d: And e and e and extremely hard to follow , like word - wise , grad e: So . phd d: I bet the transcri  , I have no idea what they 're talking about , grad g: Yeah . phd d: so , postdoc a: I 'm sure that , they 're they 're accurate now . grad e: oh , before you l go I guess it 's alright for you to talk a little without the mike I noticed you adjusting the mike a lot , did it not fit you well ? Oh . postdoc a: Well I won I noticed when you turned your head , it would it would tilt . grad e: Maybe it wasn't just tightened enough , or phd d: Maybe the yeah , the s thing that you have tightened @ @ , phd b: Actually if if you have a larger head , that mike 's gotta go farther away which means the the balance is gonna make it wanna tip down . grad e: Cuz , I 'm just thinking , you know , we were we 're we 've been talking about changing the mikes , for a while , grad g:  postdoc a: Yeah . grad e: and if these aren't acoustically they seem really good , but if they 're not comfortable , we have the same problems we have with these stupid things . postdoc a: I think it 's com This is the first time I 've worn this , I find it very comfortable . grad e: I find it very comfortable too , but , it looked like Andreas was having problems , and I think Morgan was saying it professor c: Well , but I had it on I had it on this morning and it was fine . phd b: Can I see that ? grad e: Oh , oh you did wear it this morning ? professor c: Yeah . phd b: I yeah , I don't want it on , I just I just want to , say what I think is a problem with this . If you are wearing this over your ears and you 've got it all the way out here , then the balance is gonna want to pull it this way . phd b: Where as if somebody with a smaller head has it back here , grad e: It 's more balanced . postdoc a: Oh ! phd b: Then it then it falls back this way so it 's phd d: So we have to grad e: Well wh what it 's supposed to do is the backstrap is supposed to be under your crown , and so that should be should be postdoc a: Ah . grad e: if it 's right against your head there , which is what it 's supposed to be , that balances it so it doesn't slide up . grad e: Yep , right right below if you feel the back of your head , you feel a little lump , phd b: Yeah . phd d: So I 'm not saying anything about bias towards small headsize , grad e: About heads ? phd d: but does seem ,  phd b: It would be an advantage . postdoc a: Well , wonder if it 's if if he was wearing it over his hair instead of under his hair . professor c: Well , we should We shou we should work on compressing the heads , and grad e: I think probably it was Yeah .  , so the directions do talk about bending it to your size , which is not really what we want . phd b: The other thing that would do it would be to hang a five pound weight off the back . professor c: that 's good ! postdoc a: What did you say ? phd d: A little , grad e: wh professor c: Hang a five pound weight off the off the back . grad e: We at Boeing I used I was doing augmented reality so they had head - mounts on , and we we had a little jury - rigged one with a welder 's helmet , phd b: Counter - balance . grad e: and we had just a bag with a bunch of marbles in it as a counter - balance . If people those who talk a lot have to wear heavier weights or something , and grad e: Yeah ! professor c: and  , grad e: Anyway . professor c: so , what was I gonna say ? Oh , yeah , I was gonna say , I had these , conversations with NIST folks also while I was there and and , so they they have their their plan for a room , with , mikes in the middle of the table , and , close - mounted mikes , grad e: Yep . professor c: and they 're talking about close - mounted and lapels , just cuz phd d: And arrays , professor c: sort of and the array . grad e: And arrays , professor c: Yeah , so they were phd d: which is the i interesting grad e: yep . professor c: And yeah , like multiple multiple video cameras coverin covering every everybody every place in the room , phd d: and video , right . professor c: the yeah the the mikes in the middle , the head - mounted mikes , the lapel mikes , the array , with well , there 's some discussion of fifty - nine , grad e: Fifty - nine elements . professor c: they might go down to fifty - seven Because , there is , some pressure from a couple people at the meeting for them to use a KEMAR head . professor c: but what it is is it 's dummy head that is very specially designed , grad e: Oh , that 's right . professor c: and and and , so what they 're actually doing is they 're really there 's really two recording systems . professor c: So they may not be precisely synchronous , but the but there 's two two recording systems , one with , I think , twenty - four channels , and one with sixty - four channels . And the sixty - four channel one is for the array , but they 've got some empty channels there , and anyway they like they 're saying they may give up a couple or something if for for the KEMAR head if they go go with that . grad e: Yeah , h  , J Jonathan Fiscus did say that , they have lots of software for doing calibration for skew and offset between channels phd d:  -  grad e: and that they 've found that 's just not a big deal . I was thinking phd d: But they 're still planning to do like fake grad e: Scenario - based . grad e: But it sounded like they were pretty well thought out phd d: Yeah , th that 's true . grad e: and they 're they 're gonna be real meetings , postdoc a:   grad e: it 's just that they 're with str with people who would not be meeting otherwise . phd b: Did did they give a talk on this or was this informal ? phd d:   phd b: What was the ,  the paper by , Lori Lamel that you mentioned ? professor c: yeah , we sh we should just have you have you read it , but , I mea ba i i  , we 've all got these little proceedings , postdoc a: Mmm , yeah . professor c: but , basically , it was about , going to a new task where you have insufficient data and using using data from something else , and adapting , and how well that works .  , so in in fact it was pretty related to what Liz and Andreas did , except that this was not with meeting stuff , it was with grad e: Right . professor c: like I think they s didn't they start off with Broadcast News system ? And then they went to grad e: The - their Broadcast News was their acoustic models and then all the other tasks were much simpler . phd b: What was their rough what was their conclusion ? grad e: Yeah , read Wall Street Journal . phd d: Well , it 's it 's a good paper ,  professor c: Yeah , yeah . phd d: Bring the grad e: That It not only works , in some cases it was better , which I thought was pretty interesting , but that 's cuz they didn't control for parameters . phd b: Did they ever try going going the other direction from simpler task to more complicated tasks , grad e: acoustic models were a lot more complex . grad e: Yeah , well , one of the big problems with that is is often the simpler task isn't fully doesn't have all the phones in it , professor c: Yeah . grad e: like for the spr speech proxy thing that I did ? That 's what I did . Yeah , and they have  they have better adaptation than we had than that that system , grad e: Yep . professor c: yeah , we should probably what would actually what we should do , I haven't said anything about this , but probably the five of us should pick out a paper or two that that , you know , got our interest , and we should go around the room at one of the Tuesday lunch meetings and say , you know , what what was good about the conference , grad e: Present . phd d: Well , the summarization stuff was interesting , I don't know anything about that field , but for this proposal on meeting summarization , it 's sort of a far cry because they weren't working with meeting type data , but he got sort of an overview on some of the different approaches , grad e: Right . phd b: Do you remember who the groups were that we 're doing ? phd d: so . phd d: but , there 's that 's a huge field and probably the groups there may not be representative of the field , I I don't know exactly that everyone submits to this particular conference , phd b: Was were there folks from BBN presenting ? phd d: but yet there was , let 's see , this was on the last day , Mitre , BBN , and , Prager grad e: Mitre , BBN , IBM . phd d: no it was grad e: Wasn't Who who who did the order one ? phd d: this was Wednesday morning . The sentence ordering one , was that Barselou , and these guys ? grad e: Ugh ! I 'm just so bad at that . phd d: Anyway , I I it 's in the program , I should have read it to remind myself , but that 's sort of useful and I think like when Mari and Katrin and Jeff are here it 'd be good to figure out some kinds of things that we can start doing maybe just on the transcripts cuz we already have professor c:   postdoc a: Well , I like the idea that Adam had of of , z maybe generating minutes based on some of these things that we have because it would be easy to to to do that just , you know , and and phd d: Right . postdoc a: it has to be , though , someone from this group because of the technical nature of the thing . grad e: Someone who actually does take notes , I 'm very bad at note - taking . phd d: But I think what 's interesting is there 's all these different evaluations , like just , you know , how do you evaluate whether the summary is good or not , grad e: I always write down the wrong things . phd d: and that 's what 's was sort of interesting to me is that there 's different ways to do it , grad e: A judge . phd d: and phd b: Was SRA one of the groups talking about summarization , no ? grad e: Yep . One of those w grad e: And as I said , I like the Microsoft talk on scaling issues in , word sense disambiguation , phd d: Yeah . professor c: Yeah , that was an interesting discussion , grad e: The professor c: I grad e: It it it was the only one It was the only one that had any sort of real disagreement about . phd d: The data issue comes up all the ti professor c: Well , I didn't have as much disagreement as I would have liked , grad e: So . professor c: but I didn't wanna I wouldn I didn't wanna get into it because , you know , it was the application was one I didn't know anything about , grad e: Yep . professor c: it just would have been , you know , me getting up to be argumentative , but but , the missing thi so so what they were saying it 's one of these things is you know , all you need is more data , sort of But I mea i wh it @ @ that 's that 's dissing it , improperly , it was a nice study .  , they were doing this it wasn't word - sense disambiguation , it was phd d: Yeah yeah yeah grad e: Well , it sort of was . grad e: But it was it was a very simple case of \" to \" versus \" too \" versus \" two \" and \" there \" , \" their \" , \" they 're \" phd d: And there and their and professor c: Yeah , yeah . phd d: and that you could do better with more data , that 's clearly statistically professor c: Right . professor c: And so , what they did was they had these different kinds of learning machines , and they had different amounts of data , and so they did like , you know , eight different methods that everybody , you know , argues about about , \" Oh my my kind of learning machine is better than your kind of learning machine . \" And , they were started off with a million words that they used , which was evidently a number that a lot of people doing that particular kind of task had been using . And then they had this log scale showing a you know , and and naturally everything gets grad e: Them being beep , they went off to a billion . professor c: they well , it 's a big company , I didn't I didn't mean it as a ne anything negative , grad e: Yeah . professor c: but i i i phd d: You mean the bigger the company the more words they use for training ? grad e: Well , I think the reason they can do that , is that they assumed that text that they get off the web , like from Wall Street Journal , is correct , and edit it . Of course there was the kind of effect that , you know , one would expect that  that you got better and better performance with more and more data .  , but the the real point was that the the different learning machines are sort of all over the place , and and by by going up significantly in data you can have much bigger effect then by switching learning machines and furthermore which learning machine was on top kind of depended on where you were in this picture , so , phd b: This was my concern about the recognizer in Aurora . professor c: That phd b: That the differences we 're seeing in the front - end is b professor c: Yeah . phd d: If you add more data ? Or phd b: You know ? professor c: Yeah . So so , that was that was kind of , you know , it 's a good point , but the problem I had with it was that the implications out of this was that , the kind of choices you make about learning machines were therefore irrelevant which is not at n t as for as I know in in tasks I 'm more familiar with @ @ is not at all true . What i what is is true is that different learning machines have different properties , and you wanna know what those properties are . And someone else sort of implied that well we s you know , a all the study of learning machine we still don't know what those properties are . We don't know them perfectly , but we know that some kinds use more memory and and some other kinds use more computation and some are are hav have limited kind of discrimination , but are just easy to use , and others are phd b: But doesn't their conclusion just sort of you could have guessed that before they even started ? Because if you assume that these learning things get better and better and better , professor c: You would guess phd b: then as you approach there 's a point where you can't get any better , right ? You get everything right . phd d: It 's just no grad e: But phd b: So they 're all approaching . phd b: But what I 'm saying is that th they have to , as they all get better , they have to get closer together . phd b: But they 're all going the same way , right ? So you have to get closer . phd b: Oh they didn't ? professor c: Well grad e: They just switched position . professor c: well that 's getting cl  , yeah , the spread was still pretty wide that 's th that 's true , grad e: Yep . professor c: but but , I think it would be irntu intu intuition that this would be the case , but , to really see it and to have the intuition is quite different , I think somebody w w let 's see who was talking about earlier that the effect of having a lot more data is quite different in Switchboard than it is in in Broadcast News , phd d: Well it 's different for different tasks . phd d: So it depends a lot on whether , you know , it disambiguation is exactly the case where more data is better , right ? You 're you 're you can assume similar distributions , professor c: Yeah . phd d: but if you wanted to do disambiguation on a different type of , test data then your training data , then that extra data wouldn't generalize , grad e: Right . w  , I think one of them was that \" Well , maybe simpler algorithms and more data are is better \" . Right ? Because their simplest , most brain - dead algorithm did pretty darn well professor c:   Why are you sticking with a million words ? \"  , their point was that this million - word corpus that everyone uses is apparently ten or fifteen years old . But anyway , I I I think it 's it 's just the the i it 's it 's it 's not really the conclusion they came to so much , as the conclusion that some of the , commenters in the crowd came up with grad e: But we could talk about this stuff , I think this would be fun to do . professor c: that , you know , this therefore is further evidence that , you know , more data is really all you should care about , and that I thought was just kind of going too far the other way , grad e: Machine - learning . professor c: and and the the , one one person ga g g got up and made a a brief defense , but it was a different kind of grounds , it was that that , i w the reason people were not using so much data before was not because they were stupid or didn't realize data was important , but in fact th they didn't have it available .  , but the other point to make a again is that , machine learning still does matter , but it it matters more in some situations than in others , and it and also there 's there 's not just mattering or not mattering , but there 's mattering in different ways .  , you might be in some situation where you care how much memory you 're using , or you care , you know , what recall time is , grad e: Right . professor c: or you care , you know , and and grad e: Or you only have a million words for your some new task . professor c: Yeah , or or ,  phd d: Or done another language , or  , you so there 's papers on portability and rapid prototyping and blah - blah - blah , grad e: Yep . \" professor c: And there 's cost ! phd d: So , these are like two different religions , basically . professor c: you know , so so these ,  th the in the in the speech side , the thing that @ @ always occurs to me is that if you if you  one person has a system that requires ten thousand hours to train on , and the other only requires a hundred , and they both do about the same because the hundred hour one was smarter , that 's that 's gonna be better . because people , there isn't gonna be just one system that people train on grad e: Yep . She put this up , and it was like this is this p people kept saying , \" Can I see that slide again ? \" professor c: Yeah . phd d: Yeah , postdoc a: and then they 'd make a comment , and one person said , well - known person said , you know , \" Before you dismiss forty - five years including my work \" phd d: yeah . phd d: But th you know , the same thing has happened in computational linguistics , right ? You look at the ACL papers coming out , and now there 's sort of a turn back towards , OK we 've learned statistic you know , we 're basically getting what we expect out of some statistical methods , and , you know , the there 's arguments on both sides , grad e: Yep . grad e: Is that all all of them are based on all the others , right ? Just , you you can't say phd b: Maybe they should have said \" focus \" or something . And I 'm saying the same thing happened with speech recognition , right ? For a long time people were hand - c coding linguistic rules and then they discovered machine - learning worked better . And now they 're throwing more and more data and worrying perhaps worrying less and less about , the exact details of the algorithms . phd d: And and then you hit this grad e: Except when they have a Eurospeech paper . grad e: Shall we read some digits ? Are we gonna do one at a time ? Or should we read them all agai at once again <doc-sep>And actually if everyone could cross out the R - nine next to \" Session \" , and write MR eleven . grad c: And let 's remember also to make sure that one 's gets marked as unread , unused . grad c: There 's lots of clicking I 'm sure as I 'm trying to get this to work correctly . Any agenda items today ? grad c: I wanna talk a little bit about getting how we 're gonna to get people to edit bleeps , parts of the meeting that they don't want to include . What I 've done so far , and I wanna get some opinions on , how to how to finish it up . postdoc f: I wanna ask about  , some aud audio monitoring on some of the  well some of the equipment . postdoc f: Ba - based on some of the tran  i In listening to some of these meetings that have already been recorded there are sometimes big spikes on particular things , and in pact in fact this one I 'm talking on is one of of the ones that showed up in one of the meetings , grad c: Oh really . postdoc f: so I phd b: \" Spikes \" , you mean like  , instantaneous click type spikes , or ? postdoc f:   grad c: It could be touching and fiddling , and the other thing is that it could the fact that it 's on a wired mike is suspicious . Well maybe Then we don't really have to talk about that as an phd b: You could try an experiment and say \" OK , I 'm about to test for spikes \" , postdoc f: I I take that off the agenda . phd b: and then wiggle the thing there , and then go and when they go to transcribe it , it could , ask them to come and get you . phd b: \" Come get me when you transcribe this and see if there 's spikes . phd b: No I 'm just  professor e: were this a professional audio recording , what we would do what you would do is in testing it is , you would actually do all this wiggling and make sure that that that things are not giving that kind of performance . I guess I would like to have a discussion about you know where we are on  , recording , transcription you know , basically you know where we are on the corpus . professor e: And then  , the other thing which I would like to talk about which is a real meta - quest , I think , deal is , agendas . Andreas brought up the fact that he would kinda like to know , if possible , what we were gonna be talking about because he 's sort of peripherally involved to this point , and if there 's gonna be a topic about discussion about something that he  strongly cares about then he would come and And I think part of part of his motivation with this is that he 's trying to help us out , in the because of  the fact that the meetings are are tending to become reasonably large now on days when everybody shows up and so , he figures he could help that out by not showing grad c: Mmm . by not showing up if it 's a meeting that he 's he 's So ,  in order I 'd I think that this is a wish on his part . It 's actually gonna be hard because it seems like a lot of times  things come up that are unanticipated and and grad c: Right . professor e: But  , we could try anyway , do another try at coming up with the agenda  , at some point before the meeting , say the day before . grad c: Well maybe it would be a good idea for one of us to like on Wednesday , or Tuesday send out a reminder for people to send in agenda items . phd b: That 'll be I think that 'll help grad c: I 'll put that on my spare brain or it will not get done . professor e: Yeah , I have to tell you for the  for the admin meeting that we have , Lila does that  every time before an admin meeting . phd b: I would I would also guess that as we get more into processing the data and things like that there 'll be more things of interest to him . The other topic I was thinking of was the sta status on microphones and channels , and all that . grad c: Yeah , actually I I was going to say we need to talk about that too . First of all , if the other headsets are a lot more comfortable , we should probably just go ahead and get them . So we 'll have to evaluate that when they come in , phd a:  grad c: and get people 's opinions on on what they think of them . professor e: So how many channels do you get to have in a wireless setup ? grad c: well , I 'm pretty sure that you can daisy - chain them together so what we would do is replace the wired mikes with wireless . So we currently have one base station with six wireless mike , possibility of six wireless receivers , and apparently you can chain those together . And so we could replace our wired mikes with wireless if we bought another base station and more wireless mikes . grad c: And So , you know it 's still , it 's fifteen minus six . professor e: So let 's see we grad c: Right ? So we could have up to nine . grad c: And it 's  , about nine hundred dollars for the base station , and then eight hundred per channel . So yeah so the only Beyond the mike the cost of the mikes the only thing is the base station that 's nine hundred dollars . OK , so I 'll look into how you daisy - chain them and and then just go ahead and order them . grad c: No , we 're just replacing the wired the two wired that are still working , phd b: OK . grad c: along with a couple of the wired that aren't working , one of the wired that 's not working , with a wireless . phd b: Three wireds work , professor e: Basically we found phd b: right ? grad c: I I guess three wireds work , yeah . professor e: And so  , we we seem to have  , a reliable way of getting the data in , which is through the ra Sony radio mikes , as long as we 're conscious about the batteries . grad c: Everyone 's battery OK ? phd b: I checked them this morning , they should be . But the quality seems really good and  I heard from UW that they 're they 're  very close to getting their ,  setup purchased . They 're they 're they 're buying something that you can just sort of buy off the shelf . grad c: Well we should talk to them about it because I know that SRI is also in the process of looking at stuff , and so , you know , what we should try to keep everyone on the same page with that . grad c: They got sa apparent Well , Maybe this needs to be bleeped out ? I have no clue . But anyway there 's there 's there 's  ,  other activities that are going on there and and  and NIST and UW . But but yeah I thin I think that at least the message we can tell other people is that our experience is is quite positive with the Sony , grad c: Right . Now the one thing that you have said that actually concerns me a little is you 're talking about changing the headsets meaning changing the connector , which means some hand - soldering or something , right ? grad c: no , we 're having the them do it . professor e: No ? grad c: So it 's so hand - soldering it , but I 'm not doing it . professor e: OK , so that 's being done professionally and grad c: I  professor e: Yeah . professor e: Well , it could if they do a lot of it , it 's grad c:  i it 's just their repair shop . grad c: And ,  we 'll see , tomorrow , you know , what it looks like . So , Dave isn't here but he was going to start working on some things with the digits . I guess Was the decision last time was that the the  transcribers were going to be doing stuff with the digits as well ? Has that started , or is that ? postdoc f:   grad c: Right , so , the decision was that Jane did not want the transcribers to be doing any of the paperwork . And  , then I have a bunch of scripts that we 'll read those and let the  transcribers use different tools . So he has a nice set up that they it w it will be efficient for them to do that . professor e: So anyway grad c: So , you know , just  , a matter of a few days I suspect . professor e: So anyway I think we we have at least one  , user for the digits once they get done , which will be Dave . grad c: So if he wanted to , you know , just have a few to start with , he could . You know , and I also have a bunch of scripts that will , like , generate P - files and run recognition on them also .  , is Dave I don't know if Dave is on the list , if he 's invited to these meetings ,  if he knows . grad c: we don't have a active one but I 'll make sure he 's on the list . Should we call him ?  is he d is he definitely not available today ? professor e: I don't know . phd a: Yeah , he was in s postdoc f: He wasn't there at cof professor e: Yeah , so this might be a conflict for him . grad c: Yeah didn't he say his signal - processing class was like Tuesdays and Thursdays ? phd a: I think he has a class . grad d: Yeah , I think he 's taking two twenty - five A which is now . professor e: And the and the recordings also , postdoc f:  professor e: just where we are . postdoc f: Well , so  , should we we don't wan wanna do the recording status first , or ? grad c: Well , we have about thirty - two hours  as of , I guess a week and a half ago , so we probably now have about thirty - five hours . professor e: And and that 's that 's  How much of that is digits ? It 's  that 's including digits , grad c: That 's including digits . professor e: right ? grad c: I haven't separated it out so I have no clue how much of that is digits . So anyway there 's at least probably thirty hours , or something of There 's got to be more than thirty hour phd a: Mmm . grad c: Of of non - digits ? professor e: i it couldn't of Of non - digits . postdoc f: OK , and the transcribers h I , don't have the exact numbers , but I think it would come to about eleven hours that are finished  , transcribing from them right now . The next step is to that I 'm working on is to insure that the data are clean first , and then channelized . What  by clean is that they 're spell - checked , that the mark - up is consistent all the way throughout , and also that we now incorporate these additional conventions that  , Liz requested in terms of  ,  in terms of having a s a systematic handling of numbers , and acronyms which I hadn't been specific about . And you know , so how you could grad c: Nine two , postdoc f: e Exactly . postdoc f: So if you just say \" nine two \" , the there are many s ways that could have been expressed . An - and I just had them I  , a certain number of them did put the words down , but now we have a convention which also involves having it followed by , a gloss th and things . phd b: one suggestion and you may already be doing this , but I 've noticed in the past that when I 've gone through transcriptions and you know in in order to build lexicons and things , if you  , just take all the transcriptions and separate them into words and then alphabetize them , a lot of times just scanning down that list you 'll find a lot of inconsistencies and mis grad c: Misspelled . postdoc f: You 're talking about the type token frequency listings , and I use those too . Y you mean just  on each on each line there 's a one word right ? It 's one token from the from the corpus . postdoc f: Yeah , those are e extremely efficient and I and I I agree that 's a very good use of it . postdoc f: Well that 's that 's a way that 's You know , the spell - check basically does that but but in addition yes , that 's that 's exactly the strategy I wanna do in terms of locating these things which are you know colloquial spoken forms which aren't in the lexicon . Cuz a lot of times they 'll appear next to each other , and  , postdoc f: Exactly . phd b: i in alphabetized lists , they 'll appear next to each other and and so it makes it easier . And that was that 's my strategy for handling a lot of these things , in terms of things that need to be glossed . I didn't get to that point but So there are numbers , then there are acronyms , and then  , there 's a he she wants the  , actually a an explicit marker of what type of comment this is , so i curly b inside the curly brackets I 'm gonna put either \" VOC \" for vocalized , like cough or like laugh or whatever , \" NONVOC \" for door - slam , and \" GLOSS \" for things that have to do with if they said a s a spoken form with this m this pronunciation error . postdoc f: but I I haven't been asking these people to do it systematically cuz I think it most ha most efficiently handled by  by a a filter . So that , you know you get a whole long list exactly what you 're saying , you get a whole list of things that say \" curly bracket laugh curly bracket \" , phd b:   postdoc f: then y you know it 's it 's You you risk less error if you handle it by a filter , than if you have this transcriber ch laboriously typing in sort of a VOC space , phd b: Yeah . postdoc f: So ,  I 'm I 'm going to convert that via a filter , into these tagged  , subcategorized comments , and same thing with you know , we see you get a subset when you do what you 're saying , phd b:   postdoc f: you end up with a s with  , you 're collapsing across a frequency you just have the tokens phd b:   But the numbers and acronyms have to be handled by hand , because , you know  , jus grad c: You don't know what they could be . postdoc f: Yeah now TIMIT 's clear  and PLP is clear but  there are things that are not so well known , in or or have variant u u uses like the numbers you can say \" nine two \" or you can say \" ninety - two \" , grad c: So how are you doing the postdoc f: and  I 'd handle the numbers individually . grad c: How are you doing the  , acronyms so if I say PZM what would it appear on the transcript ? postdoc f: It would be separate The letters would be separated in space grad c: OK . postdoc f: and potentially they 'll have a curly bracket thing afterwards e but I 'm not sure if that 's necessary , clarifying what it is , grad c:   Maybe it 's a nice thing to do because of it then indicating this is  , a step away from i indicating that it really is intentional that those spaces are there , and indicating why they 're there to indicate that it 's  the you know ,  enumerated , or i grad c:   postdoc f: it 's not a good way of saying but it 's it 's the specific  way of stating these these letters . postdoc f: And so anyway , the clean those are those things and then channelized is to then  , get it into this multichannel format . But that 's been my top priority beyond getting it tanel channelized , the next step is to work on tightening up the boundaries of the time bins . postdoc f: And  , Thilo had a e e a breakthrough with this this last week in terms of getting the channel - based   s s speech - nonspeech segmentation  , up and running and I haven't I haven't been able to use that yet cuz I 'm working s re this is my top priority get the data clean , and channelized . phd a: I actually gave grad c: Have you also been doing spot checks , Jane ? postdoc f: Oh yes . I spent  actually  I have a segment of ten minutes that was transcribed by two of our transcribers , grad c: Oh good . postdoc f: and I went through it last night , it 's it 's almost spooky how similar these are , word for word . And there are some differences in commas cuz commas I I left them discretion at commas . postdoc f:  and so because it 's not part of our st of our ne needed conventions . postdoc f: And  , and so they 'll be a difference in commas , but it 's word - by - word the same , in in huge patches of the data . And and sometimes it turns out that one of these transcribers has a better ear for technical jargon , and the other one has a better ear for colloquial speech . So  , the one i i the colloquial speech person picked up \" gobbledy - gook \" . And on this side , this one 's picking up things like \" neural nets \" and the one that 's good on the sp o on th the vocabulary on the  colloquial didn't . phd b: When for the person who missed \" gobbledy - gook \" what did they put ? postdoc f: It was an interesting approximation , put in parentheses , cuz I have this convention that , i if they 're not sure what it was , they put it in parentheses . postdoc f: So they tried to approximate it , but it was phd b: Oh good . More of an attempt to  apparently it was very clear to her that these the a this this was a sound these are the sounds , grad c: It was a technical term that she didn't recognize , phd b: Yeah . But she even though her technical perception is just really  you know I 've I 'm tempted to ask her if she 's taken any courses in this area or if she 's taken cognitive science courses grad c: Right . postdoc f: then cuz \" neural nets \" and oh she has some things that are oh \" downsampled \" , she got that right . postdoc f: But ch ten solid  m ch s chunk of ten solid minutes where they both coded the same data . professor e: And and again the main track that you 're working with is elev eleven hours ? postdoc f: And  professor e: Is that right ? postdoc f: Yes exactly . professor e: So let 's say roughly ten hours or so of postdoc f:   postdoc f: It 'd be more than that because I my recollection is the minutes that da digits don't take more than half a minute . postdoc f: But  the the total set that I gave them is twelve hours of tape , professor e: Oh , I see . postdoc f: So they 're still working some of them are Two of them are still working on completing that . professor e: So what what what 's the deal with with your phd a: The channel u thing ? professor e: Yeah . phd a: Oh , it 's just  , I ran the recognizer  , the speech - nonspeech detector on different channels and , it 's just in  in this new multi - channel format and output , and I just gave one one meeting to to Liz who wanted to to try it for for the recognizer professor e: Oh , I see . phd a: as  , apparently the recognizer had problems with those long chunks of speech , which took too much memory or whatever , professor e: Right . So , I hope grad c: Is this anything different than the  system you were using before ? professor e: Yeah . phd a: There is some ,  as the energy is normalized across channels grad c: You know what  ? Across all of them . What are some of the other features ? Besides the energy ? You said you 're trying some different features , or something . phd a: Oh I just  Mmm , I just use  our loudness - based things now as they before there were they were some in in the log domain and I I changed this to the to the professor e: Cu - Cube root ? phd a: Yeah . To No , I changed this to the to the to the loudness thingy with the with the grad c:  . Yeah , and I and I tried t to normalize   the features , there 's loudness and modified loudness , within one channel , professor e: OK . phd a: because they 're , yeah to to be able to distinguish between foreground and background speech . I think the  Were were you basically done with the transcription part ? So I guess the next thing is this  bleep editing . So the The idea is that we need to have We need to provide the transcripts to every participant of every meeting to give them an opportunity to bleep out sections they don't want . So I 've written a bunch of tools that will generate web pages ,  with the transcription in it so that they can click on them and piece pieces and they can scroll through and read them , and then they can check on each one if they want it excluded . And then , it 's a form , HTML form , so they can submit it and it will end up sending me email with the times that they want excluded . And so I thought about this a little bit and I think the best way to do it is every participant will have a password , professor e: Yeah . And then each meeting , we 'll only allow the participants who were at that meeting to look at it . professor e: I I can't help but wonder if this is maybe a little more elaborate than is needed .  if people have  , for me I would actually want to have some pieces of paper that had the transcription and I would sort of flip through it . professor e: And , I   it depends how this really ends up working out , but I guess my thought was that the occasion of somebody wondering whether something was OK or not and needing to listen to it was gonna be extremely rare . grad c: Right ,  so th th th the fact that you could listen to it over the web is a minor thing that I had already done for other reasons . grad c: And so that that 's a minor part of it , I just wanted some web interface so that people you didn't actually have to send everyone the text . So m what my intention to do is that as the transcripts become ready ,  I would take them , and generate the web pages and send email to every participant or contact them using the contact method they wanted , and just  , tell them , \" here 's the web page \" , \" you need a password \" . So th th question number one is how do we distribute the passwords , and question number two is how else do we wanna provide this information if they want it . professor e: That 's I think what I was sort of saying is that if you just say \" here is a here is \"  this maybe it sounds paleolithic but but I just thought if you handed them some sheets of paper , that said , \" here 's what was said in this transcription is it OK with you ? and if it is , here 's this other sheet of paper that you sign that says that it 's OK \" . grad c: I think that  there are a subset of people who will want printouts that we can certainly provide . These are big , and I would much rather be ha be able to just sit and leaf through it . professor e: You find it easier to go through a large  how do you read books ? grad c: Well I certainly read books by hand . professor e: Really ?  , it grad c: Cuz you 're gonna get , you know , if I I 'm I 'm in a bunch of meetings and I don't wanna get a stack of these . professor e: Going to a web site is easy , but flipping through a hundred pounds a hundred pages of stuff is not easy on the web . grad c: Well , I don't think it 's that much harder than , paper . So are you thinking that  the person would have a transcript and go strictly from the transcript ? Because I I do think that there 's a benefit to being able to hear the tone of voice and the professor e: So here 's the way I was imagining it , and maybe I 'm wrong , postdoc f: Yeah . professor e: but the way I imagined it was that  , the largest set of people is gonna go \" oh yeah , I didn't say anything funny in that meeting just go ahead , where 's the where 's the release ? \" And then there 'll be a subset of people , right ? OK there 's  think of who it is we 've been recording mostly . professor e: OK there 'll be a subset of people , who  , will say  \" well , yeah , I really would like to see that . \" And for them , the easiest way to flip through , if it 's a really large document ,  unless you 're searching . Searching , of course , should be electronic , but if you 're not so if you provide some search mechanism you go to every place they said something or something like that , phd a: Yeah .  if if  you don't have search mechanisms you just sort of have this really , really long document ,  whenever I 've had a really , really long document that it was sitting on the web , I 've always ended up printing it out .  , so it 's it 's  , you you 're you 're not necessarily gonna be sitting at the desk all the time , you wanna figure you have a train ride , and there 's all these situations where where I  , this is how I was imagining it , anyway . And then I figured , that out of that group , there would be a subset who would go \"  you know I 'm really not sure about this section here , \" and then that group would need it S It seems like i if I 'm right in that , it seems like you 're setting it up for the most infrequent case , rather than for the most frequent case . So that  , now we have to worry about privacy , grad c: Well , no fre for the most professor e: we have to worry about all these passwords , for different people grad c: For the most frequent case they just say \" it 's OK \" and then they 're done . postdoc f: The other thing too is it seems like professor e: yeah , that 's true . grad c: cuz you don't have to visit the web page if you don't want to . grad c: Oh that was another thing I I had assumed that we didn't need their signature , that it that an email approval was sufficient . phd b: Are are people going to be allowed to bleep out sections of a meeting where they weren't speaking ? grad c: Yes . If someone feels strongly enough about it , then I I I think they should be allowed to do that . phd b: So that means other people are editing what you say ? professor e:  I don't know about that . grad c: Well , the only other choice is that the person would say \" no , don't distribute this meeting at all \" , and I would rather they were able to edit out other people then just say \" don't distribute it at all \" . professor e: But th what they signed in the consent form , was something that said you can use my voice . grad c: Well , but if if someone is having a conversation , and you only bleep out one side of it , that 's not sufficient . grad c: If I say \" we were having a conversation , and I consider that conversation private , \" and I consider that your side of it is enough for other people to infer , I wanna be able to bleep out your side . postdoc f: The I agree that the consent forms were  , I cons agree with what Adam 's saying , that  , the consent form did leave open this possibility that they could edit things which they found offensive whe whether they said them or didn't say them . postdoc f: And the other thing is from the standpoint of the l of the l I 'm not a law lawyer , but it strikes me that  , we wouldn't want someone to say \" oh yes , I was a little concerned about it but it was too hard to access \" . Now in terms of like editing it by hand ,  I think it 's i some people would find that easier to specify the bleep part by having a document they edited . But but it seems to me that sometimes  , you know i if a person had a bad day , and they had a tone in their voice that they didn't really like , you know it 's nice it 's nice to be able to listen to it and be sure that that was OK . professor e:   it 's also a mixture of people ,  some people are r do their work primarily by sitting at the computer , flipping around the web , and others do not . You know ? grad c: Well I think most of the people in the meetings are the former . grad c: And that Well , but if they want to print it out that 's alright . I I think grad c: OK , so does that mean that I can't use email ? Or what ? postdoc f: Cuz you could send it through email you 're thinking . professor e: I I th grad c: Well , I don't think I professor e: well we there was this grad c: well I don't think we can send the text through email because of the privacy issues . So giving them , you think a web site to say , \" if you wanna print it out here it is \" , is not sufficient ? postdoc f: Good point . I professor e: Certainly for everybody who 's been in the meetings so far it would be sufficient . grad c: Yeah , I 'm just thinking for people that that 's not sufficient for , what the only sufficient thing would be for me to walk up to them and hand it to them . professor e: I 'm just wondering about postdoc f: You could mail it to them . phd a: But postdoc f: But I think it 's easier to drop in the box . phd a: Just put the button on on the web page which say \" please send me the the scripts \" . phd b: What  When you display it on the web page , what are what are you showing them ? Utterances , or ? grad c:   phd b: And so can they bleep within an utterance ? grad c: No . grad c: And that was just convenience for my sake , that it 's  ,  it would end up being fairly difficult to edit the transcripts if we would do it at the sub - utterance level . Because this way I can just delete an entire line out of a transcript file rather than have to do it by hand . professor e: There 's another aspect to this which maybe is part of why this is bothering me .  , I think you 're really trying very hard to make this as convenient as possible for people to do this . grad c:  that 's why I did the web form , because for me that would be my most convenient . You 're gonna end up with all these little patchy things , whereas really what we want to do is have the the the bias towards letting it go . Because nob you know it There was a one or twi once or twice , in the re in the meetings we 've heard , where somebody said something that they might be embarrassed by , but overall people are talking about technical topics . You know , this is this we 're we 're covering We 're playing the lawyer 's game , and we 're playing we 're we 're we 're looking for the extreme case . If we really orient it towards that extreme case , make it really easy , we 're gonna end up encouraging a headache . That I think that 's I 'm sort of psyching myself out here , I I 'm trying to  grad c: I guess I don't see having a few phrases here and there in a meeting being that mu much of a headache , bleeped out . professor e: but I I think that 's Well , it 's grad c: So . phd b: I think what Morgan 's saying is the easier it is , the more is gonna be bleeped . I think some researchers who are gonna be working with this corpus years from now are really gonna be cursing the fact that there 's a bunch of stuff in there that 's missing from the dialogue . professor e: You know , it depends on the kind of research they 're doing , phd a: Yeah . And , you know where it 's really gonna hurt somebody , in some way the one who said it or someone who is being spoken about , we definitely want to allow the option of it being bleeped out . And and  , I am just a little worried about making it so easy for people to do , and so much fun ! that they 're gonna go through and bleep out stuff . professor e: and they can bleep out stuff they don't like too , right from somebody else , as you say , you know , so \" well I didn't like what he said .  , we have to provi we have promised that we would provide them the transcript and that they can remove parts that they don't like . No , no , I I I don't grad c: The only question is professor e: You - you 've talked me into that , but I I just think that we should make it harder to do . grad c: The problem is if it 's harder for them it 's also harder for me . Whereas this web interface , I just get email , it 's all formatted , it 's all ready to go and I can just insert it . professor e: So maybe you don't give them access to the web interface unless they really need it . professor e: I 'm sorry so so So maybe this is a s a way out of it . professor e: You 've provided something that 's useful for you to do handle , and useful for someone else if they need it . But I think the issue of privacy and ease and so forth should be that  , they get access to this if they really need it . grad c: Well phd b: So you 're saying the the sequence would be more like first Adam goes to the contact lists , contacts them via whatever their preferred method is , to see if they want to review the meeting . grad c: Well , to some extent I have to do that anyway because as I said we have to distribute passwords . professor e: There 's there grad c: So , professor e: y but you don't necessarily have to distribute passwords is what I 'm saying . grad c: what I 'm saying is that I can't just email them the password because that 's not secure . professor e: We 're We 're trying i We 're trying to make it less of an obvious just l l l l  fall off a log , to do this . professor e: Right ? So th so what I would see , is that first you contact them and ask them if they would like to review it for to check for the postdoc f: Yeah . professor e: not just for fun , OK ? but to to check this for  things that they 're worried about having said or if they 're willing to just send an approval of it , at from their memory .  and , and we should think carefully actually we should review go through how that 's worded , OK ? Then , if someone  wants to review it , and I know you don't like this , but I 'm offering this as a suggestion , is that is that we then give them a print out . And then if they say that \" I have a potential problem with these things , \" then , you you say \" OK well you might wanna hear this in context to s think if you need that , \" you issue them a password , i in the grad c: But the the problem with what you 're suggesting is it 's not just inconvenient for them , it 's inconvenient for me . professor e: I know you 'd prefer it , but the proble grad c: Yeah . professor e: we have grad c: So I think you 're thinking people are going to arbitrarily start bleeping and I just don't think that 's gonna happen . postdoc f: I 'm also concerned about the spirit of the of the informed consent thing . Cuz I think if they feel that  , it 's I th I th You know , if it turns out that something gets published in this corpus that someone really should have eliminated and didn't detect , then it could have been because of their own negligence that they didn't pursue that next level and get the password and do that , but but they might be able to argue \" oh well it was cumbersome , and I was busy and it was gonna take me too much time to trace it down \" . So I 'm a little bit worried about  , making it harder for them , from the legal standpoint . professor e: Well you can go too far in that direction , and you need to find somewhere between I think , postdoc f: Yeah . grad c: It seems to me that sending them email , saying \" if you have an O - OK reply to this email and say OK , professor e: because  - huh . grad c: If you have a problem with it contact me and I 'll give you a password \" , seems like is a perfectly , reasonable compromise . postdoc f:  we could offer that but but there 's  , another aspect to that and that is that in the informed consent form , my impression is that they that we offered them at the very least that they definitely would have access to the transcript . postdoc f: I don't know that there 's a chance of really skipping that stage .  I I thought that you were Maybe I misinterpreted what you said but it 's professor e: Having access to it doesn't necessarily mean , that having it grad c: Having it . grad c: Well the in professor e: right ? It just means they have the right to have it . grad c: the consent form is right in there if anyone wants to look at it , postdoc f: Alright . grad c: D you want me to grab one ? postdoc f: Sh - sh well I could I 'm closer . grad c: Yeah , but you 're wired postdoc f: I could grad c: aren't you ? postdoc f: Yeah . Yeah ,  I don't wanna fool them , postdoc f: I don't know professor e: I just meant that e every ev any time you say anything to anyone there is in fact a a bias that is presented , postdoc f: Oh yeah yeah oh I know . professor e: right ? grad c: \" If you agree to participate you 'll have the opportunity to have anything ex anything excised , which you would prefer not to have included in the data set . grad c: \" Once a transcript is available we will ask your permission to include the data in the corpus for the r larger research community . grad c: There again you will be allowed to indicate any sections that you 'd prefer to have excised from the database , and they will m be removed both from the transcript and the recording . grad c: Well ,  it The one question is definitely clear with anything as opposed to just what you said . professor e: Yeah ,  no that it tha postdoc f: Tha - that 's true . postdoc f: And it doesn't really say we 'll send it to you , or wi it 'll be available for you on the web , or anything .  like like Morgan was saying they they grad c: They just have to make sure that it is available to them . wh  I think I have an idea that may be sat may satisfy both you and me in this which is , it 's a it we just go over carefully how these notes to people are worded . So I I just want it to be worded in such a way where it gives the strong impre it gives very ,  nothing hidden , v very strongly the bias that we would really like to use all of these data . professor e: That that we really would rather it wasn't a patchwork of things tossed out , postdoc f: Good . But if you really think something is gonna And I don't think there 's anything in the legal aspects that that is hurt by our expressing that bias . professor e: you know you might be right , it may be it was just paranoia on my part ,  but people just See I 'm @ @ worried about this interface so much fun that people start bleeping stuff out just as just because they can . grad c: It 's just a check box next to the text , it 's not any fun at all . professor e: I grad c: All no because it doesn't automatically bleep it at the time . professor e: Oh they won't ? grad c: It just sends me professor e: Oh good . professor e: OK , grad c: And then at some point I 'll incorporate them all and put bleeps .  I don't wanna have t ha do that yet until we actually release the data professor e: Yeah . grad c: because  , then we have to have two copies of every meeting and we 're already short on disk space . grad c: So I I wanna I just keep the times until we actually wanna release the data and then we bleep it . Alright , so I think Yeah so if we have if i Again let 's you know , sort of circulate the the wording on each of these things and get it right , grad c: Well since you seem to feel heart  , strongest about it , would you like to do the first pass ? professor e: but but OK . Turn about is fair play , postdoc f: Al - Also it ther there is this other question , the legal question that that Adam 's raised ,  about whether we need a concrete signature , or email c i suffices or whatever professor e: Sorry . i There 's something down there about \" if you agree to \" professor e: I 'm I 'm I 'm I thought I I thought about it with one of my background processes grad c: I don't think so . professor e: and I  it 's  it 's  , it 's fine to do the email . grad c: Yeah because thi th they 're signing here that they 're agreeing to the paragraph which says \" you 'll be given an opportunity . professor e: And Well and furthermore I it 's now fairly routine in a lot of arrangements that I do with people on contracts and so forth that that  if it 's if it 's that sort of thing where you 're you 're saying  \" OK I agree , we want eighty hours of this person at such - and - such amount , and I agree that 's OK , \"  if it 's a follow up to some other agreement where there was a signature it 's often done in email now grad c: Right . grad c: So I guess I probably should at the minimum , think about how to present it in a printed form . The problem is a lot of them are really short , postdoc f: Well grad c: and so I don't necessarily wanna do one per line . postdoc f: Well I s I also have this I I think it 's nice you have it  , viewab her hearable on the on the web for those who might wonder about  , the non nonverbal side ,  I I agree that our bias should be as as expressed here , and but I I think it 's nice that a person could check . Cuz sometimes you know you the words on a on the page , come out soun sounding different in terms of the social dynamics if they hear it . postdoc f: And I realize we shouldn't emphasize that people you know , shouldn't borrow trouble . What it comes down to but grad c: Yeah I think actually my opinion probably is that the only time someone will need to listen to it is if the transcript is  not good . postdoc f: Oh , you know , or what if there was an error in the transcript that didn't get detected and there was a whole  i segment a against some personal i th grad c: Right . grad c: I think Microsoft is postdoc f: Yeah exactly phd a: Oh , grad c: Sorry transcribers . postdoc f: Or or even or even there was a a line you know about how \"  - mmm - mmm Bill Gates duh - duh - duh - duh . postdoc f: but but it was all the words were all visible , but they didn't end up i some there was a slip in the transcript .  , I I guess we 're assuming that the transcript is a close enough approximation and that that my double checking will be so close to absolutely perfect that it that nothing will slip by . professor e: But it the some something might sometime , and they  if if it 's something that they said , they might i i  , you might be very accurate in putting down what they actually said , postdoc f:   professor e: but , when they hear it , themselves , they may hear something different because they know what they meant . phd b: how do you how do you indicate sarcasm ? postdoc f: Yeah that 's right . So the so i the so we might we might get some feedback from people that such - and - such was , you know , not not really what I said . grad c: So  , in terms of password distribution , I think phone is really the only way to do it , phone and in person . postdoc f: You know I just realized something , which is of e th this question about the  the possible mismatch of  i well , and actually also the lawyer saying that  , we shouldn't really have them have the people believing that they will be cleared by our checks . So it 's like i in a way it 's it 's nice to have the responsibility still on them to listen to the tape and and hear the transcript , to have that be the professor e: Well yeah , but you can't dep  , most people will not wanna take the time to do that , though . professor e: And they they have to postdoc f: So it 's not it 's not  Yeah , good . professor e: But  if you were at a meeting , and and you you don't think , at least , that you said anything funny and the meeting was about , you know , some some funny thing about semantics or something , or  grad c: You probably won't listen to it . postdoc f: It is true that tec that the content is technical , I and so i and we 're not having these discussions which professor e: Yeah . postdoc f: I  , when I listen to these things , I don't find things that are questionable , in other people 's speech or in my own . professor e:  we 're not talking about the energy crisis or something , people have postdoc f: Yeah . Actually , I was gonna Di - Did you have anything n that 's going on , or grad d: Not really .  , my project is going along but  , I 'm really just here to  fill the project  the overall progress . grad c:   professor e: Transcribers , he was rattling the b marbles in his brain back and forth just then this this grad c: Shall we do digits ? professor e: Oh yeah . grad c: oh by the way I did find a bunch grad d: It  grad c: we should count out how many more digits to forms do we have back there ? phd b: There were quite a few . I f I was going through them all and I found actually a lot filed in with them , that were blanks , that no one had actually read . postdoc f: Oh , did you do that ? phd a: Burger King grad c: I 'd like a burger with that , phd b: No I never did "

        "Query": "Which groups were thanked for their efforts and discussed as being heavily impacted?",
        "Summary": "In recognition of their life-saving efforts during the ongoing pandemic, essential workers were thanked, particularly during Paramedic Services Week. Additionally, members voiced their support for various marginalized groups, including advocating for aboriginals facing police brutality, students experiencing disrupted education, indigenous and rural residents lacking internet access, and the Black Lives Matter movement.",
        "Article": "Item 2, then, this morning is an evidence session to scrutinise the Welsh Government's progress in developing the new curriculum for Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Minister for Education; Steve Davies, director of the education directorate; and Claire Bennett, who is deputy director for curriculum and assessment. Thank you all for attending this morning, and thank you for the paper that you provided in advance to the committee. We've got a lot of ground to cover, so if it's okay, we'll go straight into questions. If I can just start by asking you what the main messages are that you've received during the feedback period on the draft curriculum. If I may, I think it's important to understand what the level of that feedback has been. So, there was a concerted effort and a plan drawn up to try and ensure that there was as much engagement, knowledge and opportunity as possible. So, working through the regional consortia, approximately 120 separate events were organised, and we believe that in the region of 6,000 headteachers, teachers, governors and teaching assistants have actually had an opportunity to participate in those events. We also held a number of focus group sessions specifically for young people themselves, so that they could give us their feedback. We'll all be familiar, won't we, with the narrative of, 'Oh, we're sending people out into the world of business without the skills that we as an employer are looking for'. So we thought it was really important to engage business so that they can have their say and their input into the process. And obviously we work very hard on making it as easy as possible via new technology for people to have their say. So, Members, I'm sure, will have been aware of the specific pages on Hwb that outlined the draft curriculum, and we had 275,000 unique visits to the Hwb curriculum pages. It's really interesting to see the breakdown of the areas of learning and experience\u2014which particular AoLEs were the most popular and were being looked at the most\u2014with our creative and performing arts and the creativity and the expressive arts being the most popular. So that's really interesting that people really wanted to engage in the content of that particular AoLE. What, then, have people said to us? Well, I'm really pleased that there has been broad support for the curriculum changes that we are proposing. There's real support for the need for change, because that's the first question, actually; why are we doing this, and why do we need to change? So, support for the need for change, and lots of support for the principle of a purpose-led curriculum. Strong support for greater autonomy and agency for the profession\u2014so, the ability of the profession to take a framework and then truly let them adapt it to meet the needs of the children that they are working with in their communities. In terms of some of the things that people are asking us to look again at, some of that is around some of the language used. Can we clarify, can we simplify in some areas, are there things that are repeated in a variety of AoLEs? Can we use that as an overarching, rather than repeating ourselves? Can we simplify it and clarify some of the language? Also, in some areas\u2014. It's interesting; in some areas people want it simplified and cut down, but in other areas, people say, 'Well actually, in this bit of it, we need a bit more detail, and a bit more depth and clarity'. That process has already started, but considering that this is a massive change, I have been hugely encouraged, actually, by the high levels of engagement and support for the broad principles of what we're doing. Are you able to give the committee any early indication of what level of change you anticipate making to the guidance? kirsty williams am: I think what's really important and what has been the strength of the process to date is that we are not doing this to our profession, we are doing it with our profession. So, in the spirit of co-construction, the reflection on the feedback will continue to be primarily led by the existing infrastructure that we already had that got us to this stage at present.\u00a0So, Members will be aware that we've slightly changed the model. Pioneers were asked if they wanted to continue in that process and to put themselves forward, and we've narrowed that down now to a smaller group of innovative schools. But above and beyond the innovative schools, we looked at individuals who have specific expertise in subject areas, and they're the first part of that process. So, they met last week to begin looking at the feedback, and we'll continue to use the processes that we have to reflect and refine. Opportunities to do things better, explain things better, simplify where possible, where we've been told that that needs to happen, provide greater depth where we've been told that needs to happen\u2014absolutely. We're definitely very alive and very willing to engage in those, but in terms of the overall concept, then no, no significant changes. And what are the steps now before the final curriculum is published in January 2020? kirsty williams am: Okay. We call them\u2014it's not a very nice name\u2014quality improvement practitioners, the QI practitioners. In October, there will be a number of workshops lasting three days at a time where those practitioners will continue that process of feedback with our curriculum and assessment group and all those people involved. By November, we would expect the QI groups to have completed their work and would want them to be in a position to hand over the refinements to an editorial process, and that has to be done in both languages. I think it's really important that we don't do it in English and then we simply translate it into Welsh. It also, then, hands over to the publication team to do all the work on the publication, our website team will then be working on it, and then we would expect final publication in January\u2014am I right, Claire? claire bennett: Yes. sian gwenllian am: You've touched on the point that there's going to be some sort of change, and you've mentioned in your paper to us that further specific aspects of the framework of the curriculum are going to be included in the primary legislation. kirsty williams am: The original proposal that we began working on was, in the legislation, to provide for the four purposes\u2014so, the four purposes would be set out in the legislation\u2014as well as putting in law the areas of learning and experience that you'll all be familiar with. Then, below that, we were going to legislate for a number of the cross-curricular aspects\u2014so, the literacy, the numeracy and the digital competency\u2014as well as some elements where we had already said that we were going to make that statutory, so, for instance, above and beyond what Graham Donaldson would have put in his original reports. I've already made an announcement that I was going to put RSE on the face of the Bill. So, the two main new areas that we are now working on to include within the Bill are to ensure that there is breadth within the curriculum for everybody\u2014. Rather than simply, in law, leaving it at the AoLE level, we'll be bringing it down again to the 'what matters' statements within that, again, providing greater certainty and greater clarity about our expectations at a national level. We'll also be looking to include in the legislation provision for a statutory framework setting out our approach to progression in each of the AoLE areas. So, there has been in the Chamber\u2014I can see Suzy is writing this down\u2014Suzy has asked me questions about, 'How do you create a national expectation around progression?' We've reflected on that and our conversations with other people outside during this process, so we would look to have a statutory framework where our expectations of progression at a national level would be laid out. One of the consistent worries that some people have had, whilst being very supportive of the overall aims, is how do you get that balance between individual autonomy in the school, but also ensure that there is some national expectation and that the variation on these important things is not so great as to cause concern. I set up a process\u2014this was an open process, and we were open to listening to people. So, I think those will be the two main areas where we hadn't originally thought that we would legislate for, but that we will now legislate for. I haven't got the 'what matters'\u00a0statements in front of me\u2014 kirsty williams am: Well, if you remember, we have the four purposes, and then we have the areas of learning and experience, and then, below the areas of learning and experience are the broad concepts that we would expect to be delivered in each of those areas of learning and experience. Some of the feedback that we've had is that\u2014 sian gwenllian am: So, will you be adding to those? kirsty williams am: Adding is not necessarily\u2014no, not adding. But, for instance, the children have given us some interesting feedback about what they feel really matters in those areas of learning and experience. So, they'll be refined, but not added to, and then we will legislate for them, and that hadn't been the original intention. Will they include mental health and well-being? kirsty williams am: Well, the area of learning and experience for well-being is already there, and underneath that area of learning title, there are the broad concepts of what matters, what we believe matters, in that area of learning, and it is that that we will now actually put into the legislation. Sorry, I'm not helping, because I haven't got them with me either to read them out. lynne neagle am: They are in the annex to the paper, Si\u00e2n, and, obviously, mental health is in there. So, just to clarify, then, that would mean that every school would have to teach mental health by law. kirsty williams am: Yes, because the 'what matters' states very clearly the broad concepts in health and well-being. It refers to both physical and mental health, and we intend to legislate to ensure that the 'what matters' statements are a set given in the system. kirsty williams am: Claire, am I explaining it okay? claire bennett: Yes, the 'what matters' are the articulation of the big ideas. So, the idea is to make sure that those are consistent, and then that still leaves huge flexibility underneath as to how to approach those, which particular topics to select in how to actually teach them. But the concept that you might not do one 'what matters'\u2014it was never what was intended. They won't be literally in the Bill, because, obviously, you might want to change the emphasis, so that'll be provided for in subordinate legislation, but the provision will be there, and they will have the status of something that's not optional, basically, for a school. sian gwenllian am: Therefore, it's not going to be on the face of the Bill\u2014the mental health aspect, for example. You're saying that it's subordinate, but then you're saying\u2014 kirsty williams am: So, on the face of the Bill, we will make provision to say that the 'what matters' statements have to be delivered. So the actual wording of the 'what matters' statements will be in secondary legislation; the need to deliver and the requirement, the legal requirement to deliver the 'what matters' statement, will be on the face of the Bill. If I think, if we had sat here 20 years ago, we probably, in a 'what matters' statement on health and well-being, wouldn't have referred to mental health, 20 years ago, because our understanding as a society, our willingness as a society to engage in that\u2014. So, if we had drawn up a 'what matters' statement even a decade ago, I suspect we wouldn't have talked about mental health. So, the concept of having to deliver the 'what matters' statement will be in the primary legislation; the actual wording, because otherwise if you wanted to change it you'd have to go through the entire process\u2014. The actual need and the compulsion, the expectation that you have to do that, will be on the face of the Bill. The point you've made is one that Government has made with other legislation prior to this, but can I just ask you to consider the worthiness, if you like, or the good purpose of actually putting the wording of the 'what matters' statements, the first round of those, in the primary legislation on the basis that they can be amended through affirmative procedure secondary legislation when they need changing in due course? The reason I ask this is just to explain to the population of Wales that there is certainty at the first step, bearing in mind that it will change over the years\u2014I completely accept that. But when you're amending primary legislation, you don't have to go through the whole process again\u2014you can do it via secondary legislation provided the correct powers are put in the primary legislation to do that. kirsty williams am: Yes, as I said, I think we've demonstrated that we're listening to people, that there has been concern expressed about certainty and having a national approach on some of these issues, and we have taken steps to address that and we'll continue to reflect, but, crucially, we'll continue to reflect with our partners who are co-constructing this with us. And I think the important thing to remember is that it's not Ministers or civil servants that are necessarily drawing up these 'what matters' statements, it is practitioners themselves, guided by experts in the field that are not teachers, that have come up with these things. Obviously, the Bill will presumably come to this committee\u2014 kirsty williams am: We're assuming so. sian gwenllian am: Moving on, therefore, to the religious education and relationships and sexuality education, I understand that you've had numerous responses to the White Paper surrounding this particular area. What are the main points that were raised with you and how do you intend to respond to what's been said? kirsty williams am: Well, these two areas certainly have ensured that lots of people have responded. It's interesting that people are far more interested in what we may or may not do about these two subjects than maths, English, Welsh, science, but there we go; I guess it's the nature of the areas that we're talking about. With regard to religious education, we had a significant number of people that have expressed concerns about our approaches towards RE that were set out in the White Paper. There were very mixed views on the inclusion of a range of faiths and world religions included in that area of learning. Many people said that there needed to be a much clearer and stronger\u2014and in some cases exclusive\u2014focus on Christianity, as opposed to including other world religions and, indeed, non-religious views. There were people who thought that RE shouldn't be compulsory at all and therefore our proposals to ensure that RE was compulsory, people objected to that, on the other\u2014. Of those respondents that agreed that RE should be a compulsory part of the curriculum, or were neutral\u2014didn't express an opinion either way, but were neutral on the question\u2014the issues that they were bringing forward were: a need for learners, as they saw it, to be prepared to be part of a diverse and multicultural society. So, they wanted RE to be much more broad-based and encompassing of world views and world religions. They felt that that was an important part of preparing a young person to live in a world that is, as you say, diverse with people of different views living in it. There is certainly a need to modernise RE; some people perceived the current curriculum as a bit old-fashioned. And also there was much feedback on making sure that the profession was ready to deliver a renewed, modernised RE curriculum. So, those are the issues around religious education\u2014 sian gwenllian am: Can I just\u2014? Before you go on to the next section\u2014is there evidence that this was a co-ordinated lobby to present a particular view and what is your response going to be to this? Obviously, there are always going to be lobbies presenting particular viewpoints. Our role, as politicians, is to lead, obviously, isn't it? kirsty williams am: Yes. Claire, would you say that it was a co-ordinated response? claire bennett: It wasn't a campaign in the sense of it being completely consistent, but, certainly, I think people with a particular interest in this issues felt galvanised to respond to the White Paper on this issue\u2014on this one and on relationships and sex education. And your response? kirsty williams am: And my response: well, clearly, Si\u00e2n, I need to consider those responses, and both for RE and RSE, I shall be making a statement in the near future of our intentions on how to respond to these issues. With regard to RSE, the key messages, again, are focused on whether children should be taught RSE at all and that this should not be in the curriculum and it shouldn't be a compulsory part of the curriculum\u2014that this was not an area where the school system and the education system should be involved, and that it should be alone the preserve of parents to teach children about issues around relationships and sexuality education. There were some issues raised about potential challenges with staff in talking about issues that they perhaps personally did not agree with with regard to this curriculum. With regard to guaranteed access to a full curriculum, there were strong views that, again, it should be parents, and parents alone, that made decisions about whether their children should have access to the entirety of the curriculum rather than schools or the state setting those rules. I think if we are to achieve the four purposes, and that's how we have always got to think about it, and if we agree that those are the kind of people and individuals we want leaving our compulsory education system\u2014how do we achieve those purposes? How are they healthy, confident individuals? How are we to prepare our children to be ethical, informed citizens of Wales and the world? So, we will reflect on what has come back to us, but I do believe that these are important aspects of the curriculum, if we are to achieve the four purposes. You've also mentioned that there will be a final draft of the curriculum at the start of next year. What is the timetable for the Bill itself and for seeking Royal Assent for that? kirsty williams am: Okay, so, as I said earlier, the expectation is that we will publish a final version of the curriculum in January 2020, so schools will then have the opportunity to be really engaging in it. I have to say, I'm in schools most weeks, and many, many, many schools are already taking the opportunity, even on the draft, to begin to think about planning and, indeed, changing what they're doing in schools. I'm overwhelmed, actually, by the enthusiasm of the sector to embrace what is a massive change for them. sian gwenllian am: \u2014actually implemented in September\u2014 kirsty williams am: In 2022. kirsty williams am: And I think what's really important is that we get the actual curriculum out in January itself, because that's the bit that schools are really concerned about, and then we will have the process here to underpin it. We've got some questions now on potential unintended consequences, and other matters relating to that, from Hefin David. hefin david am: Can I ask what value you place on the work done by the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods and the presentation so far and the paper to be presented by Dr Nigel Newton? kirsty williams am: I always\u2014and Welsh Government are big supporters of WISERD and the work that they do, and, in fact, we need more research into Welsh education, not less. I think what's really important in perhaps this piece of work is to say that I hope that, in the time where I've had an influence to influence over Welsh education, either as a backbencher or now as a Minister, equality and principles of equity have always driven what I've tried to achieve. And I would never undertake a policy reform that I thought would lead to less equity in the Welsh education system. Closing the attainment gap is a core element of the national mission for education in Wales and we would not proceed with anything that we thought could lead to an exacerbation of an achievement gap. And how do you respond, then\u2014? , it's a balanced paper, it looks at pros and cons and there's a mixed picture from it. How do you respond to the specific statement that Dr Nigel Newton said that the curriculum could exacerbate segregation within schools between different groups of pupils? kirsty williams am: Well, I think what the paper acknowledges is that there is no evidence that that will happen. These are 'coulds' and 'maybes' and things that we need, as a Government, to take into consideration as we plan this journey. There can't be any empirical research done at the moment because the curriculum isn't being delivered, but I understand, and we need listen to\u2014. If there are concerns out there in the field that these are unintended consequences that we may fall into\u2014that is the value of that piece of research that helps inform us. I have to say, though, the curriculum in itself is neither going to necessarily on its own hugely enhance equity nor detract from equity, in the sense that the curriculum is what's taught in our schools. There is an opportunity, I believe, that empowering teachers to be able to be more flexible in what they teach their children actually gives us an opportunity to deliver lessons that could be much more engaging and much more relevant to some of our schoolchildren than what they have at the moment. What will make the curriculum a success for all of our children, and I believe will have a bigger impact on children who are in danger of being left behind, are the four enabling purposes of the curriculum. So, the curriculum on its own can play a part, but it will only be as good as the four enabling elements that surround it. And that is strong leadership of our schools that ensures that there is no segregation, that has high expectation of all of our children, and delivers a curriculum within that setting that meets the needs of the children there. In the end, no education system, whatever its curriculum, can exceed the quality of the people who stand in front of our children day in, day out. So, the curriculum can be the most exciting, wonderful\u2014and I think it is exciting and I think it's wonderful\u2014it can be the most exciting, wonderful thing in the world, but if teachers can't teach it effectively, if their pedagogy is not excellent, then the content itself\u2014it won't work. So, how do you assess how children are doing in your new curriculum? How do you understand how that pupil, who has, you know\u2014who could be vulnerable for a whole host of reasons, usually reasons outside of the school\u2014? That pupil is vulnerable. How can you assess how that pupil is and move their learning along in an appropriate fashion? And then, finally, the well-being of the child. But what we know is that we cannot expect children to learn unless we address issues around their well-being. There's been lots and lots of research done, not in a Welsh context but in other systems, where children are kept behind for a year. So, good achievement leads to good well-being, but good well-being also leads to good achievement, and you can't separate the two. It is the four enabling objectives that sit around it, and we have to be cognisant of the WISERD's research, of course we do, to ensure that, as we're doing our professional learning, as we're planning well-being for our children, as we think about assessment methods and how we develop a culture of strong leaders in our schools\u2014and we have some, we have many, but we need to do more to support them\u2014it is that that will make the biggest difference, not just the content of the curriculum on its own. Although I do believe the flexibility that we're allowing people will, I think, lead to a curriculum and more meaningful lessons for some children in schools who are in danger of disengaging because they don't understand why they're being asked to learn what they're learning, they don't see the relevance of what they're learning to what they may want to do or how their lives are, or they don't see themselves reflected. So, for some of our communities, they don't see themselves reflected in the curriculum that we're teaching at the moment. And, again, international research would suggest that, if you want a child to thrive, they have to see themselves and their community reflected in what they're learning in schools. hefin david am: What the WISERD research suggests is that the senior management teams\u2014the management teams\u2014would certainly buy into what you've just said, but the classroom teachers would be a little bit more sceptical. kirsty williams am: As I said, classroom teachers are absolutely crucial to this, which is why, first of all, we've taken the difficult step to delay the implementation of the curriculum to give us the time that we need to make sure that it's not just school leaders but it is individual classroom practitioners who have the skills that they need to make the most of the opportunity that the curriculum allows them. hefin david am: So, if we look at some of the statements that were in the presentation by WISERD at the seminar two comments jump out: 'We'll end up'\u2014this is from classroom teachers\u2014 'We'll end up with a different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.' and 'there will be no consistency'. And consistency is the one I'd particularly like to focus on: 'there will be no consistency across all schools in how the new curriculum is delivered which could affect outcomes'. kirsty williams am: Well, first of all, we've just talked, haven't we, about trying to ensure that there is greater consistency and that's why we're changing our approach to the legislation around the Bill. So, in terms of progression steps, there will be a statutory framework to ensure that progression is the same wherever you are in Wales. So, as I said, we're using this report, we're using this feedback, to inform decisions going forward. hefin david am: Yes: 'different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.' kirsty williams am: Okay. So, as always, in education, teachers\u2014understandably, because this is the regime that they have been a part of\u2014immediately don't think about their pedagogy, they think about, 'How are judgments going to be made upon me as an individual?' And what we're trying to do is ensure that we are developing another accountability regime that is indeed in line with the purposes of the curriculum and doesn't work against the purposes of the curriculum. They spend a lot of time thinking about accountability and how they're going to be held accountable for their practice, but, again, what we want to do is provide reassurance that we are devising an accountability regime for our system that is in line with the purposes of the curriculum and puts us in line with the mainstream thought and reform process across the world of progressive education systems. hefin david am: It was the segregation bit I was particularly interested in and the response with regard to disadvantaged pupils and pupils of lower attainment. I do not believe that any changes\u2014and I would not pursue any changes that\u2014would lead to a segregation. And with regard to the connection between Welsh Government and local government and the concerns that the Welsh Local Government Association and the Association of Directors of Education Wales raised, what progress\u00a0has been made on bridging the gap between\u2014? Whether it's a perception gap or a practice gap, what progress has been made on that? kirsty williams am: Well, I think the last time we had this conversation in the committee I said that I think the comments that the WLGA and ADEW had made were reflective of an old piece of work and were not current and up to date, and I think progress had been made in that time, and I'm pleased to report the significant progress that's been made\u2014 hefin david am: Bridges have been built. But we've got renewed, energetic engagement from the WLGA and ADEW in all the arrangements that we have for the development of the curriculum and my understanding is that they have said publicly and in writing that they're very supportive of what's going on. hefin david am: I'm sure they're watching and nodding vigorously now on Senedd.tv. kirsty williams am: And I will be with them tomorrow night and Friday morning and I'm sure if they've got any other views they'll let me know. hefin david am: And the final question: there is a process, a model for this, which is Scotland. What kind of lessons are being learned from the introduction of their curriculum? kirsty williams am: Okay. So, I think the first thing to realise is that our curriculum is not a copycat of the Scottish curriculum, but it is always useful to reflect on how other systems have undertaken curriculum reform in their nation and to learn from any issues that have arisen. So, I think it's fair to say\u2014and I spent time with some delegates from Scotland just this weekend at the Atlantic Rim Collaboratory conference that Wales hosted this year. Unfortunately, Minister Swinney was not able to attend at the very last minute because of Brexit preparedness work that he was involved in, but certainly their teaching union and their equivalent of the EWC in Scotland joined us as well as representatives from the Scottish Government, although not John himself, and they were very frank about some of the challenges that they had faced in introducing their curriculum. Professional learning, ensuring that the profession was properly prepared for the changes, I think they would agree that that wasn't necessarily\u2014. Well, they've got local authorities and regions, but whether they were truly engaged in what they were doing. Although our curriculum isn't a copycat, as I said, we have been able to learn from, and we've had people who have been deeply involved in the Scottish experience as part of some of our curriculum and assessment groups and some of the advice that we've had in terms of developing coherence. steve davies: As I said, they're very forthright in sharing their learning and I think one of the critical elements was the extent to which assessment was considered at the outset alongside the curriculum content. So, that was critical, but we've embraced experts who were involved in that process who were part of our curriculum assessment group. So, they feed in throughout\u2014not 'don't do this because Scotland has done it', but they feed some of that learning into the system. As the Minister said, we had seven other countries from across the world giving us feedback and input over four days as to where we can continue to look at what we're doing but also checks and balances against some of their experiences with this area of reform. kirsty williams am: The particular focus of this year's conference was on the issue of assessment and we were joined by colleagues from Scotland, from Ireland, from Iceland, from Finland, from Saskatchewan, from Nova Scotia and from Uruguay. hefin david am: When did that take place? kirsty williams am: Where? hefin david am: When. You've got a whole section on assessment, I don't know\u2014 suzy davies am: This isn't about assessment. suzy davies am: So, on the basis that this is not about assessment, you mentioned that one of the lessons learned from Scotland is that they said they spent too much time on curriculum content rather than assessment. Can you tell me a little bit about what you've learned about how they quality control the content, even though the content, of course, will be completely different in Wales? kirsty williams am: Yes, the content would be completely different. When I said they spent too much time, I said that the focus had been in their work about just talking about content and, actually, the assessment arrangements were bolted on at the end of the process. So, the curriculum was all designed and developed, it was sent out to schools, and then the question was raised: 'Oh, actually, what assessment methods\u2014? How are going to assess how children are getting on?' But, Steve, you would have more details of their exact experience of quality control of the content\u2014 suzy davies am: Of the content, because every school is going to be very different at this. steve davies: In terms of developing the guidance and the curriculum going out in January is concerned, I think\u2014again, I don't want to be overly critical, but one of the findings was that they encouraged schools to go forth and multiply in terms of the materials and ideas and concepts that were coming through. What we learnt was to actually\u2014the pioneer movement was to get a smaller group to develop those materials and look to engage through cluster groups. So, we had pioneers who worked with clusters to test the development of that concept before we were looking for schools to go away and develop a larger amount of content. So, in terms of the staging and measuring of bringing together the curriculum and the associated guidance, I think the time we've taken to actually get there and the strategy of using pioneer schools, external experts, back to pioneer schools, back to regions, or engaging regions in that, has been more measured and planned against a planned timescale, where everyone from the outset\u2014with the exception of the extension of the one year\u2014was clear on when we were going to be producing materials that would allow the profession to then take it and use it. Claire, do you want to add to that, or\u2014? claire bennett: I think, as we move forward, that kind of cluster approach remains really important. So, it's, as schools then think about, 'What am I going to do in my school?', that they're doing that in clusters together. When colleagues from the regional consortia were sharing their thinking with the curriculum assessment group last week, they were talking about the very specific and differentiated, I suppose, professional learning support that they would be offering to schools that have already done quite a lot of thinking and are quite far down this journey and then the kind of different sorts of approaches they would offer schools that are just starting out. Their emphasis was very much on this peer-to-peer sharing and support, so people aren't just going off in isolation. So, there'll continue to be a focus for each area of learning and experience, bringing together the professional learning and the ongoing curriculum development, bringing together practitioners and experts and colleagues across the middle tier to give a bit of strategic direction and to be able to identify if there are areas where more support is needed. So, I think that a huge amount of thinking, particularly in the regions, has gone on into the practical support that can be given to schools, not just in engaging with the curriculum now, but then how they take it and think about then developing it in their schools. You don't start in 2022\u2014people are already doing it and there's a lot of thought going into how to support continued sharing through the next two years. kirsty williams am: And I think that's another difference, you see\u2014that strong middle tier and the role that the middle tier is playing in Wales, which was absent in Scotland. So, this ability to work in networks to provide support to a network of schools, that wasn't available in the Scottish system and I think that makes\u2014I think that helps us in the way that they just simply didn't have a structure that allowed them to do that. It's not a criticism of them; it's just that we have got a structure that we can utilise to do that support so that schools are not completely left on their own and they can be working with other schools, with their regional consortia, going forward. suzy davies am: Can I just have a quick\u2014? lynne neagle am: Very quickly, because I want to move on to implementation. Was one of the things that Scotland did\u2014I don't want to use the word 'assess'\u2014to monitor the pupil response to the curriculum as one of the means of deciding whether curricula in particular schools were working well enough? kirsty williams am: I don't know if they\u2014. I don't know if they did, but one of the interesting things that we were reflecting on over the weekend is that, certainly some of the Canadian systems, in particular, which we were interested in, used pupil surveys as part of their accountability regime\u2014so, actually taking the time to ask students how they felt, not just about the content of the new curriculum, but actually how they felt their school was doing. And so we're interested in looking, as I said, at some of the practices that other countries use to include pupil voice to find out what's happening. They found that particular useful and successful, and we're keen to see if we could do something similar. You touched on this briefly in response to some questions from Hefin David earlier on, but I'm just interested to know how the money that you announced for supporting teachers for the preparation of the implementation, how that's actually been used. What specifically have teachers been doing to prepare for its implementation? I know you've set aside about \u00a324 million over two years. kirsty williams am: You're right, first of all, it's not an insignificant amount; it's the largest investment in professional learning since the history of devolution. So, you're right that it is not insignificant, and it was a hard-won resource, I can tell you, from my colleagues. Because, as I said earlier, the curriculum itself can be amazing, but if our teachers and our professionals are not equipped to deliver it, then all this change will be for nothing. That money is being made available to each and every school and has empowered headteachers to really think, 'What are the professional needs of my school and the practitioners in my school?' Because, as we've just heard from Claire, there are some schools that have been part of the pioneer process from the very beginning and therefore are further along that development chain. There are other schools that maybe are only beginning now, now that it's published, to be really engaging with the curriculum. kirsty williams am: There is a national element to it, but we've given the money to individual schools and individual headteachers because I have no way of knowing how each individual practitioner is ready or how much additional support they're going to need. But we have worked with the National Academy for Educational Leadership to put together a programme for headteachers, and that's national. The regional consortia are working together to provide consistency for classroom teachers and teaching assistants, and then the next stage of that development is for subject specifics. Claire referred to the AoLE networks, and there's an opportunity then for people to engage in that. So, this September is the start of our new ITE courses, taught for the first time, and that's great. So, we're looking at developing potentially a stronger set of support, again on a national basis, for those who are newly qualified, beginning their teaching career, because I don't think we've done that on a consistently good level across the country. We're also working with the regions to revisit and improve their coaching and mentoring schemes that they have across the system. We're also involved in\u2014and I'm sure the committee has heard about it, so forgive me if I'm going over old ground\u2014schools as learning organisations and the OECD work to support schools to develop that culture as a learning organisation. We know from very successful education systems in other parts of the world there is a strong, strong culture of self-evaluation as a first step in their school improvement system, and we've not been very good at that in Wales, we've not been strong at that, that's not the culture that we have had. We've kind of depended on a culture where a school does its thing and then somebody comes along and tells you whether you're good or bad, rather than the school really thinking itself deeply about, 'What are we doing well and what do we need to improve on?' So, the schools as learning organisations are an important part, again, so that money is being used for schools participating in that programme with support from the OECD. And the money that you announced for this\u00a0\u00a0professional development preparation, if you like, was for two years. So, there's going to clearly be an ongoing programme of preparation development and personal development, as well as anything else. But is there likely to be any more money allocated specifically beyond the two years that you've already allocated or is that going to be a question and negotiation with your colleagues? Or do you see what you've put in as being, 'This is what we need to develop or to prepare for the implementation. The rest would be what would be normal professional development beyond that'? kirsty williams am: The money that was agreed was for a two-year period and, clearly, I continue to have conversations with the Minister for Finance and the First Minister around future allocations for professional learning, and I'm sure this committee and, indeed, members of this committee could help me in that task. Can you tell us a bit about the innovation schools\u2014the 16 innovation schools\u2014and how you've made your decisions about who they might be, across which sectors, in primary, secondary and so on? So, basically, how they were selected and what you're expecting of them. So, all of our schools that had previously been pioneers were invited to apply to morph into the next phase, which is innovation schools, and they were asked to apply and there was a discussion held both internally within Welsh Government and with the consortia about which schools were best placed to be able to do that role and to continue to work with us, going forward. I think one of the lessons learned, and this was said in the committee, was that there was an upside to having pioneer schools, but there was a downside to having pioneer schools, and I think, at this stage of the game, we need to move away from that model and to really get the message to everybody that they all had to be pioneers now\u2014everybody had to be a pioneer\u2014because this is coming down the track and we don't want anybody just sitting there waiting until September 2022 and saying, 'Oh, gosh. So, the move away is partly to engender within the sector the fact that we've all got to engage in this now. The innovation schools have led to a very specific piece of work as we do the final refinement, and their main role is working with us on these final refinements to the content but also to the assessment issues and accountability issues. It was important that we engaged with the regions to get their view, and we've had evaluation being carried out\u2014 claire bennett: Yes. So, during the first term of work, we asked them to really look at the curriculum as a whole\u2014so, take the whole curriculum guidance and then think, 'How would I apply that in the school?, Does it make sense?, Can we work with it?, What are the issues?, What are the questions that arise for us for assessment?', and each of the schools produced a report setting out their reflections on, 'If I were putting this into practice\u2014'. So, it's slightly different to the feedback we've had from other people, which has been more, 'Maybe you should emphasise this or change that wording' and kind of quite practical, and really about how you would realise this curriculum in a school. That's been drawn together into an overall report, drawing out the themes, by Wavehill, who are a kind of research company. Having 16 headteachers in a room talking about how they see this curriculum and the way in which they would practically engage with it has been invaluable, in just making us think, even with all the practitioners that have been involved, 'How do we make this work for schools?', given that we've got schools and headteachers really engaging in the detail of how they would use it practically. So, it's been invaluable, and they're continuing on that work now this term to keep making sure that what we're doing is something that schools can actually realise practically. kirsty williams am: If you think of the pioneer model, pioneers were looking at specific aspects of the curriculum. So, you might have been a pioneer school because you had particular strengths in health and well-being, or you might have been a pioneer schools because you were particularly looking at professional learning needs to support the curriculum. This is about, at this stage, where we have a high degree of certainty about what it's going to look like, 'Actually, how do I as a school practically implement this in the round?', and the schools were chosen because of their ability to do that. But also we did need a mix of sector\u2014secondary, primary\u2014but also linguistically, to just try to make sure that this works in all the different types of schools we've got. So, just trying the practical implementation now, now that we know exactly\u2014not exactly\u2014 but we have a good idea what it's actually going to look like, so, 'How am I going to go about doing this?' lynne neagle am: Okay. If I could ask as well, maybe you could provide the committee with a list of the new innovation schools. sian gwenllian am: Are you confident that every school across Wales is participating in this process of change now, because the danger is, in getting these pioneer schools\u2014? I understand that they are discussing in clusters, and so on, but can you put your hand on your heart and say that every school is participating in this project now? steve davies: I can't tell you that, absolutely, 100 per cent are definitely, totally, absolutely equally involved. The structure we've got in place across the regions is working with schools on their readiness to actually\u2014not readiness to engage\u2014start to deliver as we move through to the future. And we don't have a roll-call against all schools, but we require them, or request of them that they keep us informed of the networks. Every school is part of a network that links to it, and they gauge (1) the level of activity in it, (2) the outcomes of that work, because each of the networks, each of the clusters, produces work that the region brings together. What I would say, and it touches on the point you raised earlier and in relation to Scotland, I think if we had 22 units of local authorities trying to do this, it would be incredibly complex and very difficult to deliver. dawn bowden am: I just wanted to clarify, because in your paper you talk about giving \u00a330,000 to each, or to the innovation schools. Was that \u00a330,000 each, or \u00a330,000 for the project? kirsty williams am: Each school that participates in the innovation schools programme gets \u00a330,000. My final question in this section is just about how we are going to deal with the issue of teachers who are not trained in Wales. So, teachers trained in England apply for jobs in Wales, but they obviously haven't been trained in the new curriculum. Well, you're right\u2014we will continue to have a system where teachers trained in Wales will teach in England and teachers trained in England or who have worked in England will come across the border, as well as teachers from other parts of the world coming to teach in our schools. Indeed, when I'm feeling at my most confident and bullish about these issues, I think Wales will be a really attractive place to be a teacher because of the autonomy that we will be giving to our professionals, as well as an exciting new curriculum. So, I think, actually, potentially, we will have people coming across the border to teach here because it'll be a great place to be a professional. So, our programmes of study are already different and that does not preclude anybody from coming across to teach in our system from a different system. Clearly, there may be pedagogical concepts in the new curriculum that perhaps somebody who had trained in a different system would not be completely au fait with, but that is the ongoing role of professional learning within our school system, because we've just talked about the two years' worth of money; in an ideal world, if I was able to make long-term plans, I think there will be an ongoing, and there should always be an ongoing, provision for professional learning in our classrooms. And this shouldn't just be about just getting people ready for the curriculum and then taking away professional learning budgets. One of the ways in which I think we can attract teachers to Wales is to send a very clear message\u2014 and actually attract people into the profession and keep them in the profession, wherever they train\u2014that you will have a career in teaching where you will be continually supported in your practice via professional learning. dawn bowden am: So, you'll still be recruiting on the basis of skills and adaptability and so on. We've got a lot of issues to cover, so I'm going to appeal for concise questions, concise answers. What was the feedback like with regard to the draft assessment proposals? lynne neagle am: Excellent, concise question. We received what I would describe as positive feedback regarding the emphasis placed on ongoing assessment that is there to support children's learning and progression. Key messages were perhaps to find a better way of expressing the purposes of assessment\u2014we refer to a formative and summative assessment\u2014and just being a bit clearer about what that actually means and being clear about definitions around it. suzy davies am: Obviously, we're all aware now of the distinction between assessment of pupils for their own progression and the evaluation of how a school does at certain points in its life cycle as well. Presumably, the way you're looking at this is to keep these items completely separate, and that evaluation and assessment proposals will be\u2014. They're out in a separate document; their results are going to be coming forward in a separate document\u2014is that right? There's a thick black line between these two concepts. I think some of the trouble that we've got ourselves in previously is because there has not been a clear distinction between assessment and accountability, and, when you start using assessment for accountability purposes, that's when, potentially, that assessment process gets corrupted and you have gaming. suzy davies am: Can I ask, with the assessments, though, which is about pupil progression, will those results be published internally? Will parents get to see those? kirsty williams am: Oh, yes. The primary purpose for assessment is for that professional to be able to know how to move that child's educational journey on, and you would absolutely expect professionals to have those conversations with parents, whether they're using formative methods of assessment or summative methods of assessment. So, absolutely, you would expect teachers to be sharing information around assessment methods, whichever type they use, with parents, to describe and to inform parents about what happens next for their child. Is it realistic, then, to expect parents, families, communities, not to think about that information when they're drawing conclusions about the school, notwithstanding that formal evaluation of those schools is going to be done completely separately? kirsty williams am: Well, of course, parents will always be interested in how the overall institution is doing. But the conversations I have with parents, and I certainly feel this myself as a parent\u2014I'm interested in how my child is doing, how my child is getting on in school, what are the issues that that child has, and, more importantly, what is the school going to do about it? So, if my child is struggling for whatever reason, what is the school going to do about that to help that child? If my child happens to be exceptionally able and talented, how are you as a school going to make the most of my child's talents and move them on to fulfil their potential? So, undoubtedly, I can't control assumptions that parents will make, but it is absolutely clear in this system, and my intention is, that teachers should share assessment methods and outcomes with parents to have that conversation about what happens next. But I am absolutely clear that we do have to make this distinction between assessment for learning and an accountability in the system, otherwise we drive\u2014inadvertently; people don't set out to do it, but we drive a set of behaviours that has negative unintended outcomes. So, how\u2014? Can you just briefly give us an indication of how you think the accountability, on both sides of that thick black line\u2014the methodology\u2014is likely to change with this? You mentioned that there's going to be an independent review of performance measurements coming shortly; we know that some of the existing ones have been ditched in fairly recent legislation. Without pre-empting the findings of such a review, have you got your top three likely expected changes? kirsty williams am: To accountability? suzy davies am: Yes. Well, we're moving to a system of schools as learning organisations, and a greater emphasis on self-evaluation, with external verification of that by Estyn, our inspectors. suzy davies am: And that will be reflected in the school categorisation system as well\u2014will those indicators change, do you think? kirsty williams am: Well, categorisation\u2014again, the purpose for categorisation is not to make a judgment on a school in the sense of a league table; it's a triage process, categorisation. kirsty williams am: Well, this is the issue, isn't it? This is the problem of designing a system where there are perfectly good reasons to introduce the system\u2014and in this case it's a triage system to identify levels of support for a school. And categorisation was never intended to be a way of expressing a league table of school performances; it's there to identify levels of support that a school can expect from its regional consortia. Now, we have, we have\u2014we will continue to keep categorisation, but, since coming into office, we have tried to adapt categorisation simply away from pure data to a more formative assessment process, and categorisation will continue to evolve. And the first level of accountability in that system has to be the professionalism of an individual member of staff\u2014the moral purpose that I bring to my classroom today to do right by the children that are in front of me. That's the first part of our accountability regime\u2014the moral purpose our professionals bring to their work. Well, just finally on that, there may be an argument, then, for scrapping categorisation, putting something else in place. But I suppose the core question is: how are the general public going to understand all those things that you've just mentioned about the teachers being able to teach, the leaders being able to lead, and how well a school is performing against KPIs on those measures? kirsty williams am: Well, because we will still\u2014. kirsty williams am: Yes, that's the ultimate, isn't it? So, the ultimate is\u2014. The ultimate system that we're going to get to and the ultimate arbiter and the part of the system that provides public assurance and public confidence ultimately ends in Estyn. Because I get the point of the end point being Estyn, and that's where the public assurance will be seen, but what about the public assurance at those early steps of the teaching standards and the leadership standards? Where will we see those demonstrated? kirsty williams am: Well, you would expect to see those demonstrated in the self-evaluation that a school will provide of itself, and then Estyn\u2014 suzy davies am: All right, so schools will be publishing self-evaluations annually, or something like that? kirsty williams am: Yes, schools\u2014 steve davies: The outcome of the self-evaluation is a school development plan. steve davies: We expect a series of priorities for a school to set itself as a result of prioritisation. What we're looking at, in terms of what's brought to that, is not a narrow set of measures\u2014just two measures, or one measure in a secondary school. The measures will still consider reflection on progress of children, but it'll also have reviews of mental health, well-being, how it approaches that and things that it wanted to do. The school is evaluating\u2014the outcome of that will be a development plan, annually published on the website. kirsty williams am: And the schools' ability\u2014whether they do that well or whether they don't do it well\u2014will be judged by Estyn. lynne neagle am: Okay, as my colleague Chair Dai Lloyd would say, 'Now we're into the needing serious agility territory'. Firstly from me: Qualifications Wales have told us that the curriculum must define qualifications rather than the other way around. What implications does that have for the amount of time that is needed to develop qualifications that are properly aligned with the new curriculum? kirsty williams am: Well, I'd absolutely agree with Qualifications Wales. The qualifications have to arise out of the curriculum, and the qualifications should not be dictating the curriculum. Qualifications Wales, which I met with yesterday, I think\u2014yes, yesterday; it seems a long time ago\u2014will begin their national conversation about reform of qualifications as a result of curriculum reform in November. How is awareness and understanding of human rights, including children\u2019s rights, being embedded in the new curriculum? kirsty williams am: Children's rights, human rights\u2014they've been key considerations throughout the design, and this is currently set out in overarching guidance and we continue to work with the children's commissioner's office to map the rights of the child across each area of learning and experience. And I'm delighted that the children's commissioner took the time to write to me during the feedback phase to say that they were very pleased that their initial assessment demonstrates that what we're proposing is a big step forward. And how do you respond to the concerns expressed in the children's commissioner\u2019s quarterly report of July 2019 that consultation materials for young people were not released until mid June, allowing just over a month for young people to engage? And they said it was disappointing that a plan was not in place at the start of the consultation period. kirsty williams am: Well, we undertook a specific programme of engagement with children and young people, as I said at the beginning. We had over 20 events where focus groups of young children were involved and we had a number of children who took the opportunity to feed back via different mechanisms. The output of that engagement and feedback has been drawn together into a report exploring learners' views about schools and learning. It's a powerful contribution and I think will actually effect change, especially in how the 'what matters' statements are worded. sian gwenllian am: Turning to the Welsh dimension in the new curriculum, the Learned Society of Wales has said that there needs to be a directory of resources to implement that Welsh dimension. Do you agree with that and will you be publishing such a resource? kirsty williams am: We have a separate programme of work that is looking at resources that are needed to support the curriculum. It's one of the conversations I had with Qualifications Wales yesterday to try to avoid the debacle that we've had previously, where we have new qualifications and the resources to support those qualifications aren't available. So, we're already having those conversations with Qualifications Wales and there is a piece of work that is ongoing to look at what are the resources that are necessary to support the curriculum. And, in terms of the single continuum of learning with regard to the Welsh language, how are progression steps and achievement outcomes in Welsh-medium schools going to work and how are they going to work in English-medium schools? kirsty williams am: Okay. Just on the Welsh dimension, I think it's really important that whatever resources we have to support the Welsh dimension are really, really, really broad and not confined to specific areas. I was in Swansea University just this week, looking at some of their Technocamp work that they're doing to help us with coding, and we had an amazing conversation about the Welsh contribution to the computing industry. And so my expectation is that that isn't taught in a history lesson\u2014that, actually, when children are learning about coding, they get to hear that Welsh people have been at the forefront of developing this technology. When I talk about a Welsh dimension,  right the way across the curriculum, and I think that's important. The continuum for language will have to be contextualised depending on the setting where a child is being taught. We have to recognise that, and there will be progression points on that continuum that will be there to show progression both in Welsh language and in the English language, and they have to be contextualised. We recognise that children learning Welsh in a Welsh-medium school, their progressional on that point would be more speedy and quicker, and by the end of primary school they would be in a very different position than a child that was learning Welsh in an English-medium school. Vice versa\u2014we've had this discussion before\u2014if a child is going into Welsh medium, their progression in English perhaps from age three to seven would be very different from a child that was in an English-medium school, although the expectation would be that by 11 they would be in the same position. So, we have to contextualise that learning continuum depending on the medium of tuition with the school, but recognising that it is a progression. sian gwenllian am: With regard to the creative thinking element of PISA, I take it that you are adhering to the fact that the Welsh Government is opting out of the creative thinking tests with regard to PISA 2020. I don't entirely understand that because the new curriculum does place great emphasis on creative thinking and independent thinking. So, why not participate in these tests? kirsty williams am: Because, for me, the key factor for making that decision, and I intend to stick to it, is in 2021 we will be expecting schools to be right in the middle of their preparation for the introduction of the new curriculum\u2014 sian gwenllian am: Okay, so it's the timing. sian gwenllian am: So, later on, maybe when this is embedded\u2014 kirsty williams am: I think there could well be a different decision at a later date, but at 2021 this is not the right time to do it. Can I just say? In terms of creativity, Wales is seen as an exemplar by the OECD, especially our partnership with the Arts Council of Wales and creative learning through the arts. That's why I don't understand why we're not actually going for it and showing how good we are through the PISA. kirsty williams am: There could well be a different decision, but for 2021 we're asking enough of people at the moment and this would be an unnecessary addition to cope with. I just don't think that that should be seen as us running away from it because we're worried about a lack of creativity in our education system. We are seen as exemplars by the OECD\u00a0and some of the work that's been going on with creative learning through the schools is now being shared internationally. sian gwenllian am: So, you'll think about it for the next round of PISA. kirsty williams am: Oh gosh, that shows that Si\u00e2n thinks that I'll be here to make that decision. Countries were offered if they wished to take the invite to come into it, and a number of countries across the world are yet to make their decision on this. janet finch-saunders am: Can you give a guarantee that all children and young people, where appropriate, will take part in physical activity under the new curriculum for Wales? Also, how much time per week will the Government expect children and young people to spend undertaking physical activity? kirsty williams am: Yes, all children will be given that opportunity, because if they are not then that school would be in breach of the expectations that will be set out in statute. janet finch-saunders am: How will you monitor it? kirsty williams am: Again, Janet, I don't go around monitoring schools now. As we've just said\u2014 janet finch-saunders am: How will you ensure that every child has that opportunity? kirsty williams am: Well, as we've just said, ultimately, we are not getting rid of our school improvement services and regional consortia, nor are we getting rid of Estyn. So, one would expect the quality of the curriculum to be a key consideration of any visit that Estyn would make to a school. To what extent will the new curriculum allow for the continuity of the way that the foundation phase is taught? Will there be any significant differences and have the early years professionals been involved in the development of the curriculum to date? kirsty williams am: Yes, early years professionals have been involved in the curriculum to date. One of the advantages, I think, of the new curriculum is to take the pedagogical principles that underpin our approach to early years education actually further into children's educational journey. We have a certain pedagogical approach until the age of seven, and then all of a sudden, at seven, it's like, 'Forget all of that now. Sit down, pick up your pen and do this.' That's been really uncomfortable for many practitioners in our primary sector. So, actually, yes, statutory and non-statutory provision have been involved in the development of the curriculum because, of course, some of this is going to be delivered in the non-statutory sector. I'm very welcoming and supportive of that, but those pedagogical principles will now be available throughout that child's educational journey, rather than the false divide we've got at the moment. suzy davies am: So, aside from the purposes and the AoLEs, the type of teaching is unlikely to change in the foundation phase settings. The other end of the scale now: you report that one of the themes of the feedback from further education has been the need to ensure that the transition to post-16 education is supported so that the systems don't just clash against each other. How are you working on the sector at the moment to make sure that there's a decent dovetail? kirsty williams am: Okay. We don't want to do anything in pre-16 that stops people going on to be successful in post-16, whichever route the child or young person decides to take. FE have been involved in every single AoLE and they're a part of the curriculum and assessment group. And then in the conversations we had yesterday with Qualifications Wales around what qualifications will look like, I was very keen to take the opportunity to emphasise that any changes to qualifications should be a gateway to further study in FE, whichever type of route the child took. suzy davies am: And you're confident they're geared up to accepting young people who have been educated in this way. sian gwenllian am: I think you actually answered this at the beginning, but just to confirm that you're carrying on with the same governance set-up, the different groups that you've got, and there's nothing being added there or taken away. And just finally from me, then, on pupil referral units: what arrangements will be in place to ensure that they can benefit from the new curriculum and how is that going to be reflected in the legislation? kirsty williams am: Okay. So, we've been taking advice from Brett Pugh, who chairs the education otherwise than at school improvement group, and this has been an area where we've had to think really, really, really, really, really hard. So, what we intend to do for EOTAS and PRU is to set a minimum of what we would expect a child to receive. So, that would be around the four purposes; that would be around the cross-cutting themes of literacy, numeracy and digital competency and health and well-being. After that, then there needs to be a discussion and a focus on what is in the best interests of that particular pupil. One of the things we know about sometimes in EOTAS is we have very able and talented students who don't get access to the range of qualifications and courses that they have the capability and the aptitude to do. We also have to consider, though, that for some children they may be out of school for reasons, and telling them that they've got to do a full curriculum may be hugely detrimental to their mental health and well-being. So, for instance, to give an example, you could have a child who's very ill, and saying to them, 'You have to carry the full load of a curriculum' could be inappropriate. So, we'll be setting a minimum standard, as I said, around the purposes, around the cross-cutting themes and health and well-being, and then there will be an expectation that in conjunction with the child and the family an appropriate addition would be put in place to meet the needs of that child, recognising that they could have very different needs. Is that clear? lynne neagle am: Well, yes, and it's something that we'll probably look to build on when we look at our inquiry on EOTAS, which is coming up. So, can I thank you for attending and thank your officials for coming today? As usual, we will send you a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you again, all of you, for your attendance this morning. As Members will see, there are a substantial number of papers to note\u201423 in total, which are in a supplementary pack. As there are so many, can I suggest that we note them all together and then we've got an opportunity to return to some of them in the private session afterwards? Is that okay with everybody? Okay. Can I propose in accordance with Standing Order 17.42 that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content?<doc-sep>Can I welcome Members to the virtual meeting of the Children, Young People and Education Committee this afternoon? In accordance with Standing Order 34.19, I've determined that the public are excluded from the committee's meeting, in order to protect public health. In accordance with Standing Order 34.21, notice of this decision was included in the agenda for this meeting, which was published last Thursday. This meeting is, however, being broadcast live on Senedd.tv, with all participants joining via video-conference. Aside from the procedural adaptation related to conducting proceedings remotely, all other Standing Order requirements for committees remain in place. Can I remind everyone that the microphones will be controlled centrally, so there's no need to turn them on and off individually? We've received apologies for absence from Hefin David AM, and there is no substitution. Can I just note for the record that if for any reason I drop out of the meeting, the committee has agreed that Dawn Bowden AM will temporarily chair while I try to rejoin? Moving on, then, to item 2 this afternoon, which is an evidence session with the Welsh Government in relation to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on health and social services as they relate to children and young people in Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Vaughan Gething AM, the Minister for Health and Social Services; Julie Morgan AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services; Albert Heaney, deputy director general of the health and social services group; Nicola Edwards, deputy director, childcare, play and early years; Jean White, chief nursing officer; and Tracey Breheny, who is deputy director of mental health, substance misuse and vulnerable groups. We've got lots of questions that we'd like to cover, which we'll go straight into, with questions from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian. How much do we understand about how this virus impacts children and young people, and their role in transmitting the virus? And how important is it that this is considered in the Welsh Government's exit strategy, especially in the context of reopening schools? vaughan gething am: Okay. I think it's fair to say that our understanding is developing across all age ranges about the virus and its impact. It's still the case that children and young people are less likely to be affected significantly by COVID-19 than people with a range of healthcare conditions, and in particular the age grade that we've seen, and that's underpinned the advice we've given to the whole population about self-isolation by people in age categories, as well as the extremely vulnerable group we advise to shield. We still don't understand everything about the role that children have to play in the transmitting of the virus, and this is one of the difficulties we face. Because in cold and flu, children transmit the virus and they're also susceptible, in particular to the flu, as well; that's why we have a childhood immunisation programme for the flu as well. We do know that there's some developing evidence about what's called a Kawasaki-like syndrome, but that's affecting very small numbers of children. We have one possible case in Wales\u2014a child who's in critical care\u2014but that isn't confirmed. But the generals still apply\u2014that children are less likely to be affected than older people, but can nevertheless still become unwell, and that's, if you like, one of the few positives in this condition. But as I say, we're still learning, so I won't try and present a fully accurate or finalised picture of knowledge in this area. sian gwenllian am: And in terms\u2014[Inaudible.] vaughan gething am: Chair. Sorry\u2014with apologies to the Member, my translation stopped after a while, so I heard the first part translated, and then it just fell off. I'm really sorry, but I didn't want to try to answer a different question to the one that may be being asked, and don't think that's fair to the Member or other members of the committee. lynne neagle am: Can we check that translation is back on, please, and maybe Si\u00e2n could repeat her question? vaughan gething am: I can hear it, yes. lynne neagle am: Okay, Si\u00e2n, would you mind repeating that, please? sian gwenllian am: Not at all. I was discussing NHS services, including critical care services, and I was asking whether there is sufficient capacity in place to manage any increase. We, of course, hope that there won't be any increase, but should there be an increase, particularly in paediatric cases of coronavirus\u2014let's say such a thing were to happen and this rare syndrome that you mentioned did emerge here in Wales\u2014do we have the capacity in place to deal with these, and with the impact of coronavirus more generally on children? vaughan gething am: At this point in time, the answer is 'yes', and there is always a significant caveat, though, and the 'but' that comes in there is that despite the fact that we've got a plan for surge capacity in paediatric care\u2014. So, when we increased critical care right across the national health service, we of course looked at paediatric care as part of that as well. But the challenge in all of that this is\u2014it's part of my caution and the Government's caution about moves out of lockdown. So, it's much easier to go into lockdown than to come out of it, and I know you heard evidence from the Minister for Education last week about the approach that she wants to take and the principles behind doing that. So, actually, we'll need to think carefully about if we are reopening schools, even on a limited basis, what that then does to the circulation of coronavirus within that group of children as well as within the wider community, and then to try to understand whether the current capacity we have planned for in surge capacity is still going to be enough, because, actually, one of the real success stories of the first stage of the fight with coronavirus is that we haven't had our critical care capacity filled up. It's been extended, and the extension has meant that we haven't been overtopped.\u00a0If we hadn't done that, we definitely would have been. And we'll need to carry on testing ourselves and seeing what's happening and looking at the evidence and making sure that the plan we already have got that we published for paediatric critical care is still fit for purpose, and again to reconsider if we need to do things differently. But that's part of the difficulty of being a Minister at the moment\u2014you don't know everything that's coming, and on this disease in particular, we do know that we're still learning with each passing day. lynne neagle am: [Inaudible.]\u2014Si\u00e2n? sian gwenllian am: Hello. Right, we'll move on now then to some question on access to health services from Dawn Bowden. Minister, just some concern that you will have heard about in terms of parents and carers maybe not taking their children into the healthcare system for other conditions while the coronavirus pandemic is with us. How are you monitoring that situation at the moment and have you had to look at your own commutation strategy in relation to that? vaughan gething am: We've had to look at some specifics around communication, so challenges about not just different languages, but about how we get messages to people in a very different environment, and it's really challenging. We've had to think about the way it works, and I had this conversation earlier this week with the chief nurse. I understand people's fear and anxiety, but that then means that their family, and in particular their child, isn't getting the sort of proactive care that we would want them to have. So, there's a real concern both at the professional leadership end and for the chief nurse and for Ministers as well about how we can get through. That's actually about rebuilding people's confidence in the service, and that isn't straightforward because there's a broader concern about coronavirus still circulating. But I think for us it's really important to reiterate that we have thought again about how to provide the service. We've thought about how to protect staff and families and the very clear message to parents is to please make sure that when health and care professionals are calling to help and support your family, please discuss your concerns with them. There are times you need to be physically in the same place, for example on routine vaccinations, because we certainly haven't stopped that programme either, and I really wouldn't want to see that one of the unintended consequences of what we've done is that if parents don't engage with that service, we could potentially see a rise in other diseases. We're all, I think\u2014not just you\u00a0in your constituency, but others who are on this call and\u00a0others as well\u2014seeing an occasional reappearance of measles, and that's because people didn't engage with the vaccination programme. I don't want, either myself or a different health Minister in the future, to be sat here talking about how in years to come the failure to engage in a vaccination programme has led to clearly avoidable but significant harm to children and young people and the communities they live in. So, I approached the immunisation lead in Public Health Wales to see exactly what has been happening recently and they said at the very beginning of the outbreak parents were very reluctant about coming forward for their routine immunisations, but recently, through lots of energy from the immunisation clinics and the leads within it reaching out to families, that trend seems to have turned and there's now a much better attendance. One of the most important things we can do to protect our children is to make sure they have their vaccinations. So, yes, there was a bit of a downturn, but it does seem to be improving at the moment. We're going to go on now to some questions about mental health from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian. sian gwenllian am: It's a cause of great concern to us all, of course, in terms of the impact of this crisis on mental health and well-being among our children and young people. So, what assessment has the Government undertaken of the impact on these aspects in young people and what work is being done to understand the impact of the pandemic? What longer term measures will be put in place and what support services will be put in place? vaughan gething am: Again, I think it's helpful that you've already heard from the education Minister last week, because I think the first of her key principles for returning to school is the impact on the emotional health and well-being of children. So, children's mental health was a central concern and remains so for both myself and the education Minister. Part of the honest challenge, again, is that we don't fully understand the impact on the mental health and well-being of children but we do expect there will have been an impact. So, we're working together with both health boards and our own knowledge and analytical services across the Government to both try to further understand what that is and the difference. Until we have more contact with families, we may not fully understand that, and that's a real point of concern for me. In all of the unknowns within this, the impact on mental health and well-being is absolutely one of them, because we're looking at how we then develop not just a recovery plan for the economy but a recovery plan around mental health, how we support people, and that will have to be informed by the understanding of what's happening when we get more engagement with families about the level of need, and then how we need to think about that. Obviously, it's a key factor for their return to school, but, actually, for the life children and young people lead outside the school environment, and that will be difficult because we're going to phase out of lockdown\u2014it's not going to be a one-hit measure. We're going to be looking at, at each point, what difference has been made, what more we can do. And, again, there are the efforts we're making to make sure that our online support services and our telephone support services\u2014that we keep on reminding people that they're there and are available, and we want people to make use of them, because I know, as this committee said, we'd much rather be able to support people and intervene earlier rather than wait until there's a much bigger problem in a period of months in the future. sian gwenllian am: So, in reality, there's been no assessment undertaken because it's difficult to do that. So, the full picture in terms of the outcomes of the crisis\u2014you don't know what they are at the moment as things stand. vaughan gething am: We can't know, because we don't have that level of contact. I wouldn't say that no work's being done, but I couldn't tell you honestly that that work is finalised and we have a definitive understanding of the picture. If I tried to say that, then I'm sure you'd ask me, 'How on earth can you say that? If you're not having regular contact with people, you can't possibly understand the picture.' And it's much better to say, 'We don't understand the full picture. We're working alongside health boards and others, but we'll know more as we carry on having more contact with families.' I'll look at a variety of different areas, again, both to reform the recovery plan, but also then to understand what we need to do at various points in the future, and the picture that we're seeing isn't straightforward and we need to make sure that we don't try to pretend to ourselves or to the public that there is a one-off measure that will allow us to be successful in all the areas that we'd want to be. sian gwenllian am: But can you give the committee an assurance today that this area of mental health and well-being is going to be a priority for you as health Minister? vaughan gething am: Of course. Not just on the work we've done in the past; not just because it's one of the key principles for the education Minister about the reopening of schools, but it is a real worry list for me about how we understand the impact on the mental health and well-being of children and young people, and to move forwards, that we don't end up with an entire generation of children and young people who grow up with a range of damage because we haven't thought about what that will look like. In amongst all the other priorities I have, I'm certainly not going to allow the mental health and well-being of children and young people to be forgotten. sian gwenllian am: And how does the current capacity in terms of child and adolescent mental health services compare to service capacity prior to the coronavirus outbreak in Wales? Have you had to shift some resources over from CAMHS, for example, in order to deal with more general aspects of coronavirus? vaughan gething am: No, we've actually got\u2014. Maybe perhaps it might be helpful, Chair, if Tracey Breheny could say something about the way that we're monitoring the impact we have, in terms of we've got a reporting tool, but also weekly contact with leads in CAMHS services. Yes, on that question, we moved pretty quickly at the beginning of the pandemic phase to put in place, as the Minister said, a weekly monitoring tool of all local health boards, so through that tool, we look at that every week in terms of collecting information. Whilst national reporting's been stood down, we are picking up assurance through that tool on things like staff sickness in CAMHS services, referral numbers and so on, so we do have that tool in place, and at the moment, that's telling us that the system can meet the capacity; has the capacity to meet need. sian gwenllian am: Have CAMHS staff been shifted over to do other work during this virus outbreak? tracey breheny: There has been some movement, as I'm saying, around health boards, particularly where in the first phase of the epidemic the concentration was on in-patient provision, providing critical care, but my understanding is from the latest tool that we looked at last week, those staff are gradually not just returning to work from self-isolation or whatever, or from different parts of the system. sian gwenllian am: And then, what about the capacity for CAMHS primary mental health services? Has there been a reduction in that capacity since the beginning of the pandemic in terms of in-patients? Because that's what I'm hearing, that there has been such a reduction, but how are those patients then treated and served? tracey breheny: In terms of in-patient capacity, that is in the system in both the north Wales and in the south Wales unit at the moment. There were some discharges of young people, but we've had the assurance that that was only undertaken where it was clinically safe to do so and where the community support was in place. sian gwenllian am: And finally in this section from me, given that schools are of course closed and that schools are so very important in terms of signposting young people towards services, how can young people access appropriate services\u2014online services, for example? How are they signposted towards those services at the moment? vaughan gething am: Well, we've not closed off general practice and, as you know, we've expanded the ability for people to access services in an online manner. We've expanded a range of telephone advice services, so the telephone advice service we already provide, we've made sure that's maintained, and both myself and the deputy Minister have referred to that on a number of occasions. I think the real struggle and the real difficulty is actually how you punch through different messages when the broader news agenda is so overwhelmingly focused on headline messages in other areas. That is, again, a worry for me, but the communications we have within the health and care system, people should know where to refer people to and how to provide access to both telephone and online support that continues to be available, and actually, as I say, we've expanded that right across our healthcare system. Whatever the post-COVID-19 world is, I don't want to miss out on the progress we have made in the online provision of services. Of course, most children and young people expect to be able to access services in an online manner already. sian gwenllian am: But, of course, there will be some who are missed; they may fall between two stools because they won\u2019t know where to turn. vaughan gething am: Yes, and that, again, comes back to our challenge of how we help children and young people in their context, with their families, to know where support and advice and guidance is. Many people are defaulting to their general practitioner if they can't find advice somewhere else, so that's why there's the information we're providing through general practice to signpost people, so those pathways haven\u2019t been closed off. It's about making sure that people have alternative means that they\u2019re prepared to use at this point in time. If we go back to where we started this evidence session, we were talking about the difficulty of families who don't want to engage in a traditional person-to-person contact or being in the same room as someone else or allowing people into their home. So, there's a real challenge about how we make the service available, but then encourage people to take it up, so that we don\u2019t see much greater harm that we have to try and resolve at a later point. I've got a supplementary from Suzy Davies, and can I remind Ministers about concise answers, please? Suzy. Just as we're speaking about children and young people's mental health, I wonder if you can confirm whether you've seen the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child's reports about what they call the grave physical and psychological effect on children and young people, and whether the operational guidance you've given out is responding to that in any way, or maybe there was something in that that you hadn\u2019t thought of and you can respond to as we go along. vaughan gething am: I, personally, haven't read that advice, but the Government's already concerned about the direct physical and mental health impact of lockdown restrictions. You don't need to be a parent to recognise that that\u2019s a potential issue for children and young people. I haven't read it, but that's been signposted, so I can check with officials if they have and if that would change the advice and the position that we're already adopting, because we do regularly look at a range of advice from a range of sources, including the UN, the World Health Organization and others. But, as you know, Minister, the prevention of young suicide is a cause that is very close to my heart. Can I ask what assessment the Welsh Government has made of an increase in suicide amongst children and young people during this pandemic and because of this pandemic? vaughan gething am: Apart from the general concern that I've expressed on mental health generally, we are already investigating, we're having a\u2014. We've commissioned, through the Government, the delivery unit to work with the national advisory group, including Dr Ann John and other people, to review the current, unexpected deaths during the start of the pandemic here in Wales, because we want to try to understand the wider concerns about the potential effects of the restrictions on the mental health and well-being of children and young people, and if that is leading to a spike in suicide or not. So, that's why we've commissioned that review to be carried out with the current numbers of unexpected deaths that we have, so we're able then to provide a report to understand where we are. My understanding is that we should have a report on that review before the end of this month and, obviously, I know the committee\u2019s got an interest, so if it's helpful we can write to you once we've had a chance to receive the report and to look at it. In terms of provision of crisis care, then, how has that been impacted by the pandemic? Are those crisis services available for children and young people who need them at the moment? vaughan gething am: Yes, they continue to be available. We've made clear that mental health services, including those for children and young people, are essential services to be provided. We have built up those crisis care services over a period of time, and the last thing we want to see is to see them disappear during this period of time when there are well-understood concerns about emotional and mental health. Moving on to perinatal mental health, this morning I hosted a round-table with the NSPCC where we heard about lots of good practice that's going on in terms of supporting new mothers and their families in this period, but I wonder if you can tell the committee what you are doing as a Government to make sure that there is consistent perinatal support for all women across Wales in what is a difficult time for any new mother, let alone in a pandemic. We've also been looking at how that's provided on a phone or online basis where possible, because again the same concerns exist about physical contact with people. So, we're looking to make sure that the progress isn't lost that we've made. And again, part of the challenge in all of this is about the pause or the interruption in work to create the in-patient capacity that I've previously committed to. So, I want to understand what that really means, but again the problem is, at this point in the pandemic, I can't give you an answer about what that means for that in-patient provision. We're still committed to it, but I'm concerned about the time frame\u2014that is partly about the length and the extent. But again, I'm really impressed by the continuing commitment of our staff to deliver this service for women in what is a particularly uncertain time. It's difficult enough in terms of the challenge in terms of perinatal mental health in normal times, about people being prepared to come forward and then receiving the sort of response they'd want, and even more so now. lynne neagle am: Is the Welsh Government aware that there's apparently been a decrease in the numbers of women being willing to look at mother and baby unit provision, and will you be taking that into account in your planning? Because, obviously, we wouldn't want people to think that was because of a lack of need; it's down to fear and the lockdown. vaughan gething am: Yes, we're aware there's been a reduction in people wanting to make use of the service\u2014or being prepared to make use of the service is probably a better phrase\u2014because we know that's the same with a range of other areas. There aren't fewer people having strokes than there were at this period of time last year; the reason why the figures are different is the way that people are behaving because of their concerns about coronavirus. So, I certainly wouldn't be using this period of time to plan for the need that exists for a facility that we want to create. Obviously, we have the detail of the third sector resilience fund and the\u2014there are two funds, aren't there, for third sector organisations? But can you give us some indication of how much of that support is being targeted to children and young people, and perhaps you can specifically mention how much of the \u00a36.3 million for hospices is for children's hospices? I don't mind who answers that one. Certainly, I'm sure the committee is aware, as Suzy has said, of the funds that are available for third sector services. The Deputy Minister and the Chief Whip, of course, announced on 6 April the \u00a324 million Welsh Government third sector COVID-19 response fund, and that of course is more than we would have had as a result of consequentials from the UK Government. They can also benefit from the \u00a3400 million economic resilience fund, but I am aware that some groups don't benefit from that and they may not qualify for that. So, we've also got third sector support being delivered by WCVA, such as the voluntary services emergency fund, which supports volunteering, and the third sector resilience fund, supporting organisations to stay afloat. We are working very closely with the third sector on issues such as support for fostering services, care leavers and repurposing funding so that they can support the crises. Voices from Care Cymru has developed a specific offer for care leavers, and the Fostering Network provides extended helplines. And, actually, about 50 per cent of contact with Childline at the moment is to do with COVID-19. The NSPCC UK helpline have also reported a decrease in calls resulting in a referral to children's social services at the start of the lockdown period, but, since then, the numbers have actually risen. Meic, Action for Children, and, of course, Voices From Care Cymru have come up with their own specific package. In terms of the actual percentage that is being spent on children, I can't give you an actual figure for that, but, certainly, there are a whole range of projects that are there helping children. vaughan gething am: It's about \u00a31.5 million from the \u00a36.3 million that's gone to T\u0177 Gobaith and T\u0177 Hafan, Suzy. Perhaps if you could ask the Deputy Minister, when she's in a position to do so, to let us have a note. Before we finish on this point, could I ask the Deputy Minister, again, about whether any of the things you've been talking about now is additional money, because, obviously, you mentioned yourself one of these funds is \u00a324 million. So, again, if you don't have the answer to hand, perhaps you could send us a note in due course about how much extra is going in. I think most of those things I mentioned are things that are already there, and the \u00a324 million is for support and extra help. dawn bowden am: Thank you, Chair, and thank you, Deputy Minister, because one of the questions I was going to ask was around some of the work that you've been doing with the third sector on safeguarding and child protection, and I think you've covered that. But what I'm particularly keen to find out is how you're monitoring the impact of coronavirus on child protection and safeguarding in the round. I know the health Minister raised this as a concern in Plenary only recently, and it's really how we are monitoring it, what concerns have been identified, and how we're going to start to tackle some of those. Obviously, it is difficult to monitor if there's not easy access to the children that we're referring to, and that's why we have been trying to encourage the vulnerable children to go into school or childcare settings. The Minister, the director of education and the director of social services sent out a joint letter recently to all the local authorities, asking them to try to encourage the vulnerable children and the families to get the children to go to school. In fact, we've now got 890 vulnerable children attending school settings, and that's the highest number that we've had at all since the opening of the scheme. But, of course, there are a lot of children who are not attending school and the social services are not necessarily seeing. Those numbers are now beginning to go up, but there certainly was a significant drop, which is a great deal of concern. One local authority, in fact, reported a drop of 27 per cent in terms of safeguarding referrals compared to this time last year. So, I issued a written statement on 1 May, setting out the work taken forward under our cross-departmental vulnerable children, young people and safeguarding work stream, and encouraging people to report any safeguarding concerns there are. Because, obviously, we are dependent on the public authorities\u2014you know, schools and health services\u2014to report any concerns, and at the moment, obviously, they're not there to report them. So, we have made this public appeal for everyone to look out for each other, and I was very interested in what Si\u00e2n Gwenllian told me about what was being done in Anglesey in terms of sending out a message via social media to get people to look and listen, and to raise their concerns, because, obviously, safeguarding is the concern of everybody in the community. But I think that we are reassured in terms of our contact with the local authorities that they are, in fact, keeping close touch, as far as they possibly can, with all the children that are vulnerable. For those where it is very critical, face-to-face contact is still taking place, and there are imaginative ways of trying to keep in touch with all the other children and families. So, it is a difficult situation and we are concerned about it, but I think as much as possible is being done. professor jean white: Just to add to what the Deputy Minister was saying, the health visiting service has not been stopped or stepped back. It has consolidated some of the ways that it does the Healthy Child Wales Programme, but, for those families that are identified as having particular need or have children that are particularly vulnerable, all the normal contacts have been maintained, so they're not unseen to the normal health visiting service. dawn bowden am: Thank you, Jean, for that, and, Deputy Minister, would there be any value at this point in actually revisiting the current Welsh Government definition and guidance around vulnerable children, in terms of who we identify as vulnerable? Because this opens up a whole new group of children that are not necessarily known to services but can still be vulnerable. Do you think that needs revisiting at all? julie morgan am: The definition of vulnerable children and young people includes those with a social worker and with statements of special educational needs, and the most vulnerable of these should be prioritised. But we have now looked at this again, and we've set out an expanded definition, and we intend to publish that this week. This does include discretion for local authorities to have some flexibility and to be able to offer a place for those who may be on the edge of receiving care and support if they are known to be vulnerable by the school or by family support services. Because, obviously, the children that we know about, we know about, but there are those other children who may be on the edge of care\u2014the children that we've been trying very hard, as part of our policies in the Welsh Government, to keep with their families, with a lot of support. So, we are giving discretion to the local authorities in order to have a degree of flexibility, and that will be published this week. We're going to move on now, then, to talk about looked-after children and children on the edge of care, with questions from Janet Finch-Saunders. Can you set out the impact the coronavirus emergency has had on the care system, including edge-of-care services, and where have there been areas of concern? julie morgan am: Well, local authorities have obviously had to change their working practices in response to the COVID emergency, so a red-amber-green rating\u00a0risk assessment was adopted by all local authorities at the start of the pandemic to ensure that vulnerable children and families receive the right way of receiving services and the frequency of contact from the services. This is being dealt with on a case-by-case basis, so every case that is known is being RAG rated and services are being linked to that. I can't speak too highly, really, about the amount of support and mutual work that has been going on. We've been assured that there have been no significant increases in the numbers of looked-after children, and the number of placement breaks are minimal. The other interesting good point is the children services workforce remains at 90 per cent plus, and, obviously, that is a great testimony to the dedication of the workforce. The children are all being monitored individually, and I think in the circumstances we're all doing what we possibly can. I know that Albert Heaney is able, probably, to respond in more detail to the contacts, if you'd like to have that. How is Welsh Government ensuring that vulnerable children have access to the necessary technology to maintain contact with their social workers and other support workers and networks? julie morgan am: It is normal practice to ensure that children and families do have appropriate access to technology to keep in touch with social workers, so that is part of our normal practice. We're very keen as a Welsh Government that no children are left behind in their education during this period. So, last month, as you will know, the Minister for Education announced \u00a33 million of funding to help digitally excluded learners so that they've got access to the internet, so that they can fully participate in online learning. Can you set out the picture regarding children's residential care? What are the challenges these care settings are facing, and have any children's homes closed? julie morgan am: Residential children's homes are not really reporting any particularly difficult issues, and certainly they have been able to resolve any issues that have happened. We obviously expect all children in residential care to be supported, and to keep contact with their families and with their siblings, and that is going on, although it may be by technology rather than face to face. We know that some young people have found the social distancing a challenge, and I think it\u2019s easy for us to understand that they have found that quite difficult. So, there have been a few issues related to that, but, where that has happened, local authorities have been able to resolve that on a case-by-case basis, and really there are not any major issues. There are fewer children and young people there, so, in fact, there's been an opportunity to give a great deal of attention to the children, and I think we've had very good reports about how that has happened. I also meet with the children's commissioner once a week, who is an independent source, and she said when I met her last week, 'Well, as far as we know, it's all good news'. Moving on to foster care, how is Welsh Government working with local authorities to meet the challenges set out by the Association of Fostering and Adoption Cymru and its fostering guidelines? julie morgan am: We have worked with the fostering organisations. We have had close communications with them, and we've supported AFA Cymru to develop guidance for foster carers, and that guidance has been very strongly welcomed across the sector. I think I mentioned before specific issues such as support for fostering services and, of course, care leavers. The Fostering Network has extended its helpline hours, and, of course, Voices from Care\u2014I mentioned them before\u2014have developed this particular offer of support for care leavers. I've been reassured, as well, from Voices from Care that the young people appear to be more stable now\u2014that they have contact with. janet finch-saunders am: So, the final point on that, then: the Fostering Network and others, as you know, have called for foster parents who can temporarily no longer foster due to the current virus emergency to be paid a retainer, with all foster carers receiving extra financial support for additional expenses. What is your position on this, please? julie morgan am: Well, we haven't had any specific representations from local authorities asking for support for foster carers, but some local authorities have paid retainers and some people, I believe, have increased the amount of money that they are paying. They've also given support for various activities and things\u2014have helped sometimes, I think, with broadband access and that sort of issue. And, obviously, foster carers who do require additional support should be approaching their local authorities or the independent fostering agency. The Minister has indicated that we are speaking weekly with heads of children's services, and we do now have a data collection that's been implemented to capture the critical data in relation to the children's services. I just wanted to have a quick answer from probably the Minister, I think, about the primary legislation and the regulations that followed, about which children's rights impact assessments have been done. Have any been done, and can they be shared with the committee if they have? Sorry, Deputy Minister\u2014my mistake. julie morgan am: Well, it's been a very difficult time, as you appreciate, in terms of having to make legislation very quickly, and it hasn't been possible to do the impact assessments that we would normally do. And this is to try to get from children their views of what's happened, what we've been doing, and their views on the whole COVID-19 situation. So, we're doing this in conjunction with the children's commissioner and with Young Wales and with the Youth Parliament. So, this is an online survey that we hope will be going out to thousands of children, and we will get their response in terms of what are the important issues that have arisen for them, what they feel about what's happened during this period, what they feel about the way that we've dealt with the schools, the way that they've had to cope in not going school and being at home for so long. So, I'm very pleased that we're doing that, but, in terms of an impact assessment, it has been very difficult, as I'm sure you can imagine, to be able to do those at these times. Just to say for the committee, really importantly, that we haven't introduced any easements in relation to children's services legislation. So, from a Welsh context, the standards that are in place do remain, so therefore there wouldn't have been a necessity for us to do a children's rights impact assessment in relation to the primary legislation. I think that's particularly a strong point to us in Wales, both in terms of safeguarding arrangements, but also ensuring that children's rights are protected at a crucial time. In terms of childcare and education, we're obviously looking at the provisions under the coronavirus Act to allow us to maybe ease some of the statutory requirements, and we are going to be undertaking a full suite of impact assessments on those. Obviously, the coronavirus Act itself was UK Government legislation and they ran their own impact assessments, but, in terms of how we implement it in the childcare and education space\u2014and I think Albert was just saying the same thing\u2014we definitely will be looking at those impacts in terms of going forward. Well, just to come back on that then, are you saying to me that, as a result of the various coronavirus regulations that we've had, no assessments for children's needs have been postponed, cancelled or done very quickly online rather than in person? julie morgan am: Well, I think, as Albert said, that there was no relaxation of regulation for children's social care. There's no relaxation, but what's happening in practice? We're down on staff across all our councils and in our third sectors\u2014who's doing the children's needs assessments, particularly for young carers? julie morgan am: Well, I\u2014. Albert, can you answer that? albert heaney: I think the first thing to say to the committee is that, going back, we took a very strong line at the beginning that we weren't going to introduce easements in requirements to children's social services. Of course, through the way that practitioners and social work practitioners have to operate, they are having to operate through a different time. So, assessments are still taking place for child protection and safeguarding concerns; assessments are still taking place, and especially in relation to\u2014as you mentioned\u2014young carers, to support their needs. So, arrangements\u2014[Inaudible.] But they're having to be slightly differently done\u2014so, some of the technology, and keeping in contact and keeping those visits. So, we've used, for example, the St David's Day fund to make sure that care leavers are well supported in terms of having contact and are accessible and able to engage as well. So, we're having to be a little bit more\u2014and social services departments are having to be a little bit more\u2014innovative in the use of technology in the way that they've engaged as well. But personal visits are taking place, and visits especially, as the Minister mentioned earlier on\u2014they actually individually assess each case to determine the frequency of visits, to make sure that those contacts are maintained with children at a critical time. I don't want to take this much further, but personal visits and social distancing could be slightly problematic. Have they been accepted by Government, and is it those that are driving the agenda of the task and finish group that you announced the other day, Deputy Minister? julie morgan am: Well, those will certainly be considered by the task and finish group. I've had a letter from the Carers Trust about those issues, and we are setting up this group, as you know, and we will be looking at those issues in the group. Any steal on when that might report? julie morgan am: I don't have that at the moment. Can I just say, we are running short of time? We did start late, so, if the Ministers are happy, we'll carry on until 2.10 p.m.\u20143.10 p.m.\u2014if that's okay. sian gwenllian am: [Inaudible.] lynne neagle am: Hold on a sec, Si\u00e2n, we've lost translation again. sian gwenllian am: You will know, Deputy Minister\u2014because we have discussed this in private session\u2014my major concerns with regard to the childcare sector, and what kind of childcare sector we will have at the end of this crisis, as families start to return to the workplace. There are still some childcare providers who are falling between the cracks and aren't receiving financial support. Do you agree\u2014are there people who are still not being supported, and why isn't the Welsh Government able to provide that support for everyone in the childcare sector? julie morgan am: Thank you, Si\u00e2n, for that question. Basically, we are aware that there are some sectors in the childcare sector that do fall through some of the loops. So, that is guaranteed to them, and they are able to take advantage of the Government's job retainer scheme, but that does mean that there is a problem, as I think we've discussed before, of the double funding issue, and that is something that we have been trying to resolve and there have been discussions with the Treasury in Whitehall about ways forward on this. I'm going to ask Nicola to come in in a minute, because she's much more up to date with the discussions about that, but, so far, I don't think very much progress has been made on that. But we are looking to see if there are any other ways that we can get help to the childcare sector, and I'm actually following this meeting with a meeting with the Deputy Minister for equality and chief whip, who is responsible for the voluntary sector, because obviously many of the groups that we're talking about would come under the voluntary sector, because they have voluntary committees, but they fall between many stools, because they rent premises rather than own premises and they don't have high turnovers that would qualify them for some of these grants. So, some childcare settings can access funding under the small business rate relief scheme, but certainly not all of them; some of them can access funding under the economic resilience fund, and, as the Deputy Minister said, we're following up for some of them to be able to access funding under the third sector resilience funding. All of the childcare settings can apply for the UK Government's coronavirus job retention scheme, but there are some complications around that in that it's a salary-based scheme and you can't claim two types of public funding for the same individual member of staff. So, if you were using funding under the childcare offer to pay for a particular member of staff's salary, you can't access CJRS and furlough that individual with Government money as well, and that has led to some confusion and complication about how that balances, which we're trying to work through with the sector and with local authorities around the rules and regulations that the Treasury and HMRC have put in place around that. Some of those are less attractive to some childcare settings, but they are still available and Business Wales is offering support and advice for settings on how they can help weather this storm and support their workers as best they can. We're also having some conversations now with our economy colleagues and with Business Wales about what happens next, the recovery and the return of the sector, and we've just come out of a meeting with the childcare sector around the support they think they would need to have in place to be able to return from this as well. sian gwenllian am: I'm sure you can share my concerns and the concerns of Cwlwm, which represents the childcare sector and the nursery school sector, that there are a number of providers that aren't receiving support at all and are likely to collapse as a result of this. What I can't understand is why you, in collaboration with the Minister for the economy, Ken Skates, can't devise a specific grant package for the providers that aren't currently receiving support, or we'll be facing a situation that is very difficult when people are seeking childcare for their children and those settings won't be available to them. Why isn't it possible to have a bespoke scheme for those that are falling between the cracks in this sector? julie morgan am: Well, that is what we're looking to see\u2014if we can get a bespoke scheme. I absolutely agree with you: it is absolutely vital that we keep this sector going, because it is a fragile sector in any case, and I think about 50 per cent of the childcare settings have temporarily closed down and the reason they've given for closing down is because they haven't had enough children to make it viable to keep their settings going. They are heavily reliant on the fees that parents pay and, of course, with the social distancing and the lockdown, this has meant that we've had to discourage children from attending. So, that means the number of children they've had has been much reduced and it hasn't been viable for them to keep going, although obviously it's great that about half have stayed open so we have somewhere for the children of the critical workers and the vulnerable children to go. But, I absolutely agree with what you're saying, Si\u00e2n, and we are looking for a solution, because we know it's vital not only for the children and their parents, but for the economy as well, that we do have that sector there, surviving after this is all over. So, I can assure you, we're working very hard, and I think Nicola's working day and night to try to achieve this. sian gwenllian am: And just finally from me, I'm very pleased that you are working on this, and I very much hope that we will see a support package that will reach everyone in the sector, because it's been weeks now since all of this started, and if there's still no light at the end of the tunnel for some of them, then that needs to be dealt with. But just to conclude, how effective has the provision been in general over this period in terms of providing support for key workers? julie morgan am: I think it's been crucial, because how would the majority of the key workers have been able to get to work and do all the wonderful things that they've been doing if it hadn't been for childcare for those who need it? And we were very pleased to introduce the coronavirus childcare assistance scheme, which means that critical workers and families with vulnerable children are able to have free access to childcare aged 0 to 5, and I believe that we are the only country in the UK that is providing that free service to the vulnerable children, and so\u2014. , that scheme has only really taken off now since Easter, so we don't have any particular statistics. nicola edwards: I do have some early numbers, if you'd like me to announce them? julie morgan am: Yes, that would be very good. In terms of the provision in schools, we're looking at around 4,000 children a day in schools at the moment. In terms of the children accessing the coronavirus childcare assistance scheme, it has only been two weeks up and running really, so the numbers are quite low, but there were nearly 1,500 children accessing that childcare last week, and of those, just over 100 would fall within the definition of vulnerable children. So, it is picking up there; it was 900 children the week before that, so we are seeing some traction now that parents are aware that that support is there. And, can I just ask, in terms of the other vulnerable children, what assurance can you give that all the vulnerable children who need to keep in contact with social workers and other key workers are being provided with the necessary technology to do that? Is that happening in a uniform way? julie morgan am: Well, that is the intention\u2014that everybody should have the opportunity to have the necessary technology, and certainly, that is what is intended. Suzy, very, very briefly, one question on the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service, please. suzy davies am: Just generally, have you had any feedback on the effects on the family courts and the execution of the\u2014well, the child arrangement orders, the various versions of that? julie morgan am: Yes. In terms of the family courts, as you probably know, a lot of the hearings are going on virtually, but the hearings that are more complex are being postponed to be heard at a later date. So, that's one of the issues, really\u2014that we may expect a lot of demand on the court service after this period has finished. And obviously, the president of the family division has issued guidance on compliance with family court child arrangement orders, which were his guidance, and obviously, this is directed at separated families subject to the family court, and that offers general advice to parents, recognising that the circumstances for each parent and each family will be different. But of course, where parents have joint parental responsibility, as you know, the Government has said that children under 18 can be moved between the two households. With the other children, it's on a case-by-case basis, really, what actually happens. I have met with CAFCASS to see how their operations are going, and all the CAFCASS officials are not attending any courts at all; they're sending in any of their views virtually, but it appeared to be that there weren't any major issues arising. lynne neagle am: Okay, thank you, and we have definitely now come to the end of our time. So, can I thank the Ministers and officials for attending? We do recognise what an immensely pressurised time this is for Welsh Government, and we are very appreciative of having your time this afternoon, so thank you both to Ministers and officials. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you very much. This is, of course, our last formal business of the National Assembly for Wales before we become the Senedd tomorrow, and it seems fitting that the National Assembly's last formal proceedings are focused on children and young people, and I'm sure that we would all agree that it is vital that they continue to be at the centre of the work of our Parliament going forward<doc-sep>Item 2, then, this morning is a post-legislative scrutiny session on the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Minister for Education, and Huw Morris, who is director of the skills, higher education and lifelong learning group in Welsh Government. I will just start the questioning by asking whether you are planning to repeal the 2015 higher education Act, or will it be amended by the post-compulsory education and training Bill? kirsty williams am: Thank you very much, Chair. I'm very pleased to be with the committee again this morning, although it's in slightly unusual circumstances. As a piece of post-legislative scrutiny, this was a Bill that was taken forward by a different Minister in a different administration, but I think it is really valuable work in the context of the question you just set out: what can we learn from the implementation of this piece of legislation as we move forward with our reform journey and with this Government and my proposals to introduce a new commission for tertiary education? There is much, at the moment, that lies within the 2015 Act that we will look to bring forward into the new legislation, but there are certainly experiences\u2014and I'm sure we'll come on to some of the evidence that has been received about what's worked, what perhaps hasn't worked\u2014that we all want to reflect on and be mindful of as we take forward the new Bill, including the report of this committee as part of it. So, it is our intention that this Bill will be superceded by the new PCETR Bill. Do you believe that the Act has fulfilled all the Government's objectives? Where are the weaknesses? kirsty williams am: Diolch yn fawr, Si\u00e2n. As I've said, it's a bit difficult to place myself in the mind of the previous Minister when this legislation was first envisaged and then taken through. You'll be aware that there were four main reasons for the introduction of the Bill: around regulation of institutions in Wales; safeguarding the contribution made to public good arising from Welsh Government's financial support for the sector; maintaining a focus on fair access; and preserving and protecting the principle of institutional autonomy. I think the evidence that has been received by the committee to date shows that there are different views about the effectiveness of whether all four strategic aims have been achieved. I think those strategic aims are still really, really important and certainly will underpin our thought process going forward, but we have to recognise the higher education and research Bill across the border in England, the implementation of new student support measures in Wales, as well as the report that was done by Ellen Hazelkorn, I think, means it is appropriate that we move forward with different proposals, not just regulation of the HE sector but the post-compulsory sector as a whole. We will look to see what we can do to strengthen or whether there is more that we need to do to achieve those four objectives, because I think those four objectives are still very, very relevant. But we have to have legislation now that is fit for the circumstances we currently find ourselves in and, hopefully, futureproofs us for how we want to see the sector develop in the future. sian gwenllian am: Do you feel perhaps that the legislation itself hasn't been strong enough, and that you then have had to drive some of these objectives through the annual remit letter, rather than through legislation, and that's why the strengthening is required? kirsty williams am: Certainly, I see the remit letter as a really, really important way in which national priorities and the priorities of an elected Government can be clearly stated, communicated to the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and then HEFCW use their powers to ensure that that happens. So, certainly, I see the remit letter as being a very important mechanism for ensuring, as I said, that those national priorities are clearly articulated, and then change happens. sian gwenllian am: Has the current legislation been framed around institutional autonomy so that it's not possible for institutions to fulfil any national outcomes, and is that going to be an element of the new Bill? kirsty williams am: Well, certainly, the 2015 Act contains numerous provisions that protect universities' privileges and autonomy. And that's really important, and those are principles that I am committed to in any legislation that I bring forward. We'll certainly be looking to see how we can carry those protections into the forthcoming Bill, but, at the same time, we do have to ensure appropriate regulation and accountability of institutions for their public funding and the privileges that they enjoy. We have a very positive working relationship with the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and I am very fortunate to have a very positive working relationship with the sector. I don't think there's anything in the legislation per se that prevents those national priorities being articulated and being acted upon. sian gwenllian am: I don't think that's what HEFCW has said in their evidence. They've said that the Bill has been framed in a way where it's not possible for institutions to fulfil any requirements. You're talking about the remit letter; maybe you need to have that discussion there, but, in terms of the Bill itself, you can't make them fulfil any national outcomes. Shouldn't there be a discussion looking to move in a direction where there are national outcomes being set through legislation, because there is public money going into that? kirsty williams am: Well, I don't know whether we need national outcomes through legislation, because those national priorities, potentially, will change over time. What is really important, and what we will be seeking to do in the new legislation, is look to move to a system of outcome agreements. So, there is a very clear expectation that the commission will have, in regulating the sector, and co-ordinating and funding the sector, to create a system of outcome agreements, where those outputs will reflect national priorities, and that's one of the things that we've consulted on, and will look to take forward in the new legislation. What about private providers? The Act, or the Act as it stands, makes it a requirement for a regulated institution to be a charity, and that means it's not possible to regulate alternative private providers under the Act, even though they can provide higher education in Wales. What is your view on this, and will the new legislation continue with the requirement of being a charity? kirsty williams am: Okay. So, I think, first of all, it's important to make the distinction between the scale of private providers, and what could be termed as 'unregulated providers' in the Welsh system, as opposed to the English system. So, currently, under the current legislation, unregulated providers can only access Welsh Government student support if they're designated on a case-by-case basis. Only six organisations were designated on a case-by-case basis in the 2018-19 academic year, so the scale here is small. So, when we talk about a private provider, perhaps people would have a view of a private university, but, actually, three of those were FE colleges, which we would all be familiar with. And the three private providers were the Centre for Alternative Technology, the training arm of the Church in Wales and the Newport and District Group Training Association. So, in order for their courses to be specifically designated, the three crucial questions that those providers have to answer are: quality\u2014is what they\u2019re providing to students of a good quality; the financial viability of the institution, again, to try to protect the interests of the students who may find themselves embarking on a course in an institution that isn\u2019t viable; as well as their contribution to private\u2014sorry, not to private good\u2014public good. But, Huw, I don't know if there's anything else to add? huw morris: Well, just to say that there are a very small number of private providers, as the Minister has outlined, and, in comparison with England, where I think the last figures said that there were between 300 and 400 private providers in England, you get a sense of the differences that exist there. And, if you look at what happened over recent years, it has been those small private providers across the UK who have been most financially challenged and a number of them have stopped their operations, with consequences for the students. So, we\u2019ve been keen to put students at the front of things to make sure that the institutions that they\u2019re enrolling with are strong and have good quality. So, what you're saying is that you will continue with a charitable status, or not\u2014 kirsty williams am: At this stage\u2014 sian gwenllian am: \u2014or are you still thinking about it? kirsty williams am: Well, at this stage, I think the charitable status will continue to be an important part of what we will take forward. sian gwenllian am: Just turning finally to part-time fees and postgraduate fees, do you have an intention to regulate this part in the new legislation? kirsty williams am: I have to say that, at present, we've not identified an urgent reason to designate these courses as qualifying courses for the purposes of a fee limit. Actually, the current Act\u2014the 2015 Act\u2014does not permit the fee regulation of postgraduate courses, other than PGCE courses for IT purposes. In the case of part-time courses, I'm currently content that fee levels are not exceeding the amount of student support made available by the Welsh Government. So, I think we are, at this moment, relaxed about that, and there are some difficulties around deciding and introducing fee limits on postgraduate courses. I think what's really important to me is the success at the moment of attracting people to postgraduate and part-time study in Wales, as a result of our reforms to student finance. But, at this current moment, the Act precludes fee regulation in some areas and there's not a pressing policy need that we've identified to date. Okay, we're going to move on now to some questions about the level of ambition in the higher education Act and any lessons for the PCET Bill, from Janet Finch-Saunders. To what extent has the 2012 university funding system limited Welsh Government\u2019s policy leverage over the sector, and how has the HE Act addressed this beyond the levers offered by fee and access plans? kirsty williams am: Of course, the Act was introduced as a direct result of the changing scenario around finance and the different ways in which, because of the reduction in HEFCW's budget, the level of influence that HEFCW would be able to exert over institutions through the imposition of terms and conditions of funding\u2014. So, the Act was introduced in part to address that shift in influence and the Act also has provided HEFCW with a range of new powers of intervention and sanctions in the case of non-compliance by institutions. Personally,\u00a0I wholeheartedly believe that tertiary education providers should contribute to national goals and outcomes as part of what I'd describe as a civic mission. I'm determined that any legislation that I bring forward and any commission that I establish will be empowered to enable that to happen through its regulatory and funding powers. Of course, the funding situation has shifted again now because of the introduction of what is commonly known as the Diamond reforms, but our new system of student finance does again shift the parameters of influence that HEFCW or any new tertiary commission could have. But, as I said earlier, it's not to say that institutions have had a free reign. We have been able to use the remit letter and our relationship with HEFCW to progress agendas that we would want to see. So, for instance, you'll be aware, in my remit letter, I am concerned about issues around how people working in the sector are paid. We've been able to successfully see all institutions sign up to becoming living wage employers, all institutions sign up to the Welsh Government's code of ethical procurement. So, it's not to say that the Act has meant that we've had no influence, but there are opportunities now, because of the change in financial circumstances once again, to look at that in any forthcoming legislation. Do you share HEFCW's views on the benefits of having national targets to get institutions to address national priorities? Is this something you wish you could do? kirsty williams am: Well, it's not something I wish I could do; I think that we're doing it. Self-praise is no recommendation, but, because of the working relationship that we have, I think we're seeing some success in using the remit letter to influence national outcomes. So, I've just talked about living wage; we're also using our remit letter to drive transparency over senior leaders' pay, the gender pay gap within institutions. For instance, as part of this Government's commitment to improving mental health, we've been able to use the remit letter and some funding to be able to drive change and some improvements in mental health in the higher education sector. These are national priorities and we're acting upon them and we're using the multiple levers we have at the moment to engage in universities. And, I have to say, universities have risen to that challenge, and I'm very grateful to them for doing that. Are there plans to give the proposed new PCET funding body more effective policy levers to align the sector to the social, economic and civic needs of Wales? And, if so, how will this be done? kirsty williams am: Well, as I said in answer earlier, I'm determined that we ensure a sense of civic mission for the entirety of the sector, including our institutes of higher education. You'll be aware, Janet, that, in the consultation exercises that have been undertaken by the Government so far on PCET reform, we will be introducing more formal outcome agreements, whereby institutions might be given by the commission very clear expectations of how they're expected to contribute to national priorities. We've heard that the HE Act, by focusing on individual institutions, did not encourage collaboration, even for widening access activity. Was this a missed opportunity and how will this be taken forward in the PCET Bill? kirsty williams am: I think we can strengthen our sector by closer collaboration. I think what sets us apart in Wales is that this Government is determined to create a legislative regime and a regulation regime that encourages collaboration and co-operation, which is in stark contrast to the marketisation and the competition that we see being regulated for and legislated for across the border in England. That's one of the reasons why we are going to introduce the new PCET reforms\u2014to create collaboration, not just between different higher education institutes but actually across the sector. So, this is a prime opportunity where we can create a framework that demands and encourages collaboration, not just, as I said, in between individual institutions but across the entirety of the sector. We're doing that because that means we can avoid duplication, we can fill gaps that there currently are and we can create a system that allows for a seamless passage for students to move between the different parts of post-compulsory education that are currently available, where, sometimes, those students find barriers. lynne neagle am: Okay, Janet? janet finch-saunders am: Thank you\u2014that's great, thank you. lynne neagle am: We've got some questions now around HEFCW's powers of intervention from Dawn Bowden. We received substantial evidence from HEFCW suggesting that powers were inflexible and hard to use\u2014I think HEFCW called them 'threatening'\u2014saying that they make sanctions difficult to use and so on. Are you satisfied that HEFCW's powers are useful on a preventative day-to-day basis? kirsty williams am: If I may disagree slightly, I don't think their powers are frightening. It's very clear what powers are available to HEFCW, and they're certainly more than just the ability to, maybe, lean on an institution. Clearly, there is a system by which there is the ability to, you know, ramp up and escalate levels of intervention in the sector by HEFCW, but I certainly wouldn't describe them as inflexible or not having weight. dawn bowden am: I think they were saying it was difficult to use for swift interventions\u2014they found it a bit cumbersome. They explained to us that they often take informal measures or actions in their role as regulator, and they've explained that the small size of the sector enables good relationships to be developed. How can such measures work in the tertiary education body when there clearly will be many more than the 10 providers? kirsty williams am: Well, looking ahead to the new Bill, I would want to see and be very keen to ensure that there are sufficiently flexible\u2014did you use the word soft\u2014and soft regulatory powers that the commission could exercise. Those powers, for instance, could include the ability to offer advice and guidance, rather than, maybe, punitive interventions, and powers to undertake enhanced monitoring of institutions to ensure compliance with regulatory conditions. So, I would expect the commission to be able to have a series of abilities to intervene, from the soft, flexible type, which is non-punitive but actually allows people to go in and support institutions, through to something that would be, as I said, more punitive, if they felt that an institution was in danger of not providing quality or financial failure. hefin david am: Can I just come in there, on the point that was made? The issue that seemed to me to come from HEFCW and from the universities is that the dial seems to have only three steps. So, rather than having a graduated series of actions that they can take, it seems to step from\u2014what did he call it\u2014a 'meeting without coffee' to\u2014 kirsty williams am: That's a very HEFCW thing to say. hefin david am: \u2014potentially institutions going bankrupt, and there don't seem to be many steps in between that. kirsty williams am: I think, as I said at the beginning of the session, this is why this post-legislative scrutiny is useful, because we can reflect on that feedback. As I said, I would expect to be able to ensure that the commission had a range of powers that could address\u2014from that soft power and those early conversations to being able to, as I said, issue, perhaps, advice and guidance to an institution, so there would be a more graduated escalation. Huw, is there anything else that I've missed out? huw morris: Just to build on what the Minister has said, there's a range of ways in which we interact with all institutions that are going to be in the tertiary sector, and some of that is about providing information. So, HEFCW provides information\u2014it sends around circulars, it produces reports and it holds events. There's staff, management and leadership development activity, which can create a culture amongst the leaders of institutions, but also amongst their governing bodies, to help them move in a particular direction. We use those mechanisms and informal interactions with FE college principals, with the work-based learning provider network, with sixth forms and others, and we would want to see, I hope, in the tertiary sector some alignment of those things. I think what stands behind HEFCW's comments is that before we had a loan-based system of student finance, there was a system of block grant allocations and conditions could be attached to those grant allocations by HEFCW. I don't think we're going to be going back to that system in the foreseeable future because of the pressures on public finances\u2014 hefin david am: That wasn't how I understood it. I understood it to be the fact that you use these informal powers and then the next step up is quite a severe sanction and there's not much in between those. huw morris: In the Hazelkorn review, there's quite a lot of focus on that and looking to learn from other national systems where outcome agreements provide a broader measure of the range of things the institutions do and a mechanism for tracking how things are done through the provision of information back to the institution to help them know how they're doing. What we have to strike the balance of as well is at what point those powers seem to be\u2014and the ability to direct\u2014interfering with the principle of autonomy within an institution. So, there's that balance to be struck, isn't there, about creating a regulatory regime, which I'm very keen and the Act attempted to do, which was to enshrine institutional autonomy, and that's really, really important, but also a regulatory regime, the ability to influence and to develop and to deliver national outcomes and the power to intervene in that sector, which you know, better than probably anybody else in this room, guards that institutional autonomy very, very, very dear indeed. And that's the balance that we need to try and strike as we go forward with the new commission proposals. I think, in terms of the levels of measures\u2014and I understand what you're saying\u2014but I think what HEFCW were saying was that they try as far as possible to use informal measures and they are able to do that because of the size of the sector\u2014just 10 institutions to work with. The post-16 sector, however many we're talking\u201450 plus providers\u2014it's probably going to be less likely that they would be able to have that sort of relationship with the leaders in those institutions. kirsty williams am: Yes, but also, what's incumbent upon me as the Minister is to ensure that the commission is set up in a way where it can have that relationship with the sector, because what's really important to remember is that HEFCW will be replaced. We're not asking HEFCW suddenly to go from regulating a small number of institutions to suddenly regulating 50. We'll be creating a commission that will be structured in such a way that it can have those relationships. Because, of course, whilst HEFCW will face changes, our relationship with and how we manage the FE sector and the apprenticeship sector will also shift. So, the point is that we need to create a commission that will still be able to be close to the sector, close enough to be able to provide that soft regulation, those really important relationships in a way\u2014. So, it has to be created in such a way and resourced in such a way that it allows that to happen, and that's my intention. Well, then, of course, the University of Wales said to us that they felt that there was the potential for HEFCW to issue directions enforceable by injunction to remedy minor matters. So, I think, from what you're saying, you wouldn't be expecting that to happen. Just the fact that they've got the power doesn't necessarily mean that that's what they're going to do. kirsty williams am: Well, I think it's important to recognise when HEFCW can enforce its directions by way of an injunction. If they were to do that because a university was breaking fee limits or because there were real questions about the quality of the provision or whether a university was not complying with the financial management code\u2014personally, I wouldn't describe those as minor matters, as a Minister, if we had an institution that was significantly falling down on quality and HEFCW were using these powers to intervene. And, actually, on that point, we've had some recent high-profile issues in Swansea and Trinity St David, and HEFCW still haven't yet used their powers of intervention. Do you find that surprising? kirsty williams am: I think what they have done in these circumstances is, perhaps, used their ability to support those institutions through what, undoubtedly, have been challenging times. Given the fact that there are ongoing legal processes attached to Swansea University, I think it would not be appropriate for me to comment any further, because there are still matters in train with regard to that institution. But clearly, our expectation on HEFCW is to ensure that they are using their powers to support those universities, and I would expect them, if they felt necessary, to use the full remit of their powers if they felt that that was what they needed to do. Now, I have to trust their professional judgment that that has not been necessary to date, but our expectation is that they would do that if they felt it was necessary. hefin david am: Are you concerned that neither the regulator nor the sector seem to have any confidence in fee and access plans? kirsty williams am: I think the concept of a fee and access plan is an important concept. Whether we can do them better, whether we can reflect on what's happened to date and create a better system of what's included in a fee and access plan and how those fee and access plans can be monitored, there's an opportunity to do that in forthcoming legislation. hefin david am: So, have you been aware of specific issues yourself? Have they brought them to you? kirsty williams am: Well, no, not in the sense that they've brought them to me to talk about specifically. From my perspective, fee and access plans are focused very much on inputs, and, really, I'd like to think about outputs and outcomes, more importantly\u2014what are the outcomes of the fee and access plan, not necessarily just how much money has been spent on them. I think, certainly, to really understand the success of the fee and access plan, you have to question whether an annual basis is an appropriate timescale for a university to be working to, and whether we could have something that was focused over a longer period of time. Because, when you think about it, you write the plan and then you're into it, and then, the next thing you know, you're writing your next year's plan. So, do I see a place for fee and access plans going forward, as part of our outcome agreements? Yes, I do. hefin david am: So, why would introducing outcome agreements make them work any better? kirsty williams am: Well, I think they're going to be a part of an outcome agreement\u2014part of that wider expectation. So, fee and access plans are there to address an issue around, primarily, changing the nature of people who go to university and making sure that nobody is put off from pursuing that. So, that's part of a wider piece of work that I'd want to see as an outcome agreement. But, as I said, I think looking at outcomes for students and outcomes of that activity, rather than the inputs of the activity, over a longer period of time, is probably a more effective way of doing it. In a way, it's difficult to make a final judgment on whether fee and access plans in their current format have worked, because we need to know what'll happen to those students in the future. But undoubtedly, despite the limitations of them, I do think we're making progress in terms of access, but I don't think we can necessarily point to the fee and access plans as being the driver for some of those improvements. hefin david am: No, I appreciate that, and some of the things you're saying reflect some of the discussions we've had, but what was clear is that the process and bureaucratic nature of the way you present fee and access plans doesn't work, particularly given the fact that, four years on, early fee and access plans are still being evaluated. So, what you're saying\u2014can I just pin down what you're saying\u2014is that we may be moving away from yearly fee and access plans to something that's longer term and outcome focused. kirsty williams am: That's my preference.\u00a0So, I think the principle\u2014I'd like to think we can all agree around the principle of what a fee and access plan is hoping to achieve, but I think there are better ways of doing it, and I think we should take the opportunity of reform to look at how we can do it better. hefin david am: So, with that in mind, I think we're talking about the future of the Bill, the consultation on the PCET reforms closed in summer 2018\u2014with these important issues in mind and things that are currently ongoing, have you had further dialogue since then with key stakeholders like, for example, Universities Wales and others? kirsty williams am: On the Bill or on fee and access plans in particular? hefin david am: I'm thinking about fee and access plans as an issue that suggests that there is a need for deep consultation, so with that in mind, with things like that, have you had further discussion? kirsty williams am: Oh my goodness me, civil servants in the department are constantly in discussion with a range of stakeholders as we continue to develop legislative proposals. I meet on a regular basis with both HEFCW\u2014I meet separately with the vice-chancellors, and I've been very keen to develop a stronger working relationship with chairs, and perhaps we'll come on to issues of governance later. So, we are constantly discussing with stakeholders all options for change\u2014 hefin david am: I suppose the message I'm getting as chair of the cross-party group on higher education is that there could still be more direct consultation with stakeholders. Now, I've got no evidence to say it has or hasn't happened, but that's the message I've received. huw morris: If I could just chip in for a moment, the Minister's outlined that there is very extensive, ongoing communication both ways with the sector, but the challenge of preparing a Bill is the balancing act between gathering in information\u2014and there's been a general consultation process and a technical consultation process\u2014and wanting to make sure that the Bill that's laid next year hasn't been discussed with anybody else before it comes to be considered by the Senedd. So, the broad principles have been discussed, but specific details of what goes into a Bill or policy instructions that inform a Bill haven't been the subject of consultation\u2014 hefin david am: Because that happens at Stage 1. Sorry, can I move on to the next item? lynne neagle am: Oh, you're going on to the next section. hefin david am: Yes, unless there's anything specific\u2014 lynne neagle am: Yes, I just wanted to clarify, if we're moving to a longer term approach to this, how will the new body be able to establish that things are actually working, that the powers are working, if we're working on a five-year time frame? kirsty williams am: As we've heard, we can't really properly assess fee and access plans in the current arrangements, because it takes time for those cohorts of students to go through and activities to go through. Being able to move to a system where fee and access plans, for instance, could be over a three-year period I think allows universities to be more strategic in some of their investments and some of their activities around fee and access. In a single-year plan, it's almost knee-jerk, it's the need to demonstrate that you're doing something, and doing that within that period of time, rather than a more strategic view\u2014. Can I just say, I know it's not quite subject to this, but we're really moving forward in terms of access and broadening access into the HE sector. For me, student financial support is one aspect of it, but if we're really thinking about social mobility and attracting people into higher education that have never been part of higher education before, our early figures would suggest\u2014they're early figures, and they're subject to change, but in terms of our change to our student support regime, we have seen a 58 per cent increase in the number of postgraduates applying for student support in Wales. When you think about it, when many of us went to university, a degree was the thing that set you apart. Now that more and more students are going to university, it is that postgraduate qualification that sets you apart, but your ability to carry on studying is often limited by access to financial support, so a 58 per cent increase in postgraduate I think is great for those individuals, but it's also great for our economy. We've seen a 35 per cent increase in part-time undergraduates that have been supported by the Student Loans Company; the Open University have reported a 67 per cent increase in students from Wales's most economically disadvantaged areas registering with them; a 57 per cent increase in disabled students; and a 30 per cent increase in black, minority ethnic learners. So, I think that's a really, really positive basis for our sector to continue to work on broadening access. The feedback from Universities Wales suggests that, with the outcome of the 2015 Act, institutions with the strongest track records are more highly regulated than the riskier private alternative providers. Do you think that Act has struck the right balance? kirsty williams am: I think the Act has created a system where the level of regulation is proportional to the amount and the nature of public moneys received by institutions. Those were the words used by Universities Wales\u2014 kirsty williams am: No, no, I'm not disagreeing. When you look at public moneys going into institutions, I think that the Act is proportionate, myself. hefin david am: So, do you think it's in the interests of students, then, to be at private institutions\u2014? I've seen those private institutions and how they operate; I've seen them at first-hand\u2014they don't operate to the same rigour as public institutions, and they're less regulated. huw morris: Can I just chip in? I think that the category 'private' covers quite a wide range of things, and many private institutions are also charities. We don't have the presence of some of the large private charities that are present in other countries, but Stanford and Harvard would count as private universities. I think there has been attention drawn to some private providers, particularly in England, but I wouldn't tar them all with the same brush, necessarily. hefin david am: But they fall outwith\u2014if they're not charitable providers running validated courses, for example, they fall outwith the strength of regulation that is currently in place on the universities in Wales. kirsty williams am: So, we would regulate them on a course-by-course basis, so it's back to the issue of proportionality, isn't it? So, you are automatically regulated for all your courses, if you're one of our main universities, but there is a process that is run by HEFCW on a course-by-course basis to validate alternative providers. And as Huw said, I think we should recognise the nature of that is very, very, very small in Wales, and there is a process to ensure quality provision. hefin david am: And I'm aware that there are a small number of private institutions in Wales, but are you concerned that in the future the landscape may change, particularly with the opportunity to recruit more part-time students? Do you think the landscape may change in future and that the 2015 Act, as designed, wasn't equipped for that, and will the next Act, then, be equipped? kirsty williams am: I think it's right to say that maybe the previous legislation didn't futureproof for changes. I'm not anticipating a mass influx of alternative providers, in the sense that we've seen across the border, but we will need to ensure that the new commission has powers to regulate and to futureproof. We had some evidence from the University and College Union that were concerned about the governance of universities, actually, as being a bigger problem than the regulatory framework in many ways. Can you tell us, perhaps, how the HE Act addresses the issue of poor governance, or is it really just limited to responding to the symptoms rather than the poor governance itself? kirsty williams am: Well, I think it's true and fair to say that the Bill does not directly address issues around governance in the sector. HEFCW do have well-established assurance practices in relation to governance that would predate the 2015 legislation. But governance\u2014we've talked briefly about some recent history within the sector that I think has certainly brought the issue of governance to the fore once again, and I think there are two important things that we're trying to do about that in the current time, prior to any legislative changes. The first is, as I just said to Hefin, I have sought to have a more direct relationship with chairs of universities and have that one-to-one relationship with them, not in the presence of their vice-chancellors. I challenge them, they challenge me, and I think we've deliberately tried to establish a regular routine of that since I took office. And you'll be aware that, collaboratively\u2014and I'm glad that this has been done in this way because I think if you do it this way, we're more likely to get some success and change\u2014Universities Wales and HEFCW have worked together to undertake an independent review of governance. And I think it's really important that parties have come together to recognise the issues and to agree to take action, because I think if we'd have tried to impose something, we'd have more resistance. So, there is an independent review going on at the moment\u2014 dawn bowden am: Is that the risk review process in\u2014? kirsty williams am: That's the Gillian Camm review. This is a review that, as I said, Universities Wales and HEFCW have agreed to do together. It's chaired by Gillian Camm, who is the chair of the Leadership Foundation for Higher Education, and she is doing an independent review to advise on changes to governance. And I welcome that, I'm very supportive of that, and that's happening at the moment. As I said, I'm glad that there's been recognition from within the sector themselves that they need to make sure, and they need to give confidence, that governance arrangements are what they should be. dawn bowden am: So, is that something that you're going to be taking into the PCET Bill, do you think? kirsty williams am: Yes, absolutely. We're exploring how the Bill could introduce a regulatory condition in respect of good governance, and a commission would be able to set expectations with regard to good governance. I think one of the concerns for me\u2014and I know that this is a concern that is shared by the UCU\u2014is the diversity of governance and who finds themselves in these really important positions. HEFCW don't hold figures on it, but from an approximation that I've asked officials to do for me, currently in the universities that we have, I would say that men make up around 56 per cent of membership of universities' governing bodies; women\u201444 per cent; BME\u2014as low as 4 per cent. Of course, in individual institutions, it does vary, but I think there is some way to go to making sure that our governing bodies are diverse and that there's an opportunity to look at the student voice in governance going forward, the staff voice in governance going forward, and these are things that we hope to have discussions on whilst we bring the legislation forward. dawn bowden am: But also, I guess\u2014sorry, Chair\u2014a greater understanding, that anybody going in to become a governor of one of these institutions has a greater understanding of what is expected of them. Do you think that that's a gap that needs to be plugged? huw morris: One of the things that HEFCW have led on with AdvanceHE, the body that encompasses the leadership foundation, is a development programme for governing bodies, and that started earlier\u2014well, it's been going on for some time, but it was recommenced earlier this year, with a session for all of the chairs of universities in Wales. And I believe\u2014I'll need to check this\u2014that there are plans to engage with each of the governing bodies, because, as you rightly say, and this lies behind a lot of what we've been discussing, the activities of these institutions have become much more complex over recent years, and so there is a need for that training and development and understanding also of the fast-changing nature of that activity. lynne neagle am: Okay, just before we move on, can I ask whether it's your plan to legislate on that, as they've done in Scotland? kirsty williams am: As I said, I don't want to pre-empt scrutiny of the Bill, because we need to be able to come to the committee and do that in the entirety, rather than picking off individual bits of it, but we are absolutely exploring how the Bill could introduce a regulatory condition with regard to governance. We've heard evidence regarding the difficulties caused by HEFCW having a legal duty to quality-assure all the provision in two further education colleges. Could you clarify that and explain the situation in that instance? kirsty williams am: Thank you. My understanding\u2014and as I said, it's a bit difficult, because I can't put myself into the thought process of the Minister at the time and what his expectation was. But, certainly, my understanding is that it was not an unintended consequence, it was an expectation built into the Act that HEFCW and Estyn would work together on these matters. The Act built on what were the quality assessment arrangements in the 1992 Act, which required HEFCW to secure arrangements for the assessment of the quality of education provided by funding institutions. So, as a consequence of that approach, HEFCW's quality assessment duty currently encompasses all the education provided by or on behalf of a regulated institution. So, it is complicated, and Huw can help me out here if I get it wrong, but my understanding is that it was not an unintended consequence, that was the expectation of what would happen when the legislation was passed. That was a theme in the general and technical consultation exercises that we've engaged in over the last couple of years. sian gwenllian am: So, you're happy, therefore, that that partnership has worked. Are you happy with that? kirsty williams am: Certainly, in our consultation for the upcoming Act, we've generally heard, certainly from our further education colleges, that they've been quite content with the arrangements. huw morris: There are differences in the systems of quality assurance as they've historically applied to FE and HE, but I understand that that has meant that, as FE colleges become more interested in HE, they've had to learn new ways, and that's taken a little bit of time. sian gwenllian am: Okay, which moves us on to this idea of having one quality assurance body or one quality assurance framework. Is that your intention and how will that work in practice? kirsty williams am: I am aware, and we've listened to stakeholders' concerns regarding proposals to introduce a single quality assessment body. As I said, we recognise that stakeholders are broadly content with the current situation with regard to Estyn and QAA. So, we've been listening to that, following the technical consultation, and policy officials are working through options in regard to ensuring what quality assurance will look like in the commission. As I said, I don't want to pre-empt bringing forward the legislation, but the principles underlying any assurance regime would need to be coherent, need to be effective and need to be comprehensive. What we're also very clear about, and I think it is important to say, is that any quality framework covering higher education will be compatible with ENQA, which I think is really, really important going forward. sian gwenllian am: But, you have touched on this, there is substantial concern in the sector about this offer to move to one assurance body for the tertiary sector. One vice-chancellor has told us: kirsty williams am: Well, sometimes, I think it is necessary, maybe, to cause a stir. If we don't change things, it does beg the point of, 'Why are any of us here if we're not here to sometimes move things forward?' And change is challenging always, but I would like to reassure all of our vice-chancellors and our sector as a whole that we're not going to do anything in the quality assurance regime that would risk what is the very high reputation and standards that Welsh universities currently comply with or would set them apart from institutions across the border or in a European context. I think the fear is misplaced, but coming back to another theme in the conversation so far about futureproofing, what we're seeing in the figures that the Minister outlined to you earlier about the growth in postgraduate and the growth in part-time is the desire of a greater number of people at different ages to engage in higher and tertiary education, and quite often that will be in a workplace or it will be in a non-conventional institutional setting. Historically, the quality assurance regimes for work-based learning have tended to sit with Estyn; the assurance regimes for the universities have sat with the QAA. There's quite a lot of learning that all sides have got to engage in if we're going to be able to have continued high quality in these new areas that are being explored. The Augar report, which was published earlier this year in England, drew attention to this as being a major problem in the relationship over the border between Ofsted and the QAA. So, I think we're not looking to impose one institution on anybody, but we are looking to encourage greater synergy in the ways in which quality assurance and enhancement is undertaken in those different areas of activity. Will the new Bill address these issues? kirsty williams am: Well, certainly transnational education does present real opportunities for Welsh institutions, but if not managed appropriately and regulated appropriately can cause real risks to reputation to our sector. When I meet with vice-chancellors in universities in different parts of the world, and when I am visiting different countries, one of the great things that I'm able to say is that we have a sector that provides fantastic quality of teaching, excellence in research and a wonderful student experience, and that is undermined if institutions find themselves undertaking TNE activities that put that at risk. So, it's an important consideration for the health of the whole sector that any TNE undertaken by a Welsh institution has the appropriate quality guarantees built into that because it's a problem not just for an individual institution, but it could undermine the very strong reputation that the Welsh sector has as a whole. Huw, was there anything further about TNE? huw morris: Well, just to say that we are live to that, as I know HEFCW and the QAA are. When they visit institutions with their reviews they will look at a selection of those overseas activities and there are periodic thematic reviews of the activity in particular countries. I think we would hope and believe that HEFCW, in its conversations with the QAA, would be keeping that under review to minimise the risk and maximise the opportunities. sian gwenllian am: So, you're not actually looking to use the new legislation to strengthen the regulation around this. huw morris: The arrangements at the moment are that HEFCW uses the QAA to do the reviews and the inspections. The system at the moment works through co-operation between the institutions and the regulator to make sure the quality assurance system is improving and enhancing things. Well, can I thank you both for attending this morning and answering all our questions? As usual, you will be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you both for your attendance this morning. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Minister for Education regarding the revised additional learning needs implementation plan. Paper to note 2 is additional information from HEFCW, following the meeting on 18 July, in relation to our post-legislative scrutiny of the Higher Education (Wales) Act. And paper to note 3 is a letter from us to the Welsh Local Government Association on the Childcare Funding (Wales) Act 2019. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting and for item 1 on 2 October? Are Members content? Thank you."

        "Query": "Summarize the difficulties faced by secondary schools in carrying out curriculum reform, the opinions on support or changes of circumstances, the stress faced by the oil and gas industry, and the discussion about restoring Canadian businesses during the pandemic. Additionally, provide insights on the perspectives of Heather McPherson and Chrystia Freeland on restoring Canadian businesses during the pandemic.",
        "Summary": "Despite some primary schools having surplus funds, many secondary schools are facing deficits and a lack of funds. Additionally, there is a shortage of teachers with appropriate training. Concerns arise regarding the ability of lower-tier schools to adapt to the new curriculum and improve teaching quality. The approach to students has not changed, but individual circumstances may require adjustments from the Student Loans Company. Challenges in service delivery may arise due to staff shortages caused by illness, self-isolation, or adherence to social-distancing measures. Early monitoring was implemented due to the presence of campuses and activities in China and Southeast Asia. The oil and gas industry has been heavily impacted by anti-oil and gas lobby groups, resulting in the introduction of bills that restrict major projects and oil shipping. These actions have caused a significant decline in investment and a recession in the Alberta economy. Members express concerns about the government's handling of pandemic-related restrictions, particularly in relation to reopening businesses and providing effective stimulus. They emphasize the need to reopen fishing, restore agricultural supply chains, and support farmers. Questions are raised about the government's response to outbreaks in meat-packing plants and the provision of financial support to workers in unsafe conditions. The government is also questioned about providing pandemic relief funds to businesses utilizing tax havens. Hon. Chrystia Freeland acknowledges the hard work of farmers and emphasizes the importance of a safe working environment, trusting the Food Inspection Agency to regulate conditions.",
        "Article": "I've received apologies for absence from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian, and I'm very pleased to welcome Helen Mary Jones, who is substituting for Si\u00e2n today. Can I ask whether Members want to declare any interests, please? Can I just, then, place on record that I have got a son who was about to do A-levels, so is affected by the exam decision? We'll move on, then, to our substantive item today, which is an evidence session with the Welsh Government around the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on education in Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams, Minister for Education; Steve Davies, who is director of the education directorate; Huw Morris, who is the group director, skills, higher education and lifelong learning; and Rob Orford, who is the chief scientific adviser for health. We know that this is a really difficult and pressurised time for everyone, and we appreciate your attendance. As you know, it's not usually my practice to do that, but I think it is important today. COVID-19 coronavirus is one of the most significant issues that the Welsh Government and the people of Wales have dealt with in recent times. But I would like to assure you that our aim, and my aim, and my main concern as the education Minister is to protect all staff and pupils in our schools and other educational settings. Public health is clearly the priority here, but that does not change our belief that no child should miss out on any education, unless absolutely necessary. So, the decision to close all schools from tomorrow for statutory education provision was not taken lightly, but I believe it was necessary, given the advice and recommendations that we had received from a public health perspective and the situation that was developing on the ground. They will help support those most in need, including people involved in the immediate response to the coronavirus outbreak, and I'm working with my colleagues in the Cabinet, with Government officials and our partners in local government to develop and finalise these plans. The key areas that we're looking at are supporting and safeguarding the vulnerable and ensuring continuity of learning. I can confirm that all maintained schools in Wales already have access to a range of digital tools that can support distance learning through the world-class Hwb\u00a0digital learning platform, including virtual classrooms and video-conferencing facilities. A guide on what tools are available and how schools can use them has been developed and is being promoted widely. Yesterday, I announced that, whilst there are no easy choices, we have agreed that the best way forward is not to proceed with the summer exam series. Learners due to sit these exams will be awarded a fair grade to recognise their work, drawing on a range of information that is available, and I will announce further details shortly, but I felt it necessary to give early certainty to students and to staff. I would like to put on record my thanks to everyone working in education settings for the hard work that they have put in over the last few months in dealing with the virus and ensuring that pupils have been able to continue to learn. We need to continue to do this work together, as we face the continuing challenges posed by the coronavirus. We'll go to questions from Members now, and I've got some questions from Dawn Bowden. Can I thank you, Kirsty, for your statement and the really difficult decisions that you've been having to make? You've already indicated in your statement this morning that these decisions are not taken lightly, and we understand that that is the case across Government. You've outlined a little bit further there in your statement to us this morning about the new purpose. I take from what you're saying that you haven't really developed that yet in terms of exactly what that is going to look like. Is there anything else you can tell us about that at the moment and how you might staff the schools in those particular areas? kirsty williams am: Thank you, Dawn. So, you're\u00a0absolutely right, our priority now is to operationalise, with colleagues in local government and schools, a practical response. And I have to say, we're working to timescales that I would have hoped to have avoided, but given the fact that we're having to make these decisions quite quickly, I hope that you will understand that perhaps where we start on Monday might change when we have more time and more opportunities to develop programmes going forward. Steve will be able to give you more details of the practical work that has already been going on, but our expectation will be that schools will be playing an important part in providing safe and secure places for children of those on the front-line response to dealing with the coronavirus to attend, and work is already under way with local authorities and individual schools on what that will look like for the emergency situation on Monday. Our other priority is indeed free school meals, and, again, where we eventually end up might be a different place to where we are on Monday. Again, we're responding to the emergency situation that there will be families that were expecting a free school meal on Monday, and, again, individual schools and local authorities are developing those plans at pace to be able to provide an emergency response as we work out a longer term plan to deal with the situation. The same thing also goes for additional learning needs, and attending to the needs of that particular group of learners. I had the opportunity to meet with the First Minister and Andrew Morgan, the leader of the Welsh Local Government Association, yesterday to talk about what local government could do, and what they were already doing. Those plans in some places are already quite developed, and are now working at pace, but I hope you will understand that where we start on Monday is the emergency response, and that work will develop as we go forward. But, Steve, perhaps you could\u2014? Because Steve was the one making all those phone calls and doing the practical operational stuff, rather than me. steve davies: In short, the new purpose is to meet the needs of particular groups of children and young people. In some cases, some of the response to supporting free school meals, in the short term in particular, we may use the schools as part of that, and I'm certain that will happen in some cases. Now, there is still work to be done on identifying exactly the categories of key workers, but I think it's really encouraging that in my discussions yesterday\u2014I spoke with all 22 directors of education, and the examples we're picking up in their work with schools is they're already ahead of the curve in working with schools. They're vulnerable sometimes in terms of education other than at school, vulnerable in terms of mental health, and for those children, as well as having an experience that we want to be planned, some have compared it to a snow day, particularly on Monday, when you're putting something together in the short term, but it will not be a formal curriculum that those children would normally go through. So, the range of activities\u2014some will be focused on educational activities, some will be cultural, some will be sporting, and that plan will be developed on the basis of the age range of children, which in some cases may go from extremely young children up to those at the age of 16 in our all-through schools, but there will be a planned set of activities to cater for those children. What we are doing currently\u2014I have staff back at Cathays Park who are in touch and working with directors of education to ensure that schools over the next two days will have been able to identify, at least at the earlier stage, in terms of health workers, the type and numbers of people. There are already schools who have informed us, and local authorities, of their plans for these activities to be starting next week, which is quite amazing, actually, given where we are. But we are expecting, and we're writing to schools today, that during the course of next week, headteachers to be in schools, and with their staff, taking into consideration the health guidance as to which staff should or should not be in, and in that period from next Monday through the two-week period, to Easter, we expect staff to be both planning for delivery post Easter, but also, as I said, building on and reflecting the good practice that's already in place for schools that have engaged in activities, and I'm sure a number of them will be inviting and enabling those children to come in on Monday. So, Monday will be a challenge for some, and not all will be delivering it, but we will be working so that we can get as much as possible delivered for those groups over the next two weeks, and particularly to have resilient programmes post Easter for the groups of children in those three categories that I said. Can I just clarify one thing? One of the identified vulnerable groups would clearly be children on the at-risk register. kirsty williams am: In our discussions, we have asked local government to be working with the social services departments and individual schools to identify those children who may be in that situation. We know that, for some children, being at school is part of their safeguarding arrangements, and obviously we will need to be able to respond to those needs. steve davies: I wrote specifically yesterday to all directors of education to be assured that, for those children, the register is up to date and the plans are in place. I'm working with Albert Heaney my colleague, the director for social services, who is meeting with the 22 directors of social services today to look to ensure that we are joined up in ensuring none of these children fall through the gap. hefin david am: A very quick and simple question: how are you going to communicate this to parents? There's a bigger picture and it's changing all the time, as you said. The most helpful thing I've seen is that Public Health Wales have a single website with information regarding the wider issue of the virus. How will this then be cascaded to schools, because there's obviously a time lag? So, have you considered how this is going to be communicated directly to parents? kirsty williams am: We're using all of our platforms of communication to get these messages across. So, we're using the more informal methods of communication, but are relying on a systematic approach via individual directors and through to individual schools. We're looking, as quickly as we can, to have a frequently asked education questions page that we can update. It is impossible for the communications team here to be able to respond individually to every single person that is sending Facebook messages and sending tweets, so the best way we can do that is to collate the types of questions people are asking and then to be able to have a frequently updated question and answer page to try to respond to that. With regard to parents, for instance, we're aware of schools that have already sent a questionnaire out last night to parents saying, 'Do you consider yourself to be a key worker? Do you work in the NHS? Please let us know by tomorrow so we can put arrangements in place for your children.' So, schools are already taking the initiative and having those conversations with parents about what their needs will be. It won't be perfect by Monday, because we're working to such constrained timescales. We also have to think about systems that look at what might the epidemic do and have systems of resilience that may work next week, given the situation we find ourselves in with public health advice at the moment. Therefore, have we got a system that will be resilient in those circumstances? These are some of the challenges that we're having to grapple with. So, as I said, what happens on Monday might look very different to where we are if schools are still off in May. suzy davies am: Yes, just on this question of vulnerable children, I'm just wondering how much discretion teachers are going to have in including individual children who may not be obviously under social services' care or on a risk register or whatever. Teachers know their pupils and, very sensitively, they could include people who may not be obviously in need. kirsty williams am: We would absolutely respect the professional judgment of individual headteachers to be able to have those conversations with their directors. As you said, quite rightly, they are the individuals who know their children best and know which children, perhaps, will need this extra support. The second part of my question is: there were going to be Easter holidays anyway, weren't there? What was going to happen about free-school-meal children during that period? Has that gone out of the window now, the normal holiday provision for children? Because that's not there normally, is it, except in separate\u2014 kirsty williams am: We do find ourselves in a strange situation. My understanding is what we're trying to work to is that we would have ongoing provision and not to make some strange, 'You get this for two weeks, then you don't get it for two weeks, and then you're back in.' My understanding is, in England, that is what they're going to do. We're trying to create a system where it will be seamless and it will not necessarily matter that two of those weeks were formally holidays. It won't matter to those nurses and doctors who will need to be in work during those weeks. helen mary jones am: Just briefly, building on Suzy's question, one particular group of children and young people that I hope will be eligible to be included in the potentially vulnerable category is young carers. For some of them, they may not be able to come into school because the people they're caring for may have to be excluded because of their conditions. But I think that, for other young carers, coming to school is an absolute lifeline, because they're working at home. So, I don't know if it's appropriate for you to specifically mention those in discussions with local authorities, but it's a group of young people who, again, may not be vulnerable in other ways, but because of their caring responsibilities they may need school. And the other group\u2014and this, I suppose, goes back to Suzy's point about teachers knowing their young people\u2014is the children who may be living in situations where they're at risk of witnessing domestic abuse. Again, these may very well not be children who are in any formal contact with social services, but being at home may be really not a good place for them to be. So, again, I'd put in an appeal for that to be something that perhaps can be raised with schools. If a teacher is worried about what a child's circumstances are like at home, whether they can be, as you said, Kirsty, included as one of the\u2014. They may not be formally identified, but if the teacher knows that they're at risk, or there is an instinct that they're at risk, they might be able to be included in children who are allowed to take advantage of this special provision you're making at this difficult time. We have to do that in the context of what is deliverable, and we also have to do that in the context of the public health advice that we are receiving as well. We know that the ability for school closures to make a contribution to that diminishes if we have significant children in school still. So, we will take these issues into consideration, but remembering this is part of an epidemic mitigation plan. This is a rapidly-evolving problem and the scale is something that we haven't seen in 100 years, and so we're having to evolve and iterate things as we go. We've all got a role to play, and schools certainly have a significant role to play in breaking those chains of transmission. We need to send a really clear message that you're all part of the solution, and the things that you do by distancing yourselves from your friends and your family are really important for us to get on top of this outbreak. helen mary jones am: I'm sure that that's true, but I'm sure that we wouldn't be wanting a child who's in a very pressured environment with perhaps a very difficult relationship between mum and dad\u2014. janet finch-saunders am: Thank you, Chair, and good morning, Minister, and your team. Can I just put on record my thanks for all that you're having to endure at this moment? I think it's fair to say you have the support of Assembly Members and, indeed, our communities. Now, the question I have: if Cylch Meithrin have to close, where will they get money from to pay their staff? Because, currently, thankfully, there's support for businesses. lynne neagle am: Janet, we're not doing Cylch Meithrin at the moment; we are sticking with schools, as we discussed in advance. dawn bowden am: Can I just get some clarity, Steve, around what you were saying in terms of next week? Because I think the practical applications of this\u2014and I understand that you don't know all of this yet, I understand that\u2014the practical applications are what is coming to us, obviously, with constituents saying, 'Well, what's going to happen to that?' Just so that I can be clear, are you saying that, at this stage, every headteacher will be in school on Monday, as will all their staff? steve davies: Within the scope of the guidance in terms of their health, the expectation\u2014and this will be conveyed in letters by the Minister today, to be made clear\u2014is that they are closing for the majority of pupils, but our expectation within the guidance is that the headteacher with their staff will be coming in; for some to start the delivery of what we just described, but that will probably be small numbers, but more importantly to plan to ensure that, after the formal Easter period, which is school holidays, the schools are geared to cater for the range of pupils that we've been discussing. dawn bowden am: So, would you anticipate\u2014again, I know this is all a bit 'if and when', and it depends on the changing nature of the advice, but from what you're saying, I think we can probably anticipate that, as we go forward, there will probably be fewer schools opening and operable\u2014that we may be moving those children on to fewer sites. So, we already know that one of our local authorities already has identified a strategic pattern of schools that they will want to operate in this way. That local authority has already chosen those locations, and is already having communications with how they will then staff those centres. That, I expect, in the longer term, will be the nature of the provision that we will get to. The local authorities are best placed to understand what is the best, pragmatic use of the resources that they have available; and of course those resources, primarily, are human beings. So, we've talked a lot this morning in the context of teaching staff, teaching assistants, but we're also having discussions with local authorities, and I met with the Council for Wales of Voluntary Youth Services this week, to look at deploying youth workers, to look to be deploying other staff that the local authority may employ, like sports development officers. Welsh Government will be talking with a range of our partners who perhaps their normal activities can't continue at the moment, but actually have personnel who want to add to this effort, who want to be able to be part of a provision going forward in the longer term, to be able to provide a great place for children to be. Let's think about it, in these worst of times, we're asking parents to leave their children so that they can go and do essential work, and some of that essential work is putting themselves at risk, potentially. And we want to give those parents confidence that, when they leave their child with us, that child will receive something really worthwhile, and they can direct all of their attention to doing their job. Janet, have you got a supplementary on schools now, not on early years settings? janet finch-saunders am: I lost the signal before, so it's a little bit confusing at this end, so bear with me. Just in terms of the closure of schools, I have been asked by teachers what does new purpose\u2014you may have covered it, but bear in mind [Inaudible.]\u2014mean in practice. And also, they're already asking what will next\u2014? I know you said earlier that next week could look and probably will look significantly different than this week, but what can they expect to be happening next week in terms of this new purpose work? lynne neagle am: We've covered that, Janet. kirsty williams am: First of all, Janet, I just want to say thank you very much for your kind comments. lynne neagle am: I think you're having trouble hearing us, aren't you, so I think\u2014? janet finch-saunders am: No, I heard that loud and clear. lynne neagle am: But I think you missed the earlier comments, when we went into some detail on the new purpose of schools. dawn bowden am: Just in relation to special schools and how they will fit into this new purpose arrangement. We know, again, that some of these children are our most vulnerable and they are some of our most pressurised families. We'll be having discussions about what arrangements can be made for those children within their own usual settings. Can I give a shout out to the work of Rhondda Cynon Taf in this regard, who are already doing some excellent work with regard to how they can keep in touch with their children who usually would attend their special schools. steve davies: I think special schools have already been hit by this challenge, because a significant proportion of their children, because of their conditions, have not been coming to school, they've been isolated. But the principle we've used there is, actually, even if it's a minority of children who go to those schools and are vulnerable, they deserve and need that support through the school. But similarly, even in special schools, there will be children whose parents will be key workers, so we would expect them to apply that same principle. Just quickly in response to the earlier question, while we may bring some groups of children into separate schools, we\u2019ll have to continue with the principle of keeping social distance and any provision for a child in a special school in a different setting would be unlikely, given the nature of the special school, so we would look to cater for that within the original school. It\u2019s likely, because I know it has already happened, that some schools might actually close before Monday. Are you quite happy that headteachers still have the discretion to do that, if they feel that\u2019s the right thing to do? kirsty williams am: In this situation, the discretion of the head still remains. As I said, we will be communicating with all schools today about our expectations, if at all possible, to have schools open for staff to do some of this planning and to be able to respond to these priority needs that we've just talked about. steve davies: The rationale of headteachers for closing schools up to now has been that they can't cope with the safety of the children. I think, moving forward, it's unlikely that that would be a rationale that headteachers would want to use for not engaging and planning for the future. dawn bowden am: We're only talking about one more day, now, anyway, aren't we? So, just in terms of confirmed cases in schools, is your view at this stage that, if there is a confirmed case in a school, once that school has been deep-cleaned, it can reopen again? kirsty williams am: If we had a confirmed case in a school, then all the usual mechanisms arranged by Public Health Wales would kick in at that point. I know that kind of crosses over into somebody else's portfolio as well, but I think we know that. Certainly what I've seen, and I'm sure this is true elsewhere as well, we've seen nurseries closing down because the parents are actually taking the children out of those nurseries. I've got one in particular, there are kids from the ages of 6 to 12 years in there, and the parents are taking them out. They've got 30 staff there, catering for 200 children and no children to care for and the organisation, at this stage, is unable to claim on their insurance for the ongoing payment of those staff wages. Is there any advice that we can give to people in that situation at this stage? kirsty williams am: Sure. As you say, many of these settings are businesses\u2014people's businesses and they play a hugely important role and it's a very worrying time for them. We have said that we will continue to pay for childcare, delivered under the childcare offer even when a child is unable, or a parent is unwilling, to take up that place. So, if that setting is receiving a childcare payment from the Welsh Government as part of our childcare offer, that will be paid, regardless of whether that child attends or not. And I know that we're also working with local authorities to ensure a similar position on Flying Start childcare and early education. It's also important that childcare settings will be able to apply for the various packages of support that are being made available by my colleague, Ken Skates. hefin david am: Yes, I'd just like to turn that around from the parents' point of view. With schools closing, there are a lot of parents then losing 10 hours of free childcare, but from a settings point of view, they'll continue to be able to receive, for the time being, the nursery care. kirsty williams am: Yes, so the decision that has been taken by my colleague, Julie Morgan, is that settings should stay open at the moment unless public health changes. Again, the issue is that we know that that childcare is vital to many families, especially\u2014and we're particularly concerned about those individuals who are trying to help us overcome and solve these problems. If you have any specific questions about that, we'll be happy to take them back to Julie Morgan. janet finch-saunders am: Is this the Cylch question? lynne neagle am: Yes, please. Yes, just basically, Cylch Meithrin, there are concerns\u2014[Interruption.] lynne neagle am: We've lost Janet. kirsty williams am: I think if the issue is about funding for Cylch Meithrin, these are not normal circumstances. As a Welsh Government, we will take every step to provide continuity of funding, if at all possible. We will overcome this, and when we overcome this situation we find ourselves in, we will need those childcare settings, we will need those private businesses and we will need our Cylch Meithrin to be there to respond and to be able to go on doing the job that they usually do for us. And if there is any way that we can, as a Government, ensure that that happens by carrying on funding things, even if they are not able to run, all usual\u2014[Inaudible.]\u2014 around service-level agreements are off. [Laughter.] But, you know, we will not undermine businesses and voluntary provision like Cylch by withdrawing Welsh Government funding. lynne neagle am: If we can move on to talk about exams, obviously you made the announcement yesterday. I completely understand that everything is a very fast-moving situation, but, as you know, there are a lot of questions that people have about young people who've put a lot of work in. Are you able to tell us any more today? In particular, have you got any idea about timescales now for setting out what the approach will be to handling the lack of summer exams? kirsty williams am: Yes, it is a devastating decision to have to have been taken, but I have done so on the very, very clear and unambiguous advice from Qualifications Wales. What was most important to them was that I made an early decision and I did not equivocate on what would happen for the exams. I was able to make an informal decision at that meeting, and then, of course, there is a formal process that we have to go through. That, now, allows Qualifications Wales and the exam board to operationalise that decision, and they will be communicating with schools as quickly as possible about what schools will need to do to ensure that the systems that they will now put in place can work. We are trying, as far as we can, as I understand it, to be able to mirror as closely as possible the usual results day, for instance. It might not be possible, because, of course, we're dealing with a situation that requires human beings to be involved in it, and those human beings could find themselves unwell. So, our best attempts will be to maintain the normal rhythm of an exams day in August, but that has to be caveated by the fact that we're dealing with difficult circumstances. But, the WJEC and Qualifications Wales will be making urgent communications to exam centres to explain what will need to happen next. janet finch-saunders am: Yes, I think I raised it yesterday, Kirsty, but you were receiving loads of questions. I'd just ask for some further clarification about coursework, because only 30 per cent of that is done. Years 11 and 13, typically, in my case they're what's been raised with me\u2014do you have any advice for them? kirsty williams am: Okay, so, all exams are cancelled, but year 11 and year 13 will be given a grade\u2014I think that's a distinction that people need to be aware of. That is because those years and those grades are gateway qualifications, and they are points of movement in the education system. So, it's really important for those students that they are not disadvantaged in any way by not being able to receive a grade that helps them to make a decision as a qualifying step into what they will do next, whether that be university, whether that be a degree apprenticeship or whether that be going into sixth form, into a college, into an apprenticeship or into some work-based learning opportunities. That's why we have to focus on those children, because for them, it is absolutely critical that we do. We are at an advantage in Wales, can I say? Because of the nature of our examination system, those students already have a lot of externally assessed work that we can use as a basis to move forward on. Our year 11s, if they're doing triple science, they've already done 40 per cent of their paper, so we're very fortunate. Because of the structures that we have got in our qualification system, there is already lots and lots of externally-verified work that we can use, alongside, potentially, teacher evaluation of students as well. What will also be important is that these children have confidence in those qualifications, and so we will be looking at a modulated arrangement within Wales, and I know that Qualifications Wales are discussing with their counterparts across the UK a modulated system across the UK. So, actually, we can make sure that our standards are maintained by actually having that modulation across the UK. So, we know that those children never have to worry about the rigour that has gone into determining that grade. You'll know that the National Union of Students has suggested that black and minority ethnic children and children from the working class, on the whole, don't do as well, in terms of their assessment by their own teachers. We also know, of course, that boys tend to do better in exams, and girls tend to do better at coursework, for whatever reason\u00a0that is. So, just to ask you at this early stage to build in those considerations around potential unconscious bias into that overall system that you're talking about. And, of course, you are right to say that, because we have got some elements of external moderation here, those factors may be less for us in Wales than they might for colleagues in England. kirsty williams am: Yes, I think we are starting at a different base, thank goodness. As I said, students will have done unit 1 papers last year if they're GCSE students. I have every confidence that they and the WJEC will come up with a very comprehensive way of establishing those grades, but I have to say, in some ways, I have to step back now, because you would not expect me, in normal circumstances, to dictate to the WJEC how much percentage goes for that, and how much percentage is allocated for that; that would not be appropriate for a Minister. My job is to make the decision on the examinations on the basis of having confidence that what can be put in place is fair and is equitable, and I have confidence that that will be the case. One is, obviously, pupils are being asked to work at home as well now, some of whom will be doing GCSE and A-level courses. So, there's just a question, generally, from me\u2014 because we're encouraging these kids to carry on working\u2014how that will be accommodated by Qualifications Wales, I guess, in this modulation process. It may be that your at-home work will be of a higher standard or a lower standard than a teacher would be expecting. Secondly, you mentioned the AS-levels, of course, as being of value at the moment, but we've got people in Year 12 who now won't be doing their ASs. Is there any steer at this stage about what they will be expected to do? Will they be doing two sets of exams next year, for example? Or is AS just off the table? In which case, how are the A2s going to be calculated in due course? And then, finally from me, we do have some vocational qualifications that are up for examination as well\u2014your BTECs, and I think it's the Association of Accounting Technicians, which is a lot of computer-based learning\u2014which is due to be examined within three weeks. I appreciate that you may not have the answer just at the moment, but are they off as well is the question, I guess? kirsty williams am: With regard to\u00a0AS-levels\u2014no final decision has been made for exactly how those students will be treated. There are a range of options that could be used, but again, we will want to be thinking about student well-being, fairness and equity in that regard, and I will update Members as soon as I have received definitive advice from Qualifications Wales around that, and that hasn't happened yet. With regard to other types of qualifications, as you will be aware, the vast majority of BTECs is a modular, continually-assessed piece of work, and we would have every expectation that BTECs will be able to be awarded, but clearly, those conversations are with awarding bodies\u2014they tend to be UK awarding bodies, rather then necessarily our WJEC exam board\u2014and those conversations are ongoing. But I have every expectation that those qualifications will be awarded and, of course, because of their nature there's even more evidence of continued assessment. Huw, I don't know if there's anything else that you would like to add about those types of qualifications. I don't have a definitive answer for the ATT qualification, but we can look into that and come back to you. suzy davies am: Well, I've just had a constituent ask, so that would be very helpful. suzy davies am: \u2014is that going to count towards the assessments, overall assessments? kirsty williams am: Well, potentially, as I said. What will be absolutely necessary is that Qualifications Wales and the WJEC will be able to give absolute clarity and simplicity around how those grades will be arrived at, because parents, teachers and students will want to know that, and my expectation is on them to be able to clearly communicate what elements will and will not be taken into consideration when awarding those grades. lynne neagle am: And, just before we move on, have the universities across the UK indicated that they are content with this approach going forward\u2014content to accept students on this basis? kirsty williams am: Certainly. There have been discussions with universities and UCAS, of course, that this also has a bearing on. And the views of university and how university terms might be impacted is one of the ways and one of the reasons that we've factored in to making these decisions. Those discussions with universities are ongoing, aren't they, Huw? huw morris: Yes. So, we've been in regular conversation with Universities Wales and through them with Universities UK and we've received every indication that the approach that's been adopted here has been welcomed by the institutions. Those conversations will continue as we work through the practicalities of how the gradings that are awarded are going to feed through into university admissions decisions and enrolment. Well, we've got some questions now from Suzy on the potential closures of colleges and universities. I appreciate you've already indicated there are lots of ongoing conversations, but my understanding is whether colleges or universities close is pretty much still at their own discretion. We're going to be asking some questions on emergency legislation shortly, which may impact on the answer you can give today, but what sort of conversations are you having with FE and HE at the moment about how they decide? kirsty williams am: Well, you're absolutely right. As we often say in this committee, universities are autonomous institutions\u2014a status that they guard jealously and we would never want to question. Universities have been making the decision to move as much of their learning online as they possibly can and we continue to have conversations with them. Colleges are in a similar position, looking to do as much as they can to be able to provide continuity of learning via distance learning methods, and the Bill, potentially, does give us more powers of intervention in both the FE and the HE sector. suzy davies am: I might ask you about that in a minute, because I don't even know what the Bill says yet. kirsty williams am: Huw, I don't know if there's anything you want to add. huw morris: No\u2014just to confirm what's been said and also to add in that independent training providers, similarly autonomous, like colleges and universities, have been moving in the same direction. We've been very impressed with the maturity and forward-planning that's been adopted by all of those institutions and their representative bodies. We've got consistency in the approach and a common desire, and investment in moving towards online support for students. Certainly, colleges have indicated, as with schools, that, for the most vulnerable learners, they'll have something in place that might permit attendance on an individual basis. huw morris: That's my understanding, yes, and, again, we've been in regular conversation with them about that. My understanding is that they're going to spend the next week working through the detail of how that will work for the institutions. You indicated that any Welsh Government support's going to stay, whatever the circumstances are\u2014in your portfolio. helen mary jones am: Just further to EMA, of course, at the moment, that has an attendance qualification, doesn't it? And you don't get your EMA if you don't turn up. Should we take from your last answer that that attendance qualification doesn't apply anymore? kirsty williams am: Yes. They can't turn up if the institution is not open, and that's not their fault. helen mary jones am: No, but that is something that's been a worry, so that's really encouraging to hear. Thinking about students in higher education, can you give an assurance that student maintenance payments will continue as normal? Is that the intention? kirsty williams am: Yes. And have you given any special ministerial instruction to Student Finance Wales on processing applications for support or changes of circumstances, or is that something that's kind of ongoing at the moment? kirsty williams am: Those conversations are ongoing with the Student Loans Company. Individual student circumstances could well change and our expectation would be that the Student Loans Company would respond to that. All I would say is, just to remind people: people who work for the Student Loans Company are no more able to resist this disease than anybody else. There will undoubtedly in some cases be really practical challenges to service delivery, simply because organisations could be losing staff because of illness or the need to self-isolate or because they are reacting to social-distancing messages from the Government. So, I think we just need to bear that in mind: that these organisations are doing their best, but, if they are badly affected by staff numbers being off because of the virus, then I hope people will give them due consideration. helen mary jones am: Yes, that makes sense, of course, because we've been told that universities won't be able to entirely close, because there will be students who can't go home\u2014 kirsty williams am: It is their home. What discussions have you been having with the sector to make sure that those students' basic needs are met, that there's still food, shelter, whatever they need? kirsty williams am: Well, obviously, universities have a duty of care to those students that find themselves in those circumstances, and every conversation that Huw's been having would suggest that universities are well aware of their need to do that. huw morris: We instituted a monitoring process very early on in the onset of the disease, not least because a number of institutions have campuses and activities in China and other parts of south-east Asia. And so, as the disease has progressed, we've seen lessons being learned from the support for students who are in isolation coming from there to the UK, and I am assured that the universities here in Wales have got processes in place that support those learners. And on this specifically\u2014last question from me\u2014 have you considered whether students might need to be refunded some of their tuition fees, should the academic year not be completed? huw morris: So, as the institutions move more and more of their material and some of their assessment online, clearly, there are lessons that will need to be taken on board. There are established quality assurance and enhancement procedures in institutions to enable the tutors and other supporters to make sure that that material meets their needs. There are appeals mechanisms and feedback mechanisms through the students union and through course committees and other things within institutions to make sure that any concerns or incomplete work are addressed. Failing those institutional mechanisms, there is a UK-wide system through the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for students to take forward any concerns that they have. So, we're confident that that system will be robust and will make sure that the students are getting a course of learning that meets their needs. But thinking just a little bit more broadly about the mental health and well-being of staff and learners across a range of educational settings, or, indeed, young people who can't access educational settings, what considerations are you giving to how that mental health and well-being might be supported through what is an incredibly difficult time for everyone? kirsty williams am: Yes, that is correct. So, our expectation would be that during a prolonged period of closure\u2014which I think, if we're honest, we have to acknowledge is what we're looking at\u2014we would expect school staff\u2014well-being staff, for instance in school\u2014to be doing check-ins\u2014phone check-ins, potentially, or FaceTime check-ins, with students, just to keep in touch with them as we go forward. We'll be looking to promote amongst young people\u00a0a range of online facilities that are available\u2014so, for instance, Meic website\u2014so, looking to use a variety of platforms. I'm concerned, of course, that for some children their access to their counsellor is\u00a0via their school. We know that, and we're just double checking the capacity of online counselling that already exists\u2014online counselling tools that children already use because they don't want to go to the counsellor in the school and be seen in the school corridor going to the counsellor. They're already using those online methods and we expect to be able to continue, as far as possible, those kinds of mechanisms where children can have their mental health needs and their questions answered, and their worries. One of the reasons, again, that we wanted to keep schools going as long as possible\u2014and teachers have been working so hard to do that\u2014is because that routine of going into school and that normality is one that we've needed and wanted to maintain. Children will have worries about their own health; they'll have worries about the health of their parents and their grandparents; they will be consuming potentially media and news stories that have empty supermarket shelves. So, we need to understand, and I think we will also have to recognise, that this support will have to be ongoing once we're back to normal, and we will have to continue to look to support children in the longer term who will have lived through this experience. They are incredibly resilient, and they have been the champions of some of our public health messages. They are so much better and so much more compliant on the whole 'washing your hands' and things like that than even adults have been. So, they are incredibly resilient, but we also have to recognise that it can be a really worrying time for them. helen mary jones am: Can I just\u2014? Just a supplementary to that\u2014you've mentioned already, Kirsty, the importance of youth services, and, particularly thinking voluntarily youth services, you've given the commitment, when were talking about Mudiad Ysgolion Meithrin earlier, that services that are part-funded by grants through the Welsh Government, for example, thinking of the national youth voluntary service\u2014will those be able to be maintained even if settings have had to be shut as well? Obviously, local authorities will have to make their own decisions about whether youth settings are kept open, but, in terms of the direct support from Welsh Government, can organisations that receive it rely on that through this time? kirsty williams am: No formal decision has been made, but if people are in receipt of a Government grant from my department to run a service and that service can no longer run because of the public\u2014 helen mary jones am: Because it's not safe. kirsty williams am: \u2014because it's not safe to do so, I do not foresee that we will be turning around and saying, 'We'll have our money back, thank you very much.' lynne neagle am: Okay, thank you. The normal rules of engagement have to change and, those organisations, we'll need them to be providing youth services for children when we are back to normal, and we wouldn't want to do anything that would undermine their ability to do that. When we're trying to maintain services for vulnerable children and for front-line staff children, they have a valuable role to play and I know that local government and the Council for Wales of Voluntary Youth Services are already in discussion about how youth services\u2014. Those traditional youth clubs, because of austerity, are not necessarily there anymore, so they are well used to being out and about and doing outreach work, and they will have an important part to play in the services that we talked about earlier. Hefin, briefly, and then we're going to take one final question from Suzy on emergency legislation. I'll declare an interest as a parent of a child with additional learning needs, although the question I'm about to ask doesn't reflect her interests. Additional learning needs pupils who are waiting outcomes of referrals\u2014if they're currently waiting an outcome of a referral, will that process will be suspended or will it continue as normal? And, if it is suspended, will it pick up where it left off from this point? kirsty williams am: I think we have to recognise that the ability to deliver business as usual has been massively compromised. I'm sure people will try and continue to do their normal activities and their normal jobs, but that might not be possible. I don't want to give you any false assurance if, actually, the intelligence on the ground is that that simply will not be able to happen. But we don't\u2014 hefin david am: Can we have a clear line on that? kirsty williams am: We don't want to jeopardise anybody, but as I said, some of the normal services are simply not available as everybody turns their attention to trying to respond to the pandemic. Final question\u2014because I know that the Minister's got a lot of things that she needs to get on with\u2014from Suzy on emergency legislation. suzy davies am: I'm not going to ask you if you'll use any powers you get under the emergency legislation, but are you able to give us some indication of what they might be? kirsty williams am: Sure. For instance, the Bill will provide Welsh Ministers with powers to temporarily close schools or other educational institutions, childcare premises; powers to give temporary continuity direction\u2014so, actually, the other way around, force things to be open\u2014and to be able to direct resources. So, that includes, as I said, I could direct something to stay open if that institution was trying to close down. The powers also give flexibility to maybe be able to direct staff to other institutions that they would not normally work in, if that was part of our resilience needs. We'd also be looking at, for instance, relaxing requirements around ratios in childcare settings, or we might be wanting to do things around food. If there is a continuing role for schools in providing food, we might have to be a bit more flexible about what that might look like. So, those kinds of flexibilities\u2014to be able to suspend things, direct things\u2014that we would not normally have in normal circumstances. And just to finish this one off\u2014you may not be able to answer this one, in all fairness\u2014in those situations where it's the Government who says 'no' to various things, does that then help people in the situation of Dawn's nursery, and insurance claims suddenly become more likely? kirsty williams am: I'm not an expert on insurance, and I don't know if anybody here can help me. But what my understanding is, is that even where Government has given a direction that does not necessarily mean that you will be covered by your insurance. What we're finding in the private sector is that insurance companies are not paying out, because even when a Government has directed it, they do not regard this as a disruption to business. kirsty williams am: It's not my area of expertise, but from what I understand from discussions around the Cabinet table, this is particularly problematic. Let me give you an example about how we've been trying to overcome some of this\u2014it feels like an awfully long time ago now\u2014 you'll be aware that we gave directions earlier around cancellation of school trips abroad. Trying to make sure that that direction came from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, rather than the Department for Education was a real battle, because again there were fears that, unless that advice came from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, insurance would not kick in, and that was a two-day discussion. kirsty williams am: So, these are the kinds of things that we're grappling with. But, as I said, thinking about it, that was only last week, but it feels like an aeon ago. suzy davies am: I'm not holding you to that, but it helps us manage the questions we get asked. kirsty williams am: Yes, but as I said, insurance is not my area of expertise. Can I thank you for attending this morning, and your officials? We do recognise what an incredibly challenging time this is, and we'd like to place on record our thanks to all of you for the work that you're doing to try and see us through this crisis. Item 3, then, is a motion under Standing Order 17.42 to resolve to exclude the public for the remainder of the meeting<doc-sep>anthony rota (nipissingtimiskaming, lib.)): I call the meeting to order.  Welcome to the third meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. Pursuant to the order of reference of Monday, April20, the committee is meeting for the purposes of considering ministerial announcements, allowing members to present petitions, and questioning ministers of the crown, including the Prime Minister, in respect of the COVID-19 pandemic. I understand there's an agreement to observe a moment of silence in memory of the six members of the Canadian Armed Forces who lost their lives last Wednesday in a helicopter crash off the coast of Greece. Colleagues, we meet today to continue our discussion about how our country is dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. As we do, Canadians, like everyone around the world, are doing their best to live their lives until things improve. Meanwhile, as we look towards the future, I believe that it is also important to remember our past and to continue to mark the important moments in our shared history. Andrea McCrady, is performing a special recital to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Netherlands by the Canadian Forces. In May 1945, Canadian Forces played a major role in liberating the Dutch people from Nazi occupation. May 5 is now a national holiday in the Netherlands that commemorates the event and the great friendship that now exists between our two countries. Let me remind you that, as in the House or in committee, members may not take photographs of their colleagues or film the proceedings. In order to facilitate the work of our interpreters and ensure orderly meetings, I will outline a few rules. If you look at the bottom, you have a little flag that indicates whether it's English or French, and that's how we will be speaking.  I would like to remind members that petitions presented during a meeting of the special committee must already have been certified by the clerk of petitions.  In addition, to ensure that the petition is considered to have been properly presented, the certificate of the petition and each page of the petition for petitions certified in a previous Parliament should be emailed to the committee no later than 6 p.m. It includes removing the mandatory 10-day reflection period and the number of required witnesses who will witness a person's consent. The petitioners urge the House of Commons to immediately discontinue the removal of safeguards for people requesting euthanasia, and to put in place additional measures to protect vulnerable people. Petitioners call on members of the House, and hopefully the Senate as well, to support Bill S-204, which would make it a criminal offence for a person to go abroad and receive an organ for which there has not been consent. It would also create provisions under which a person could be made inadmissible to Canada if they had been involved in organ harvesting or trafficking. I want to remind all the members that there are specific headsets that have been mandated to all of us. If you don't have one, please talk to your IT ambassador and they will get one to you as quickly as possible. The reason for them is not so much for what you hear, but that our interpreters are working and there are work conditions that really make it difficult. Part of that is not having the appropriate boom on your headset, which will make it very difficult for them to hear and interpret for our members. The petitioners have noted that there are approximately 60 indigenous languages in Canada and that 2019, last year, was declared by the UN to be the year of indigenous languages. They draw attention to article 13 of the UNDRIP and to the TRC's calls to action numbers 13 to 16. Fundamentally, they call upon the Government of Canada to recognize indigenous languages as being official languages of Canada and to have each language recognized nationally, with implementations on regional and provincial levels, acknowledging that many regions have different languages. Chair, I am proud to present a petition on behalf of one of my constituents, Myles Lynch of St. Myles lives with cystic fibrosis and has had three lung transplants in the last five years, and he's only 22 years old. One thing Myles has been advocating for is the creation of a national opt-out program for organ donation. I am proud to have this certified today, with 1,318 signatures, asking the Standing Committee on Health to launch a study into the feasibility of the creation of a national opt-out program. I give kudos to Myles not only for his strength personally but also for his advocacy for others and for saving lives in our country by advocating for a better and an improved organ donation system. Chair, I'm very pleased to present this certified petition on behalf of several dozen residents of Toronto, Mississauga and Brampton, Ontario, who add their voices to those of the thousands upon thousands of Canadians who have signed similar petitions. Given that Canadians are living through unprecedented, catastrophic climate events, and at the same time our society, as you know, is suffering from worsening social and economic inequalitieshalf of Canadian families are only $200 away from insolvency in any given monthand particularly given the pandemic that we are currently experiencing, these petitioners are calling on the Government of Canada to support motion M-1, a made-in-Canada green new deal that I am presenting in front of the House of Commons. It calls on Canada to take bold and rapid action to tackle the climate emergency, and to put in place a shift to a clean and renewable energy economy. Chair, it's an honour to table a petition on behalf of constituents from CourtenayAlberni. Over 12,000 Canadians have died over the last four years due to fentanyl-poisoned sources. They cite that the current war on drugs has been costly and grossly ineffective; that it has resulted in widespread stigma towards addiction and against those who use illicit drugs; and that criminalization of particular substances has resulted in the establishment of a drug trade that now trafficks dangerous and lethal products such as fentanyl. They are citing that regulating to ensure safe sources, with proper measures and bylaws, will reduce the criminal element associated with street drugs. They are calling on the Government of Canada to declare the current opioid overdose and fenanyl poisoning crisis a national public health emergency under the Emergencies Act. They are calling for the government to reform current drug policy to decriminalize personal possession, as has been done in Portugal and other countries, and to create with urgency and immediacy a system to provide safe and unadulterated access to substances so that people who use substances experimentally, recreationally or chronically are not at imminent risk of overdose due to a contaminated source. Chair, I'm presenting a petition today that contains the concerns of Canadians in my riding with the government's approach to firearms legislation and regulation. The petition highlights that the Liberal government's December 5, 2019, Speech from the Throne contains numerous inaccuracies about current firearms legislation and regulation; that the term military-style assault rifles is a political phrase undefined in Canadian law; that municipalities are constitutionally unable to enact criminal law to ban handguns in their jurisdictions; that the experts, including chiefs of police, agree that banning firearms and requiring law-abiding gun owners to follow more unnecessary red tape will not increase public safety; that the majority of guns used in violent crimes are smuggled into Canada from the United States; and that the Liberal government continues to target law-abiding firearms owners instead of the gangs, drug traffickers and illegal gun traffickers responsible for violence in our communities. The petitioners in MissionMatsquiFraser Canyon are calling on the government to stop targeting law-abiding firearms owners; to cancel all plans to confiscate firearms legally owned by federally licensed, RCMP-vetted Canadians; and to focus our limited resources on anti-gang enforcement, on reducing the involvement of at-risk youth and gangs, on mental health and on providing the Canada Border Services Agency with the tools they need to do their job effectively. I would like to remind honourable members that no member shall be recognized for more than five minutes at a time and that members may split their time with one or more members by so indicating to the chair. I want to again remind honourable members to use the boom on the official headsets so that everything runs smoothly, not only for ourselves but also for the interpreters. pierre paul-hus (charlesbourghaute-saint-charles, cpc): Thank you, Mr.Chair. Although we are right in the middle of a pandemic and the government has agreed to set aside all parliamentary business in order to concentrate solely on eliminating the virus in Canada and its impacts, the Prime Minister is deceiving Canadians by introducing measures to punish law-abiding firearm owners. justin trudeau (prime minister): Mr.Chair, I feel that all Canadians were affected by the massacre in Nova Scotia. During the last election campaign, we promised to ban military-style assault weapons, and that is exactly what we have done. It is a shame that, once more, the Conservatives do not want to strengthen gun control in the country. However, I would like to know whether he considers that, with this order in council, organized crime, street gangs and other criminals are simply going to turn in their weapons. We are doing other things to eliminate or restrict handguns in our municipalities, to strengthen the control at our borders, and to implement other measures. member speak of those measures, because we are going to work together in the House to strengthen gun control. I hope that the Conservative Party will be part of that discussion in a positive way, in order to keep Canadians safe. pierre paul-hus: Mr.Chair, I can simply say to the Prime Minister that the Conservative Party has always been committed to battling criminals, not law-abiding citizens. Speaking of criminals, we know that, even before the pandemic, the Prime Minister had asked the Parole Board of Canada to release prisoners more easily and more quickly. The Minister of Public Safety told us that the people were approaching the end of their sentences or were older, but we are learning in the media that some dangerous criminals are being released. justin trudeau: The protection, the safety and the health of all Canadians are important for the government. This is why we have taken additional measures in our correctional services to ensure that guards and inmates are protected. We have indeed opened the doors to some more speedy releases, but only in very specific cases that present little or no danger for Canadians. pierre paul-hus: So is the Prime Minister confirming to us that no dangerous criminals have been precipitously released so that they do not have to experience COVID-19 within the walls? right hon. justin trudeau: There are very strict rules and principles to ensure that people posing a threat to society are not released. Is Canada going to stand by its allies in the Five Eyes and demand that the Chinese government be completely transparent? right hon. justin trudeau: We continue to stand in solidarity with our allies, including the Five Eyes, as they have stood in solidarity with Canada in terms of the two Canadians who have been unjustly detained for a long time in China. In the coming months and years, we expect to obtain answers to all our questions about the origin of this pandemic, including questions that are important for China. At the same time, we are going to work hard to ensure that all Canadians have the equipment and the protection they need to get through this pandemic. yves-franois blanchet (beloeilchambly, bq): Thank you, Mr.Chair. For some days, discussions have been going on between people from the Bloc Qubcois and people from the government with a view to collaboratively coming up with a proposal for seniors in Quebec and Canada. The gist of our proposal is to temporarily increase the old age security by about $25per week, or $110per month. The discussion has been going on for some time and it's a proposal that we made in the election campaign. Given that impatience, I realized I should not be the one answering them, it should be the Prime Minister. So here is my question for the Prime Minister: what are you doing to seek a solution that will increase the purchasing power of seniors in Quebec and Canada in the very short term? right hon. justin trudeau: Clearly, seniors need support and significant services from us because of COVID-19. Our priority was to implement income replacement benefits for workers who have lost their jobs because of COVID-19. The most vulnerable seniors are going to receive reimbursement of the GST, which will help them very quickly. We have also channelled $9million through the United Way, to help the most vulnerable seniors. I am very pleased that we have been able to work with other parliamentarians, including those in the Bloc Qubcois, to hear these concerns and to find the best way to help seniors in the short term. In terms of the pandemic, they have concerns about their physical security, but also about their financial security. yves-franois blanchet: In the last few hours, the Prime Minister has indicated that he could need the cooperation of other parties, including the Bloc Qubcois, on a completely different matter. We are very open to that discussion, but we want the same openness when we are asking for something to serve the people of Quebec. Seniors in my constituency, as in any other of the 338constituencies, are asking what we are doing. When will there be something for them? I want to be able to give them an answer of some kind. justin trudeau: There will be announcements in the coming days on the way in which we will be able to help seniors, particularly the most vulnerable seniors. There are horror stories, whether about the CHSLDs, or about our most vulnerable seniors across the country. There are seniors who are alone, seniors who are afraid of falling ill without ever seeing their grandchildren or their children again. We have to be there for those who belong to that great generation that fought for us during the second world war. Chair, every day I hear from people who are struggling to pay their bills and to keep a roof over their head. Instead of making sure that Canadians get the help they need, the government has created complicated programs that are still letting people fall through the cracks. If the Prime Minister won't commit to a universal benefit, will he at least commit to removing the restrictive eligibility criteria that are leaving the most vulnerable people behind? right hon. Chair, we knew, when this pandemic hit, that we needed to help Canadians who were suffering from coast to coast to coast, particularly the most vulnerable. That is why we moved forward rapidly with the Canada emergency response benefit, which has helped over seven million individual Canadians and has made a huge difference. We had to move very quickly to get this money out to people, and that is exactly what we did. That is why since that moment, we have continually worked on reaching out to the most vulnerable and supporting them as well. However, because she didn't make $5,000 last year, when the pandemic hit she didn't qualify for any benefits. Chair, our focus throughout this crisis has been on helping the most vulnerable with targeted measures that will lift Canadians out of poverty and will support them. Over the past five years, we've lifted over a million people out of poverty in this country, and we've continued to put the most vulnerable at the heart of everything we're doing. At the same time, we will continue to look for more ways to help even more than the seven million Canadians who successfully receive the CERB. We recognize there's more to do, and we will continue trying to do everything we can in this unprecedented situation. Chair, the government is weirdly committed to eligibility criteria that result in regular people not getting the support they need, but not so committed to criteria for corporations and billionaires who get our help. If a company is cheating the public, using offshore tax havens not to pay its fair share, it should not be eligible for government bailouts or benefits. Other countries, like Poland, Denmark and France, have made this commitment, and if they can do it, so can we. Will he commit now that if a company has money in offshore tax havens, it will not receive public funds? right hon. Chair, the measures we've put forward are focused on helping workers who lose their jobs, regardless of the companies they work for. It is a shame to hear the NDP, which used to be the party of workers, choosing to judge workers by which multinational they work for. We have moved forward with a wage subsidy such that the employers are obliged to pass every single penny on to the workers. That is help for the workers, and that has been our focus all the way through: ordinary Canadians who need support because they are unable to work because of COVID-19. I want to remind honourable members that we're trying to stay within committee rules, which state that the length of a question and the length of an answer should be approximately the same amount of time. She has about 45 seconds left, and hopefully that's about half and half for the question and the answer. My community was facing a crisis long before the pandemic hit, and now people who are living on the streets or in parks don't have the luxury of following public health advice and just staying home. In Victoria, the province and the municipality have stepped up with solutions to house people, at least for the short term, in local hotels. Will the federal government respond to this immediate crisis and provide the needed investments in long-term, stable housing? the chair: The right honourable Prime Minister, in 25 seconds or less, please. Working with partners, we have reduced poverty by over a million people in this country, but there is more to do. We recognize that during this pandemic there's even more to do for vulnerable Canadians, and we are partnering with orders of government to make sure that happens. jol godin (portneufjacques-cartier, cpc): A point of order, Mr.Chair. Could we please check so that I can hear in French what the Prime Minister is saying? the chair: Okay. I'm speaking English right now and I'm on the English toggle at the bottom of the screen. It does create a bit of a disjoint when we're speaking, but it's the way to get around that so we have interpretation that works for everyone. Chair, as this is our first opportunity to meet in any forum, I want to take this opportunity to express my condolences to the families of the brave men and women who lost their lives in the helicopter crash. I know that I speak for all parliamentarians when I extend our sympathy to their families and loved ones. Chair, I want to raise with the Prime Minister an issue that I've raised several times before, and that is a gap in the wage subsidy program. Those companies separately would qualify for the wage subsidy, but because of rules that the government designed, together they do not. Even though collectively they have experienced a massive drop in revenue and would otherwise be eligible, so far they've been unable to get confirmation that they will be able to access the program. Will the Prime Minister be able to deliver some good news to people who work for Brandt Tractor all across the country? right hon. justin trudeau: I thank the honourable member for his question and for his advocacy for his community and businesses in his riding. As I told him when we spoke directly, Finance officials have been directly in contact with the company in his riding. We recognize that there are particular elements in regard to this company that are challenging around application for the wage subsidy, but I know that Finance officials are working very hard to try to make sure that everyone who needs the subsidy gets it, so that the workers in his community can get the support they need. andrew scheer: The Prime Minister knows that there are many companies across the country that fall into this category as well, so we're hoping for some good news. Just flagging the time and date, it is well into May now and important decisions have to be made in very short order. There are other aspects of the government's plans to help get people through this crisis that are also causing people to fall through the cracks. As provinces start to open up, many companies are going to be faced with a very difficult decision of operating at perhaps 35% or 45% of regular revenues. They will not be able to access these programs and, in many cases, there is going to be a disincentive to reopen and put people back to work. Will the Prime Minister amend these programs to provide for more flexibility so that more and more Canadians can start to return to work in the weeks ahead? right hon. Chair, we are in an unprecedented crisis and we had to move quickly to support workers and to support families across the country, and that's exactly what we did. We're going to continue to work to try to respond to the reality that people and businesses are facing right across the country. I am eager to be faced with the challenge of how to ease off in these measures so that people can get back to work. We are still focused very much on giving the supports to workers and families that are so necessary in this time of crisis. As different provinces move forward towards reopening, as we look at different paths forward, I know that I will be able to count on all members in the House and, indeed, on Canadians from coast to coast to coast to figure out together what the best way will be to move forward on keeping us safe and restoring economic activity in the right way. the chair: We have about a minute left for maybe a 30-second question and a 30-second answer. The problems with them have been flagged for the government for weeks as well, but we're also going to see an additional challenge, where people who are receiving the emergency response benefit, who may have the option to go back to work and work some hours, are faced with a hard cap of $1,000 a month before they lose the CERB. Conservatives are proposing a progressive system, a more flexible system, where people will be able to earn more without losing their benefits as businesses ramp up but before normal working hours are restored. Again, will the Prime Minister build in some flexibility to lift the restrictive ceiling on what people can earn before losing benefits so that it always pays more to work? the chair: I believe the timer is telling all of us that the time is up, but I'll give the right honourable Prime Minister about 30 seconds to answer that, please. Our priority was getting support for Canadians right across the country with the CERB, with the wage subsidy and with other measures for students, for seniors, for farmers and for agricultural producers. We are going to work with communities and with industry as we look to reopen, to make sure that people have opportunities to work and are not penalized for it. However, our overarching priority was allowing Canadians to be confident in their ability to stay home, care for their loved ones, buy groceries and pay their rent so that we could keep safe during this pandemic. We've heard the Prime Minister admit that fixed incomes for some of them are down, rent is increasing and the price of groceries is increasing. Chair, after a lifetime of hard work, of course Canadians deserve peace of mind when it comes to their retirement security. Happily, their pensions and their benefits are still flowing, unlike for so many of those who have lost their jobs, but it's still tough. People received a GST credit, a supplementary payment that was $400 on average for single seniors and $600 for couples. I think you had reminded us as members that the amount of time for the answer should be similar to the amount of time for the question. the chair: I want to remind all honourable members to keep their answers as well as their questions as concise as possible. We see a number of inconsistencies in what is considered essential travel with regard to the U.S. While we have Americans coming over to buy cheaper prescription medications and to fish, individuals in my riding who are trying to get auditors over so that they can be approved for export businesses are being declined. We have people who have purchased masts from Canadian producers for their boats, and who want to come and pick them up, who are not being allowed to do that. When will they clarify the rules to the CBSA agents so that essential travel and trade and commerce, including individual commerce, is understood? hon. Chair, we have implemented very rigorous rules that have been well documented and understood by CBSA to stop all non-essential travel. At the same time, we recognize the importance of maintaining essential supply routes so that goods and services could reach Canada and we could put groceries on our shelves. The work we are doing to stop non-essential travel has been important for the health and safety of Canadians, and we will continue with that work. We see that many of them are not eligible for any of the benefit packages that have been rolled outEI, CERB, the wage subsidy, etc. What is the government going to do to address sole proprietors who are currently falling through the cracks? hon. Chair, first, let me say that we absolutely recognize there are businesses across the country of all sizes that are finding this to be extremely difficult. The intent of the measures we put forward is obviously not only to give individuals a bridge but to give businesses a bridge. We are looking at ways that we can ensure that the Canada emergency business account has the broadest possible application. We are looking at ways we can consider that eligibility process, recognizing that we need to make sure that the program continues to have its desired impact, and we will have more to say on that. Since then the minister has overruled the will of harvesters in Prince Edward Island and in the gulf who voted to start their seasons on time, but she has allowed harvesters from her own riding to proceed with their seasons as scheduled, giving them access to markets weeks before their competitors. This double standard is severely unfair and Atlantic harvesters are furious, as demonstrated during the protests on the Canso Causeway yesterday. When will the minister stop abusing her position and start respecting fish harvesters by opening up lobster fishing areas 23, 24 and 26? hon. Chair, when making decisions with regard to when seasons open, a number of factors are taken into account. They are complex decisions that take into account what is necessary for processors to be ready for the season, what is necessary for harvesters to be ready for the season, as well socio-economic impacts on the area. In the decisions we've made around the gulf, one of the main things we heard from all of those areas is that it was very important for them to start on the same date. Maybe I'll start muting if it's necessary, but interrupting is not going to solve anything. West coast fishing tourism is a key economic driver in British Columbia, especially in coastal communities, and yet the public fishery gets no respect from the government. A year later, the fisheries minister refuses even to discuss viable, science-based solutions to conserve B.C.'s public fisheries. Does the minister and her government have a will and a plan to support Canada's west coast fisheries and the communities they sustain? the chair: The hon. That's why we continue to work with those communities and with the fisheries to make sure that we're doing everything we possibly can to support them. During these extremely difficult times, we're working on measures with the fishery in B.C., as well as on the Atlantic coast and eastern Quebec, to make sure that we're delivering for them and that all of the issues they're having are being addressed. Chair, Canada's seniors, especially those on basic incomes, are being hard hit by the COVID-19 crisis as they face new rising costs and scarcity of services. Seniors require adequate caregiver supports, physical safety and freedom to access their savings to reinforce their financial security. Why has the government failed to recognize the increasing challenges that seniors are facing? Will the government support Canada's senior citizens? the chair: The hon. We have provided a GST credit supplement of $400 for single seniors and $600 for couples, for low- and modest-income seniors. We have also ensured that the Canada emergency response benefit is there for seniors who have lost income due to COVID-19. On April 23, my colleagues and I called on the government to create a program that would match students seeking employment with employers in Canada's essential food supply chains. What has the government done to match students and other Canadians seeking employment with employers in the agriculture and agri-food sectors, including those in the fish and seafood sector? hon. Chair, we're doing all we can to make sure, using our existing employment programs, that we create opportunities for students to work and get work experience this summer. We know that this is going to be really tough, especially in areas like agriculture, so we have dedicated streams for agriculture sector employers to access students with help from the government, and a number of different initiatives including Canada summer jobs, which I'm really excited to see the results of in the coming days. Arnold, it's the second time that I note you've threatened to cut off a Conservative microphone. I'm just wondering, given that this isn't the House of Commons and it's structured as a committee, what standing order would give you the right to cut off a member of Parliament using a mute button. It seems a little dictatorial, and I was just wondering whether you could clarify that, based on the Standing Orders. the chair: I don't think I threatened to use mute, but thank you for bringing that up. I am trying to keep the rules where the questions and the answers are equal, so that there are no interruptions on either side. Bring the papers with the actual verbiage on it where I threatened, and we'll go over it, but I don't think this is the venue to do that. rachael harder (lethbridge, cpc): Canadians have outrightly expressed outrage and disappointment with the government's initiative to put a gun ban in place. Does the minister stand by his comment that these changes would have prevented the tragedy in Nova Scotia? the chair: The honourable minister in 15 seconds or less, please. bill blair: We have heard from health professionals, women's rights organizations, victims groups and the police and our unions. They're all very supportive of the government's measure to ban weapons that have no place in a civil society and were designed to kill people. rachael harder: It's interesting that the minister is misleading Canadians in that comment because the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police has actually said that a gun ban will do nothing of the sort, that it actually will not protect Canadians. How many criminals will see guns seized because of the changes that have been implemented by the Liberal government? hon. The Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police said that they support a prohibition on all military-designed assault rifles. The chief in Toronto said that taking those assault rifles off the streets contributes to public safety, and the Canadian Association of Police Chiefs has declared that military assault rifles are produced for the sole purpose of killing people in large numbers and they urged successive governments to enact legislation to ban all military assault rifles. Absolutely no criminals will see their guns seized based on the Liberals' legislation that's coming forward because it actually goes after those who legally own and use their firearms. Can the Prime Minister please tell us why he decided to go after law-abiding citizens instead of actually going after criminals who have gotten their firearms in an illegal manner and then used them to commit crimes? the chair: The honourable minister in 25 seconds or less, please. bill blair: Yes, to be very clear, the order in council actually is targeted at weapons, weapons that were designed for military use, and in their design and in their intent, to kill people, they've actually been used in this country, at cole Polytechnique; in Moncton; at a Quebec City mosque; in Fredericton; at Mayerthorpe and most recently in Nova Scotia. They are being used and have been used in Canada and around the world to commit mass murder, and in the interest of public safety and at the urging the chair: We'll go on to Ms. Now I understand the Prime Minister has his food prepared for him at 24 Sussex Drive and then it's delivered to him at the cottage where he lives. Now, they're in a crisis right now, which means that regular Canadians are actually at risk of not having food available for them at the grocery stores where they purchase theirs. Why doesn't the Prime Minister care about the women and the men who work incredibly hard to keep Canada fed? hon. chrystia freeland (deputy prime minister and minister of intergovernmental affairs): Mr. member that our government cares very, very much about the women and men who work so hard to feed our country. Let me just say I am grateful to all the farmers, like my dad, who are out in their fields right now getting ready for seeding. We, as Canadians, are lucky to be citizens of an agricultural superpower, and our government believes in supporting our farmers and ranchers. rachael harder: I'm confused as to why the Prime Minister didn't take my question, and at a bare minimum as to why the agriculture minister doesn't feel it's important enough for her to be a part of this discussion today. When we have farmers who produce for Canadians on a daily basis and they're asking some serious and some very important questions, and we don't even have a minister who's willing to come to the table and engage in this conversation, that's shameful. Several meat-packing plants have been forced to shut down because of COVID-19 and, as a result, farmers are forced to hold stock longer than expected. Cattle producers in my region are spending more than $60,000 a day to keep their livestock fed while they wait for processing plants to reopen. When will the government take this seriously and at least implement a set-aside program for those who are beef producers in Canada? hon. Chair, let me just say that I feel there is nothing shameful at all in having me, the Deputy Prime Minister, answer questions about agriculture. I am actually very proud to speak up for Canada's amazing farmers, for our country's amazing ranchers, for our amazing pork producers and our poultry producers. james bezan (selkirkinterlakeeastman, cpc): Thank you, Mr. I too would like to express my sincere condolences to the families and friends of the six military heroes who lost their lives at sea last week. I'm sure that all members of the House stand shoulder to shoulder with the families, with the crew of the HMCS Fredericton and, indeed, with the entire Canadian Armed Forces community during this time of grief. Can the Minister of National Defence give us an update as to the Cyclone helicopter crash off the coast of Greece last week? hon. Our number one priority is to make sure that we look after them, and that's exactly what we are doing. I actually spoke with the Italian minister of defence and he promised full support for this investigation and any support that's required. the chair: I'm afraid I'm going to have to cut you off there, if we're going by the rules that were pointed out by the House. I know that back in early January, military intelligence through CF Intelligence Command was reporting, through the chain of command, the novel coronavirus and the outbreak in Wuhan. On what date was he, as Minister of National Defence, given his first intelligence briefing on the outbreak and the pandemic in China? hon. We work with our Five Eyes intelligence sources and this has been a whole-of-government effort, right from the beginning. Obviously, I can't discuss the intelligence in this forum, but I can assure you that our response has been well informed with the correct information. james bezan: Minister Sajjan, we know that intelligence was going up the chain of command in National Defence. It was reported in the media that in early January the hierarchy within the Canadian Armed Forces was being made aware of the coronavirus outbreak. As with all our intelligence, we work together from a whole-of-government perspective with all of our intelligence agencies. One thing I can assure you is that our response has been well informed with all the correct information that is provided to me and other members of cabinet. james bezan: What was that timeline? From the time you were first told, Minister Sajjan, about the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, what did you do with that intelligence? When did you give it to the Prime Minister or to Minister Hajdu as the Minister of Health? hon. Chair, let me say that our government's response to this global pandemic has of course been informed by the excellent work of Canadian intelligence agencies throughout. In January, the Prime Minister convened a meeting of the incident response group, and in January we increased screening at all major airports. All of these actions were informed by the work of our excellent intelligence community, and of course our work with our Five Eyes, NATO and NORAD allies. james bezan: I want to come back the chair: We now move to Mr.Ste-Marie. gabriel ste-marie (joliette, bq): Can I go ahead, Mr.Chair? the chair: Yes, go ahead. In an interview with Grald Fillion, tax expert Andr Lareau, who specializes in tax havens, pointed out that $350billion Canadian is parked in just 12tax havens. Mr.Lareau also notes that the government is aware that all of this Canadian money is stashed in tax havens but is doing nothing about it. He said that it's time for Canada to tackle the problem given that it has a $250-billion deficit, and that if it doesn't act now to change things, it never will. diane lebouthillier (minister of national revenue): Mr.Chair, as soon as we took office, in 2015, our government made cracking down on tax evaders in Canada and abroad a priority. I realize that my fellow member is impatient, but he has to understand that this is a very complex issue. Under our leadership, in three years, the Canada Revenue Agency has undertaken twice as many audits related to offshore tax evasion as it did in the 10years the Conservatives were in power. As we speak, the agency is conducting more than 50criminal investigations tied to international tax evasion. gabriel ste-marie: You're right, I am very impatient, because whenever I bring up the fact that companies are using tax havens legally, the minister misses the point and tells me that she is going after fraudsters. Since Parliament began sitting virtually, it's been mentioned a few times that Denmark and Poland have decided to deal with the issue. Even France's finance minister, Bruno LeMaire, said that companies with subsidiaries in tax havens would not be eligible for public assistance. We hear thePrime Minister and other government officials say all the time that the wage subsidies are going to workers, so I'd like to cite another examplebanks. The government is injecting huge amounts of cash into the financial system and repurchasing troubled assets in massive quantities, and yet, the five major banks in Toronto, alone, are continuing to save billions of dollars every year by artificially redirecting their profits to tax havens. This has nothing to do with wages for workers, and everything to do with the repurchase of troubled assets, cash flow and billions of dollars that the government could be going after. Is the government going to seize this opportunity to make the corporate use of tax havens illegal? hon. diane lebouthillier: Mr.Chair, our government is taking unprecedented steps through the Canada emergency wage subsidy measure to support businesses and workers affected by COVID-19. What's more, any employer receiving the subsidy who is deemed ineligible will have to repay the full amount. Anyone who abuses the program could face a fine of up to 225% of the wage subsidy amount and up to five years in prison. the chair: Mr.Ste-Marie, you have about 30seconds to ask your question, and about the same for the answer. Although completely immoral, the use of tax havens by companies is legal under section5907 of the Income Tax Regulations. We are going to have a $250-billion deficit to pay off, and everyone is going to have to chip in, including the rich who are currently taking advantage of the system. diane lebouthillier: Mr.Chair, thanks to a historic billion-dollar investment, our government has given the agency the resources it needs to do the job, and we are starting to see results. I'm proud of how the Government of Canada has been beside Canadians through every step of this pandemic and has supported Canadians when they needed it most. In BonavistaBurinTrinity and across our country, our commercial fishery has seen many challenges and impacts. Last week, my colleague, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, announced an investment that will ensure resilience of the food system by allowing Canada's fish and seafood processing sector to safely and efficiently process, store, package and distribute healthy, high-quality products on to the plates of Canadians. The fish harvesters in my riding are fearful of what will happen within this industry and their immediate futures. Chair, I want to thank my colleague from BonavistaBurinTrinity for keeping us well aware of what's happening in his riding with harvesters and with processors. It's the backbone and the lifeblood of our communities and that's why we want to be there to support them. We've already taken steps by making sure that the CERB is now able to be accessed by people who are seasonal workers. As well, we are making sure that people who are running out of fishers EI are also able to qualify for it. We also have made an investment of $62.5 million to support our processors to make sure they are able to be ready for the challenges that they are going to face because of COVID-19. We are working with our partners across industry to make sure we're hearing what their major concerns are. We will have more to say about that and what we will be able to do in the coming days. Chair, in my riding of SurreyNewton, I'm in close contact with businesses that represent all the chair: We have a point of order. damien kurek (battle rivercrowfoot, cpc): Sorry, but there seems to be an issue with the audio. Chair, in my riding of SurreyNewton, I'm in close contact with businesses that represent all vantage points in the supply chainfrom manufacturers to retailers, transport companies to warehousing. With provinces and territories moving at different speeds and implementing different protocols for reopening the economy, there is a lot of confusion in my local business community on the timing and logistics of how this will happen. With so many different parts of the supply chain operating in different jurisdictions, and with each business serving unique roles on this spectrum, how can the federal government serve to best coordinate with the provinces and territories so that the supply chain can be implemented smoothly as we embark on our economic recovery? hon. One of the most important things the federal government can do when it comes to the reopening of the Canadian economy is to work in close collaboration with the premiers of the provinces and territories. That's why I was so pleased that last week the Prime Minister, together with all the first ministers of the country, was able to issue a statement around the principles that will be guiding our entire country as we move towards a restart. This is so important because, as my colleague has pointed out, all of our business, our economic activity, happens across the country. We have been able to work together in fighting coronavirus, and we are going to work together in the future to keep on fighting coronavirus and to reopen Canada. In Alberta, meat-packing plants are directly responsible for nearly a quarter of all COVID-19 cases. The government and management ignored the pleas of workers and did not put effective safety protocols in place to deal with COVID-19. Now, two workers are dead, at least six more are in intensive care and COVID-19 is spreading like wildfire through these communities. On March 27, regarding the CERB, the Minister of Finance said that if workers don't feel comfortable in their work, if they decide to stay home, they can apply for the benefit, yet the website says differently. Will the minister guarantee that every Canadian receiving CERB, EI or the CESB will not lose their benefits if they refuse to return to work or to accept work that is unsafe due to COVID-19? hon. chrystia freeland: Let me thank the member, first of all, for her really very important question. I think all of us share the concern for Canada's essential workers who are keeping us safe, putting food on our tables and often working in difficult conditions. When it comes to the Cargill plant, this is an issue that our government has been very closely engaged in. My colleague, the Minister of Agriculture, has spoken with her provincial counterpart and the head of the plant. To the question my colleague asked about workers, it is absolutely the case that no Canadian should feel they need to work in an environment that is unsafe, and it is also very much the case that any Canadian who is feeling unwell should stay at home. This is the way that collectively we take care of ourselves and we take care the chair: We will go on to Ms. heather mcpherson: I just want to be clear, because I'm not a hundred per cent sure that I got an answer in that response, so I'll try one more time. Knowing that workers have a fundamental right to refuse unsafe work, can the minister confirm one hundred per cent that if workers refuse unsafe work, they will be able to access the CERB, or was the Minister of Finance incorrect when he spoke on March 27? the chair: The honourable minister. chrystia freeland: In a time of coronavirus that is even more the case, and the government of course should not penalize workers for doing the right thing and declining to go to work in unsafe conditions. the chair: I want to remind the honourable members to place their questions through the Chair to avoid back and forth, just to try to keep some order in the meeting. If the provincial government won't shut down the plant, will the federal government shut down unsafe plants through the Canadian Food Inspection Agency? hon. Chair, on the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, let me be very clear that my colleague, the Minister of Agriculture, has been in touch with provincial authorities. The duties of the food inspection agency, of course, are to ensure that the food produced at the plant is safe. We are working closely with provincial authorities and with health authorities to ensure that the chair: We will go back to Ms. Can the finance minister please let us know if Cargill, a company that is owned by billionaires, with business in Luxembourg, a known tax haven, has received any federal funding this year for COVID-related support? hon. diane lebouthillier: This is a tough time for Canadians, and our government is doing everything it can to support them. More than 7million Canadians have applied for the Canada emergency response benefit, which the Canada Revenue Agency and Service Canada administer. I want to say how proud I am of the work the agency is doing; staff worked tirelessly to get the program up and running in record time. richard bragdon (tobiquemactaquac, cpc): Thank you, Mr. Potato farmers in New Brunswick and across Canada are sitting on massive stores of potatoes that were destined for the restaurant industry, but due to the pandemic, they now have no customers. What is the Prime Minister's plan for the helping farmers offload these potatoes so that they are ready for the 2020 season? hon. We are aware that the coronavirus, by keeping us away from restaurants where we eat french fries, has had a profound effect on the market for potatoes. The program announced today by the Prime Minister and my colleague, the Minister of Agriculture, will be very helpful for potato farmers, including with the surplus food program that starts with a $50 million fund, and that the chair: We'll go back to Mr. With an estimated $300 million worth of potatoes in storage, the announced funding from the government today simply doesn't go far enough. How does the Prime Minister plan to mitigate these shortfalls and allow farmers to continue to grow the food we so desperately need? hon. The program today is $252 million, which comes on top of the broad range of other programs that farmers, of course, have access to. On potato farmers, in particular, I agree with the honourable member that this is a specific area of concern. I think all Canadians would like to see those potatoes not be wasted but be used, and that's why the $50 million for surplus food purchase is going to be so helpful. The $16-billion beef industry is expected to take a massive hit due to the closures and reduced production of the meat-packing plants. Does the government truly believe that the announced $125 million that is shared between beef, poultry and pork producers will be enough to support these multi-billion dollar industries so they can put food on the tables of Canadians? hon. Chair, I absolutely agree with the honourable member that our beef, pork and poultry producers are absolutely essential for our country. I am very pleased as a Canadian that we have security that comes from being a country that produces not only enough food for ourselves, but also enough food to feed the world. That is why the $125 million specifically to support our beef, pork and poultry producers is going to be so helpful. Chair, the government's announcement of $252 million for the agriculture sector falls well short of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture's request for immediate government relief for farmers. The president of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture, Mary Robinson, put it today something like this: that if the farmhouse is on fire, the government has offered the equivalent of a bucket of water. Does the government have a plan to offer more than just crumbs to keep the vital agriculture sector operating and providing the food we so desperately need? When will the government finally make those who literally keep our land and grow our food a priority in this time of crisis? hon. Chair, I don't know about the honourable member, but where I come from, $252 million is not just crumbs. I would like to take this opportunity to highlight two other aspects of the essential support for farmers that we announced today: the $77 million to support food processors, which will not only be important for the processors, but helpful for the farmers who produce products that go to them; and the $250 million that we would like to add to the Canadian Dairy Commission's line of credit to raise it to half a billion dollars, which will be very helpful to our essential dairy farmers. Chair, a couple in my riding has had to shut down their business, and they are on CERB. They were shocked when their 16-year-old son also qualified, and he is receiving $8,000 on the basis of part-time work throughout the school year. Why is the government handing out a windfall to teenagers who are living at home while denying university students and ignoring seniors on fixed incomes? hon. Chair, any individual who has lost work for COVID reasons is eligible for the CERB, regardless of their personal circumstances. If you made $5,000 in the past year and are a resident of Canada, you qualify for the CERB. This is not a matter of differentiating between the personal circumstances of individuals but of acknowledging that many workers in different situations have lost their work or have had their work significantly reduced because of COVID. cathay wagantall: Clearly, high school students would not have the same needs as university students and our seniors who are suffering at this time. The government's own findings on banning handguns and assault firearms state, In all cases the data does not conclusively demonstrate that these handgun or assault weapon bans have led to reductions in gun violence. Why is the Prime Minister so bent on penalizing law-abiding firearms owners when he should be focusing on funding our CBSA officers first, giving them the resources they need to seize smuggled firearms at our borders? hon. Chair, I note with some interest that when we brought forward legislation in a budget in the last two years to increase the number of officers at the border, the member opposite voted against it. The evidence is overwhelming that these weapons are designed to be used, and have been used, to kill innocent people. Countries that adopt sensible gun policiesplaces like New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdomhave all recognized that there's no place for these weapons in a civil society. There have been far too many people killed with these weapons, and even most recently, to honour and respect the terrible tragedy in Nova Scotia, the time to act is now, and we've acted. cathay wagantall: Last week the Minister of Agriculture said, Step by step we are giving our farmers...the tools they need to continue their...work. On April 30, the Canadian Federation of Agriculture called on the minister to create a $2.6-billion fund to maintain food security in Canada. This morning, the Prime Minister announced $252 million, hit-and-miss, across the agriculture sector. With all due respect, this is a slap in the face to our farmers and the agri-food sector. If the deputy minister is going to answer the question in her place, how does she see it is right to be providing $9 billion to students and only crumbs to our agriculture sector? hon. Chair, first of all, let me say I do not, as has now been suggested by two members opposite, consider it in any way shameful that I should be answering questions about our support for the agricultural sector. The $252 million of support is real and meaningful, and it is directed exactly where it is needed. As to the question about students, let me just point out that farm kids are students too, and farm kids will be benefiting from the support for students. Meat packing plants like Quebec-based Olymel are extremely worried that they won't be able to stay open throughout the pandemic. In the summer, these plants rely on students to do overtime and fill in for full-time employees on vacation. However, the Canada emergency student benefit makes it possible for these much-needed workers to stay home while still collecting the same amount of money. That's why the government must adjust its current summer job program for students in the agriculture and agri-food sectors. carla qualtrough: I can assure you that we are doing our best efforts to not disincentivize work. We are looking at ways we can create additional jobs through Canada summer jobs, through the the chair: There is a point of order. claude debellefeuille (salaberrysurot, bq): Mr.Chair, what the minister is saying is not being interpreted. carla qualtrough: Last week, as part of the measures announced around supporting our students, we announced the creation of 76,000 additional jobs, including jobs in the agriculture and processing sectors. This is exactly what we're doing through our youth employment and skills strategy, and that's what we'll continue to do. richard lehoux: I'm not sure the minister understood my question about the Canada emergency student benefit. I am very concerned about the agricultural sector, but the tourist and horticultural sectors are also on my mind. A number of business owners in my riding have reached out to me because the shortage of student workers is forcing them to shut down for the summer. Minister, what do you have to say to those business owners in the tourist and horticultural sectors whom you are not helping? hon. We've heard very clearly from the students that they want to work and want to serve in their communities in this time of crisis. That's why we're creating additional employment opportunities and an income support mechanism that allows them to work. Pork and beef producers are feeling the impact of the country's shutdown triggered by the pandemic. For the past five years, the government has been saying that the programs to help producers will be improved. When will the government make these changes, including the changes to agristability, and when can producers access them? hon. chrystia freeland: We announced over $77 million in assistance for food processors to help them protect their workers and deal with the costs associated with the coronavirus. To help livestock and pork producers, we established agrirecovery, a national initiative that will provide $125million to help producers adapt to market changes. The measures announced at noon today received a very cold reception from the entire agriculture and agri-food sector, since the sector had asked for about $2.6billion. I think that it's important to support our agri-food industry and our farms, given the significant need for sovereignty. Many Canadians in the agriculture and agri-food sector have made this clear, as I was saying earlier. chrystia freeland: Our country, Canada, will never depend on its neighbours or any other country for food. I want to mention another significant part of our announcement today, which is the $50million surplus food purchase program. alexandra mends (brossardsaint-lambert, lib.)): We'll now move on to the next question. blaine calkins (red deerlacombe, cpc): Madam Chair, how will the government's forced confiscation of law-abiding firearms owners' property prevent criminals from illegally acquiring firearms from the United States? hon. bill blair: Madam Chair, in response to that, I would simply remind the member that we have made it very clear that these weapons have no place in civil society, so we have prohibited military-style assault weapons that have been designed to be used to kill people and have been used to kill people. We'll bring forward new authorities, new offences, new penalties to deal with people who smuggle weapons across the border. We're also bringing in new regulations for the storage of weapons to make it more difficult for people to steal these guns. To deal with people who purchase them illegally and sell them illegally, there will be new offences and penalties to make ensure that they face the consequences. blaine calkins: The government previously has said that decisions like classifying firearms should be left to experts. A legal opinion that's already been obtained says that the bore of a 12-gauge shotgun with the choke removed is in excess of 20 millimetres. That is the same firearm that Olympic trap shooters, Olympic skeet shooters, duck hunters and geese hunters all across our country use on a very regular basis. First of all, we have prohibited large-bore weapons, such as grenade launchers, but with reference to the 10-gauge shotgun and the 12-gauge shotgun, I would simply remind the member that the bore of a 10-gauge shotgun is 19.69 millimetres in width and the bore of a 12-gauge shotgun is 18.53 millimetres in width, both of them under the size for prohibition and therefore not covered in the new prohibitions that the government introduced on Friday. blaine calkins: Madam Chair, the opinion is that of one of the foremost experts we have in Canada when it comes to firearms legislation. If the entirety of the barrel length is considered, then the removal of the choke makes that barrel in excess of 20 millimetres. There is no plan for a buyback program in this policy, and law-abiding firearms owners are not able currently to surrender their firearms. Given this, and the fact that law-abiding firearms owners aren't committing any gun violence, what was the government's immediate benefit of making this announcement on May 1? hon. Along with the prohibition that we have put in place, we have also, using the order in council, established an amnesty period, but the amnesty period is non-permissive grandfathering of those weapons. They cannot be used, they can't be taken to the range for shooting, they can't be used for hunting, they can't be sold and they can't be transferred, so we have put in strong measures to ensure that these weapons will not be available for use. We have also put in an amnesty period that will allow us to bring forward the legislation and a budget in order to effect a responsible, safe and effective buyback program to remove these weapons from society. blaine calkins: Madam Chair, since January 1, 2002, any law-abiding citizen who was issued with a firearms licence by the government would have been cross-referenced with a continuous eligibility check 6,695 times up until May 1 of this year. How many times was this most recent mass murderer here in Canada checked against a criminal database since January 2002? hon. bill blair: As the member is probably aware, there is a very extensive investigation currently being conducted into that individual and how he acquired his firearms, and it's not appropriate to discuss that. However, I think what is appropriate is to recognize that the weapons that this individual had available to him are weapons that were not designed for target shooting or hunting purposes or any sporting purposes. In the hands of someone who is intent on mass murder, they represent an unacceptable and deadly risk to Canadians, and that's why we have prohibited them. I'd also remind the member that other countries that have adopted sensible gun control laws, such as New Zealand, Australia and the United Kingdom, have also implemented very similar bans. I'd like to start by giving my condolences for the crew from the HMCS Fredericton who died, and in particular to the family of Captain Kevin Hagen. Other countries are strongly recommending that all citizens wear masks wherever people gather indoors, including in schools, on public transit and in stores. Taiwan has effectively stopped the spread of the coronavirus by supplying people with masks and installing dispensers of hand sanitizer throughout public spaces. Taiwan started in the top 10 countries affected by COVID-19, and today it is number 119. Will Canada follow Taiwan's example so we can lift the lockdown safely and get Canadians back to work? hon. patty hajdu (minister of health): Thank you very much, Madam Chair, and I thank the member for his question. There's no doubt that masks can play a role in a layered approach to protecting Canadians' health and safety, but as the member has mentioned, there are many other aspects to ensuring that Canadians are safe no matter where they go. Social distancing can provide the most protection, in fact, when you're out in public or you're in another place where there are other people. Tam has said that when physical distancing is not an option, Canadians should consider wearing a mask. I'd like to give a shout-out to Martha and her team, who are doing a fundraiser for the SPCA by making masks for citizens in my riding. Madam Chair, many people are falling through the cracks in the pandemic relief plan, including seniors who face an increase in the cost of living and a loss of retirement investment income. Will the government make the CERB a universal benefit to ensure that all Canadians who need help get help? If not, will the government increase old age security and allow seniors to withdraw funds from their RRSP without penalties so that they can pay their bills? hon. We do recognize that OAS and GIS are very important parts of the retirement income of Canadians, particularly lower-income seniors. The CERB is there for working seniors who have lost income as a result of COVID-19. We've also reduced the mandatory retirement withdrawals by 25%, and we've also spent half a billion dollars to support organizations that assist vulnerable Canadians, including seniors the acting chair (mrs. paul manly: Many small businesses do not meet the eligibility requirements for the various relief programs on offer, particularly sole proprietorships. At the same time, we have large companies in this country that use tax havens and loopholes to avoid paying their fair share of public services. Will the government ensure that the needs of small businesses are met and withhold relief from corporations that use tax havens to avoid paying taxes in Canada? hon. mary ng (minister of small business, export promotion and international trade): I want to thank the hon. That is why we have implemented many measures to help them weather this difficult period in COVID-19. Whether it is a small business loan, a wage subsidy or commercial rent assistance, or just lowering the cost by deferring GST or HST or customs duties, many measures have been put forward to help our small businesses through this very difficult time. As we navigate this pandemic crisis, we are also in the middle of another major crisis: the climate emergency. Will this government develop its economic recovery plan for the pandemic with the climate emergency at the forefront of its planning? the acting chair (mrs. The focus of the government at the present time is on combatting the virus and on steps to start to relax some of the measures that have been taken. As we look forward, we need to learn from the experiences of this crisis as well as look forward to some of the looming crises on the horizon. Climate change is one of those, and we certainly intend to reflect on resilience for the economy as we move forward. niki ashton (churchillkeewatinook aski, ndp): Thank you, Madam Chair. First nations across northern Manitoba and many others across the country have been doing everything possible to keep COVID-19 out of their communities. Many here have implemented strict lockdowns or travel restrictions, but the federal government has done virtually nothing to deal with the chronic issues that have made them vulnerable in the first place, such as overcrowded housing and the lack of hospitals. What is your government doing to support communities in the face of that possibility? Why isn't the government supporting the call for a ventilation centre in Berens River, a hospital in Cross Lake, a hospital in the Island Lake region? If the government couldn't act in time for this first wave of the pandemic, can it at least act in time for a potential second wave? hon. marc miller (minister of indigenous services): Indeed, Madam Chair, one of the reflections we have in coming out of this global pandemic is that we don't want to go into the next one with the same social determinants of health that have made indigenous communities more vulnerable and more susceptible to contracting and then spreading COVID-19. A lot of the historic housing funds that we have mobilized in order to address overcrowding in particular are cold comfort to those communities that are still finding themselves in overcrowded situations. In the staged approach to the epidemic and the onset of COVID-19, there are many measures that Indigenous Services Canada and as a whole of government we will deploy, including surge capacity, increased PPE, and nurses and doctors. Obviously, we are looking for a medical solution to a medical problem, and that is what we will spare no expense or resource to address as indigenous communities continue to face the looming threat of a second wave of COVID-19 as they start to relax some of their confinement procedures. niki ashton: Again, Madam Chair, to the Minister of Indigenous Services, many of us across northern Canada are deeply concerned by the outbreak taking place in northern Saskatchewan, centred in La Loche. Your government says it's committed to doing everything it can to keep first nations safe, yet nothing has been done to support calls for pandemic shutdowns. Will you support first nations in their call for shutdowns during this pandemic to save lives now? hon. Members won't be surprised to know that that number will only increase as the days go on and as we implement aggressive testing and contact tracing. We are working with surrounding first nations and communities and with the Mtis and Dene communities in La Loche to ensure that medical precautions are being put into place and that strict social distancing is being put into effect. This is a situation that is very much evolving minute by minute, and it is something for which we have deployed additional resources, along with Meadow Lake and the Northern Inter-Tribal Health Authority to ensure that there is a health response to a health problem. marc miller: One of the things we see as we see the evolving dynamic and the potential spreads, particularly the fear of clusters as communities, provinces, territories may choose to relax certain measures, is the need to have a more targeted approach as to how the economy reacts and deals with it, particularly in northern and vulnerable communities. This is something for which we will need to have a serious approach, with both the Minister of Natural Resources and also our provincial counterparts, to make sure that we aren't taking hasty measures to reopen the economy while we're trying to protectand this is our most important goalindigenous communities from getting exposed and spreading COVID-19. Hundreds of fishers and their families here in Manitoba who work with the Freshwater Fish Marketing Corporation are desperately calling for emergency support. Many are calling on the federal government to also work with them and the FFMC to redirect their product to domestic markets and communities here at home to address the growing food insecurity people are facing. When will your government announce support for inland fishers, including here in Manitoba, and will you work to ensure that their product, healthy fish, can be provided here at home for people who need it? hon. bernadette jordan: Madam Chair, we know that COVID-19 is having extreme impacts on northern first nations communities, especially with regard to fisheries in areas that rely on it for not only their livelihoods but also for the cultural importance. Indigenous harvesters are able to access through the aboriginal financial institutions the $306 million we've put in for support for indigenous small and medium-sized businesses. The funding allows for short-term interest-free loans as well as for non-repayable contributions. We also announced earlier that the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency has made available $15 million in non-repayable support for businesses. We know that there's more that needs to be done to support our first nations communities as well as our harvesters. I don't want to talk about the $1billion that the government used to track down tax cheats. I want to ask the minister why she isn't taking this opportunity to learn from countries that are putting an end to tax avoidance in tax havens, a legal but immoral practice in this day and age. Can she explain why she isn't showing leadership by convincing cabinet to change course and eliminate the legal measure known as tax avoidance, which enables companies to avoid paying taxes and put money in tax havens? hon. diane lebouthillier: MadamChair, as soon as our government took office in 2015, we made it a priority to crack down on tax cheats. Our government's historic investments of almost $1 billion have ensured that the agency can access the necessary resources for its work. claude debellefeuille: MadamChair, does the minister realize that she's being filmed and recorded and that she isn't answering my question? I don't want to talk about cheats. I want to talk about companies that use a legal mechanism to avoid paying taxes and to put their money in tax havens. Can she tell me how many companies legally take advantage of tax avoidance in tax havens? How much money escapes taxation through this legal mechanism? The government could invest this money in its economic recovery post-COVID-19. Regarding tax evasion abroad, our leadership made it possible for the agency to conduct twice as many audits in three years as it conducted in 10 years under the Conservatives. However, I don't understand the government's lack of willingness to eliminate this mechanism, which is legal but completely immoral. The Fdration de la relve agricole du Qubec and the UPA approached the Minister of Finance two weeks ago and still haven't received a response regarding the following issue. As a result, these farms are being penalized because they aren't eligible for the $40,000 in loans available through the Canada emergency business account. To qualify for these loans, the farms needed a payroll of $20,000 to $1.5million in 2019. Does the Minister of Finance plan to respond to the farmers who want to access the $40,000 in loans? hon. The tourism ministry was one of the first and hardest-hit industries during this crisis, yet despite the Prime Minister's announcement over three weeks ago now of a plan to bring forward a tourism-specific aid package to help the businesses who employ millions of unemployed Canadians who work in tourism, there's still been nothing from this government. I had the chance to talk to many of the leaders in the sector, and clearly there's a lot of anxiety. We also had the chance to work with all the G20 ministers of tourism all together, and we know we have to act the chair: We'll now go back to Mr. Tourism-based communities like the ones in Banff and Canmore, which I represent, are tourism-based economies and have unemployment rates of 85% or higher. They also don't qualify for a lot of the programs because they're seasonal businesses and make most or all of their revenues for the year from May to October, so they're at risk of losing their entire season. Will the government consider making changes to the programs to make sure that seasonal businesses can get help? What does the government plan to do to help the tourism industry recover after the pandemic? hon. Obviously, the tourism sector has access to many measures, including the CEBA account, the $40,000 account. They will be having access also to funding through the regional development agencies, and we'll be coming up with the details soon. Of course, in my colleague's riding of Banff, which is a fantastic place and a tourism gem, they will have access to the support through WD, western economic diversification. If there are particular cases you would like to raise with me, I would be more than happy to talk to you to see how, on the ground, we can help the tourism operators. It doesn't address anything about their concerns about the hard economic recovery they'll have after the pandemic. Another industry that's very hard hit in my province and my riding is the oil and gas industry. It's another industry the Prime Minister has promised to help, but there hasn't been anything. The only so-called assistance there's been to help hurting Albertans in the oil patch has been measures to speed up the death of the industry that they work in. Will the Liberal government ever show any concern for Albertans? Will they bring forward a plan to preserve Canadian jobs? Will they put forward a plan to ensure the use of Canadian oil before oil coming in from places like Saudi Arabia? hon. Chair, the federal government has taken several steps in recent weeks that will meaningfully support workers and communities that depend on this industry. We have the Canada emergency wage subsidy, which covers 75% of an employee's wages for the employer. We have more liquidity for oil and gas companies through new loans of $15 million to $60 million from the Business Development Bank of Canada. We continue to step forward in our response to the impacts of COVID-19 on my province here in Newfoundland and Labrador and on Alberta and Saskatchewan. These three provinces are being hit by two crises at the same time, a crisis of demand for oil and gas on the world markets and of course a crisis of public health with COVID-19. Chair, a lot of these things we're hearing about aren't going to actually help the industry to recover. Maybe what they could do is consider expediting the approval of billions of dollars of private sector projects that would put thousands and thousands of Canadians back to work. Will the government consider looking at ways that we can expedite projects? Will they look at ways that we can encourage the use of Canadian oil before the use of oil coming in from places like Saudi Arabia? hon. We have been working with labour, concentrating on workers and concentrating on the companies that support those jobs to make sure that they remain whole and those jobs will be there for those workers. We're particularly proud of our orphan wells program, which was launched by the Alberta government in conjunction with us. I am pleased to inform this House that the uptake on applications for that program is significantly higher than even we expected<doc-sep>"
