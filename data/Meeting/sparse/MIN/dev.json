        "Query": "What were the Professor's thoughts on the results and clustering in language generation?",
        "Summary": "Summary:\nThe professor expressed surprise at the better-than-expected results and concluded that MSG had no impact. However, he observed that the inclusion of French and Spanish in the multilingual English model had a negative effect. The professor was not enthusiastic about clustering and suggested giving more weight to the most promising bands in the model. Currently, the model treated all bands equally. In terms of the SmartKom generation module, the syntax-to-prosody rules for English will be rewritten, and OGI will provide a variety of synthesizer voices to choose from.",
        "Article": "professor b: OK , so We we had a meeting with ,  with Hynek , in in which , Sunil and Stephane ,  summarized where they were and and , talked about where we were gonna go . phd e: D did did you guys get your code pushed together ? phd d: Oh , yeah . professor b: What was the update ? phd a: What was the update ? So there is th then the all the new features that go in . These are the phd e: Is the ,  the CVS mechanism working well ? phd a: Yeah . phd e: Are are people , up at OGI grabbing code  , via that ? phd d: I don't think I don't think phd e: Or ? phd a: I don't know if they use it , but . phd d: Yeah , I I don't think anybody up there is like working on it right now . professor b: I think it more likely that what it means is that when Sunil is up there he will grab it . professor b: But what 'll happen is is he 'll go back up there and , Pratibha will come back from from , the east coast . professor b: And ,  and and I guess actually , after Eurospeech for a little bit , he 'll go up there too . So , actually everybody who 's working on it will be up there for at least a little while . phd e: So has Has anybody tried remotely accessing the CVS using , SSH ? professor b: Yeah .  phd a: I don't know if Hari did that or You d phd d: I can actually do it today .  , I can just log into phd e: Have you tried it yet ? phd d: No , I didn't . phd a: Actually I I tried wh while when I installed the repository , I tried from Belgium . phd a: I logged in there and I tried to import phd e: Yeah ? It worked good ? phd a: Yeah , it works . phd e: Oh , good ! phd a: But it 's So , right now it 's the mechanism with SSH . phd e: Great ! phd a: I don't s I didn't set up You can also set up a CVS server on a new port . phd e: right ? phd a: But I didn't do that because I was not sure about security problems . I I would have to phd e: So w when you came in from Belgian Belgium , using SSH , was it asking you for your own password into ICSI ? So if yo you can only do that if you have an account at ICSI ? phd a: Right . phd e: Cuz there is an a way to set up anonymous CVS right ? phd a: Yeah , you ha in this way you ca you have to set up a CVS server but then , yeah , you can access it . phd e: So the anonymous mechanism phd a: You can access them and mostly if you if y the set the server is set up like this . Because a lot of the open source stuff works with anonymous CVS and I 'm just wondering  , for our transcripts we may want to do that . professor b: Yeah , for this stuff I don't think we 're quite up to that . So ,  phd e: What 's new ? professor b: Well , I think maybe the thing to me might be I me I 'm sure you 've just been working on on , details of that since the meeting , right ? And so phd a: Mmm , since the meeting , well , I I 've been I 've been train training a new VAD and a new feature net . professor b: But I guess maybe the thing since you weren't yo you guys weren't at that that meeting , might be just just to , sort of recap , the the conclusions of the meeting . Cuz that was sort of ,  we we 'd sort of been working up to that , that that , he would come here this week and and we would sort of phd e:  - huh . professor b: Since he 's going out of town like now , and I 'm going out town in a couple weeks , and time is marching , sort of , given all the mu many wonderful things we could be working on , what what will we actually focus on ? phd e:   professor b: And ,  and what do we freeze ? And , you know , what do we ? So ,  . So then there 's something central and there aren't at least a bunch of different versions going off in in ways that differ trivially . professor b: and then within that , I guess the idea was to freeze a certain set of options for now , to run it , a particular way , and decide on what things are gonna be experimented with , as opposed to just experimenting with everything . So we 've been working like six weeks on on the noise compensation and we end up with something that seems reasonable . phd e: Are you gonna use which of the two techniques ? phd a: So finally it 's it 's , Wiener filtering on FFT bins . And it uses , two steps , smoothing of the transfer function , the first step , that 's along time , which use recursion . And after this step there is a further smoothing along frequency , which use a sliding window of twenty FFT bins . And ,  phd e: So this is on the  , before any mel scaling has been done ? phd a: Yeah , yeah . phd e: This is phd a: It was professor b: This this smoothing is done on the estimate , of what you 're going to subtract ? Or on the thing that has already had something subtracted ? phd a: Yeah . So we are going to fix this for the moment and work on the other aspects of the whole system . phd a: So professor b: Actually , let me int eh , Dave isn't here to talk about it , but let me just interject . This module , in principle , i  , you would know whether it 's true in fact , is somewhat independent from the rest of it .  , well you don't I guess you don't re - synthesize speech , but you could phd a: We we do not fo professor b: but you could . phd a: Well well , we do , but we don't don't re - synthesize . In in the program we don't re - synthesize and then re - analyze once again . professor b: But you have a re - synthesized thing that you that 's an an option here . professor b: Yeah , I gu I guess my point is that , i in some of the work he 's doing in reverberation , one of the things that we 're finding is that , it 's it 's for the for an artificial situation , we can just deal with the reverberation and his techniques work really well . But for the real situation  , problem is , is that you don't just have reverberation , you have reverberation in noise . So in fact it might be a very nice thing to do , to just take the noise removal part of it and put that in front of what he 's looking at . And , generate new files or whatever , and and ,  and then do the reverberation part . He 's  , e phd e: I guess he 's busy with professor b: Yeah , prelims , right . professor b: but but , you know , that 'll  , it 's clear that we ,  we are not with the real case that we 're looking at , we can't just look at reverberation in isolation because the interaction between that and noise is is considerable . And that 's  , in the past we 've looked at , and this is hard enough , the interaction between channel effects and and ,  and additive noise , so convolutional effects and and additive effects . And we have , the , LDA stuff that in principle is doing something about convolutional effects . i i There 's all these interactions between these two and that 's part of why these guys had to work so hard on on juggling everything around . But now when you throw in the reverberation , it 's even worse , because not only do you have these effects , but you also have some long time effects . And , so Dave has something which , is doing some nice things under some conditions with with long time effects but when it 's when there 's noise there too , it 's it 's it 's pretty hard . So we have to start Since any almost any real situation is gonna have  , where you have the microphone distant , is going to have both things , we we actually have to think about both at the same time . professor b: So ,  So there 's this noise suppression thing , which is sort of worked out and then , maybe you should just continue telling what what else is in the the form we have . phd a: Yeah , well , the , the other parts of the system are the the blocks that were already present before and that we did not modify a lot . professor b: So that 's again , that that 's the Wiener filtering , followed by , that 's done at the FFT level . And then the mel and then the log , and then the phd a: Then the LDA filter , professor b: LDA filter . phd a: mmm , then the downsampling , professor b: And then  downsample , phd a: DCT , professor b: DCT , phd a: then , on - line normalization , professor b: on - line norm , phd a: followed by upsampling . phd a: And finally frame dropping , which  , would be a neural network also , used for estimated silence probabilities . And the input of this neural network would be somewhere between log mel bands or one of the earlier stages of the processing . So that 's sort of most of this stuff is yeah , is operating parallel with this other stuff . So the things that we , I guess we sort of  , There 's there 's some , neat ideas for V A So , in I think there 's sort of like There 's a bunch of tuning things to improve stuff . There 's questions about various places where there 's an exponent , if it 's the right exponent , or ways that we 're estimating noise , that we can improve estimating noise . But structurally it seemed like the things the main things that that we brought up that , are are gonna need to get worked on seriously are , a a significantly better VAD , putting the neural net on , which , you know , we haven't been doing anything with , the , neural net at the end there , and , the , opening up the second front . phd e: The other half of the channel ? professor b: Yeah , yeah , cuz we we have we have , half the the , data rate that they allow . phd e: That what you mean ? professor b: And , so the initial thing which came from , the meeting that we had down south was , that , we 'll initially just put in a mel spectrum as the second one . We probably will go to something better later , but the initial thing is that cepstra and spectra behave differently , phd e:   phd e: So if you took the system the way it is now , the way it 's fro you 're gonna freeze it , and it ran it on the last evaluation , where it would it be ? phd a:   It , phd e: In terms of ranking ? phd a: Ri - right now it 's second . professor b: Although you you know , you haven't tested it actually on the German and Danish , have you ? phd a: No , we didn't . phd e: So on the ones that you did test it on it would have been second ? professor b: Yeah . Would it  But When you 're saying second , you 're comparing to the numbers that the ,  that the best system before got on ,  also without German and Danish ? phd a: Yeah , yeah . professor b: Well ranking didn't before , but I 'm just asking where this is to where theirs was without the German and Danish , phd a: Yeah . phd e: Where where where were we actually on the last test ? professor b: Oh , we were also esp essentially second , although there were there were  , we had a couple systems and they had a couple systems . And so , I guess by that we were third , but  , there were two systems that were pretty close , that came from the same place . phd e: We 're so this second that you 're saying now is system - wide second ? professor b: See  , no I think it 's also institutional , isn't it ? phd e: Still institutionally second ? professor b: Right ?  , I think both of their systems probably phd a: we are between their two systems . professor b: And and , you know , in some sense we 're all doing fairly similar things .  , one could argue about the LDA and so forth but I I think , you know , in a lot of ways we 're doing very similar things . But what what phd e: So how did they fill up this all these these bits ?  , if we 're u professor b: why are we using half ? Well , so you could you c phd e: Yeah . Or how are they using more than half , I guess maybe is what I professor b: Yeah , so I I think  , you guys are closer to it than me , so correct me if I 'm wrong , but I I think that what 's going on is that in in both cases , some kind of normalization is done to deal with convola convolutional effects . And they seem to comple complement each other enough and be different enough that they both seem to help help us . phd e: So th So professor b: So that if you throw away high modulation frequencies , then you can downsample . professor b: So phd e: So what if you didn't So do you explicitly downsample then ? Do we explicitly downsample ? professor b: Yeah . phd e: And what if we didn't do that ? Would we get worse performance ? phd a:  Yeah , not better , not worse . professor b: I think it doesn't affect it , does it ? phd e: I see . So I think the thing is , since we 're not evidently throwing away useful information , let 's try to put in some useful information . professor b: And , so I you know , we we 've found in a lot of ways for quite a while that having a second stream  , helps a lot . So that 's that 's put in , and you know , it may even end up with mel spectrum even though I 'm saying I think we could do much better , just because it 's simple . And you know , in the long run having something everybody will look at and say , \" oh , yeah , I understand \" , is is very helpful . phd e: So you would you 're You 're thinking to put the , mel spectrum in before any of the noise removal stuff ? or after ? professor b: Well , that 's a question . It looks like it 'd be straightforward to to , remove the noise , and , phd e: Cuz that happens before the mel conversion , right ? professor b: Yeah . There 's even a question in my mind anyhow of whether th you should take the log or not . phd d: Well , it it it it so it actually makes it dependent on the overall energy of the  , the frame . professor b: If you do or don't normalize ? phd d: If yo if you don't normalize and if if you don't normalize . And then if if normalization helps , then y you have something to compare against , and say , \" OK , this much effect \"  , you don't want to change six things and then see what happens . And then saying , oh  particularly because we 've found in the past there 's all these these these different results you get with slight modifications of how you do normalization . So , I would think you would wanna have some baseline that says , \" OK , we don't normalize , this is what we get \" , when we do this normalization , when we do that normalization . phd e: So this second stream , will it add latency to the system professor b: No , it 's in parallel . phd e: or ? grad c: Para professor b: We 're not talking about computation time here . grad c: So with this , new stream would you train up a VAD on both both features , somehow ? phd d: No , I guess the VAD has its own set of features . that 's phd d: which could be this one of these streams , or it can be something derived from these streams . phd a: And there is also the idea of using TRAPS , maybe , for the VAD , which ,  phd d: Yeah , that 's also phd a: Well , Pratibha apparently showed , when , she was at IBM , that it 's a good idea . grad c: Would would that fit on the handset , or ? Oh ! phd a: I have no idea . phd d: Well , it has t  the th phd a: It would have to fit but Yeah . And so I guess the issue there is , are we are we using neural - net - based TRAPS , and and how big are they ? So that 'll that 'll be , you know , an issue . grad c: Cuz she also does the ,  the correlation - based , TRAPS , with without the neural net , just looking at the correlation between professor b: Right . professor b: Or a simple neural net , right ?  , the thing is , if you 're doing correlation , you 're just doing a simple  , dot product , you know , with some weights which you happened to learn from this learn from the data . professor b: And so , putting a nonlinearity on it is , you know , not that big a deal . professor b: So , the question is , how complex a function do you need ? Do you need to have an added layer or something ? In which case , potentially , you know , it could be big . phd e: So the meeting with Hynek that you guys just had was to decide exactly what you were gonna freeze in this system ? Is that ? Or was there ? Were you talking about what t new stuff , or ? professor b: What to freeze and then what to do after we froze . And like I was saying , I think the you know , the basic directions are , there 's lots of little things , such as improve the noise estimator but the bigger things are adding on the neural net and , the second stream . phd d: So , I 'll ,  I 'll actually after the meeting I 'll add the second stream to the VAD and maybe I 'll start with the feature net in that case . It 's like , you 're looking at the VAD , right ? phd a: yeah . phd d: OK , so just figure how to take the features from the final phd a: Yeah . But , yeah , I think there are plenty of issues to work on for the feature net @ @ . phd e: What about the , the new part of the evaluation , the , Wall Street Journal part ? professor b: Right . Well you you may be called upon to help , on account of , all the work in this stuff here has been , with small vocabulary . So what how is the , interaction supposed to happen ?  , I remember the last time we talked about this , it was sort of up in the air whether they were going to be taking , people 's features and then running them or they were gonna give the system out or phd d: Yeah . professor b: Do we already have it ? phd d: Yeah , th I I guess it 's almost ready . phd e: So we 'll have to grab this over CVS or something ? phd d: It - no , it 's just downloadable from their from their web site . professor b: Cuz one of the things that might be helpful , if you 've if you 've got time in all of this is , is if if these guys are really focusing on improving , all the digit stuff , maybe and you got the front - end from them , maybe you could do the runs for the phd e: OK . professor b: and and , you know , iron out hassles that that you have to , tweak Joe about or whatever , phd e: Sure . professor b: S phd d: So I 'll point you to the web site and the mails corresponding . So I phd e: And it but it 's not ready yet , the system ? phd d: I I think they are still , tuning something on that . So they 're like , d they 're varying different parameters like the insertion penalty and other stuff , and then seeing what 's the performance . phd e: Are those going to be parameters that are frozen , nobody can change ? Or ? phd d: w I guess there is , time during which people are gonna make suggestions . phd d: So these sugges these this , period during which people are gonna make suggestions is to know whether it is actually biased towards any set of features or professor b: Yeah , so I th th certainly the thing that I would want to know about is whether we get really hurt , on in insertion penalty , language model , scaling , sorts of things . professor b: in which case , H Hari or Hynek will need to , you know , push the case more about about this . phd e: And we may be able to revisit this idea about , you know , somehow modifying our features to work with professor b: Yes .  , some of that may be , a last minute rush thing because if the if our features are changing  . Yeah , the other thing is that even though it 's months away , it 's starting to seem to me now like November fifteenth is right around the corner . And , if they haven't decided things like this , like what the parameters are gonna be for this , when \" deciding \" is not just somebody deciding .  , in fact there should be some understanding behind the , deciding , which means some experiments and and so forth . phd e: So wha what 's the significance of November fifteenth ? professor b: That 's when the evaluation is . So , yeah , so after But , you know , they may even decide in the end to push it off . But , due to other reasons , like some people are going away , I 'm I 'm hoping it 's not pushed off for a l a long while . There 's there 's not anybody OGI currently who 's who 's , working with this and and phd e: Is is this part of the evaluation just a small part , or ho how important is this to the overall ? professor b: I I think it 's it 's ,  it depends how badly you do . phd d: b phd e: This is one of those things that will be debated afterwards ? professor b: Yeah . Well , it 's it 's Conceptually , it my impression , again , you guys correct me if I 'm wrong , but my impression is that , they want it as a double check . That you haven't come across you haven't invented features which are actually gonna do badly for a a significantly different task , particularly one with larger vocabulary . professor b: the truth is , most of the applications they 're looking at are pretty small vocabulary . phd e: Seems to me that if it 's a double check , they should give you a one or a zero . Y you passed the threshold or you didn't pass the threshold , and they shouldn't even care about what the score is .  , but in in the current thing , for instance , where you have this well - matched , moderately - matched , and and mis highly - mismatched , the emphasis is somewhat on the on the well - matched , but it 's only a a marginal , phd e: Yeah . professor b: right ? It 's like forty , thirty - five , twenty - five , or something like that . So you still if you were way , way off on the highly - mismatched , it would have a big effect . So again , if you 're if you get If it doesn't help you much , for noisy versions of this of large vocabulary data , then , you know , it may not hurt you that much . professor b: But if it if you don't if it doesn't help you much at all , or to put it another way , if it helps some people a lot more than it helps other people , if their strategies do , then phd e:   So is this ,  ?  , Guenter was putting a bunch of Wall Street Journal data on our disks . phd e: So that 's the data that we 'll be running on ? professor b: Yeah . professor b: well there 's training and test , right ? phd e: I I guess , I 'm not sure . professor b: No , if it 's like the other things , there 's there 's data for training the H M Ms and and data for testing it . phd e: I just professor b: So I wouldn't So it it 's phd e: OK . But I think it 's trained on clean and Is it trained on clean and and test on ? phd d: The Wall Street ? professor b: Yeah . It 's training on a range between ten and twenty DB , I think , and testing between five and fifteen . phd d: It 's ,  It 's like a medium medium - mismatch condition , sort of . phd a: and So the noise is There is a range of different noises also  which are selected randomly and added randomly , to the files . When did they estimate that they would have that system available for download ? phd d: I guess I guess one some preliminary version is already there . phd e: Oh , so there 's w something you can download to just learn ? phd d: Yeah , it 's already there . phd e: OK , phd d: But they 're actually parallel - y doing some modifications also , I think . phd d: So I guess the f final system will be frozen by middle of , like , one more week maybe . grad c: Is this their , SVM recognizer ? phd d: No , it 's just a straightforward  . professor b: You know , their their They have a lot of options in their recognizer and and the SVM is one of the things they 've done with it , but it 's not their more standard thing . phd d: Yeah , this is a g yeah , this i professor b: what ? phd d: yeah . phd e: So , just so that I understand , they 're providing scripts and everything so that basically , you you push a button and it does training , and then it does test , and everything ? Is that the idea ? phd d: I I I think yeah , I I guess something like that . phd d: is what Do they provide all the scripts , everything , and then Just , phd e: I see . Somehow yo there 's hooks to put your features in and phd d: ju Yeah , I th I think . In fact , if you look into it a little bit , it might be reasonable You know Joe , right ? Yeah . professor b: Just to sort of ask him about the issue of , different features having different kinds of , scaling characteristics and so on . So that , you know , w w possibly having entirely different optimal values for for the usual twiddle factors and what 's what 's the plan about that ? phd e: OK . phd d: So sh shall we , like , add Chuck also to the mailing lists ? It may be better , in that case if he 's going to professor b: Yeah . phd d: Yeah , I guess maybe Hari or Hynek , one of them , has to send a mail to Joe . phd d: Well , yeah , to add or maybe wh phd e: I I know him really well . professor b: Do you have Hari 's ,  ? phd e: I have Hari 's professor b: Yeah , so maybe just CC Hari and say that you 've just been asked to handle the large vocabulary part here , and , you know , phd e: OK . Why don't you just ask Joe but CC Hari , and then in the note say , \" Hari , hopefully this is OK with you \" . professor b: That way you can get started asking Joe quickly while he 's while he 's maybe still , you know , putting in nails and screws and  Yeah . phd d: And there is an , archive of all the mails that has been gon that has gone , between these people among these people . phd d: So , like like , it 's , like professor b: Have you thought about how long would be  , most useful for you to go up to OGI ? phd a: I don't know ,  . professor b: Oh , so you 're you 're imagining more that you would come back here first for a while and then and then go up there ? phd a: I professor b: it 's to you . professor b: I ju you guys are Well , y anyway , you don't have to decide this second but thi think about it about what what you would think would be the the best way to work it . And , I was looking at some of the work that , Sangita was doing on these TRAPS things . So she has ,  she has temporal patterns for , a certain set of phonemes , from from TIMIT , right ? the most common phonemes .  , so she has ,  a TRAP for each one of the phonemes , times fifteen , for each of the fifteen critical bands . And , she does this agglomerative hierarchical clustering which which basically , is a clustering algorithm that , starts with many , many , many different points many different clusters  , corresponding to the number of data , patterns that you have in the data . phd e: And then you can pick , values anywhere along that tree to fix your set of clusters . grad c: Right , usually it 's when ,  when the sol similarity measures , don't go down as much . And what she found was , sh  , was there were five broad ,  broad categories , corresponding to , things like , fricatives and , vocalic , and , stops .  , and , I was thinking about ways to to generalize this because w you 're it 's sort of like a it 's not a completely automatic way of clustering , because yo beforehand you have these these TRAPS and you 're saying that that these frames correspond to this particular phoneme .  , and that 's that 's constraining your your clustering to to the set of phonemes that you already have .  , whereas maybe we want to just take take a look at , arbitrary windows in time , of varying length , and cluster those . grad c: And I 'm thinking if we if we do that , then we would probably , at some point in the clustering algorithm find that we 've clustered things like , OK , thi this is a transition , this is a relatively stable stable point . grad c: and I 'm hoping to find other things of of similarity and maybe use these things as the intermediate ,  intermediate categories that , I 'll later classify . F  , I 'm professor b: Cuz that 's what you 're gonna be using , right ? grad c: Yeah , yeah . I I haven't exactly figured out , the exact details for that but , the the representation of the data that I was thinking of , was using , critical band , energies , over different lengths of time . professor b: Yeah , it seems somehow that needs th  , there 's a couple things that I wonder about with this . professor b: if you 're going for this sort of thing where you have  , little detectors that are looking at narrow bands , then what you 're going to be looking for should be some category that you can find with the narrow bands .  , and then the other thing , is that I wonder about with it , and and don't take this in the wrong way , like I I know what I 'm doing or anything , grad c: Right . professor b: the sort of standard answer about this sort of thing is that if you 're trying to find the right system in some sense , whether you 're trying by categories or or parameters  , and your goal is discrimination , then having choices based on discrimination as opposed to , unsupervised nearness of things , is actually better . professor b: and I don't know if that  , since you 're dealing with issues of robustness , you know , maybe maybe this isn't right , but it 'd be something I 'd be concerned about . Because , for instance , you can imagine , i i if you remember from from ,  from your your quals , John Ohala saying that , \" buh \" and \" puh \" differed , not really cuz of voicing but because of aspiration . professor b: So , if you looked if you were doing some coarse clustering , you probably would put those two sounds together . And yet , I would gue I would guess that many of your recognition errors were coming from , pfft , screwing up on this distinction . professor b: So , in fact , it 's a little hard because recognizers , to first order , sort of work . And the reasons we 're doing the things we 're doing is because they don't work as well as we 'd like . And since they sort of work , it means that they are already doing if you go and take any recognizer that 's already out there and you say , \" how well is it distinguishing between schwas and stops ? \" grad c:   professor b: Boy , I bet they 're all doing nearly perfectly on this , right ? grad c:   professor b: So these these big categories that differ in huge obvious ways , we already know how to do . So , what are we bringing to the party ?  , in fact what we wanna do is have something that , particularly in the presence of noise , is better at distinguishing between , categories that are actually close to one another , and hence , would probably be clustered together .  , I understand that there 's this other constraint that you 're considering , is that you wanna have categories that ,  that would be straightforward for , say , a human being to mark if you had manual annotation . But I think it 's also essential that you wanna look at what are the confusions that you 're making and how can you come up with , categories that , can clarify these confusions . professor b: So , the standard sort of way of doing that is take a look at the algorithms you 're looking at , but then throw in some discriminative aspect to it .  Y y this is more like , you know , how does LDA differ from PCA ?  , they 're the same sort of thing . professor b: But , you know and and , this is a little harder because you 're not just trying to find parameters .  , well W actually , you stopped thinking about it for a long time , but you used to think about it a lot . phd e: I guess I don't I don't  , it 's not clear to me how to reconcile , you know , what you 're saying , which I think is right , with the way I 've been looking at it . But it seems to me that the desire the desirable feature to have is something that , is bottom - up . phd e: And and so I guess what I don't understand is how to do that and still be discriminative , because to be discriminative you have to have categories and the only categories that we know of to use are sort of these human human sig significant categories that are significant to humans , like phonemes , things like that . professor b: Well , here 's a here 's a ,  Here 's a generic and possibly useless thought , which is , what do you really  , in a sense the only s s systems that make sense , are ones that that have something from top - down in th in them . Right ? Because if e even the smallest organism that 's trying to learn to do anything , if it doesn't have any kind of reward for doing or penal penalty for doing anything , then it 's just going to behave randomly . professor b: So whether you 're talking about something being learned through evolution or being learned through experience , it 's gotta have something come down to it that gives its reward or , you know , at least some reinforcement learning , phd e: Right . professor b: right ? phd e: So the question is , how far down ? professor b: And phd e: We could stop at words , but we don't , right ? We go all the way down to phonemes . professor b: Right , but I me I I think that maybe in some ways part of the difficulty is is trying to deal with the with these phonemes . You know , and and and i it 's almost like you want categories if if our if our , metric of of goodness , i if our phd e:   professor b: correction if our metric of badness is word error rate then , maybe we should be looking at words . professor b: for for for very nice , reasons we 've looked for a while at syllables , and they have a lot of good properties , but i i i if you go all the way to words , that 's really  , d w In many applications you wanna go further . You wanna go to concepts or something , or have have have concepts , actions , this sort of thing . And and phd e: Yeah , so the common right , the common wisdom is you can't do words because there 's too many of them , right ? So you have to have some smaller set that you can use , and and so everybody goes to phonemes . But the problem is that we we build models of words in terms of phonemes and these models are are really cartoon - ish , right ? So when you look at conversational speech , for example , you don't see the phonemes that you that you have in your word models . See , so her here 's maybe where If the issue is that we 're trying to come up with , some sort of intermediate categories which will then be useful for later stuff , then maybe it doesn't matter that we can't have enough phd e:   professor b: what you wanna do is is build up these categories that are that are best for word recognition . professor b: And and somehow if that 's built into the loop of what the categories  , we do this every day in this very gross way of of running o a thousand experiments phd e:  Right . In some ways it 's really not a bad bad thing to do because it tells you in fact how your adjustments at the very low level affect the the final goal . professor b: so maybe there 's a way to even put that in in a much more automatic way , phd e: Right . professor b: where you take , you know , something about the error at the level of the word or some other it could be syllable but in some large unit , phd e:  - huh . professor b: and  yeah , you may not have word models , you have phone models , whatever , but you sort of don't worry about that , and just somehow feed it back through . professor b: You know , so that 's , wh what I called a useless comments because I 'm not really telling you how to do it . But  , it 's a it 's it 's , you know it phd e: No , but I think the important part in there is that , you know , if you want to be discriminative , you have to have  , you know , categories . If you can put the words in to the loop somehow for determining goodness of your sets of clusters  professor b: Now , that being said , I think that that if you have something that is ,  i Once you start dealing with spontaneous speech , all the things you 're saying are are really true . professor b: If you have read speech that 's been manually annotated , like TIMIT , then , you know , i i you the phones are gonna be right , actually , for the most part . Yeah , professor b: So so , it doesn't really hurt them to to do that , to put in discrimination at that level . professor b: if you go to spontaneous speech then it 's it 's trickier and and and , the phones are  , you know , it 's gonna be based on bad pronunciation models that you have of phd e:  professor b: and ,  And it won't allow for the overlapping phenomenon phd e: Mmm . So it 's almost like there 's this mechanism that we have that , you know , when when we 're hearing read speech and all the phonemes are there you know , we we deal with that , but but when we go to conversational , and then all of a sudden not all the phonemes are there , it doesn't really matter that much to us as humans because we have some kind of mechanism that allows for these word models , whatever those models are , to be munged , you know , and and it doesn't really hurt , and I 'm not sure how how to build that in . professor b: Yeah , I guess the other thing i is is to think of a little bit  , we when y when you start looking at these kind of results I think it usually is is pretty intuitive , but start looking at  , what are the kinds of confusions that you do make , you know , between words if you want or or or , even phones in in in in read speech , say , when there is noise . You know , so is it more across place or more across manner ? Or is it cor you know , is it ? grad c:   professor b: I know one thing that happens is that you you you , you lose the , low energy phones . And if that if that is if it  , if that turns it into another word or or different you know , or another pair of words or something , then it 's more likely to happen . But , I don't know , I w I would I would guess that you 'd grad c:   Anyway , that 's phd e: I think part of the difficulty is that a l a lot of the robustness that we have is probably coming from a much higher level . phd e: You know , we understand the context of the situation when we 're having a conversation . And so if there 's noise in there , you know , our brain fills in and imagines what what should be there . professor b: but  , even if you do  , diagnostic rhyme test kind of things , you know , where there really isn't an any information like that , people are still better in noise than they than they are in in , than the machines are . If we 're not working on that then we should work on something else and improve it , but especially if it looks like the potential is there "

        "Summary": "The remote design was praised by the marketing team for its user-friendly layout, allowing users to easily reach all buttons with one thumb, regardless of hand size. The prominent placement of the on-off button and attractive colors were also noted as positive features. To cater to both left- and right-handed individuals, mute buttons were positioned on either side. For international appeal, channel buttons would be labeled with numbers while the rest would feature easily recognizable symbols. Marketing also suggested incorporating a humorous element into the shell design, playing on the concept of a rapid snail. The user interface and industrial designers agreed on this idea. The remote's unique selling points would include voice recognition, a feature not commonly found in remotes within the same price range, and its adorable appearance, with the snail image serving as a visual attraction. However, practicality would not be a standout feature, as it was assumed that all competitors would offer this.",
        "Article": "project manager:  for the aim of this meeting now is to to make presentation about  the work for each one . user interface: project manager: And take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote control . project manager: and I think we don't need lighting adaptive , so the remote control should be only used for the the television . industrial designer: So  Well I have a PowerPoint pr presentation stored in my in my personal folder project manager: Here . project manager: industrial designer: Right , so  I will talk about the the w working design and user interface: F_ five . industrial designer: And  well I I will present my my first idea on how to build the our new remote control for television . So I think the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve  what we want to do . user interface: industrial designer: So   I'm thin  I think  I I'll do a survey about what is  what is available on the market and what what is the the cheapest possible things we hav we can use . Then  I will try with the technical team to to build a prototype and to see  with  h how this little box would  look look like . user interface: industrial designer: And how an and we can  start troubleshooting first  com communication problems or things like that . user interface: industrial designer: And when we are ready with this first prototype I I think we can add some software functionalities on a programmable chip like browsing by content or  things like that . Okay so can you go down  So , wha what I think for now is we don't want to have a remote control w which is wired user interface: project manager: industrial designer: so  I think we u we can use a battery for the . And the communication with the T_V_ set is  made through  infrared communication So  this is the the schema of the o of the future  remote controls user interface: Did you draw it ? marketing: project manager: Wow . industrial designer: so  you can you can see the components ,  battery and  the two chips goes to the infrared  connection to the T_V_ set . industrial designer: The one on top is for the  well the functionali the functionalities user interface: marketing: One is a communication . industrial designer: and the the th red  sorry the green one is is to well , putting things together ,  f transform the data into  qu into the format to to  to communicate with the T_V_ set . I think we should use a F_P_G_A_ for for the functionalities which is easy to to t user interface:  . What is F_P_G_A_ ? industrial designer: It's field programmable  something array . user interface: So why's it how is it different from the Bluetooth ? industrial designer: Well ,  a F_P_G_A_ is just a chip you can  you can pr programme it  wi with wh whatever you want . industrial designer: And  well the Bluetooth chip is just responsible to  make the communication  between  the two devices .  So this are the they have to work together ? Or ? Do they have to work together or two separate choice industrial designer: No . marketing: Or it's something like isn't hardware the first one ? And the second one is for the software . marketing: Okay , and how about the battery power ?  you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared ? industrial designer:  no no no no , I think  we have  to to  have  embedded  b batteries in in the project manager: . user interface: industrial designer: And  I I don't think it will need  very  much power to make it run , so user interface:  . user interface: Because you are using because you are using Bluetooth , if some people have P_D_A_ they can use their P_D_A_ to control the T_V_ if they want to , right ? industrial designer: That's a good idea . marketing: project manager: Ma industrial designer: Also , but but I I I think  the the goal is to sell our remote control . So the the purpose is to to find  the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have . user interface: and  and I found that  the function of remote control is to send messages to television set . user interface: For example switch on , switch off , switch the next channel and so on and so on . marketing: G user interface: So I found two very good prototypes for for this interface from our competitors industrial designer: user interface: so can you industrial designer: project manager: This are usual functionality . industrial designer: user interface: But then  loo but then I found if you look at you see on the left one there are too many buttons industrial designer: project manager: And they are small . O on the right I tried to play with the problem is that  if I have hundred channels I have  I have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and I have to compose the number industrial designer: Yeah . And then I I look at the user manual they are a hundred pages thick , so we don't want that . You can navigate on T_V_ screen and we can the user's preference and we need to have the T_V_ connected to internet so we end in order to access the T_V_ programmes by X_M_L_ and we need some to do some preprocessing . From the technical aspect , the processing should be done on the T_V_ set than on the on the remote controller , right ? industrial designer: user interface: And then we the speech recognition as  Harry says we may just put in we may K_I_V_ . project manager: What do you mean by the pa pa processing will be done on the T_V_ user interface: Yeah , all the processing is done the T_V_ is a compu has some processing power the project manager: than the industrial designer: So we have to t project manager: So we should have specific T_V_ ? Or ? We can use this . project manager: Yeah , we don't marketing: user interface: Yeah because are you just wondering what controller okay . industrial designer: I think there there is there is al there there is a a technology like show view who is already available on most of the T_V_ set on recorders or thing like that user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and we can try t to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because user interface: Okay . user interface: So i the processing on on the remote controller project manager: Yeah , user interface: so it can u be used in any T_V_ , any conventional T_V_ sets ? project manager: we . project manager: Keep the navigation industrial designer: We d we don't we we don't need really much buttons to i if we have a screen to navigate on on the T_V_ so  project manager: but user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: It's easy to build , user interface: industrial designer: it does not consume much power . marketing: Oh , but you have a catch there ,  assume that  if you want to go to if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine , then . user interface: industrial designer: Well , then y you you go to the main menu and  you have  go to channel user interface:  . No , because you choose by channel , so you choose by T_V_ program industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: but  I I think i i if you if you want to to make  well a a big jump but  well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could marketing: But project manager: So you are user interface: Ah . user interface: A mouse or industrial designer: Well , not a mouse but  something that that says more clearly that  right , left , up , down , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: well , the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator , maybe directly , or marketing:    . So it'll beep if you wanna find it marketing: too small that it goes under the sofa and we can't find it . project manager: user interface: you just  shout y h just it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device . user interface: And responds to you , and industrial designer: marketing: Yeah , that's right . marketing: Okay , after having the inputs from industrial design and user interface , I think most of the points which I want to are already covered here . user interface: marketing: And to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested , then what we have done is we have put a feedback forms in all the magazines , and the users send the feedbacks , and based on that These are the findings which we got and yeah adding of a speech interface is always good for a T_V_ remote but the technology We already know that as discussed earlier industrial designer: Well I I think it will be a , yes , a bit complicated to  make a speech recognisers runs on the small  ts user interface: project manager: marketing: An it does how feasible it is . I if you just recognise  numbers is a limited you have limited vocabulary marketing: Oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones . industrial designer: And this can allow to choose the the program , for instance without  adding  buttons user interface: Yeah . And of course most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive , project manager: marketing: so this is an important criteria here is user interface: But project manager: But do you think what they sug suggested s possibility . user interface: I no I I think that  i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with  reasonable cost . marketing: user interface: Maybe not less , but they may be willing to pay little bit more for comfort , marketing: Little bit more if it's with extra features . industrial designer: Well ,  project manager: There is in the marketing: for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes . industrial designer: marketing: Or they say movie name or I don't go for movie names but only for the numbers on the channel , or volume up , volume down , brightness , contrast . industrial designer: we we just have to find a mean how to to add a m a a a microphone or  well yes a microphone into the the remote control , so marketing: I think user interface: industrial designer: I well project manager: I think i industrial designer: it will be alright . project manager: What about lighting adaptive options ? marketing: Yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting , but I think  not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required . user interface: So you need s special T_V_ sets to do that ? Or it's it's done via this remote controller ? It's very complex . marketing:  industrial designer: Yeah , I think it's a bit complex too user interface: marketing:  yeah , it's for the  industrial design and users interface designers to decide if it's going to be working or not . industrial designer: For our next product , our new T_V_ set with  automatical  sound adjustment light marketing: I think project manager: user interface: Yeah , then we can conclude that . So any things to to discuss ? Or any suggestions ? user interface: marketing: I think as I discussed th that four points would be good for  marketing . And regarding the teletext  these are the subtitl these are the text information which you got on the televisions . marketing: And  if you are a French guy watching an English movie you would like to have it in French . industrial designer: marketing: So , the remote it should have some it should give me some flexibility of choosing the ch languages . industrial designer: Yeah , but well what about the the new project's requirement ? I I I think we should give up with teletext , no ? project manager: I think we we can we is the . Well , so maybe we we can j we can already think  about a way to to access the internet via the television . industrial designer: Because if user interface: Using the T_V_ to access the internet ? Or what ? I didn't quite understand industrial designer: Yeah , but  we can think that in a few years there will be T_V_ set that can access the internet . industrial designer: So it's a good idea if i i if we i if if we  think about how to to to build up our remote  control w with this functionality in a w which will c which will come in a few years . industrial designer: So if we already have it in our remote control project manager: So you have to anticipate the the future ? industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: well , not not to implement it , but to well , to find a way to to add to add this functionality in a yeah , in an in an easy manner , if is possible "

        "Summary": "The team discussed the size of the remote control, with Marketing suggesting that the TV itself could have a user-friendly remote control system using different technology. However, the Project Manager believed that this idea would not appeal to men and Marketing eventually gave up on it. The group also debated whether installing a new remote would be seen as a technological innovation, with Marketing recommending voice recognition technology due to its fashionable and trendy appeal. The Marketing team emphasized the importance of innovation, considering the use of fruit and vegetable logos and primary colors on the remote control. They also noted that younger people were more interested in features like LCD screens and speech recognition, while older people were willing to spend more money on larger remote controls. Marketing highlighted the volume and channel buttons as the most important and should be easily accessible.",
        "Article": "project manager: No on the desktop you'll find you should find that there's a project documents link . We introduced ourselves , discussed the possibility of a macro facility , interac interacting the T_V_ a bit more ,  mentioning of bar-code , joystick for user manipulation ,  and ergonomics of the remote control as well .  also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable ,  f  your colour and slogan of course is down at the bottom there . Just to say quickly  I would have thought that only being used for a television the macro facility may now not be required .  I'd like to if possible hear from our Marketing Expert first , to help us gain an idea of where we're going to go . marketing: Okay , so  we did some research , we asked one hundred people their opinions on remote controls . We asked some  open ended questions , just , what are your opinions on the remote control , got a lot of re responses , and we asked some very specific questions , and we got a lot of good feedback . Please bear in mind this is only a hundred people , so even when the groups are divided into fifteen to twenty five , twenty five to thirty five , there's only maybe ten people fifteen people in each group . I often lose my remote control , the back of the couch , some place , and even if it's not lost permanently , it takes me a few minutes to find it . I remember trying to load a D_V_D_ player recently , and there were so many buttons , it took me I don't know maybe ten minutes to to go through each button , 'cause you have to press the shift button to access the yellow buttons , you know there's just a lot of stuff that no one really uses . I've seen some remote controls that are big , they have a lot of buttons , you have to hold down more than one key at one time to do something , they're just not great to use . Between the age of  fifteen and twenty five , most people would be willing to pay extra for voice recognition software . Most people'd be willing to pay for that  most people want remote controls to be pretty , they want it to be fancy , th they they want it to be different , everybody has a white remote control with black buttons , and a red button and a green button , not everybody wants that . It's a bit sketchy at some times , you're not gonna get good always accurate results , but for a very fixed number of words , you know you have , how many different words can you have for a remote control , up , down , left , right , channel five , channel seven , you know , how many , you can't have that many words . But after a while people may wanna return it , because if you have to to say som  most people use a remote control for switching to channels , and they say they do that about ninety eight percent of the time . Using the remote control , ninety eight percent of the time for changing channels , and that's for flickering through channels . So if you have to say up , up , up , up , if you have to do that all the time , then people might get a bit fed up with that and they may return it . However , oh , because the voice recognition software exists already , there's no need to spend money on research and development , but this does mean the need for microphones in the in the remote control , which is an unusual feature in my opinion . But if we do have the voice recognition thing , there's a lot of stuff that you can  get rid of . Either you have voice recognition by itself , which I think is a bit impractical for like night time if you wanna be watching television and you wanna be quiet , or I don't know you have a visitor coming round and the remote's only trained for you , it's a bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself . But imagine you got rid of the regular remote part , then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look , because there are no restrictions on physical size , or shape , it it could be as fancy as you want it to be , you know , it could be like a lollipop or something like that , something weird like that . marketing: So we have the three birds , we have the design , that we have the the fancy bit , right , the voice recognition's fancy , it's cool , it's different , it's radical , so , and then we have an extra bit I don't remember so I'm pretty sure people will buy the remote , but is it practical to have a voice recognition system in a remote control , I think is a big question .  , will people will people be willing to wait for the the period that it'll take to train the remote , 'cause I think it will the remote will  get better over time with the same user user , but for the first week or for the first two weeks are you willing to wait , are you willing to have a bad remote control . And  what if you have visitors come round , they stay the night , they wanna use the T_V_ , they can't use the remote because they speak differently to you .  , will people return the remote control , I think a lot of young people will buy the remote control , if they have the money , you know , so , project manager: If you could  marketing: do our audience have the money , but would they return it after a while because it's not as fast as pressing a button , it's not a practical . project manager: sor marketing: I think it's cool , project manager: if you could speed it up a bit , yeah . project manager: you've got your presentation now , industrial designer: How did where did user interface: Yeah , it's in the it's in the folder project manager: is it on the industrial designer: where did you get all your in information ? user interface: yeah . user interface: Okay , this is a brief run through of the  of the technical functions of the remote . As  is  the the the presentation is  already slightly obsolete because I had in mind something that would  be i be aimed at controlling multiple devices but  there's still stuff of relevance , so project manager: Okay . I've looked at looked at a num  couple of other  remote control models just for an idea of basic design principles .  and wasn't really satisfied by what I saw I have to say so this is more sort of springboard for  how these could be improved on .   basically the job of the device is to send commands to an appliance , in this case the television set . On the one hand and this  this particularly relates to its sort of earliest models where with you know i so so many buttons on it so about the size of the television set . And most of these functions are not going to be used , it creates a rather user unfriendly interface . And on the other hand there's a user focused approach that pares things down to just what what is most likely to get used .  With  a and a and of course there is a certain amount of sort of loss of function here obviously , but mostly that's relatively peripheral functions . And so you go for something that's fairly intuitive to use , and  well f the for the most part for T_V_ remote it's  tha that would be channel control and volume .  and if you if you if you are wanting to incorporate  control of a D_V_ D_V_D_ or  V_C_R_ presumably into that then there's a play , pause , stop , rewind , fast-forward , record , so forth .  but  the pro I think the problem with a lot of the sort of user focused designs that are about is that they sort of make assumptions in advance about what  what a given user's going to  want mo want to do from want it to do most . So , something that's  something that is more programmable , that  perh perhaps has the full range of functions available to it but you can then specify yourself what you're most likely to want .  so that those are then immediately accessible through fairly minimal number of controls ,  I liked Ebenezer's idea of including a joystick in that and  possibly a sort of fairly minimal number of sort of function buttons , and have a disp you then have some sort of basic display on it so that if you're  sort of cha changing from different modes for the device it'll tell you just exactly what  you know each direction of the  of the  joystick's going to do or wha or what each function button's going to do .  , this is actually a again slightly taking inspiration off of  games controllers , you know the Playstation control where you have four basic function buttons marketing:  . user interface: that are just marked with  distinctive  geometrical shapes but the and then dependent on what you're doing with it what game and so on  those  those functions are then sort of further specified . Click to save in where do I have to save it ? project manager: If you look on the desktop you'll find that there's a link to the project folder , or project documents .  project manager: Are you finding it okay or ? industrial designer: I'm just closing it now . marketing: Well like if you go to one ,  whichever one you were working industrial designer: that's it there , marketing: yeah , industrial designer: yeah . industrial designer: right I'm responsible for working design , this is basically the inside going on of the the  remote control . So we have the energy source , we have the user interface , this this is what I've seen .  the sender will push the button , the chip will respond ,  and then the dig digital signal is sent to the T_V_ . So   , if you go to next slide , you'll see you'll see  what do we need on the user interface . Do we need  many buttons , or do we need l many light bulbs that could be easier to  to realise which appliances are on or not .  , or would that take too much power , would we need more  components in there to supply the power ?  , the joystick is another thing , if we were gonna add that , there'd be more components to deal with that . industrial designer: so  we need to I dunno exactly what That's the design of the the the layout of the  electronic design ,  obviously there'll be more details once we've decided what we're putting on the user interface . marketing: industrial designer: I just used the it was a mess ,  I was just putting adding it together at the end there . industrial designer:  so you have the energy source obviously connected to the chip , and the user interface obviously contains everything . You have the switch turn it on , infrared bulb ,  will contact the T_V_ and will have whatever device or D_V_D_ player , the bulb will turn on to say it's on .  , so do we need on the control  different buttons to decide , or different light bulbs , would it be easier ?  , I dunno what we should decide on that . So , we've had some stuff put forward ,  along with the new user requirements ,  we've had a lot of kind of input I'd say so far . The power required ,  and the ability to the cost , it seems like for  an embedded system , this could cause us issues . project manager:  for example you see that there's fairly robust services on  computers via  via voice , I_B_M_ do  drag and dictate , but these require a lot of memory marketing:  voice activation could be an interesting idea but I think that our Ind Industrial Designer would probably upon some research say that it's maybe not feasible . project manager: however the idea of a joystick and then maybe an L_C_D_ which has been kind of put forward so far , it's almost like having a small T_ not T_V_ to say , but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display , I don't know how much power an L_C_D_ would take , but it might be quite low ? marketing:  . I  industrial designer: L_C_D_ on the remote just telling you what's on , or  , interactive L_C_D_ or project manager: Well literally  if you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than  those on a a mobile phone , user interface:  . project manager: something where you can read an an  fair amount of information , traverse maybe quite a few menus , if we maybe used mobile phones as a good example , they usually incorporate they have the keypad , and then evr all the other functionality is usually associated inside by traversing around .  and then we could have like say the common buttons as you say , volume control , changing channels user interface:  . I I was thinking that the remote the  sort of default functions for the joystick would be up and down for  volume , left and right for channels . project manager: We industrial designer: Do you think that people will get mixed up , like , they'll be looking at this screen and that screen and then , you know , trying to get everything working , would it be a bit confusing ? user interface:  I think probably for the first couple of hours of using it industrial designer: Yeah . user interface:  though  I w I would say that  we could probably probably be required to  mo most of the mobile phone displays you see these days are colour but we should probably try to stick to black and white .   colour could be a sort of subsequent development but  you know cost a bit of extra money f w w w w w once everyone's got the first , you know , oh colour's out , we'll have to replace it won't we . project manager: That would be my feeling as well , I think we could possibly create quite a useful user interface .  now  I don't marketing: Sure but the idea of a remote with a menu or and a joystick I think like I h if I was in the habit of buying remote controls then I would want one , project manager: sorry , go for it . marketing: but I think we don't have a specific audience , you know , like what is our target audience , what niche are niche are we trying to market and corner . You know , you know what I'm saying , like , for whom is this intended ? Everybody ? project manager: I think it could probably be aimed at most people who've used a mobile . project manager: if we are if we were to follow that avenue , we might be s you know  we're kind of almost relying on their experience with a mobile phone I suppose . project manager:  I imagine as well that the actual L_C_D_ and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality . Which maybe doesn't get used as often , maybe it makes it easy for them to figure out how to  change the channels as in the frequencies and such for reprogramming it . project manager:  and you can still have the main buttons that allow the people to turn the machine on and off , d up and down , it depends ,  maybe we have the fol  the joystick as a separate one for the other functions then , that there's just a a small number of as you were saying  buttons that have already been defined . And they can completely ignore most of the functionality which would be for say the o actual owner of the the T_V_ marketing: user interface: is that  you you you then basically you can then basically put it  for for T_ T_ for T_V_ remote alone , you could put   there are like I say the the the main things people do with a T_V_ remote control is the volume and the channel . user interface: But  but the but then o  obviously if  you know if you i if you wanted to access further functions i you you then get to sort of menu navigation .  with things like ch with things like tuning and channels  you know adjusting brightn  brightness and fiddly things that no one really bothers with , most T_V_s these days actually have menus anyway so this would be a fairly rational way of integra project manager: if we are  most of the  of the replacement remote market is sort of remote control rationalisation . user interface: you want one wo y you want one that'll do the job of all of them .  , if all you're replacing is one of the you know however many remotes you have in your living room ,  you know you still need separate remotes for everything else . user interface: I just think that  possibly project manager: Well this is a requirement that we have to stick to I'm afraid , user interface:  . project manager: So  this is this is one of the solid ones that has to be obeyed , for now . project manager: So I can understand your point , and I would agree with you , but this is our design spec for now .  user interface: Does that  would that include  access to say interactive functions on digital or cable ? marketing: Yeah . project manager: I would say so , yes , because then we have to be able to control the remote boxes , and that is a separate unit .  I think that it I would say that the design spec we've been with is for the television only for now . Maybe we'll hear differently , but for now marketing: So the joystick is just for differentness . Try and sell it t sell it to them to supply with  project manager: There is that possibility , yes . B However I don't know exactly where we'll be going with that , but it might not even be the avenue of the Marketing Expert , marketing:  . It's just , the way I figure it , twelve point five Euros per unit , we have to sell at least like three million or something like that , project manager: marketing: not to account for all the the money we waste on remotes that no one buys , you know , like if we made a perf if we made a ks for every remote we made someone bought it , then we have to sell a lot of remote controls . marketing: We just Is this gonna be enough to to sell ? project manager: Well , something else that you brought up was  the ability to lose a remote , which as you said you've done , in fact we've probably all done . project manager: I don't know if it's a gimmick or not , but have any of you ever seen those odd little key rings where if you whistle , it will beep and you tell you where it is . marketing: I had one of those , and my brother , and my dad , could have beat me up project manager:  . project manager: well I was going to say clapping ,   digital telephones ,  for example , one unit has of course you have to have that base unit , somewhere where there's a button , but maybe it's a button that you attach to the T_V_ . project manager: Something which you when you press that , it would beep to give its location away , on the remote unit . project manager: And that way , because we're attaching what would be a small button to the T_V_ , again say what , it would be a small transmitter ,  watch battery type scenario I would say , or something that if it was problems enough you could actually even just  I don't power that might be something that we could look into . Yeah , it's  putting a lot on your shoulders there , so  that could be something that separates us a bit from the market as well . Before we leave this meeting , it would be best to say this is what we're going this is the design we're gonna try and get , this is how we're gonna make ourselves look unique . project manager: Do we go for maybe a remote contro  sorry , we're gonna go for a remote control obviously , do we go for a small joystick that would operate say changing channels , up and down , and then , what , another button that would say that it's now being used to manoeuvre round the L_C_D_ . project manager: We could use say the left and right for changing channels and the up and down for volume , user interface: For volume . project manager: and marketing: But we have a frequency of how what people use a remote control for most . marketing: power is used like once per hour , industrial designer: I marketing: channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight per hour , project manager: marketing: that's by far the biggest one , and then teletext , is still here , that's like fourteen , project manager: Vol Volume selection okay , yep , marketing: and volume selection . project manager: the teletext we're gambling with , and we're gonna say it's dead , the way of the dodo marketing: No , yeah , okay okay . Yeah ,  project manager: So we well , sorry , we could maybe even go as far as saying power button , small joystick , L_C_D_ , and then what maybe is it one more button to say that you're using the menu system , and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay ? So we're having very very few buttons involved , user interface: Actually how project manager: but navigation around a menu for most things . user interface: Actually I would say maybe two two function buttons , the y we're now using the menus button and  and an og and an okay button .  certainly something I've found with the joystick on mo the joysticks on mobile phones is that a lot of the time th the device mistakes you trying to move it in one direction or the other for pushing down for okay . user interface: The o the o the other dis design constraint I think we should bear in mind is that people are you know very much used to using a remote control one handedly , so we need to make sure that e even with the joystick , you know something that can just sit comfortably in the palm of the hand and have the joystick just controlled by the thumb . Do we incorporate the idea of trying to f locate the remote control again via a beeping noise ? industrial designer: Yeah , think so . project manager: Do you mind looking ? marketing: I think because it's so small it might be an   if we only have like two three buttons it might be essential to have to have that project manager: The ability to locate it again . project manager: So that would require a  transmitter maybe attached to the T_V_ , just so that it says find me , and what , a basically a small microphone  on the actual unit , can maybe hide it in the base . So so industrial designer: no ? project manager: Sorry ? user interface: a small speaker you mean . user interface: project manager:  industrial designer: Nah , you'd see it anyway , if you hear it . project manager: E us we might be better with the sound possibly we could maybe incorporate marketing: W those little key-rings have both , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: th e the true fact , considering the cost of an L_E_D_ , we could just incorporate it anyway . project manager: by the sounds of it , with what we're suggesting so far , your design  the user interface is still quite open , you could go for quite an interesting design . project manager: Because we're only going to have a very few key and you've got you know a small L_C_D_ , joystick , e I think it leaves you open to a a potential wide range of shapes , something that can make it stand out slightly . project manager:  if you could look into what we've suggested so far , the feasibility of  small transmitter ,  and such , maybe if an L_C_D_ screen requires too much power , or such . Ebenezer , Marketing Expert marketing: Well I can give you the frequency , what people what options people use most often , I guess that's gonna be important in the ts defining the the software side of the interface , right . project manager: yeah if you could maybe as well see what people think about the idea of this minimalist approach that we've taken , where of a joystick to control the very basic functions , and then the idea of manipulating it like you would a mobile . project manager: I don't know how easy that will be within the time frame , marketing: Okay . project manager: Feel free to email me if you think that  we've screwed something up and wanna get it rectified as soon as possible . industrial designer: So I should just look at  the speaker , the speaker and an L_E_D_ . user interface: project manager: Speaker and L_E_D_ for locating , industrial designer: And marketing: Transmitter .  , if we do end up trying to market this to television manufacturers then the  then the transmitter could actually be built into the television .  , and something that we can can easily be adopted at the last minute as well I'd say . project manager: The electronics could be s either placed externally or internally , makes no difference to the final product of the actual remote control , user interface: user interface:  if it w if we get a major television manufacturer to say y oh yeah we'll have that , save us the bother , then that's you know vast amounts of sales . industrial designer: P project manager: Oh , one thing that we've almost not talked about at all , my apologies for that , user interface , we also need to maybe get the slogan in here ,  it's , industrial designer: Fashion . industrial designer: yeah , the slogan's we put the fashion in electronics , isn't it ? project manager: My apologies .  , I think that's l almost the last minute thing industrial designer: 'S also look cool . project manager: So I'm not too concerned a that we haven't gone into depth about that . But it might be something you could consider when you're thinking about shapes ? user interface: project manager: In fact we might like to put a slogan on , and  possibly the two R_s to signify the company "

        "Query": "Did the group find the remote control competitive in terms of evaluation criteria, battery design, and cover when discussing the functional design and prototype of the remote control?",
        "Summary": "The team had mixed opinions on the remote control design. While Marketing found the basic layout to be dull, they praised the brilliant voice recognition feature. User Interface acknowledged that the remote lacked digits but had all the necessary features. The Industrial Designer reminded everyone that they could only design within their capacity. The Project Manager agreed that the remote was of high quality but had low acceptance. \n\nIn terms of the battery design, the team wanted it to be long-lasting, original, and conventional to ensure innovation, versatility, and durability. They also wanted to avoid deviating too far from the usual performance to prevent issues for new users. \n\nUser Interface suggested using a rubber cover that could stretch over the remote, and the Project Manager agreed, asking the Industrial Designer to explore this idea further.",
        "Article": "Right so  this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me s precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . In this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype . Right so  , apologies for the last meeting , it was brought to my attention that I did not make the roles clear enough , so I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting . So , basically all we're gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time , and gonna go through you ,  whoever wants to go first is f fine by me  and we'll collate what we know about  what we discussed in the last meeting , possible directions . And then we'll make some more decisions on  basic  firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work . It is Nathan right ? I'm not calling you the wrong name over and over again ? industrial designer: No Nathan's fine . industrial designer: basically what I'm gonna have to talk to you about today is  component design and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers , project manager:  . We've already kind of gone over this but we're gonna have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon . Our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium so we might have to look if we do go that route , we might have to look elsewhere . Basically , it's like a  the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running . So that's one possibility but I don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen .  and then as far as the way it's shaped , we can do standard boring flat , which we probably don't wanna do , curved or very sexy double curved . project manager: What kind of th thickness are we looking at ? industrial designer: I imagine that we could specify . industrial designer: the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer , but to use those we'd have to use more chips ,  and that would cost us more . And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case  we'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons aren't compatible with that . industrial designer: one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum . So you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote and you know the television can detect that . And if you were to record if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light .  one thing that I thought might be interesting was to use part use visible light coming out of the remote , just kind of as a fun gimmick . industrial designer: Course it'd have to be a part of the spectrum that wouldn't damage the human eye or anything like that . project manager: is there an option that we can have that off or on so a person can select like industrial designer: Yeah .  , and then on to the circuit board that we're gonna use , also known as the chip .  , we really don't have any way around the T_A_ one one eight three five . project manager: user interface: industrial designer:  findings , okay , we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer ,  and my question to all of you is , should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available ? user interface: Interesting question . marketing: Well I'd say shop around but with our time constraints , is that really a feasible option ? project manager:  .  , if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside our current manufacturer . My personal preference is I'll just throw my cards on the table ,  I think we should probably go the solar battery route , just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on .  , I like the idea of the visible light signalling , that's something to set us apart and  I was thinking about I was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes . So we're not so confined by one style and say some you know , say our the one marketing: Right . industrial designer: if we just go with one and it doesn't go over well then we're in a bad situation . project manager: Can we do marketing piloting too ? Try to see what kind before we launch can we see how they're received ? marketing:  It's an option ,  but actually there's I've got some research already on like what we're looking at and trends in casing right now project manager: Okay . project manager: That's perfect , so I guess that makes sense for you to take it from here . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: Did you ? marketing: You waiting for me ? project manager: Fascinating , compelling even .  , basically I was looking at what's going on in the remote control market right now and what's going on in other design fields , to see sort of what's what's trendy , what's new , what's happening .  , remote control right now basically everybody says they want newer , fancier , more exciting they're sick of this boring , normal , functional ,  that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface .  the challenge is that current trends right now , across the board in fashion , in furniture , in technology , is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing . user interface: project manager: user interface: project manager: user interface: industrial designer: marketing: Now I'm not saying we should have , you know , tomato shaped remote controls or anything , but I think it is possible maybe to use  natural colours , like if wood is an option , that whole organic , sleek , clean , industrial designer:  . Different skin options , or if we can't afford this touch plate thing , or touch face screen interface  , maybe having the b images be specific , like you could choose your menu bullets to be project manager: Tomatoes . marketing: a different shape industrial designer: user interface: marketing: or okay , not the example I would choose , but you know what  to t sort of and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy , project manager: industrial designer:  . marketing:  not something I I've come up with a though if we can get around to getting piloting , I thought maybe a casing option like  not like a skin , but like a holder almost if you could do like  , leather options or wood options or something industrial designer:  . As far as the rubber that we can use we can use a rubber as part of the case , marketing: So overall I think we should stick with what we're finding , everyone's looking for easy to use , technologically innovative and this fancy new I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now . Well I d but then if the touch screen thing isn't gonna work out for us that's really a non-issue . industrial designer: I like the idea of of rubber too because it's tends to be associated with being durable , something that you can drop and it doesn't matter . project manager: Yeah , it's like , yep industrial designer: Taped with duck tape and what have you , marketing: Very much so . project manager: it's ubiquitous isn't it ? user interface: We can have a duck tape casing . user interface: marketing: I think that goes against the whole fancy something , a new line , project manager: user interface: It could go with the granola crowd . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: marketing: Ah , it could be , it could be , project manager: Great , marketing:  . project manager: industrial designer: marketing: user interface: So yur user interface , guys , is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear , or otherwise  perceive . Here's a d series of different remote controls industrial designer: user interface: that are out on the market today .  voice recognition , we we  actually have some new  information from our research design team but  I'll get to that in a moment .  , so current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples ,  and basically you record your own verbal labels c and connect them to the remote control . Now our design team , research team , has been able to  set up a system in which  you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to  with standard responses . Like you could say good morning  remote control and it'll say in a sexy female voice , Good morning Joe . project manager: marketing: project manager: industrial designer: user interface: In fact we already have this for a coffee maker line marketing:  . project manager: Lot of single people on the  on the re on the remote control research team user interface: On the remote control industrial designer: project manager: at the user interface: right . user interface: another concept is what  Apple has come up with , the spinning wheel with  L_C_ display like on the  iPod project manager:  . user interface:  and then we have the scroll button with integrated push-button , kind of like a modern a bit bulky , a bit crazy , project manager:  . user interface: And  some special components ,  ideas like  blocking , having the ability to block channels from your for your children  and  dedicated buttons for for commonly used  channels and even  ideas like secured or hidden programming but  I again if we go with touch screen I don't think that's a big issue . industrial designer: marketing: user interface:  the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose . user interface: again probably not what we're going for marketing: user interface: so I  my ideas here and kind of where I think we're heading is something slightly larger than a regular iPod  with a hard cla c  plastic casing marketing: Okay . user interface: although I think some of the suggestions we've come up with are definitely  very good ideas .  changeable casings  our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package to kind of set the idea that you can change it and you can try changing it marketing: right . user interface: and kind of get used to thinking about maybe buying another one which can add value to our  bottom line .  touch screen interface ,  possibly having go-to buttons being  stuck into the system so those don't move away from the screen , the important ones like power , volume and jump between channels .  , and of course our voice command system which I've talked a little bit about already project manager:  . user interface: and  the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features  that are around so red for power ,  arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not . user interface: And  perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea like perh  for instance my toastie maker that I got from my bank marketing: user interface: has jokes when it's ready . project manager: That's what they need , it's like a little dongle it just sticks up this further so you don't have to stand up every time , just connect it , my kingdom . Now we kind of have to come to some decisions , I figure we can just go down the line and all three of us can have a chat about it . Based on what Nathan presented as far as the  various costs and benefits  I think , I dunno , what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point ? marketing: I think it's our most marketable feature just because it's so new and it's something that is showing up in other places . marketing: But can we really afford it 'cause it looks like they would be , that would be a really main cost source then project manager: marketing: right ? industrial designer: My estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it's gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty Euro per remote , project manager: To produce each one . marketing: And our goal was to be under twelve fifty or we have to be under twelve fifty ? project manager: Well . project manager: There is , it's just , it is a question of and how much ca o does that mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money . marketing: Can we justify it ? project manager: from twelve fifty if we d wanna get our fift  hundred per cent profit margin  that would mean selling it from twenty five . project manager: So user interface: Where do you guys come up with these numbers ? industrial designer: That's just off the top of my head , project manager: From the board , industrial designer: it is pending further emails . project manager: well marketing: Though I think that's what people would pay for , user interface: marketing:  if you're gonna pay for an expensive high class remote , you're gonna expect it to do something project manager: That's true ,  industrial designer: It is the new it would be in a class of its own . project manager: And that's to be fair the  the per cent of the market we're not going for mass any you know , mass sales anyway , we're gonna make  we we're not talking about selling eight zillion of these things , we just couldn't , not for twenty-five Euros , marketing: Right . project manager: so we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins rather than selling for twenty five , sell 'em for thirty , but that's something that we can have finance deal with . project manager: or wh y wh what was your thought on the matter Ron ? user interface: I'm thinking that's  definitely a good idea and I also think that we could probably come up with some sort of a cheaper  means to to go about this kind of production , my my team in the  on the third floor suggested that  marketing: See if we can cut some corners . Well and we can look into this other manufacturing option , and maybe we can get 'em somewhere else cheaper . industrial designer: We could initially go with what we have and if we can find them cheaper later on marketing: Right . project manager: No we could have a s very simple touch screen , you know , there's always the opportunity , if it's gonna be about the size of the iPod or whatever , you know , w we yeah , I guess we can play around with it a bit . Alright , let's let's say that okay so the touch screen will be our  our main selling point here . project manager: So user interface:  I think that we really have two main selling points , I think that our casing and the voice recognition marketing: Yeah 'cause with voice recognition  really this is pretty bells and whistles kinda remote . project manager: if if we're looking at bottom line , now we're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on , user interface: project manager: I think we might have to drop the voice rec . user interface: To be honest , we have the capa we have the design in-house , marketing: Price-wise . user interface:  we've we've come up with this , with this new voice marketing: True . What do you think on it Nathan ? About the voice rec ? industrial designer: I think if we we do both the obviously production costs are going to go way up  but it does put it into it'd become the Rolls Royce of remote controls basically . Course , maybe they hadn't thought of this whole touch screen option , but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition so to say we have the technology and we're not gonna use it even though we know it'll sell is a call I don't think I can give the highs ups . marketing: Like really I can't go in and say no we're gonna just ignore everything we know . user interface: Does having both really up our costs ? project manager: I can't see how it wouldn't , there's you know the old aphorism , you can have it fast , you can have it cheap or you can have it quality , pick two of three . industrial designer: Yeah , 'cause you you just upping the number of chips that you need to deal with each different function . project manager: Well if we're gonna pick betwe e alright so we have to pick between one of the two . What which , which do we suspect we should hold o we should hold on to ? marketing: Well , we already have research backing voice recognition as you know fiscally solvent . But  I I I personally would tend to another direction but if that's what's gonna sell I think that's what we need to go with and maybe we can table this touch screen for our next model . industrial designer: I think the voice recognition is simpler , we already have the all the technology in-house , it's ready to go , it's packaged , it's project manager: What does the cost look like Ron ? Is it cheaper to do the V_R_ or to do the  touch screen ? user interface: Well my p is project manager: Nathan ? marketing:  . industrial designer: this is just off the top of my head keep in mind , but I think the voice recognition would they're both  they're both gonna push the costs up , but  , since we already have the technology in-house for the voice recognition project manager:  . marketing: And we're still not then we don't have to deal with this battery issue nearly as much either , project manager:  . So I'm getting alright so more or less you guys think that o o of the two of 'em , the voice recognition will be better . marketing: which for right now we can have it on the market sooner which is all in all our best option . industrial designer: marketing: So and when are we gonna have basic prototypes coming up next that's you guys's next step right ? project manager: Yeah , well we'll we'll sic we'll sort out what it what f what else we're gonna talk about for the prototype industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: but yeah that's our next step , it'll be a developing of prototype . industrial designer: Are we going to talk now about  the materials that we're gonna use for the case and all those things ? project manager: Yes . Would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition ? Or this kinesthetic one , would that be enough to fuel a voice recognition remote control ? industrial designer: the solar power definitely would be but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed , 'cause sometimes solar power fails and there's no way round that , we should install a small backup battery . industrial designer: Just to cover those moments when for whatever reason , the remote hasn't been exposed to marketing: Well what of people with like the T_V_ in their basement , project manager:  . marketing: like what if wha we can't guarantee sunlight everywhere so having a secondary source is probably industrial designer: It's true . Yeah , it works about the same as a solar powered calculator , marketing: industrial designer: and you know how those those don't really require that much light , user interface: Calculator . industrial designer: but obviously a little more light than a calculator , but we're not talking about a lot of light . Doesn't have to be out taking a sunbath for a few hours a day or anything . project manager: What do you think Ron ? user interface: I'm willing to agree with everything that's been said . If we're really not  handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand-held remote control and maybe kind of have a round remote control that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that , kind of a sleek little  neat thing that sits on your table or something . industrial designer: Why , why moving away from hand-held , why ? user interface: Just a thought . industrial designer: What's the  idea ? user interface: Well if you don't need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point . marketing: I if it's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job . Do you think people that are people that buy a remote , are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition or is it just something that they do sometimes . marketing: True , and i probabl I think we're banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people , like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too , project manager: Well we have to have buttons on it too as well . project manager: But that's done , that's no bother  if you look at the catalogue from places like with sharper image or whatever you know they might have or like  who is it , Apple makes these really pretentious speakers with the th sub-woofers you know like clear and glass and you know marketing: project manager: And maybe a menu button and so forth , you know  use a channel button to scroll through the menu d if they want to record programmes or whatever you know  we can sort that out . Maybe something that looks nice on a table is would be good , even though and hand-held the same time . user interface: I think it's all about following Apple's lead on a lot of these things . project manager: Yeah ,  a nice although we do  wh  is I'm recalling that she mentioned that we n need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminium thing marketing: Right . project manager: but you could have a very tasteful  wood coloured or earth tone kind of  marketing: That would be kinda neat . And the  the material like the plastics and so forth , we were discussing that being  using like a rubber kind of softer feel , industrial designer: Okay . project manager: li lik if you feel the the tip on this pen it's a bit gives just a bit . project manager: something where it's  a a more advanced f form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it . marketing: Yeah , which is the next big thing , so that's not gonna hurt us either . user interface: project manager: Yeah let's see if we can do a squishy non-remote control-looking remote control . industrial designer: project manager: But to be fair , yeah , you just c you could just put it literally put it on the the ni the coffee table next to the telly and say volume up . I guess we'll a that's gonna be  a thing , if we run a bit over-budget , that might be okay ,  . industrial designer: Sorry about the  lack of information on cost , I just haven't been provided that information by our manufacturers marketing: Okay . project manager: We'll have more of an idea when the prototype have more of a industrial designer: and I'm just having to guess .  , so user interface: project manager: we've revisited the touch screen and more or less ruled that out , I think so we're more or less con we wh wh we're more or less in agreement that we want to have a  a simple kind of function , you know , not too complex . Well when the majority of people are only using the most primary functions on a daily basis , although I'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions , they should be secondary , at least if not functionally then visually , like those shouldn't be industrial designer: Right . marketing: Take precedence , industrial designer: If , if we're not going the touch-screen route then we can  just incorporate maybe something that folds out marketing: yeah . industrial designer: like what you often see on these kinds of remotes is the most basic functions up here project manager:  . marketing: Well and do we wanna consider like an iPod screen which isn't a touch screen but you're still scrolling through menu options , in p user interface: Think then we're hitting our cost issue again . project manager: Yeah marketing: True , project manager: we've also got the the me the thing of , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: if we're gonna have a non-remote-looking remote , how do we yeah . project manager: we could do a slide or a compartment , you know , like if it say it's a lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing , it'd be easy to have a compartment in there . project manager: Or you know , a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing , like on  like on a D_V_D_ player . You know you see the modern D_V_D_ players'll just have  a menu button on the side and then four buttons around them marketing: industrial designer: So are we gonna are we talking we need to figure out what kind of buttons we're going to use , are we going to use scroll buttons ? Rubber buttons ?  project manager: Well it seems like I dunno it seems to me that we could just do the  stick with the rubber 'cause since we're probably gonna be using some kind of  rubber for the outside case marketing: Yeah . user interface: I think to a certain extent we have to stick with  kind of  a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then and then make our unique feature our casing and what not and our voice command . Well no it's basic just like four directions that are that can use as menu or channel and volume or however you wanna do it , are really versatile and everybody's already got them to some extent on the remotes they already own so it's not like we're dealing with everybody relearning things 'cause that's not something anybody's gonna wanna buy a new for . That seems to be selling  and we we've more or less agreed that we want to kar target this youth market ,  . project manager: Especially now with eighteen to thirty five year olds being such a large quantity of the population . Yeah alright , well , more or less covered what we need to cover I think fi an an any final thoughts before we think about doing the protot moving on to the prototype . project manager: The  , yeah okay I was just gonna assign tasks in the next b anyth any oth user interface: Sure . industrial designer: have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people ? project manager:  . industrial designer: Or are we just going to go with one ? ..It's very , it's very hard thing to predict because you have different cases marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: and that might open up your market a little bit obviously , but if you have just one case and it doesn't go very well  . industrial designer: but obviously having more cases also costs more so project manager: Well then again colours wouldn't be so hard to do , you could have  a , you know , a   kind of a natural wood colour , like a stained wood and  , I don't know , olive green or something . project manager: That wouldn't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the thing . user interface: And again copying iMac's kind of for iPod Mac Apple's  colour scheme . project manager: Yeah , I think that's probably a good id okay so let's work on  multiple case colours . But yeah , stick with the same kind of kinda yeah , the same basic non-remote kind of remote design . I want the  I'd like Nathan , I'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel , what can we accomplish , given these parameters that we're just gonna sort of have this kind of  non-remote remote . project manager: And  Ron if you can figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: project manager: And also  specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well . project manager: So that's what to start with for now , is that alright , you guys feel clear about this ? marketing: Cool "

        "Query": "What are the potential difficulties for researcher collaborations and networks after Brexit? How does the loss of funds due to leaving the European Union impact these collaborations and what are the possible solutions?",
        "Summary": "The impact of the Brexit deal on collaborations is still uncertain, particularly in relation to playing a role in Horizon Europe. Maintaining quality, impact, and growth in capacity is crucial for Wales. Dr. David Blaney believes that these efforts have already yielded positive results, such as increased research funding and a stronger presence in the international research market. However, the main challenge lies in securing sufficient funding. While the government recently allocated an additional \u00a36.6 million for research, this is not sustainable or adequate. The Welsh government has also expressed its vision for research and innovation, emphasizing the need for more investment in the Welsh research base to enhance competitiveness in accessing funding at a UK level.",
        "Article": "gareth rogers: Good morning, and welcome to today's meeting of the Children, Young People and Education Committee. Unfortunately, the Chair is unable to attend today, so in accordance with Standing Order 17.22 I call for nominations for a temporary Chair for the duration of today's meeting. gareth rogers: As there's only one nomination, I declare that John Griffiths has been appointed as temporary Chair. Thank you all very much, and item 1 on our agenda today is introductions, apologies, substitutions and declarations of interest. We will move on then to item 2, and our inquiry into the impact of Brexit on higher and further education, and our first evidence session. I'm very pleased to welcome the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales here today, and Dr David Blaney as chief executive, and Bethan Owen, director of institutional engagement. I wondered if we could start off with you telling us what evidence you can see that the Brexit process has had any impact on Welsh higher education so far. dr david blaney: Can I preface the response by just reminding you that we are, by contract and by role, apolitical, and a lot of the judgments about the impact of Brexit essentially reflect where people sit politically in terms of whether they think it's a good thing or a bad thing? We're not going to go there, obviously, today, so we'll stick to the facts as we can see them, and hopefully we'll be able to help you, but there are areas where we are unable to help. But even in terms of your assessment of whether this is going to be a good thing or a bad thing, a good impact or a bad impact, some of that inevitably in the end becomes a matter of your politics on it, so we will be as careful as we can be on that. In terms of the impact of Brexit on higher education, clearly, the significance here is about the contribution that higher education can make to Wales. So, we fund provision; we don't fund providers, technically, although obviously there's not much provision without providers. So, we are interested in the sustainability of higher education providers, but fundamentally the issue is: what does the HE system in Wales do for Wales, and what impact might Brexit have on the capacity of the system to continue to deliver for Wales? So, we know that universities make annually about \u00a35 billion of impact; 50,000 jobs. Of course, in Wales, all of that economic impact is really very significant, and uncertainty about the relationships and the arrangements with Europe is one of the most significant issues confronting university management at the moment. We can identify at the moment the extent to which the HE sector in Wales is exposed to sources of income that are located from the EU, so EU students, structural funds, and EU research funding, and so on, from the EU. We can identify some of that, but, actually, what happens in the future is much harder to be clear about. We are beginning to see some impact in terms of applications from EU students and I'll ask Bethan to share some details on that in a moment. We're also beginning to pick up, only anecdotally, some signs that there are increasing difficulties in the UK sector, and the Welsh sector as part of that, in playing in some of the EU collaborative research activities. And that, I think, just reflects the extent to which EU partners consider that British partners might be a stable partner as we go through this transition period. We don't have data on that\u2014that's anecdotal\u2014but there are signs that some of those relationships are beginning to become a little bit more difficult. In terms of the financial impact of that, clearly, if it is accepted that the UK is a net contributor to the EU then, presumably, some of the money\u2014we're almost immediately straight into politics if you're not careful\u2014but some of the money will be available back to the UK, and the extent to which Wales benefits or not from that returned money is a function of the political relationship between the Welsh Government and Her Majesty's Government. It's not necessarily the case that Wales will always lose out in that relationship, but that will become a matter of politics. There's a broader dimension, which is about the economic impact of Brexit on the UK economy and how much tax revenue there is and all of that. I think it's very hard for us to be definitive about how that's going to play out. But we can certainly anticipate some turbulence and exactly how that plays for institutions remains to be seen.\u00a0We can touch later on on the extent to which they are sighted on\u00a0this and preparing for it. bethan owen: This is based on the UCAS\u00a0applications and the report that was published at the end of June, 30 June.\u00a0The European Union-domiciled applicants to Wales have decreased by 8\u00a0per cent, which contrasts with a 2\u00a0per cent increase for English institutions, and non-EU\u2014so international students, not from Europe\u2014have also decreased by 9\u00a0per cent to Welsh institutions, again contrasting with a 7\u00a0per cent increase in England. Could I then just ask you what you see as the main pressures on the Welsh higher education sector at the moment? bethan owen: The funding position would be the main pressure. The recommendations made by Sir Ian Diamond in his review of higher education funding and student finance are in the process of being implemented, and the changes to the student finance arrangements will take effect from this September. However, the recommendations for re-establishing funding at Welsh institutions are expected to take quite a bit longer. That funding, when it returns to institutions, is intended to re-establish funding for higher cost provision, both full time and part time; reinstate funding for innovation; and maintain, at the very least, the research funding in real terms. Universities, in the meantime,\u00a0are trying to minimise the cost reductions that they're making in order to maintain the infrastructure, so that when the funding comes they can get the best value out of it. For the research and teaching grant, though, we are still funding at a lower level\u2014\u00a312.5 million less\u2014then the starting point for the Diamond report, the 2015-16 starting report.\u00a0But we expect to be able to start introducing funding from 2019-20 to make a start on implementing Diamond. And it's probably important to note that the Diamond recommendations predated Brexit, therefore the challenges introduced by Brexit are in addition to those that the Diamond report was addressing. There is also the start of a reduction, both in Welsh-domiciled and English-domiciled applications to Wales. And the other pressures include pay and pension costs, not least the issues around the universities superannuation scheme pension fund, where there's potentially a significant increase in cost. Increased student expectations for modern facilities and infrastructure bring a requirement for capital expenditure and borrowing, which bring their own pressures. And finally, the uncertainty about potential consequences that could arise from the review in England of fees and funding\u2014the Augar review. john griffiths am: In terms of European Union students and enrolment, is Wales forecast to do less well than England and, if so, why might that be? bethan owen: They are not forecasting it. It's very difficult until the enrolments are made, and it's also very hard to see\u2014the data that we see is the UCAS\u00a0data. So, now, they have to find the full fee, whereas previously they were getting the grant in the same way as\u00a0Welsh students. So, I'm speculating that that might be having an impact as well on EU students' appetite to come. llyr gruffydd am: Well, that's straight into what I was going to ask, really, about what you think the factors are that led to this 8 per cent or 9 per cent drop in EU students applying to study in Wales, where we see a 2 per cent increase in England. Is that it, or are there other things that you've taken into account? What's your assessment of the reasons behind this? dr david blaney: It's very difficult to be definitive about the reasons, but I think there are probably two. The one that Bethan has already indicated, which is the change in student support arrangements for EU students, will have\u00a0an effect of perturbation.\u00a0That's probably relatively temporary\u2014let's hope it is\u2014as that settles down because, actually, the deal for EU students coming into Wales is no worse than that coming into England. Ours would be better because the fee level is slightly lower, but we do struggle in Wales in terms of the\u00a0Anglocentric nature of the media and so on. The other dimension is that when you're in a highly competitive recruitment market, you have to do what you can to look attractive. Part of that is about being able to invest in facilities, and\u00a0particularly buildings and kit, and the relative levels of investment between Wales and England over quite a long period of time now probably have an impact on that. Certainly, anecdotally I know, from my own family, that a lot of the choices have been made in terms of the state of repair of campuses and so on. There's something rational about that, isn't there? If you've got a system that is relatively better invested, then you're likely to have a better student experience because the resources are likely to be better. We saw a sort of similar but opposite effect when the \u00a39,000 fee maximum limit came in, and some institutions, mostly in England\u2014there was one in Wales\u2014chose to pitch their fee levels really quite low, relative to that \u00a39,000, and caught a cold in the student recruitment market because fee levels denote quality in the student mind.\u00a0So, the price sensitivities work quite differently. So, again, if you've got a relatively better invested part of the system, then that might well be one of the reasons why it looks more attractive. llyr gruffydd am: That latter factor would affect the whole of the cohort, not just the international recruitment, of course. The implementation of the Diamond recommendations is crucial to that because that's re-balancing where the policy of investment goes. mark reckless am: If I heard you correctly earlier, you said that the applications from non-EU students were also down by 8 per cent or 9 per cent. So, forgive me a certain scepticism\u00a0about the explanation of the fall in the EU students being that they did get the fee grant and now they do not. If that's the explanation, why are we seeing the same fall in non-EU applications? dr david blaney: Well, I think the Welsh domiciled are also now having to face the prospect of finding a loan for the whole of the fee. There's also a demographic dimension here with the downturn in the 18-year-old school-leaver profile, and that actually is happening in Wales at a slightly later point than in England. mark reckless am: But this is non-EU students, and I think you said, Bethan, an 8 per cent or 9 per cent fall in them as well. mark reckless am: All English or all Welsh? bethan owen: Well, I contrasted the Welsh position with the English position where they were seeing growth. If you look, then\u2014and we don't have the detailed information, but, again, what UCAS publish is some analysis by tariff. They analyse by type of institution\u2014in other words, the grades that you need to get into institutions\u2014and there is a trend for growth being in the higher tariff institutions. So, there's a mix effect in there as well, and I think there's undoubtedly an element of perception of how welcome overseas and international students are, and that's something that we know the sector are working on with Government. mark reckless am: Why would that affect Wales\u00a0more than England? Do you think there's been perhaps too great a negativity about Brexit in the sector? bethan owen: I think it's the mix of institutions that we have. When we look at the mix of institutions that we have, we will probably see a differential impact between Cardiff University and others. john griffiths am: Okay, Mark? Sorry, David, did you want to add anything? dr david blaney: I was just going to say that we would expect to see quite differential performance in the English sector, so the overall numbers are being brought up by substantial increased performance with some of that sector, and it's a question of how many of that type of institution you have in Wales. mark reckless am: So, performance is increasing amongst the English universities, but not amongst the Welsh, you think. dr david blaney: I think performance is increasing, but increasing substantially with some of the English sector, not all of it. So, you get an average for the sector that is increased performance, but actually the stronger players within that sector, with the stronger international profiles, are bringing that up, and we have fewer in Wales that have that sort of presence. darren millar am: Would it be fair to say, then, that the universities over the border in England are better at selling themselves internationally than our Welsh institutions? Or is it just this fact that we've got fewer very high tariff universities versus the English market? dr david blaney: I suspect, and this is speculation\u2014I suspect that it's a bit of both. I would then come back to the point I was making about the Anglocentric nature of the UK media. darren millar am: But, forgive me, don't international students just look at the UK as a whole? How are we comparing to Scotland, for example, or Northern Ireland, in terms of their universities? Do you have a comparative figure for Scottish universities? bethan owen: I haven't got that one with me for now, but there will be one in the data. bethan owen: Again, it's a combination of being part of the UK but differentiating, and the ability to differentiate the strengths of Wales, so attracting those students to Wales specifically, on top of the UK draw. dr david blaney: So, in terms of the efforts that have been made, there's a programme now that is being run by the sector in Wales\u2014it's 'Study in Wales'. But that is a determined collective effort to present Wales as a good place to study, with particular messages about what distinguishes studying in Wales from studying more broadly in the UK. In a sense, that is responding to the need to increase the presence of Wales in an international market. It will take a while to actually have an impact, but I think that's exactly the sort of work the sector need to be doing more of. mark reckless am: What are those messages on why prospective students should study in Wales? dr david blaney: One of them in particular is relative safety. We know that one of the considerations, particularly for parents of overseas students, is are they going to go to a safe environment, and we know that the perception of international students who study in Wales is that this is a comfortable and safe place to be. That's partly a function of the size of our larger cities\u2014quite a lot smaller than many of the cities in England. So, we've got a UK-quality system, a UK degree, and the strength of that brand is available in Wales, but it's available in a way that is safer and more supportive, I think is the messaging that's coming through. darren millar am: I just wonder to what extent you have been able to plan in your financial forecasts for the next few years ahead for the potential impacts of Brexit. What have you built in, if anything? bethan owen: In terms of our funding, we receive our funding annually, but the sector provides us with financial forecasts, and we use those for monitoring sustainability. We are due to receive a full forecast at the end of this month, and we obviously have updated information from institutions. darren millar am: And they're three-year forecasts that come through to you, aren't they? bethan owen: They are four plus the current year.\u00a0So, we've got numbers to 2019-20 at the moment, and expect to go to 2020-21. darren millar am: And what are the universities expecting? What do they anticipate? bethan owen: Well, for 2017-18, which is the year we're about to end now, they were expecting \u00a338 million income from European students, and approximately \u00a391 million from the various European programme funding sources, and that's about 8 per cent of the total income\u2014\u00a31.5 billion\u2014of the sector. The forecasts are assuming that that continues, albeit that institutions\u00a0have various scenarios that they have for all sorts of scenarios that we can all speculate on, and, as I mentioned earlier, the balancing act of maintaining infrastructure and\u00a0resources and staff in the short term is where we are at the moment, or where the sector is at the moment. And there are also signs that the banks and lending institutions are becoming a bit more risk-averse in providing borrowing to institutions, and of more differentiation between individual institutions being made than has possibly been the case in the past. The sector made an operating deficit, again looking at all Welsh institutions collectively last year, 2016-17, of \u00a317 million. And we're expecting a similar collective level of deficit for this financial year, if not slightly higher. Now, these are managed deficits and we are not currently seeing critical short-term cash availability issues in the\u00a0sector. However, the increase in funding from Diamond is a key part of enabling the sector to return to longer-term financial sustainability. You can manage in the short-term, but there comes a point when the big cost reductions and\u00a0infrastructure reductions have to be made. And, again, having mentioned the pressures on pay, pensions and other challenges, it is difficult to gauge whether, if those factors come into play as well, some of these cost reductions may have to be made before funding comes in to replace\u2014either Diamond\u00a0funding or the European replacement funding. darren millar am: So, would it be fair to say that, in terms of the funding arrangements, and, in terms of the student numbers, one reason why we've got this recruitment\u00a0problem is this lack of investment in the capital infrastructure that we've\u00a0seen in recent years because of the\u00a0financing arrangements from the Welsh Government, and the fee regime that we had previously, and\u00a0the student finance regime that we had previously, not getting more cash into our Welsh universities perhaps, and that, over the next few years, there's going to have to be much more significant investment in capital if we're to raise the game and be more competitive, yes? bethan owen: Yes, that would be fair to say. darren millar am: So, to what extent are they planning for more capital investment\u00a0in those financial strategies that they've been preparing and presenting to you? bethan owen: They are all planning for capital investment. This year, 2018-19, is the first time that we've had capital funding in our remit letter\u2014so, we've got \u00a310 million of capital funding, which is very welcome, with a prospect of a further \u00a320 million. That will make a difference, particularly\u00a0to those institutions who are not finding it as easy to borrow from financial institutions. However, there are internal governance processes that are putting tight restrictions and\u00a0expectations of what that money will be invested in. But they all have plans to do it and they\u00a0need the confidence that their forecasts and long-term future funding prospects are secure enough that they can get the confidence of borrowers then, and service the costs of those borrowers. What clarity is there from the Welsh Government at the moment in terms of how much they anticipate the Diamond dividend will be, and what proportion of that\u00a0is going to be released to HEIs in the future? bethan owen: I was very carefully not describing it as a dividend\u2014a re-establishing of funding that we had in the past for higher cost and innovation and maintaining research funding. The timescales are difficult, because we have an annual remit letter, and we can work with Welsh Government officials, and they can only give us a sense of when they think the funding will be released. But 2018-19 is\u00a0the start of the system, and because of cohort protection\u2014so, protecting those students who came in on a different deal to the deal from 2018-19\u2014in the early years there is an element of double cost; there's a cost of seeing out the old system and the different cost of implementing the new system. So, at the moment, we're certainly not in a position to tell the sector with any degree of certainty what funding would be beyond what we've allocated for 2018-19, with some sense of what 2019-20 numbers we're working with because we allocate our money over an academic year\u2014so, by definition, we've already made assumptions of four months of the 2019-20 funding, albeit that's not approved yet in the budgetary process. darren millar am: But you're not being given a steer at all as to what you expect the additional resource that you might have to make available to Welsh universities might be as a result of Diamond. dr david blaney: I think it's fair to say that officials have been as helpful as they can be with us, in terms of the planning assumptions we make and indications about whether or not we are being too ambitious or not ambitious enough. So, I think they're being very helpful; as Bethan said, they're constrained by the process\u2014they can't pre-empt a budget process. The other question I think you asked was how much of the money released by the new arrangements will come into higher education. At the moment, we are expecting all of it to come into higher education, as the product of the arrangement between the current Cabinet Secretary and the current First Minister. The extent to which any changes there cause that to come under threat is something I can't judge at the moment. But we have had in our remit letter from the Cabinet Secretary a clear indication that we can expect our resource to grow over the next few years, as the Diamond process unfolds. llyr gruffydd am: Bethan said in an earlier answer that, I think, the financial forecasting from universities forecast something pretty consistent in terms of what they're hoping to be\u00a0receiving in income, for example. So, does that tally, really, or are they going to be recruiting additional students from the UK market or\u2014? What's the plan? bethan owen: I was\u00a0reflecting on the last point when we had consistent information across the sector. bethan owen: I'm expecting that the forecast that we get at the end of this month will reflect the reduced applications we've seen, and an element of that will be reflected in reduced improvements\u00a0as well. So, we don't really know, then, whether\u2014it's unlikely that they are going to expect a consistent fee income, really. dr david blaney: I think it's fair to say we would expect them to respond to what they're seeing in the UCAS process. Even if they didn't, they would all, in any case, have sensitivities for what they would do if things don't come out in the way they hope. And if they didn't have that then we would be on their case, of course, because we want them to be properly sighted. darren millar am: Can I just ask, in terms of the impact of Brexit, have you done any assessment of what you think might happen, or have any of the institutions made available to you any assessments of what they think is likely to happen to their individual institutions, going forward? You've mentioned scenarios earlier on, David, so what scenarios have you set out? dr david blaney: There's a Welsh Government HE Brexit working group, which is chaired by one of the Government directors, and we sit on that. And we have provided that group with early summaries of the risks and the potential impact, in terms of the exposure of the sector to EU-sourced funding. We have, as part of that working group, explored those issues that it would be really very helpful for either the Welsh Government to try to put in place or for the Welsh Government to persuade UK Government to do.\u00a0And I think, in our submission,\u00a0we identified\u00a0a number of areas of what we would consider to be a helpful action, and that has been worked through that working group. We know that it has informed Welsh Government's position, in terms of what it does and also in terms of the conversations that they have with\u00a0Her Majesty's Government. Beyond that, what we haven't done in that working group is share the work that institutions are doing individually to look at how they would\u00a0respond to different scenarios. We are not able to do that here either because, inevitably, they would have varying\u00a0degrees of unpalatability and they would have to be managed very, very carefully. You take cost out, which is essentially the response, you actually take people's\u00a0jobs out, and all of that\u00a0has to be managed carefully. So, that's not really a matter for public consideration, but we do know\u00a0that the institutions\u00a0are looking at a range of scenarios on what they\u00a0would do. Bethan mentioned earlier\u00a0on that the\u00a0current deficit for the sector is a managed deficit\u2014it's not something that has taken\u00a0them by surprise. They are responding to what they\u00a0see as the dip between where Diamond was reporting and where the money starts flowing. Similarly, I think we're comfortable\u00a0that there is a managed approach\u00a0to the scenarios that they're testing within institutions. The bigger issue really, in a public policy context, is the potential damage for the sector to be able to deliver for Wales in terms of research and skills development\u00a0and all the other contributions. darren millar am: So, you're confident that they're taking a robust approach\u00a0to planning\u00a0for various scenarios, going forward, are you, as individual HEIs? dr david blaney: Yes, and as the deal becomes more clear politically, then they will obviously have greater\u00a0clarity in terms of which of these scenarios\u00a0they need to work up more fully, but they are sighted on it. Can I just ask about fee and access plans, and how Brexit might impact them? To what extent\u00a0do you think that they\u00a0could be impacted? dr david blaney: I think there are two dimensions to maybe touch upon there. So, we're just in the process now of finalising our consideration of fee and access plans for the 2019-20 academic year. We, as part of that process, go through similar\u2014we look at their financial sustainability, which is based on their forecasts\u2014data to the stuff we've just been discussing. And\u00a0also, of course, the fee plans themselves make assumptions about how many students of different types, from different domains, are going to be recruited. So, clearly, if there is a continuing downward pressure on EU student recruitment, then that will reduce the amount of fee income that's going to come in, unless they can find other students, and that will reduce the amount of investment in the various activities that are identified in the fee plans. If institutions are becoming aware that the basis upon which they've submitted a fee plan is fundamentally different from the reality, then they can come into us for a change to their fee plan. If it's not fundamentally different, but there are always differences between what you plan and what happens three years later\u2014. We also monitor after the event and, if there are differences, we would then obviously require institutions to explain those differences. Conversely, if they'd had more students, and potentially more investment, we'd want to know what they'd spent it on, and if they've done different things, we'd want to understand that as well. The only other thing that's perhaps worth saying is that, in the 2019-20 fee and access plans\u2014they're not published yet, so I can't give you the full detail\u2014five universities have made reference to Brexit and the Brexit impact, and things they want to do through their fee and access plan to try and address some of those issues, so they're in there as well. darren millar am: But we've already said, haven't we, that it may be nothing to do with Brexit, this dip in EU recruitment, because there are other factors like the attractiveness of the estates and the environment that young people might be educated in? But they're making assumptions that it's linked to Brexit, are they? dr david blaney: Not really. There are things they want to do to enhance and to protect\u00a0student mobility, and some of that will be funded through fee plan investment. So, the Brexit conversation between the EU and the UK Government might or might not sustain\u00a0Erasmus engagement, and if it doesn't, then they need to find other ways of trying to support that sort of thing. What else do you do to assure yourselves that Welsh higher education institutions are effectively planning\u00a0for Brexit? bethan owen: We've touched on contingency plans, but, in an environment\u00a0of uncertainty, I think it's difficult for any of us to know what the right scenario is. I think rather than looking at worst-case scenarios, what the sector is also focusing on is the promotion and looking for additional or increased sources of funding. So, we touched on strengthening the Global Wales engagement in order to sell Wales, so more focus on marketing Wales overseas, but also within the UK. The other area where the sector is working at a UK level very hard is making the arguments to UK Government for maintaining access to the successor to Horizon 2020, which is arguably a larger part of the whole funding infrastructure\u2014students is one part, but the whole funding infrastructure\u00a0for maintaining research capacity. So, working with UK universities to make arguments at UK Government level for maintaining access to those sources of funding is also a part of what the institutions\u00a0are doing. That group, which is the Welsh Government\u00a0group, is being advised by members on it, and that's informing Welsh Government officials when they engage with UK Government\u00a0as well. mark reckless am: Do universities seek your advice on what the risks and, indeed, opportunities of Brexit may be and what you think they should be doing to plan for them, or is your role more one of monitoring what they do as opposed to advising what they should do? bethan owen: They are autonomous institutions and ultimately\u00a0their governing bodies are responsible\u00a0for ensuring their sustainability. It's not a relationship\u00a0where we would advise and direct, but it is a relationship\u00a0where we would question the scenarios if we consider from our experience that we would have expected other scenarios to have been tested. mark reckless am: I understand you don't direct, of course, but my question was about advising. You're overseeing, or monitoring\u2014or whatever you like to describe the role as\u2014quite a number of institutions, and presumably you therefore have particular expertise within your organisation, and I just wondered whether higher education institutions are doing enough to draw on that. bethan owen: I think we can advise\u2014we can advise based on data and information that we can see. The big thing in this whole\u00a0Brexit scenario is the uncertainty and the extent to which our speculation is better informed than the governing bodies or the sector collectively is probably the issue. So, there's a relationship\u00a0with the sector and there's a relationship with individual institutions, and they are different. So, some of these conversations are happening in various ways, where we're all gaining intelligence about what might be a sensible set of planning assumptions. Then, if we see an institution that is manifestly giving signs of not being sighted on some of these risks, either through their forecast or through other assurance\u00a0activity, we will challenge. We have an annual cycle, with two points in the year where we reassess the overall risks of individual\u00a0institutions, and that's based on a whole range of hard data but also a range of soft data. We have lots of conversations and we take all of that in the round and form an assessment about the financial sustainability of the institutions but also the extent to which we think their governance and management arrangements are properly sighted and facing properly the challenges that they face. In some ways, we say it's not about the challenges they face; it's about how they face the challenges. Our alarm bells really ring when we get the sense that, actually, either an executive or a governing body hasn't really noticed. There are medium-term real challenges, both because of Brexit and because of other contextual factors, but at the moment the sector is a managed sector, which is good. It's not always like that, but we're in, I think, a good place at the moment. So, our role is definitely to challenge where we don't think they are making sensible assessments, but it's not to say that their assessment is wrong and ours is right; it's just to have a conversation\u00a0about, 'Why have you done this and what has informed your thinking?' It's slightly more one step back and slightly more subtle, but it is, as you imply, us using the intelligence we gain from all of those conversations when we talk to individual institutions as well. We had evidence last week from some of the higher education institutions, including Cardiff University, and it's very interesting, in relation to Erasmus+ and the mobility funding for students that, I think, only 40 per cent of the mobility funding in Cardiff is paid for by Erasmus+. I note that you've been consulting on national measures for higher education performance and that one possibility is using international mobility as a performance indicator. I was just wondering whether you might go further and expect universities to actually make commitments\u00a0to funding international mobility from their own fee incomes as part of that. bethan owen: Again, reflecting on the latest fee and access plans, seven of the universities are referring to mobility\u2014either they have targets in them or are explaining what their plans are\u2014so they are including an element of it from their own income and fee and access income. However, Erasmus is such a well-established and long-term plan\u2014if we were looking at a scenario where that infrastructure wasn't available, to implement anything similar to that would be much less efficient and much more costly. Ideally, you'd want something that all Welsh institutions could take part in, and that takes some investment and some co-ordinating. I think it's easy to underestimate the accumulation of time that has gone into establishing Erasmus. llyr gruffydd am: And the point was made clearly last week that the brand is internationally recognised. When you enter into Erasmus+, you know exactly what you're going to get, and all of that. But there have been criticisms as well about degrees of flexibility and this, that and the other, so I'm just wondering whether\u2014and there is presumably going to be some change on that front although I'm hoping we can buy into it, as others have done who aren't in the EU\u2014that emphasis on encouraging institutions to look more proactively at funding their own mobility efforts would be positive. dr david blaney: I think the\u2014 llyr gruffydd am: Sorry\u2014especially if it means that they do more of it. I think the Welsh sector is definitely committed to trying to find ways of promoting and resourcing that sort of mobility. There are signs that some of the restrictive elements of the Erasmus programme are going to change anyway, because that's under development and that's positive. There have been positive noises as part of the Brexit negotiations about wanting to carry on being able to access the Erasmus programme. Nothing is agreed until it's all agreed apparently, so we'll have to see on that one. That would be far better, I think, as Bethan indicates, than trying to replace it with a made-in-Wales only, but you could have a made-in-Wales on top. All of these challenges also create opportunities because they stimulate thinking, and so the fact that seven of the eight universities\u00a0are already now using their fee plans as a vehicle for thinking about this is positive, and I think we can take that on from there. llyr gruffydd am: Because that 40/60 split struck me as being the opposite to what I perceived\u00a0the situation to be. A key\u00a0part of your role is to work in partnership with students, so I'd just like to ask what work have you done with students, in terms of maybe protecting their interests as the Brexit scenario evolves? dr david blaney: Well, as you say, we do work with students. We were the first of the funding councils\u00a0in the UK to have a memorandum\u00a0of understanding\u00a0with the National Union of Students in Wales. So, we have close links with NUS Wales and we're very proud of that, and it's very productive. We we're, again, ahead of the rest of the UK in requiring all HE providers to have student charters and there are elements of student protection within the student charter. The UK-wide quality code also has elements in it where arrangements have to be specified about the protection of student interests. That is particularly, in essence, around circumstances where a provider gets into difficulties and they might wish to close a course or something more drastic and then what arrangements are in place to make sure that those students who are in train are protected. So, that is there and we've worked hard with the sector and with NUS Wales to get those measures in place. There's more development work in train at the moment, so we've asked Universities Wales to construct a protection that takes account of the approach to protecting the student\u00a0interests in higher education. We're also requiring\u00a0further education institutions\u00a0who are regulated and deliver higher education to do similar or the same, and that's very important. The students who are HE students in FE are absolutely not second-best, and they should have the same protections. llyr gruffydd am: But is all this a general piece of work? It's not Brexit-specific, although, no doubt, it may\u2014. The other dimension around Brexit is the immigration status of EU students, and that's, kind of, beyond our pay scale\u2014that's a UK Government issue. llyr gruffydd am: Is that something that you have a view on? dr david blaney: It's clearly in the interest of the enrichment of the curriculum\u00a0and the student experience for students in Welsh institutions to be able to have students from other EU countries\u00a0in the mix. Now, of course, you have a statutory duty as well to assess the academic quality of the work in our higher education institutions, and I'm\u00a0just wondering\u00a0what potential impacts you think that Brexit might have on that particular aspect. dr david blaney: I think there are possibly\u00a0a couple of things to say, and one, in a sense, echoes what I was just saying in the final part of my previous response, which is that part of the quality of the student experience\u00a0is the richness that you get from having students in your cohort who have different backgrounds and different perspectives. So, if there is a continuing\u00a0reduction in the number of EU students coming into Welsh institutions, then that richness deteriorates. That doesn't\u00a0mean to say that the base or the threshold standard of what's required for a degree will come under pressure, it's just about the richness on top\u00a0of that, which will be, in a sense, a quality-enhancement issue. That would be something that we would wish to try to protect against, but in the end you can't force EU students to come\u2014you have to try and look attractive, and we've touched on that. The baseline requirement assessment\u00a0of quality will not be affected by Brexit, except in so far as the machinery we use to discharge\u00a0our statutory responsibility, which is through the Quality Assurance Agency, which themselves\u00a0are accredited\u00a0with\u00a0European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education, the European machinery\u00a0for higher education quality. And there's a set of standards around that, and we would obviously wish not to be in a position where our ability to use and adhere to those standards is adversely\u00a0impacted upon. Those\u00a0standards will still exist, and it will be possible for the British system to adhere to them, even if they're not actually able to play in the same way. Then the only other thing I would\u00a0say is that one of the factors that can cause\u00a0the quality of the learning and teaching experience to be likely to become inadequate is when institutions come under financial pressure, just because their capacity to maintain the same sort of student experience can get under pressure. So, clearly, we will be looking for and making sure that institutions manage the financial pressures, if there are any\u2014and there are some at the moment, as we've described\u2014and manage those carefully. And in all of that, we will expect institutions to do their duty to make sure that the commitments they've already made to students are carried through. So, where students have already started on the course, they need to be able to finish that course\u2014you can't just pull the plug out. A lot of what you've told us in the last three quarters of an hour or so will have costs attached, depending on the impacts. Certainly, we're in choppy waters as a sector anyway, and the risk is that things will be even more choppy, if you'll excuse that level of political interpretation, over the years to come. I'm just wondering what advice you might have given the Welsh Government in terms of what level of transition funding, or Brexit transition funding, might be required by the sector, and if you have, what the Welsh Government might have told you. bethan owen: I mentioned earlier that, obviously, we've provided information in terms of the assumptions that the sector are making on income. I think the extent to which that needs to be replaced or supported with transition funding depends absolutely on what the final arrangements for Brexit are, but it's an appropriate point to refer to the report that Professor Graeme\u00a0Reid has produced, commissioned by Welsh Government. But, again, the Reid recommendations in that report build on the Diamond recommendations, and as soon as\u00a0Diamond is in place\u2014and Reid is providing recommendations in addition, to establish funding on the basis that the funding needs to be available in Wales to maintain and develop and strengthen the research and innovation infrastructure that we have. llyr gruffydd am: Are you not worried, though, that the clock is ticking and that we really don't know what the situation is at this point? dr david blaney: Do you mean the Brexit situation? llyr gruffydd am: The Brexit clock, yes. dr david blaney: Uncertainty is unhelpful, because as I've said several times, the sector is a managed sector at the moment. We're not seeing maverick stuff, but actually you can only manage, really, what you can see and what you can reasonably predict. So, the longer the uncertainty persists, the more difficult that is for institutional management and, indeed, for the rest of the machinery to support them. darren millar am: Chair, can I just ask a question? john griffiths am: Yes, Darren. darren millar am: In terms of uncertainty, though, we've still got this uncertainty over whether the extra cash that the Government's going to have to spend as a result of Diamond being implemented is coming to the HE sector. They've given a political commitment, but you've got absolutely no other assurance of the sums of money that are coming in. We've got the reform of tertiary education arrangements in Wales, which are also under way, so it's a bit of a perfect storm for you, isn't it, really, with all of these three things happening at the same time? dr david blaney: We're certainly kept busy. darren millar am: But two of those things are in the gift of the Welsh Government to sort out for you, aren't they? dr david blaney: Well, the policy on the reform of the post-compulsory sector absolutely is a Welsh Government policy. The extent to which they can pre-empt a budgetary process and give us clear sight of the amount of money in future years is\u2014. My understanding is that that's difficult for them to do, and I would repeat what I said earlier: officials have been as helpful as I think they can be in respect of that. , you're right, we've only got a political commitment between two people currently in post. darren millar am: that statement about the savings accrued from Diamond being reinvested wholly into the HE sector has not been repeated, frankly, has it, since the coalition deal was struck? dr david blaney: No, but it hasn't been rescinded either, so\u2014. darren millar am: No, but there have been opportunities\u2014repeated opportunities\u2014in the Chamber, where the Cabinet Secretary's been asked to repeat that commitment, and the First Minister's\u00a0been asked to repeat that commitment and has not given that commitment. That must concern you, and must concern your university sector even more than, perhaps, some of the elements of Brexit that we're discussing. dr david blaney: Bethan has outlined earlier on in this session the fact that institutions are currently running deficit budgets in order not to lose the infrastructure on the assumption that the Diamond money will come in. If anything were to cause significant perturbation, either to the timeline of that or to it coming in at all, then there would be much more of what Medwin Hughes calls 'houskeeping' that would be required, and that would be significant. So, at the moment\u2014I don't like the expression 'valley of death', but there is a valley to cross, and I think the sector is reasonably confident about how wide and how deep that valley is. So, there are several valleys that they're crossing\u2014the metaphor fails, doesn't it, really, but I think you get the drift? So, there are a number of challenges and they can see their way out of some of those challenges, but if any one of these starts to get significantly disrupted, then that would be a real issue for them. Could I go on to ask about other barriers to Welsh universities gaining more funding from UK research councils? What would you say those barriers are? dr david blaney: Well, I think there are a couple of things, really, to say. The first one\u2014and we'll sound like a stuck record if we're not careful\u2014is that there's an issue about investment and the Reid report makes this very clear. So, he has reaffirmed research that had been done previously that identifies that, actually, the quality of the research base in Welsh universities and the productivity of that Welsh research base are both good, there's just not enough of them, and that, in the end, is a product of investment decisions. They have particularly looked at the deficit\u00a0in science, technology, engineering and mathematics areas, and I always say that research is not just STEM. , STEM is important, and I'm not denying the deficit in that area, but we have to also remember that the research agenda for Wales is not just STEM\u2014it's arts, humanities, it's social sciences. The Welsh impact in its research is better than anywhere else in the UK, so that's good. So, they do very well, and we just really need to invest a little bit further\u2014so continue to do very well, but put it on a broader front. If you want to be able to play into the UK-wide research funding, then the investment has two dimensions to it. One is just having enough researchers to be able to play into those increasingly larger projects rather than small-scale projects. If you haven't got the critical mass, it's very hard to make the case that you can play. And the second thing is that UK-wide research pots nearly always fund at about 80 per cent of the total cost of the research, and the other 20 per cent is meant to be found from the core research funding for the university, and if you're in a situation where your core research funding is not competitive, then you're not going to be competitive at getting that money. I think it's fair to say that the Welsh sector has not been sufficiently focused on getting in on the conversations with the research councils, making sure they're in the various committees and so on. We are intending to do a bit of work to see if we can systematise that a bit better\u2014that engagement\u2014because there's no doubt about it: it's not to say that this system is in any way inappropriate, but the more you're in the conversations, the more likely you are to be better placed to respond to the research challenges that come up. One final question: in terms of the researcher collaborations and networks that exist, do you see potential difficulties after Brexit for the continuation and enhancement of those, and are there any particular lessons to learn from\u00a0S\u00ear Cymru II? dr david blaney: I think that there are two things to say here as well. First of all, the Brexit deal might or might not impact adversely\u00a0on the capacity of Welsh and, indeed, UK research infrastructure to play into broader collaborative activity across Europe, and, in a sense, that's a function of the deal whatever the deal looks like, and we'll have to wait and see. But we've mentioned playing into Horizon Europe, and being able to continue with that would be an important part of that capacity. It's not just the money, it's being in the club and it's the signalling that we're in the game. And then the other part of my response to this would be that, actually, Wales will need to continue to be good at the research it does, so maintaining the quality, maintaining the impact, and hopefully growing\u00a0the critical mass. The S\u00ear Cymru initiative has been quite important in doing that, because it's been very focused, capturing key research players, and the attractiveness that that has then to other researchers around them, and to industry collaboration, and they have been areas of real strength that we've invested in. And I think they are already showing dividends in terms of the capacity to win more research funding, and to establish an even stronger presence in the international research market. darren millar am: Just very briefly, one of the pieces of feedback that the committee members received at a stakeholder engagement event, which took place prior to this inquiry starting, to receive oral evidence, was about the research funding that is available from the charitable sector, and how poorly Wales does in attracting some of that research. I think we had some figures from the British Heart Foundation, which said they have \u00a3100 million a year available for research grants, or something like that, and we're getting 1 per cent of that coming into Wales, which is\u00a0obviously pretty low down. I appreciate that research into the type of activity that they want to put their money into, Wales may not be\u00a0particularly good at, and there may be other opportunities with other charities and partnerships. What work are you doing in order to build the capacity that Wales has to attract more of that charitable sector research funding into Wales? bethan owen: One of the issues is the capacity to engage with that funding,\u00a0because of the overhead issue that David mentioned. Again, that could be built in to our funding, if we had the capacity to increase our quality-related research funding. darren millar am: But that pressure's the same in other parts of the UK, is it not? So the overhead funding is still an issue in England, and in other places. bethan owen: There is an increased contribution, and I think it's an element that was increased this year to acknowledge that. I'm fairly certain that some of our institutions will be very strong with the cancer charities, possibly not the heart foundation. darren millar am: So, this gearing issue that you mentioned earlier on, for every \u00a31 that somebody else puts on the table, they can draw in another \u00a34 on top, because that \u00a31 will cover the overheads, whereas the rest of the research cash\u2014. You know, we sometimes get into a conversation about the unhypothecated nature of our research funding, but actually that creates a\u00a0flexibility and the infrastructure investment that allows institutions to be able to respond to these other opportunities. Without that, they can't do it, because if you're not careful, you've got\u00a0institutions engaging in UK-wide or charity-based research activities where they're actually having to pay for it themselves\u2014they're running at a loss. darren millar am: So that's the main problem; it's not that Welsh universities aren't doing their best to get this cash in. Or is it a bit of both? dr david blaney: I think, in the main, universities and researchers will get their cash from wherever they can, so I don't think it's a lack of appetite. Well, thank you, both, for coming in to give evidence to the committee this morning.\u00a0You will be sent a draft of the transcript, to check for accuracy. Okay then, the next item is item 3, papers to note, the first of which is a letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education\u00a0on the school organisation code. The second is a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care on the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill. Paper to note 3 is a letter from the Chair of the Finance Committee regarding scrutiny of the Welsh Government's draft budget\u00a0for the forthcoming financial year, which we will be discussing under item 6 on the agenda. Paper to note 4 is a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care on parental attitudes towards managing young children's behaviour. And\u00a0the final paper to note, paper to note 5, is a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care\u00a0on the children and family delivery grant, which we will discuss later on in private session, if Members are content. Item 4, then, is a motion under Standing Order 17.42 to exclude the public from the remainder of this meeting, and also for items 1 and 2 of the 20 September meeting"

        "Query": "Summarize the discussions on the responsibility for developing curriculum resources, the flaws in the government's pandemic relief program, the debate over the economic recovery plan, and the official acknowledgment of Taiwan's donation by the Minister of Foreign Affairs.",
        "Summary": "The responsibility for determining the curriculum was seen as a joint effort between Philip Blaker and the Welsh Government. The opposition party raised concerns about the wage subsidy program, stating that some companies were unable to access it due to unnecessary barriers. However, the Deputy Prime Minister argued that the program was designed to support as many companies as possible. The government was urged to provide a comprehensive overview of the economic situation and emergency measures, but the minister emphasized the importance of considering each phase of the recovery. The Minister of Foreign Affairs highlighted the significance of the One China agreement and expressed gratitude for global cooperation in combating the Covid-19 virus.",
        "Article": "anthony rota (nipissingtimiskaming, lib.)): I call this meeting to order.  Welcome to the 23rd meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic.  A reminder to all members that in order to avoid issues with sound, members participating in person should not also be connected to the video conference. For those of you who are joining via video conference, I will remind you that when speaking you should be on the same channel as the language you are speaking, and please use your headsets. I remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of this special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. For members participating in person, I ask that they please come and drop their signed certificates off at the table once the petition is presented. I would ask members to be very brief and concise, and to summarize the exact content of the petition. The residents of SaanichGulf Islands are calling on the government to simplify the process for protection of marine protected areas. The marine protected area first proposed in the 1970s for the southern Strait of Georgia, now called the Salish Sea, has been awaiting designation for so long that it was originally endorsed by Jacques Cousteau. The second petition is from petitioners who are very concerned about our obligations under the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and our commitments under the Truth and Reconciliation Commission calls to action. They specifically reference the RCMP violation of UNDRIP in its actions on Wet'suwet'en territory and ask the government to commit to actually living the principles embodied in UNDRIP. I am presenting a petition on behalf of the one in a million Canadians who suffer severe and adverse effects from vaccinations. GuillainBarre syndrome is very debilitating, and this petition seeks the setting up of a no-fault accident or compensation system to help offset the loss of work, the loss of wages and the loss of quality of life that many of these people suffer. denis trudel (longueuilsaint-hubert, bq): Mr.Chair, culture is the soul of a people. Over the past 20years or so, culture, especially music, has never been as accessible as it is now. The advent of digital technology has completely overturned the system for distributing the wealth generated by creators for the benefit of various Web stakeholders, many of whom are billionaires. The third is for Internet and cell phone providers who sell their services as direct access to culture to share their profits with artists. Six thousand people have already signed the first version of this petition, launched last month by musician JordanOfficer and supported by singer BarbaraSecours. As an artist, I am proud to present this petition today because the issues it raises are fundamental to the survival of Quebec culture. garnett genuis (sherwood parkfort saskatchewan, cpc): Thank you very much, Mr. I will be as brief as you suggested, although I will observe that if some members are going on longer during petitions than they normally do, it might be because the government has taken away so many of the tools that opposition members normally have for raising important issues in the House. The petitioners are concerned that instead of focusing on improving medically assisted life, something that we know is a major issue in light of recent revelations, the government has put so much time and legislative energy into efforts to continually further expand euthanasia in Canada and remove vital safeguards. The reality of the way that bill applies is that people from certain backgrounds who wish to practise their faith are not able to fully participate in Canadian society if they are employed in the public service. This petition asks the government to provide a response on that issue, something it hasn't done in response to past petitions on this. The petitioners want to see the government take a strong response in dealing with illegal guns and gun smuggling. At the same time, the petitioners are concerned that the government has the wrong focusthat is, harassing law-abiding firearms ownerswithout putting in place substantial measures to deal with illegal guns. The petitioners want to see the reversal of the order in council from May 1 and strong measures to deal with illegal firearms. The fourth and final petition deals with Bill S-204, a bill that would make it a criminal offence for a Canadian to go abroad and receive an organ from a person who has not consented to giving that organ. It would also create a mechanism by which someone could be deemed inadmissible to Canada if they were involved in organ harvesting and trafficking. The petitioners are supportive of Bill S-204 and of similar bills in previous parliaments and would like to see us pass that bill as soon as possible. These residents have signed a petition asking the Government of Canada, and in fact all members of Parliament, to put a high priority on assisting our poorest seniors. The increases to the GIS by $200, and $300 to the OAS, have been well received. They just want to highlight how important it is to support our seniors, in particular the poorest of our seniors. the chair: For members present in the Chamber, a reminder that they are asked to bring their petitions to the table. June 21 is National Indigenous Peoples Day, a day of acknowledgement and a day of celebration of the beautiful diversity of indigenous peoples across Turtle Island. I wish to recognize the leadership of Chief Shelley Sabattis of the Welamukotuk First Nation in Oromocto, New Brunswick. Each year she and her council, volunteers and staff go above and beyond to show appreciation for their members and to demonstrate pride and culture while promoting well-being. We gather in an event where all are welcome to take part, from traditional hand drum-making with elders to moose meat and tacos. This year we will celebrate a bit differently, but we will still stay connected, virtually and in spirit, to the vast network of indigenous peoples and allies. Chair, COVID-19 is an unprecedented challenge for all communities across Canada, but as we do our part to flatten the curve, I often think about those who suit up every morning to serve on the front lines of our health care system. Even before the crisis, they would often share the hardships they faced on a day-to-day basis. Share this message and say thanks to our front-line workers, participate in the 7 p.m. doug shipley (barriespringwateroro-medonte, cpc): Thank you, Mr. Slowly, we are getting back to some resemblance of normalcy, although unfortunately not soon enough for some of our great summer festivals. It will not be normal in BarrieSpringwaterOro-Medonte this summer without the iconic Boots and Hearts weekend music festival, Kempenfest, Oro World's Fair, the Elmvale Fall Fair, or the Midhurst Autumnfest. Because of the lack of Canada Day celebrations, I've created Happy Canada Day lawn signs that are available through my constituency office, free to all residents of BarrieSpringwaterOro-Medonte. I'm also hosting a drive-through party on Canada Day at the Royal Canadian Legion on St. Among the countless ordinary Canadians who have stepped up to do extraordinary work during COVID-19, I wish to draw attention to our teachers. My father was a teacher, and my daughter-in-law, Kelly Webb, is one now. I'm certain that my colleagues can all easily remember a teacher in their past who played an important role in helping them achieve their potential. This is not the school year anyone imagined, and what the next one will look like is unclear, but our teachers in London West and across Canada have shown that no matter what, they will be there to help our next generation shine. the chair: Before proceeding to the next presenter, I just want to remind the honourable members in the chamber that I realize that the six-foot limit makes it harder to whisper to each other, but we're hearing a bit of rumble, so I just want you to try to whisper at your best. stphane bergeron (montarville, bq): Mr.Chair, on July1st, we will be celebrating one of the most important events for the riding of Montarville: the 175thanniversary of the city of Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville. The theme Proud of our traditions will be the focus of this celebration for the people of Montarville. This is a good illustration of the rich history of this municipality nestled in the western foothills of Mont-Saint-Bruno. The seigneury of Montarville was granted in1710 to the illustrious former governor of Trois-Rivires, PierreBoucher. The parish of Saint-Bruno, which took root there and in which a village grew, became a municipal corporation in1845. To this day, it is one of the most prosperous localities, with a strong sense of belonging, a very dynamic community life and jealously preserved natural environments. A whole program had been drawn up for the celebration, but the current health crisis has taken over some of the planned activities, which has in no way diminished the pride and festive spirit of the people of Montarville. Chair, thank you for allowing me to take a moment to highlight an initiative that I started early on during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Heroes of EtobicokeLakeshore is an opportunity for citizens in my riding to recognize the contributions of those in their community who make life a bit easier. I'm pleased with the number of nominations I received that honour everyone from front-line workers to businesses that are innovating in these difficult times to volunteers who are finding new ways to reach out. I think of Daniel Lauzon who set up Food for Now, a mobile service that helps take care of the homeless. I think of Toni Varone, who helped his business clients by forgiving their rents, or young Lucas, who wanted to thank his teachers. I've been moved and inspired by the countless stories of generosity, strength, resiliency, kindness, incredible character and creativity. Chair, it gives me great pleasure to thank a local Richmond-based charity, the Social Diversity for Children Foundation, SDC, for its hard work both in raising funds for the purchase of personal protective equipment and in distributing this PPE to long-term care facilities and individual seniors' homes in the lower mainland of B.C. The COVID-19 relief fund is supported by a dozen other non-profits, businesses and community groups. It is amazing to have witnessed how the younger generation have gotten involved in caring for the elderly at this very challenging time. Chair, June is ALS Awareness Month, and 79 years after Lou Gehrig died from ALS little has changed. On June 21, Canadians will gather virtually to raise funds for ALS Canada in the Walk to End ALS. In Halton, normally we meet each year at Bronte Creek Provincial Park on the May long weekend to raise funds for ALS Canada. This year I will virtually join Tim's Titans, a team formed to honour Tim Robertson, my friend who died in 2016 after living with ALS for 13 years. I have a T-shirt, with a picture of Lou Gehrig, that says, Great Player...Lousy Disease and Tim's Titans...Great Team! ALS...Still a Lousy Disease. Join me on June 21 for the virtual Walk to End ALS to raise funds to support patients and their families and for ALS research. The peaceful protests that we're seeing across the country and around the world were not triggered by an isolated incident. They are fuelled by decades of ineffective action against something that is so insidious and deeply entrenched in our history, systems and institutions. It exists when a shocking report exposes the Peel District School Board's failure to work fairly with the black community. It exists when D'Andre Campbell, who was fighting mental illness, loses his life at the hands of the police. We need to dismantle the systems that allow this privilege and oppression to take form, and address the unconscious bias plaguing our institutions. Chair, a few months ago I rose in the House on the eve of our closure due to COVID-19. I told Canadians we must not give in to fear, that we would carry on and get through this crisis stronger than ever. Businesses are reopening, jobs are returning and our lives are starting to feel a bit normal again. Canadians pulled together, and because of that we did not see the devastating death toll that many had predicted. Life may be returning to normal, but unfortunately, here in this chamber of democracy, the people's voices continue to be shut down. In the words of my grandfather, it's time for the Liberals to get with the program and bring back the House. Chair, from in-person learning to virtual classrooms, COVID-19 has drastically changed the lives of students across the country, especially those in post-secondary education who are worried about covering costs like tuition or rent this coming fall. Our government recognized that students should not have to worry or put their futures on pause during this difficult time. If you're a high school student headed to a post-secondary school, or a current post-secondary student or a recent graduate, you can receive the Canada emergency student benefit every four weeks and have the financial support that you need to save for school. We also doubled Canada student grants and loans, enhanced the student loan program, increased supports for indigenous post-secondary education and introduced the Canada student service grant for those who wish to pursue it. I wish them all the very best, and I wish all of you, my colleagues and those across Canada, a very happy National Indigenous Peoples Day, which is coming up on June 21. the chair: I want to remind the honourable members to keep to their 60 seconds so that we don't go over the time. Chair, I rise today to once again implore the government to do something about the horrible lack of access to and crazy cost of rural Internet service. Right now, too many areas of my riding have no access to rural Internet service at all, and those who can get service are paying through the nose. I've even heard constituents say that during this pandemic, they are having to choose between feeding their kids and educating them. Is that too much to ask of the government? the chair: We'll now go to Mr. Chair, these last few months have been incredibly challenging for the residents of CowichanMalahatLangford, who have been forced to deal with the economic and social consequences of COVID-19. The pandemic has laid bare the inadequacies of our social safety net, the weakness in our supply chains and the dependence of our society on essential workers, who often work long hours for low wages, putting themselves and their families at risk. We've also been forced to confront the systemic inequality, poverty and racism that continue to hold so many people back from achieving their full potential. I will not dishonour the sacrifice that so many have made during this time by allowing us to go back to the status quo that got us here in the first place. I will not apologize for demanding that the most vulnerable in our society get the supports and opportunities they need to live with dignity, and I will not relent from pushing my political colleagues to summon the courage necessary to implement policies that lead to environmental, economic and social justice. steven blaney (bellechasseles etcheminslvis, cpc): Mr.Chair, here is a beautiful story, the story of a woman from Bellechasse, a courageous young mother from Saint-Malachie, Marie-ChristineGoupil. With three children, including the eldest daughter with a disability, and realizing that her daughter with a disability had special clothing needs, she decided to go into business to meet the needs of other parents who, like her, were facing their child's clothing challenges. Marie-ChristineGoupil has discovered a passion for entrepreneurship and has moved and inspired many people with her passionate and courageous attitude. yves-franois blanchet (beloeilchambly, bq): Thank you, Mr.Chair. I lend my voice to the Chief of the Assembly of First Nations of Quebec-Labrador, GhislainPicard, whose message is as follows:     There have been no fewer than 14reports and conclusions of commissions of inquiry since1967 highlighting major problems in relations between law enforcement agencies and indigenous people. Are you going to respond, as you too often do, by moving on to the next one, or are you going to do what we expect you to do, which is to recognize that the justice system discriminates against indigenous people and that we have no less right to security than the rest of the population? In three months, police interventions have claimed more victims among our members than the pandemic. rachael harder (lethbridge, cpc): Over the last few months, Canada's democracy has been disregarded and an autocracy has been resurrected in its place. In 2014, he professed that Canadians want their Members of Parliament to be effective voices for their communities in Ottawa, and not merely mouthpieces for an all-too-powerful Prime Minister. A government that does not allow for effective opposition is not functioning in the best interest of Canadians; it is operating in the best interest of itself and, even more so, the interest of the Prime Minister. Canadians deserve to flourish in a democracy, not merely survive under the autocracy that this Prime Minister has created. Chair, I would like to recognize the work of Agincourt Community Services Association and its tireless executive director, Lee Soda, who have been serving our community during the COVID-19 pandemic. Under more pressure than ever, their staff and volunteers continue to serve a community whose need was great even before the crisis. They have opened outdoor washrooms and hand-washing stations for vulnerable communities and are delivering groceries and other essentials to vulnerable seniors. ACSA is a bridge between those who can help and those who need help, and they are just one example of how our community has come together to meet this challenge. There are restaurants and businesses donating meals to front-line workers, residents answering the call to stock the food bank shelves and neighbours looking in on the vulnerable and isolated. Please note that we will suspend the proceedings twice in order to allow employees who provide support for the sitting to replace each other safely. Chair, for months Conservatives have been pointing out flaws in Liberal government programs that are preventing Canadians from getting the help they need. The Prime Minister has refused to make these very technical changes to get more help to Canadians who need it. For example, on the wage subsidy, more than two-thirds of the money allocated for that program has lapsed because businesses don't qualify. Will the Prime Minister change the program to allow companies who have made acquisitions to access the wage subsidy to keep more people working? right hon. Chair, from the very beginning we knew that as we rolled out measures, we would need to improve them and tweak them, and that's exactly what we've been doing over the past three months. But we continued to improve them, to make additions and amendments so that more people could get the help they needed, including with the proposed legislation last week that expanded the reach of the wage subsidy to more businesses. Chair, it was the Liberals who said no to the motion to allow this Parliament to sit to debate that motion, and even in that legislation they refused to allow businesses who have made acquisitions to access the program. Now, when we look at the rent relief program, it is so difficult to apply for it that many landlords are refusing to bother, leaving even more small businesses to fall through the cracks. In fact, of the $3 billion allocated to the rent relief program, only $39 million has been paid out. It's now June and he has refused to fix these programs and has successfully talked out the calendar on the days that the House of Commons could meet to discuss these programs. We recognize, in conversations with the premiers, how important it is to make sure that we're working together, the provinces and the federal government, on issues like rent subsidies where commercial rent is indeed a provincial jurisdiction. Many provinces have moved forward with the eviction bans that are necessary to go along with this, and we'll continue to work with provinces to make sure that we're getting Canadians the help they need. He has run down the clock on parliamentary sittings and he still refuses to make these changes to get more help to Canadians. Some of these sites are very near sensitive government institutions, like government departments, the National Research Council, RCMP headquarters and the Bank of Canada. How long has the Prime Minister known that Huawei technology has been installed in the Ottawa area? right hon. Chair, first off, on the issue of Parliament, it has been meeting four times a week over the past many weeks, and members of the opposition have been able to continue to ask questions on COVID-19 and a broad range of subjects. Moreover, every two weeks the finance department puts forward at the finance committee the full transparent measures that we've taken, so that parliamentarians can study them. justin trudeau: in regard to Huawei technology there are strict rules for companies to follow and we assume they will all follow those. I want to remind the honourable members who are joining us virtually that heckling really does disrupt the whole session. Your face does come up and we do see who it is, so I just want to make sure that you're aware of that. Chair, throughout this unprecedented pandemic, we have been open and transparent about all of the measures we've put forward. Chair, the Prime Minister has pursued a policy of appeasement in pursuit of a personal vanity product at the UN. He's abandoned Israel and committed funding to UNRWA, an organization whose schools have been used as storage facilities for Hamas rockets against Israeli civilians, and whose facilities have served as breeding grounds for racism and anti-Semitism. He has apologized for the Iranian regime when it shot down a plane full of Canadian citizens, and he refuses to list the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist entity. What's the point of having a seat at the table if you have to sell out Canadian principles to get there? the chair: The Right Honourable Prime Minister. That's why, when we took office five years ago, we demonstrated the kind of leadership on values that Canadians expected. elizabeth may: This being a committee, we can have a point of order during what would have been question period. I am not sitting that far away from the Prime Minister, and I'm sorry, but Andrew Scheer used to be the Speaker of the House and should show better decorum. Chair, on the same point of order, it is disgusting for the leader of the Green Party to use decorum as an excuse to interrupt the Leader of the Opposition in the middle of critical lines of questioning. The leader of the Green Party knows the rules of the House and shouldn't be abusing them to advance a partisan agenda. andrew scheer: I appreciate the honourable leader of the Green Party, Elizabeth May, for that reminder. I just want to say to the member, and to all members, that the reason that I cannot control myself is that the Prime Minister used the word embarrassment in answering a foreign affairs question, and it just made me think of the India trip. yves-franois blanchet: Mr.Chair, while the Greens and the Conservatives are saying that they'll be waiting outside after the meeting, I will ask a question. The Prime Minister has extended the Canada emergency response benefit, and that's good news, but it's not enough. For us, it was also urgent to adjust the CERB to the needs of the tourism, arts and agriculture sectors. So what happened to the urgency of reforming the CERB? Why is the government refusing to talk to the opposition parties? right hon. We have unequivocally proposed to extend the debate to reach an agreement, which brings me to my second question. Last week, the issue of assistance to people with disabilities was also a pressing concern, and it's even more so a week later. The Bloc proposed to extend the discussions and split the government's bill in two to help people with disabilities. Why is the government refusing this assistance to people with disabilities, when it could have been debated with the opposition in a civilized and proper way in a Parliament in which it has a minority? right hon. justin trudeau: That was exactly what we wanted, but unanimous consent of the Chamber was required to debate this matter, and the Conservative Party of Canada voted against it. yves-franois blanchet: If the idea is so good and wonderful, why not start over and open the dialogue now? What's stopping the Prime Minister from being a rallying point and inviting us to take to each other and resolve the problem, rather than saying that he is going to pack up his toys and go home? The people with disabilities are the ones who will pay the price. Where was the Prime Minister on October21,2019? He received a minority mandate from Quebeckers and Canadians. Why is he behaving like something between a prime minister with a majority and a monarch by divine right? right hon. justin trudeau: I've heard the Conservative Party and the Bloc Qubcois throw their accusations around. They don't point out that the House of Commons did indeed give its consent to extend the mandate of the Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic until the end of June. Unfortunately, they too are part of a minority Parliament and must respect the voice of the majority of parliamentarians, just as we do. yves-franois blanchet: I might have been tempted, but that's unlikely to happen because the Prime Minister isn't me, he's him. In addition, the government wants to buy the right to interfere in provincial and Quebec jurisdictions for $14billion. However, Quebec and a number of provinces are refusing to allow it to interfere in their jurisdictions and are asking that this money be paid to them unconditionally. Is the Prime Minister trying to take advantage of the crisis or is he trying to create a constitutional crisis? right hon. justin trudeau: Mr.Chair, the safety of Canadians is the responsibility of all levels of government. That's why we have proposed a $14billion agreement to ensure that all Canadians across the country experience a safe re-opening of the economy. This is a proposal that we are working on with the provinces because we know that there are needs across the country, including early childhood centres, screening and support for municipalities. Indigenous leaders have expressed a lack of confidence in the RCMP commissioner's ability to tackle full-scale systemic racism, but the Prime Minister has expressed his confidence in the commissioner. Chair, over the past two years, Commissioner Lucki has made significant strides forward on an issue where there is still much more to do. We know that systemic racism exists in all of our institutions across this country the chair: We'll now go back to Mr. jagmeet singh: This is the same RCMP commissioner who just recently said that they couldn't explain what systemic racism was. Why does the Prime Minister believe that the RCMP commissioner can tackle systemic racism in the RCMP? right hon. Chair, recent events have made it abundantly clear that to tackle the systemic racism at the level of the RCMP, we need a full-scale overhaul of the RCMP. Is the Prime Minister committed to a full-scale overhaul of the RCMP to root out systemic racism? right hon. Chair, I am committed to addressing systemic racism in this country and taking significant, bold actions to reduce the amount of discrimination that indigenous peoples, that racialized Canadians face on a daily basis. What it's saying is that we need to be better at where we spend our money, investing in communities and not policing. Will the Prime Minister commit to a review of the RCMP budget to allocate resources to community services and not to policing? right hon. Chair, over the past years we have been investing more directly and more money in community organizations, in the black community, and working with indigenous partners on the path to reconciliation. We have been investing in the kinds of community-based programs and solutions that are part of the solution. We know there is much more to do, and we will continue to look at all of our expenditures to make sure we're doing the right things. Chair, over the past few years, while the Prime Minister has been in office, the RCMP budget has increased by 31%. In recent events we've seen people who needed a health care response to a health care crisis been killed by the RCMP. Does the Prime Minister believe that we need to be investing in a health care response instead of a police response for people who are faced with a crisis? right hon. We need to make sure that our systems across the board, from our police systems to our judicial systems, to our health care systems, to our community systems, are actually addressing the systemic discrimination issues that are embedded within them That is exactly what we are going to continue to do in the coming years. Chair, with regard to the CERB extension, can the Prime Minister guarantee that everyone who is receiving CERB payments now will continue to do so without any gaps throughout the summer? right hon. Chair, I am happy to highlight that many Canadians who were on the CERB are now returning to work. We know that as the economy gets back to work, people will want to the chair: We will go back to Mr. jagmeet singh: Can the Prime Minister assure people who need it that they will continue to receive the CERB over the summer, yes or no? right hon. justin trudeau: We are very pleased to point out that we are going to extend the Canada emergency response benefit for at least another eight weeks, because a lot of people are going to need it. the chair: We're going to pause and suspend proceedings just for a few moments to allow our support staff to substitute for one another in a healthy and safe way. Chair, it was really a surprise in the middle of a pandemic to see the Prime Minister at his first campaign stop last week in Ottawa. He has a daily report show and he wants to sideline Parliament, dominate the news cycle and keep everyone in the dark about the state of the economy. According to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, there is no reason that he cannot provide the fiscal update during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the PBO has published a number of reports himself. Why won't the Prime Minister provide a fiscal update so we can all understand the state of our economy, or is that just not part of his campaign playbook? hon. mona fortier (minister of middle class prosperity and associate minister of finance): Thank you, Mr. We will continue to be open and transparent about the actions that we are taking to support families, businesses, workers, our health care system and our economy. cathy mcleod: Chair, Canada's economy was in trouble prior to the COVID, with some of the worst numbers since 2009. Government revenues in March dropped by 7.2%, and it's shameful and, quite frankly, it's outrageous that they refuse to provide Parliament and Canadians with an economic update. Households during this challenging time know how much money is coming in and they know how much money is going out. mona fortier: The Canadian economy is going through a period of extraordinary uncertainty due to COVID-19. We've continued to be open and transparent about the measures we've put in place for Canadians, workers and businesses. In fact, we have reported biweekly to Parliament on the total cost and status of our plan's measures. As soon as it's possible to provide clear economic projections, we will provide a comprehensive update to Canadians the chair: We go back to Ms. cathy mcleod: Other governments have managed to provide updates for their citizens and carry out their responsibilities, but of course this government has sidelined Parliament with simply a question-but-no-answer period. The forestry industry was in crisis even before the pandemic, with mills closing down and thousands of jobs lost. Eight weeks ago, Minister Freeland said, I have had many discussions with leaders in our forestry sector and the provinces about what we can do to support the industry today. Meanwhile, we've had support going to the arts and we've had support going to fisheries, just to name a few, but arguably for the industry that was having some of the most numerous challenges, it has been radio silence. Can the government at least commit to releasing an updated softwood lumber transition plan before we rise? hon. Chair, we remain committed, of course, to the forestry industry and seeing it through this pandemic and this very uncertain time. The expanding market opportunities program, for instance, has helped Canada's forestry sector diversify, create jobs and open new markets. We've had new construction projects that are active today, using Canadian wood in key markets like Korea, Japan, China and the United States. Tomorrow this House will vote on our government's investment of $20.97 million for this program. It's part of our budget 2019 commitment to invest $251 million over three years, and I hope the opposition will support us in that. cathy mcleod: It was stated in a major newspaper this morning that this government is like a sexy sports carvroom, vroom, vroombut with a history of breakdowns and major repairs. The sector is also an essential link in the medical equipment supply chain, and we thank them for all the work they're doing. We're aware of the immense pressures faced by this sector, especially at this time, and Deputy Prime Minister Freeland and others are taking that seriously and working through this issue. duties on Canadian softwood lumber are unfair and unwarranted, and we will pursue all means in order to the chair: Before continuing, I want to remind honourable members who are at home to make sure that the boom on their headsets is down. grard deltell (louis-saint-laurent, cpc): Mr.Chair, before I ask my question, I'd like to pay tribute to the Minister of Justice, particularly to his versatility. I like Mr.Lametti very much, but I'd like Mr.Morneau to answer my question. Yesterday, in a Senate parliamentary committee, the Minister of Finance half-opened the door to an economic update. Based on what he said, it seems that, as we speak, a committee of the Department of Finance is working on an economic update. mona fortier: Mr.Chair, as we know, the Canadian economy is going through a period of extraordinary uncertainty. As soon as it's possible to provide clear economic projections, we will provide a full update to Canadians. Right now, we can say that we have supported workers, businesses and Canadians with the emergency measures we have put in place. We will continue to do so, because we need to be sure that Canadians can get through this crisis. We don't know when the economic update will take place, yet all across Canada, provinces are doing economic updates. mona fortier: Mr.Chair, since the beginning of the crisis, we have implemented the economic action plan to respond to COVID-19, and we've provided immediate assistance to Canadians, businesses and workers. In addition, 8.4million Canadians the chair: We are returning to Mr.Deltell. grard deltell: Mr.Chair, next Friday, the Quebec minister of finance, EricGirard, will give an economic update. If EricGirard can give one for Quebec, why can't BillMorneau give one for Canada? hon. mona fortier: Mr.Chair, once again, we have been open and transparent from the outset. grard deltell: Mr.Chair, I cannot judge the quality of the work done by the provinces, but what I do know is that Quebec, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland have also made efforts to support their residents economically. We have reported biweekly to Parliament on the total cost and status of the measures in our economic response plan. Once again, as soon as clear economic projections can be provided, we will provide an update the chair: Mr.Deltell has the floor. So I ask the question: so far, over the past three months, how much has the pandemic cost Canadians? hon. mona fortier: As I said earlier, it is important to note that we have put forward measures, including the wage subsidy, which have helped more than 2.5million the chair: Mr.Deltell has the floor. grard deltell: Mr.Chair, I have been trying for four minutes to get anything remotely resembling an answer, and I'm getting absolutely nothing. Why are the government and the Minister of Finance, Bill Morneau, not able to table an economic update when some provinces are able to? hon. We have continued to support businesses and Canadians during this time the chair: Mr.Deltell, you have time for a very brief question. grard deltell: The only thing that distinguishes the provinces that table economic updates and the current government is political will. As soon as it is possible to provide clear economic projections, we will provide Canadians with a full update. The difference between our government and the previous government is that we will actually consult with Canadians, including black Canadians, including Asian Canadians, to respond to the challenges, including with an anti-racism secretariat and an anti-racism strategy. Chair, this program was made possible by working with the provinces, and we will continue to encourage landlords and tenants to work together to make sure they have relief for this very difficult time in which they're living. We're continuing to monitor the CECRA program and we will make it possible for businesses to have access to the program. What is it going to take for the government to admit that the program is a disaster and needs changes? hon. Chair, we know our government has been working closely with the provinces and territories to deliver the Canada emergency commercial rent assistance. Although the tenant-landlord relationship is ultimately the responsibility of the provinces and territories, our government has stepped up to provide support through the tools we have and through CMHC so that small businesses can get the rent relief they need. At committee, we were told only around 5,500 of them are receiving COVID-19 rent relief. We will continue to monitor this program closely and ensure that Canada's small businesses are supported during this challenging time. Chair, I want to assure the honourable colleague that we are doing everything and will continue to do everything to help small businesses in our country. Chair, on May 27 the CBSA seized 65 small handguns at Pearson airport, the largest firearms seizure on record. Chair, I would point out that gun violence in any of our communities is unacceptable, and it's important that governments and communities take steps to prevent guns from getting into the hands of criminals. That's why we do important work at our border to keep guns from being smuggled into our country, but it also necessitates additional work. That's why our government has taken a very strong position and will strengthen gun control to keep Canadians safe. We know the Liberals' gun ban won't change anything, but a focus on smuggled guns and criminals will. Chair, stronger gun control laws are an effective tool, and that's been told to us by police leadership and communities across the country. is a strong partner of Canada, as is the European Union, and we're looking forward to continuing that strong relationship the chair: We'll now go back to Mr. With respect to the negotiations with the U.K., when will the minister publish her goals and objectives for this agreement? hon. Chair, we're going to continue to work to ensure that any future agreement is going to be based on the best interests of Canadians, and we will the chair: We will go back to Mr. randy hoback: Can the minister confirm whether they've entered into negotiations with the U.K. mary ng: Our government is analyzing the most-favoured-nation tariff regimes schedule the U.K. Chair, during the CUSMA negotiations, a deal was struck between the Liberal Party and the NDP that the government would notify this House 90 days before it starts any negotiations on any trade agreement. Right now, we are analyzing the most-favoured-nation tariff regimes schedule put out by the U.K. Has the minister discussed a WTO reform with the USTR, the United States trade representative? hon. mary ng: The Ottawa Group is a consensus-based group limited to WTO members who are committed to bringing forward ideas and proposals the chair: We'll go back to Mr. randy hoback: Just as with any other trade agreement, the minister has committed to this House that she will publish the list of goals and responsibilities for the negotiations. Chair, I'm thrilled that we had an excellent meeting of the Ottawa Group yesterday where, as a group, we agreed to take concrete action. randy hoback: Will the minister be releasing a list of Canada's objectives we would like to see the new WTO's director-general pursue prior to the upcoming DG election? hon. I would remind the member that we have access to a billion and a half customers through our very robust mr. randy hoback: A billion and a half customers is fine if you have a functioning WTO, but if you don't have a functioning WTO, then a billion and a half customers may not be fully accessible to our suppliers, manufacturers and agriculture producers. Chair, I want to assure the honourable member that nothing is more important than standing up and helping create markets for our Canadian businesses and to help our small businesses get more export-ready so that they can grow into the international marketplace. This is work that we've committed to do, and we will keep working on it, particularly the chair: We'll go back to Mr. Not only did they present the budget, but they'll also actually debate the budget and pass the budget in Parliament. Chair, the House is sitting in this hybrid format so that people can participate in the House on the screens. I'm sure my colleague is happy to see that his own colleagues are able to ask questions and participate. New Brunswick families and businesses are rapidly making adjustments to manage and live with the coronavirus pandemic. Chair, our government is committed to ensuring that Canadians continue to have access to the benefits that they rely on through Service Canada. We have redeployed over 3,000 additional staff to ensure that Canadians continue to have access to their benefits. We've established a 1,500-agent call centre to make sure that people can get access to the phone lines to get the help they need. Provincial governments are working hard to adjust to Canada's new normal by opening up businesses and front-line government services. Chair, we're currently working with our world-class public health experts to determine how best to reopen the Service Canada network for the public. Make no mistake: Our Service Canada employees have gone above and beyond to ensure that Canadians continue to have access to the services that they rely on and the benefits that they need. john williamson: Please don't hide behind health experts when the Prime Minister is appearing in the middle of large protests, yet is afraid to bring back the Parliament of Canada to do its business. Bills are being studied, opposition input is being heard and MLAs are voting on legislation, not rubber-stamping government bills. When will the government table an economic update so taxpayers understand what was spent, what is owed by our kids and grandchildren, and what the government's fiscal footing looks like? hon. The only reason my colleague is able to ask a question and I'm able to answer his question is that he's right there on the screen. We have this hybrid format that cares for MPs across the country, not only the ones sitting in the House. When will the government table an economic update so that taxpayers understand what was spent, what is owed by our kids and grandchildren, and what the government's fiscal footing looks like in today's environment? hon. We have been open and transparent about the measures we have been providing to support families, businesses and workers. Again I will ask when the government will table an economic update so that we can have an understanding of what the government's fiscal footing looks like. Chair, we have included biweekly reports to Parliament on the full cost and status of our economic response plan measures since the beginning. I have said, and I will continue to say, that when it is possible to provide a clear economic projection, we will provide an update. john williamson: What is the full cost to date of the government's COVID-19 relief measures, as the minister just claimed the government has provided to Parliament? hon. Chair, we have provided support for workers, and 2.5 million Canadians have been helped through the Canadian wage subsidy. stphane bergeron: Mr.Chair, as the leader of the Bloc Qubcois mentioned a few moments ago, the government promised $14billion to Quebec and the provinces, but in targeted transfers. But Quebec and the provinces don't just want this money to be transferred unconditionally, they also want a real discussion on a permanent increase in health care transfers. The federal government, which does not manage any hospitals or long-term care centres, must stop playing armchair quarterback and transfer the money to the only governments with jurisdiction over health, that is, Quebec and the provinces. Will it do so without delay and without nitpicking? the honourable patty hajdu (minister of health): Mr.Chair, we know that the Government of Quebec is working hard to ensure the safety of Quebeckers and we are here to support them. As part of this co-operation, we have developed health and safety recommendations for workplaces, we have purchased medical equipment for workers and we have supported the province in developing its reopening program. stphane bergeron: The co-operation is so effective that the money is staying in the federal government's coffers. We see it with housing, for which Quebec has not received a dime of the $1.4billion it is owed. pablo rodriguez: I am pleased to confirm to my colleague that there is no messing around, no quibbling, nothing of the kind. There is a clear willingness on the part of the federal government to co-operate with Quebec and all the provinces. stphane bergeron: We don't want to bicker, we want the money to be paid out. There is $1.4billion that should be paid to Quebec for social housing and is sitting in the federal government's coffers. We are waiting for money for water treatment and water systems, but it is sitting in the federal government's coffers. What is the government waiting for to pay out the money so that we can get our economy rolling? hon. stphane bergeron: MadamChair, things are definitely at a standstill, because the money is owed and has not been paid out. We need more flexibility in the gas tax program and Quebec's contribution to allow municipalities to undertake work on city halls, community centres and fire stations. We need the federal government to contribute to funding public transit operations, which have become a real financial drain because of the drop in ridership. pablo rodriguez: When it comes to just talking, the Bloc Qubcois has a lot of experience, I admit. iqra khalid (mississaugaerin mills, lib.): Madam Chair, I'll be splitting my time with the member for GlengarryPrescottRussell. During a consultation with the business community in Mississauga, the concerns of businesses, big and small, included the need for stable, affordable and safe child care. With the lack of such child care spaces, an economic recovery plan post-COVID cannot be effective until and unless we make sure that people are able to get back to work. I've heard from parents across Mississauga that they're being forced to stay home because of inadequate child care and that they have to choose between putting food on the table and keeping family safe. More and more employers are realizing that good employees are unable to contribute to their business growth because of this challenge. Now more than ever, we need to find long-term sustainable solutions for Canadians who face challenges with regard to child care. I ask our Minister of Families, Children and Social Development this: What is our strategy to tackle this ever-growing need for a national child care plan? hon. ahmed hussen: Madam Chair, I thank the honourable member for her question and for her important advocacy and work on this important issue. That is why we're committed to continuing to work with provinces and territories to renew our agreements on early learning and child care, and to provide, at the earliest opportunity, $400 million in support. In addition to that, the Prime Minister has already indicated that child care will be part of the $14-billion pledge to provinces and territories to assist them with respect to COVID-19 recovery efforts. Over the next decade, we will continue to invest $7.5 billion, and together we have achieved the goal of over 40,000 affordable child care spaces. We are also committed to continuing to create over 250,000 before-school and after-school child care spaces for kids under the age of 10. We will continue to work with our partners in the provinces and territories to ensure that Canadians can continue to have access to safe, quality and affordable child care. francis drouin (glengarryprescottrussell, lib.): MadamChair, small businesses play a fundamental role in the Canadian economy. In an article in LaPresse, the Minister of Economic Development warned us that the economic crisis caused by severe lockdown measures could have more serious consequences in small municipalities than in large cities. Based on discussions with the chambers of commerce in my riding, it is clear that federal government assistance will be essential for the reopening of the economy, specifically for the rural economy. In fact, I would like to acknowledge the work of the Prescott-Russell community development corporation , under the leadership of John Candie. After announcing almost $57million to help SMEs adopt e-commerce, how does the minister plan to help SMEs and the business community in our rural areas? hon. mlanie joly (minister of economic development and official languages): MadamChair, I also thank my colleague from GlengarryPrescottRussell for his important question. It is also why we have doubled the budget of CFDCs and Community Futures organizations across the country.  In southern Ontario we have reinvested over $260million in the regional economic development agency FedDev. In the great riding of GlengarryPrescottRussell, which I am particularly fond of and where there is a very good member of Parliament, there is an additional $1million for entrepreneurs in the region. carol hughes): The honourable member for GlengarryPrescottRussell has 36seconds left. daniel blaikie (elmwoodtranscona, ndp): Thank you very much, Madam Chair. She has been working from home since late March, taking care of her child, who is out of school, and caring for her father, who is living with her and vulnerable to COVID-19. As a parent and a care provider to a vulnerable person, she's not comfortable with physically returning to work. Service Canada won't give Krystal a straight answer as to whether going on leave and collecting CERB would count as refusing a reasonable job offer. With Bill C-17 looming in the background, Krystal is worried about jail time and fines if she does right by her child and her father by applying for CERB. Can Krystal reasonably refuse to go back to work and collect CERB, or will she be considered a fraudster? That's my question for the minister that is specific to Krystal's case. As well, what is the minister doing to provide clear direction to Canadians and to Service Canada agents so that people can get a clear answer before making their decision about returning to work? hon. We recognize that Canadian workers will face various different situations, including those who are ineligible for the Canada emergency support benefit. We'll continue to work with workers to make sure they're able to be supported throughout this pandemic. daniel blaikie: Madam Chair, that answer is really not good enough, because the problem here is that Krystal needs to know whether she can continue receiving CERB or not. That's a federal government decision, and she needs to know whether the federal government is going to accuse her of fraud and put her in jail or assess fines against her if she refuses to go back to work because she wants to take care of her child and her father. ahmed hussen: Madam Chair, I can assure the honourable member that if a Canadian has to take care of a loved one due to circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, they are indeed eligible to receive the CERB and remain receiving that benefit. laurel collins (victoria, ndp): As we deal with the global pandemic, we cannot lose sight of the ongoing climate emergency. Canada has missed every single climate target it set, and we need to break the cycle of empty promises. Canadians want their government to be accountable, and environmental groups such as Ecojustice, CAN-Rac, Environmental Defence and West Coast Environmental Law, as well as the government's own climate institute, are all calling for legally binding climate targets. When will the government put its climate targets into law with legally binding milestones so we never miss another target again? hon. navdeep bains (mississaugamalton, lib.): Madam Chair, I thank my honourable colleague for her question. It is a priority not only for us as a government, but it should be a priority for all Canadians. That is why we have a comprehensive plan that also includes significant investments in clean technology, which will help reduce our carbon footprint. I am confident that these measures will enable us to not only meet but exceed our 2030 target and also allow us to achieve our net-zero 2050 target. navdeep bains: Madam Chair, I think the fundamental issue here is having a plan when it comes to the environment. I'm confident that the measures that we have takenputting a price on pollution, investing in clean technology, and other key measures to reduce our carbon footprint, including the investment in infrastructureunderpin a plan the acting chair (mrs. laurel collins: This government is not meeting its targets, but it is meeting with oil and gas lobbyists. Are we going to choose a just recovery with good, sustainable jobs for Canadian workers, or are we going to keep subsidizing oil and gas companies to the tune of billions, subsidies that we know are ending up in the pockets of CEOs and shareholders? the acting chair (mrs. navdeep bains: Again, Madam Chair, this is the fundamental difference between us and the NDP. We fundamentally believe that the entire economy needs to work together, including the energy sector, to enable us to achieve those 2030 and 2050 targets. We are going to work together to support our workers, including in the energy sector, to reduce our carbon footprint. When I was last here in May, I was on my way back to Saskatoon from Toronto, and there was actually someone on my flight who tested positive for COVID-19. Why hasn't the government put rules in place requiring airlines to reach out to individuals like me who may have been exposed to COVID on their flights? hon. patty hajdu: Madam Chair, it's hard to speculate on what happened from such a vague description of his experience, but I will say that we have every confidence in local public health, which is doing the hard and heavy lifting of contact tracing and working very closely with all kinds of different sectors, including airline sectors, to make sure that close contacts of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 are found, are traced and are isolated. I assume that the member took appropriate precautions on the flight and I hope that he continues to do so. kevin waugh: Madam Chair, it was reported that the individual on my plane who had COVID was actually connecting in Toronto from an international flight. The Prime Minister announced last week that they would begin mandating temperature checks for those bound for Canada in July. Will international travellers be tested when they land in Canada, or will they be relying on the tests that take place in other countries? hon. bill blair: Madam Chair, this is a very important question, because the protection and safety of all Canadiansin particular, Canadian travellersis a high priority for our government. That will initially be done primarily by the airlines that are in the best position to do it at this point in time. We are also now going to be including CATSA, the people who do the security screening, so that when people enter the airport, they will also be screened. kevin waugh: Madam Chair, last week five of the largest professional sports leagues in North America put out a statement of support for my private member's bill, the safe and regulated sports betting act. Given the struggles that clubs and leagues are facing due to COVID-19, including having no fans at all in the stands for the foreseeable future, the legalization of sports betting would be a welcome opportunity not only to engage fans but to generate much-needed revenue. Will the government commit now to supporting the sports and gaming industries by supporting my private member's bill, Bill C-218? hon. bill blair: Madam Chair, I've had the opportunity on many occasions to speak to members of Parliament and also to mayors and councillors and people living in border communities where there are casinos. I would like to advise the member that I look forward to the opportunity for a careful examination of his bill. At the same time, we will examine his bill with all of the necessary attention to make sure it's given full consideration. kevin waugh: Madam Chair, it's the first time in history that we've had the five professional leagues in this country joining together for this bill. I've heard major concerns from a number of newspapers in this country about competition they're receiving today from Canada Post, which is offering massive free postage services. In fact, I have one of their ads here, which says that the first 6,000 pieces of postage are 100% free. If the government is genuine about wanting to ensure that newspapers and journals can succeed in this country, why are you allowing Canada Post to use its monopoly power to actually threaten local newspapers in this country? hon. steven guilbeault (minister of canadian heritage): Thank you, Madame Chair, and I thank the member opposite for his question. As you well know, a healthy news and media sector in Canada is a priority for our government, which is why we have put in place a number of measures before COVID-19 and during COVID-19, and we will continue to be there for them after this crisis has gone by. carol hughes): Before we go on, we will be taking a break to do a bit of a changeover. Blair stated yesterday here in the House that the AR-15 has been used in mass killings in Canada on many occasions. Blair, please provide just one specific instance in which an AR-15 was used in a mass killing in Canada. I think this is an excellent opportunity to point out to the member opposite how important it is to actually listen to what was said. If you go back and review that tape, and I would invite you to do so, you'll see that I said the AR-15 and other weapons like themreferring of course to military-style assault weaponshave been used in mass killings, and I actually cited a number of examples. Madam Chair, I think it would be very useful if the member's questions were based on facts. Blair that I actually have watched the video a couple of times, and he specifically states that the AR-15 was used in mass killings in Canada, yet he has yet to provide one. Out of the recently banned firearms on May 1, how many have been or are still currently in use by the Canadian Armed Forces? hon. bill blair: That's an excellent question, Madam Chair, because it's very important to provide Canadians with clarity. I asked him a question on whether any of them is being or ever has been used in the Canadian Armed Forces. Are any of the recently banned firearms still in use, or have they ever been in use, in any military in the world? hon. bill blair: Madam Chair, I think it's important to also recognize that the basic origin, the provenance of the weapons that we have prohibited, was in their original design. As I've said previously, they were designed for soldiers to use in combat to kill other soldiers. alex ruff: As someone who has used many military-style firearms and who is actually involved in helping define what we purchase in the military, I would use none of the ones that are currently prohibited. Can he please confirm whether Veterans Affairs has a plan to address the claims backlog, yes or no? hon. lawrence macaulay (minister of veterans affairs): Madam Chair, I appreciate my honourable colleague's question, and yes, we've indicated that it's a major priority. That's why I'm so pleased that the supplementary estimates contained just under $90 million to address hiring more staff, improving the process and making sure that we attack the backlog in an appropriate manner. lawrence macaulay: Well, Madam Chair, I can assure you that it's in the supplementary estimates, and of course, this money is the acting chair (mrs. lawrence macaulay: Madam Chair, I can tell my honourable colleague that the money is in the supplementary estimates, and with the money we're able to attack this problem in an appropriate manner, and that's what is important for our veterans. alex ruff: The deputy minister committed on March 10 that a written plan would be provided to the Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs within a month and made public. lawrence macaulay: Madame Chair, I'm sure my honourable colleague wants an appropriate plan and he would be fully aware this just under $90 million would make a big difference in the plan to attack the backlog. Therefore, my question is, if the deputy minister in the department provided him with an appropriate plan or a written plan, why is he questioning how appropriate that plan is? I have complete confidence in the deputy minister's ability to produce a written plan. lawrence macaulay: I can assure my honourable colleague that with the appropriate funding, we will address the backlog in Veterans Affairs. carol hughes): We will go now to the honourable member for Parry SoundMuskoka, Mr. Three weeks ago, I asked this government if the finance minister would meet with the beleaguered summer camp sector. Summer camps, which are a social and economic mainstay in Parry SoundMuskoka and all of northern Ontario, have been crippled by the global pandemic. Aside from a brief follow-up conversation over the phone with the junior minister, there has still been no action from this government. ahmed hussen: Madam Chair, I recognize the honourable member's important question and his focus on summer camps. We will continue to engage with them, as we have, to ensure and find ways in which we can get their feedback and find ways in which we can support them. That work is ongoing, and I assure the honourable member that our focus is on the kids and on ensuring that they have access to summer camps for this year. The summer camps association has given lots of feedback and my office has given lots of feedback, so I don't see what's confusing about this. However, I've become accustomed to not really getting answers to questions, so I will go to the next one. The Ontario government's regional reopening plan permits cruise boats to resume on Georgian Bay, yet the federal government is refusing to allow these vessels to operate until July 1. Therefore, small businesses such as the Island Queen cruiser in Parry Sound, which has only a very few precious weeks to operate in the first place, is losing yet another two weeks because of federal inaction. Will the Minister of Transport take a regional approach himself by lifting the federal ban on Georgian Bay, just like the Province of Ontario has done? the acting chair (mrs. There have been a number of very important discussions with the provinces, in particular with the Province of Ontario, around provisions regarding pleasure craft. We're working very closely with our provincial counterparts to address this issue, but we want to ensure that it will be done safely. scott aitchison: Madam Chair, I actually gave the minister a heads-up that I would be asking that question. He sent me an email today saying he was not going to be able to be in the House, and it's great of him to do that. He said that whoever was going to fill in for him would have an answer, but again, that was not really an answer. The next issue I would like to bring this government's attention to is the deplorable state of rural Internet service in Parry SoundMuskoka. Quite simply, there are too many gaps in service, and what is available is generally way too expensive. We have families trying to work and teach their kids from home on unreliable and outrageously expensive Internet service, and we have too many small businesses that either cannot access or afford reliable Internet services. Today Greg Rickford, the Ontario energy minister, and Laurie Scott, Ontario Minister of Infrastructure, announced $2.3 million for seven northern Ontario broadband projects. Minister, will when your government get serious and become a reliable partner for the Government of Ontario and the private sector to deliver this crucial modern-day infrastructure to rural Canadians? the acting chair (mrs. carol hughes): I remind the member that he needs to address the questions and comments to the chair. maryam monsef (minister for women and gender equality and rural economic development): Madam Chair, in the best of times, life without access to high-speed Internet is hard. Our government's unprecedented investments are already connecting a million more Canadian households to this essential service, but until we achieve universal access our work is not done. We will work with our partners, including provinces across the country, to connect every Canadian household to high-quality Internet access that is affordable and reliable. I'm wondering, then, Madam Chair, since the Province of Ontario has used the Northern Ontario Heritage Corporation Fund to make this announcement, what about using FedNor to make the same kind of announcement, and partner with the province? the acting chair (mrs. mlanie joly: Obviously we believe in the importance of northern Ontario; that's why we nearly doubled the budget of FedNor. We will continue to invest in businesses and people all around Parry Sound, Muskoka and northern Ontario. If my colleague has specific projects in mind, please come and see me and let's have a conversation. carol hughes): The honourable member for Montmagny-L'Islet-KamouraskaRivire-du-Loup, Mr.Gnreux, has the floor. bernard gnreux (montmagnyl'isletkamouraskarivire-du-loup, cpc): Thank you, MadamChair. During this pandemic, we are realizing the extent to which reliable high-speed Internet service is needed for Canada's economy. There are still places where telework is not possible today because of the lack of adequate coverage. Benot Pilotto, who is the mayor of Saint-Onsime-d'Ixworth, in my riding, wrote to me a few days ago. That is why I am asking you what concrete results the government plans to achieve for our rural areas by the end of the year. maryam monsef: At the best of times, life without high-speed Internet access is difficult. bernard gnreux: MadamChair, I am simply asking the minister to tell me when the mayor of Saint-Onsime-d'Ixworth will be able to tell his residents when the Internet will be available in his municipality. What does the government plan to do so that rural municipalities across Canada can have access to the Internet as soon as possible? What is its plan? hon. maryam monsef: We are working with partners across the country to ensure that every Canadian household is connected to a high-quality, accessible and affordable high-speed Internet service.  Madam Chair, I assure my colleagues that we share the same goal, and we will work with all our partners across the country to ensure every Canadian household has access the acting chair (mrs. According to the government's plan, when will rural Canadian businesses and households be connected? the acting chair (mrs. maryam monsef: Madam Chair, those plans are under way, and we will have more to share in the coming days. bernard gnreux: It seems that the Minister of Rural Economic Development plans to announce a new plan this week. Can she tell us how this program will differ from the Connect to Innovate program, which is already in place? Can the minister tell us whether her program will solve the problem of the 25square kilometre hexagonal zones, which unfortunately make many projects ineligible for the CRTC's broadband fund? hon. maryam monsef: Madam Chair, I'm pleased to share with my colleague that the model he's referring to, the hexagon model, is no more. bernard gnreux: MadamChair, this year, the Canada summer jobs program is a real fiasco. On May13, 100jobs were announced in my riding; on May20, 16jobs were announced; on May27, 13jobs were announced; on June3, 12jobs were announced; and on June10, only one job was announced. Can we have an announcement, once and for all? Let's stop the piecemeal announcements and finally confirm the remaining jobs today so that our organizations can have young people before the summer starts on the weekend. We recognize the important role that the Canada summer jobs program is playing in supporting employers and young workers in communities right across the country. Our government is working very hard to help employers adapt to the realities of the COVID-19 pandemic, and at the same time is supporting young Canadians as they begin to look for summer employment. We've introduced flexibilities into the program to ensure that more young workers have opportunities to get employed. The honourable member also has to understand that we're in the COVID-19 pandemic, and as such it will take some time for businesses to equip themselves to hire students. Addiction is a health and social issue, but criminalization creates stigma, so people hide their drug use and die alone. Access to a safe supply of drugs and safe injection sites saves lives and puts addicts in daily contact with people who can help them. Will this government end the war on drugs by decriminalizing them, providing a safe supply and reallocating resources from policing addicts to providing treatment for them? hon. patty hajdu: Madam Chair, I think it's really important we make sure that when we speak about people who use substances, we remove stigmatizing language like the word addict. We can stand together, as this government has, with people who use substances and their families to ensure a range of options for people who are struggling with addiction, who are using substances in a way that is harming their health and their communities. Madam Chair, we're working with communities to make sure there are more community-based approaches to treating the acting chair (mrs. paul manly: Madam Chair, the Geneva Convention considers both tear gas and pepper spray to be chemical weapons and prohibits their use in war, yet our police forces use these weapons on Canadian civilians. Will the government prohibit the use of these weapons and require police to use de-escalation techniques to keep legal protests peaceful? hon. bill blair: Madam Chair, the right to peaceful protest in this country is a constitutionally protected right. At the same time, Madam Chair, we recognize that the use of even less than lethal force can have significant impacts on people's safety. It's prohibited for non-police use, and for the police it is and should be highly regulated. paul manly: Madam Chair, in 2012 the RCMP spent $14 million on 18 armoured personnel carriers. Will the government rein in the RCMP budget and end wasteful spending on militarizing our civilian police forces? hon. bill blair: Madam Chair, it's a very important tradition that our Canadian police are not militarized. At the same time, we've seen a number of tragedies when police have responded to situations in which people were armed with weapons designed for soldiers to kill soldiers, and they've been used to kill police officers. The militarization of our society, so strongly promoted by some, is the direct consequence of the militarization of the police. As we remove these weapons from our society and prohibit them, we'll make it safer for everyone and we can then move away from such a model of policing. paul manly: Madam Chair, the government spent $4.5 billion to buy an old, leaky pipeline. How much is this spill going to cost Canadian taxpayers to clean up? How much contingency funding has been budgeted to repair the environmental destruction from spills? hon. navdeep bains: Madam Chair, I want to thank the honourable colleague for his question. He full well knows that the acquisition that we made with regard to the TMX initiative is a reflection of the fact that we want this initiative to move forward in a sustainable manner and in a manner that protects the environment. I'll continue to work with my colleagues to endeavour to make sure that we have the appropriate processes in place to protect the environment and at the same time create good-quality, middle-class jobs for Canadians. carol hughes): The honourable member for RosemontLa PetitePatrie, Mr.Boulerice, has the floor. alexandre boulerice (rosemontla petite-patrie, ndp): Thank you, MadamChair. In Montreal, the city and the police department have recognized this, and measures will be put in place. Although it spends $10million a day, we see no attempt to reform or change the RCMP. If the Prime Minister really wants to act, why is he delaying the action plan in response to the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls? hon. bill blair: Let me assure this House and the member opposite that we're not dragging our feet. Indigenous people, black Canadians and other racialized people are far too often experiencing systemic racism and disparate outcomes through the criminal justice system. It's incumbent upon all of us who work within the criminal justice system to take the steps and actions necessary to produce more equitable outcomes. All police services, including the RCMP, must be committed to ensuring that the people they're sworn to serve and protect are always treated with dignity and respect. alexandre boulerice: MadamChair, why are the Liberals taking indigenous children to court to challenge the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruling in their favour? hon. marc miller (minister of indigenous services): Madam Chair, as the honourable member knows full well, a number of cases are pending, and we are currently negotiating with the parties. We are making progress, and I would be delighted to tell the member and the House about it in response to a later question. alexandre boulerice: We've been asking questions about it for months, and as I see it, we should keep doing so. The Prime Minister's new pipeline, which taxpayers were forced to buy with their hard-earned money, has leaked. Some 190,000litres of oil spilled, and we can't even make the company pay for it because the Liberals bought the pipeline. Trans-Mountain, KeystoneXL and the resumption of gas exploration and development off the coast of Newfoundland and Labradorare these the projects the Liberals had in mind for their green recovery? hon. Our priority was to protect the health and safety of Canadians throughout the pandemic, especially when it comes to the environment. That's why environmental and climate change laws aimed at protecting the environment, human health and conservation will remain in force. Unions, associations, artists and creators have all taken part in public demonstrations recently to condemn the lack of a specific plan for the living arts, performing arts and festival sector. alexandre boulerice: Well, that wasn't at all what the artists and creators who were out demonstrating in the streets a few days ago thought. The CERB extension announced by the government only brings us to September, but the cultural community is expecting the worst in the fall. steven guilbeault: I'm not so sure those who were protesting last week had issues with our government, but we'd certainly be happy to speak with them. As for a long-term plan, we are currently consulting arts and culture stakeholders to contemplate together how the government can help the sector in response to the ongoing crisis. We are working on finding solutions, but until we have long-term solutions, we have seen to it that our artists and organizations have access to funding until September. carol hughes): The honourable member for BeauportLimoilou, Mrs.Vignola, has the floor. julie vignola (beauportlimoilou, bq): Madam Chair, I will be sharing my time with the member for Montcalm. According to the latest news, Seaspan Shipyards will be spending an additional $1.5billion to build two ships. anita anand (minister of public services and procurement): I'd like to thank the member for her question. Davie is certainly a strong and trusted partner that works very hard to help our government get results for Canadians. Building a new class of ships is highly complex, and it's not unusual for cost estimates to change throughout the procurement project. It's important to make sure additional funding is available for the joint support ships project to ensure the navy's vessels are delivered. In the beginning, eight years ago, the project was supposed to cost $2.6billion. Why haven't the ships been delivered yet? Why is Davie still not seen as a trusted partner? the acting chair (mrs. anita anand: Once again, I would point out that building a new class of ships is highly complex, and it's not unusual for the cost estimate to change for a procurement project as large as this one. carol hughes): It is now over to the honourable member for Montcalm, Mr.Thriault. luc thriault (montcalm, bq): Madam Chair, in Quebec, 12,000people have begun their training to work in residential and long-term care centres. The dedication of the members of the armed forces is paramount, and I want to extend my heartfelt thanks. What does the army have to do right now that is more important than helping our caregivers save lives? hon. pablo rodriguez: Madam Chair, I'm glad my fellow member recognizes the fundamental role the men and women of the Canadian Armed Forces have played and continue to play in residential and long-term care centres and many other areas in support of our seniors. luc thriault: We are short 12,000people, so if the Red Cross wants to help us, all the better. I repeat my question: What does the army have to do 10days from now that is more important if it's not to help caregivers save lives? hon. The people at the Canadian Red Cross are well-trained paid workers who can perform the same work in partnership with the members of the armed forces, who can stay in Quebec as well. Right now, we are working with the Quebec government and discussing how we can keep the measure in place until September15. What does the army have to do that is more important than helping caregivers save the lives of those who built Quebec? the acting chair (mrs. carol hughes): The Leader of the Government in the House of Commons is asked to keep his answer brief. pablo rodriguez: Madam Chair, the Government of Canada is there and will continue to be there to help the people who built Quebec. Madam Chair, on May 14 I asked the Minister of Agriculture when the Liberal government would put aside its usual campaign rhetoric and recognize the very detrimental impact the carbon tax is having on farmers across this country. Minister Bibeau proudly noted that according to their data, the average cost of the carbon tax per farm across Canada is $210 to $819. The fact is that the Liberal government's own Parliamentary Budget Officer has estimated that at $25 per tonne, the cost for an 855-acre crop farm in Alberta is well over $6,000. When will this Liberal government come clean with Canadians and recognize the disastrous impact the carbon tax is having on Canada's critical agriculture and agri-food sector? hon. marie-claude bibeau (minister of agriculture and agri-food): Madam Chair, our pollution pricing policy is designed to grow a clean economy. Farm fuels and fuels from cardlock facilities are exempt, and there is a partial rebate for propane and natural gas used in commercial greenhouses. We will do a review of our pollution pricing system in 2020, focused on competitiveness issues in trade-exposed industries such as agriculture. It is also important to remember that this is about tackling climate change and that 100% of the revenues stay in the province. earl dreeshen: Madam Chair, Minister Bibeau keeps talking about wanting to protect Canadians' environment. Well, the truth is that Canada's farmers, ranchers and processors have for years demonstrated their ability to deliver meaningful reductions in emissions and to safeguard the environment through the adoption of new technologies, education and innovative management practices, but the government ignores these efforts. Will the minister at the very least admit to Canadians that Canadian farmers are unable to pass on the cost of the carbon tax to consumers and instead have to absorb those extra costs out of their own pockets? hon. marie-claude bibeau: Madam Chair, allow me to explain again our government's position on pollution pricing. Madam Chair, Minister Bibeau has repeatedly asked stakeholders to send her data about the impacts of the carbon tax on farmers, so this is exactly what they have been doing. The Atlantic Grains Council, the Grain Farmers of Ontario, Producteurs de grains du Qubec and the Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association issued a joint statement at the beginning of this year in which they estimated that the cumulative indirect inflation of carbon tax on farm costs will be $14.50 an acre this year, with that cost escalating by more than double by 2022 to almost $30 an acre. Why does the Liberal government continue to ignore the facts presented to it and continue to misrepresent the truth to Canadians? hon. marie-claude bibeau: Madame Chair, I can assure you that we have paid close attention to all the information that has been provided to us and that our calculation was also based on this information provided by provinces and different stakeholders. Marie-Claude Bibeau:as well as the 2019 agricultural tax data to estimate the average cost of pollution pricing associated with grain drying at up to 0.4% of overall operating costs. Dreeshen, I am watching the time, and the minister is allowed to answer for the same amount of time that you used to ask the question"

        "Query": "What were Dr. Frank Atherton's thoughts on having a target, investment, data, addressing gaps in data, and legislation to build a healthy environment?",
        "Summary": "Dr Frank Atherton emphasizes the importance of having a target that is both achievable and challenging. He believes that a target is not only a tool, but also an evaluation to assess progress. However, there is still much work to be done. In terms of investment, Dr Frank Atherton mentions that they currently invest in various areas related to child health, including obesity. The estimated investment needed for their plan is around \u00a38 million to \u00a310 million per year. Additionally, Dr Frank Atherton suggests considering diverting some of the \u00a37 billion spent on health and social care towards prevention initiatives and tackling obesity. The latest data presented by Dr Frank Atherton shows that less than a third of children aged four or five are overweight or obese, but the situation is not improving. The data also reveals that about 12% of children are severely obese. Dr Frank Atherton highlights the importance of having a longitudinal view of children's health over time, which would require significant resources. He also supports the implementation of legislation to create a healthy environment, citing examples of food takeaways. Overall, Dr Frank Atherton's goal is to address the challenges of child health and obesity through targeted strategies and investments.",
        "Article": "We've received apologies for absence from Michelle Brown and Jack Sargeant; there are no substitutions. We'll move on, then, to item 2, which is our scrutiny of the 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' draft strategy, and I'm very pleased to welcome Dr Frank Atherton, the Chief Medical Officer for Wales, and Nathan Cook, who is the head of the healthy and active branch at Welsh Government. If I can just start by asking about the fact that 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' is an all-age strategy, really, and how confident you are that it will deliver for children and young people. We have high prevalence of overweight and obesity among adults\u2014we know that, and we can't walk away from that because that's translating into demand on health services. But we have to take a focus, a future generation's focus, almost, on the next generation. I don't write off the current generation, we can't afford to do that, but we do need to think about what can we do that would be different for the next generation so that they don't get into the sorts of problems that we're currently seeing with overweight and obesity. We know that the consequences of that for our young people are going to be enormous if we don't do something and something quite soon. We know that overweight children go on to become overweight adults, unfortunately, and that brings all the consequences of multiple disease issues\u2014diabetes is often cited\u2014cancer risk et cetera. So, we have to focus on children, and, in fact, during the consultation, we've been very clear that we need to engage with children and young people as well. Perhaps we'll get into that at some point, Chair, but, yes, I can give you that assurance. What my follow-up question, really, is: can you just tell us what kind of engagement you've had with children and young people to inform the draft strategy? dr frank atherton: Well, Nathan may be able to influence some of the detail, but in broad terms, we have discussed with young people in a number of fora. In fact, I was delighted that we had a young person, Evie Morgan, a schoolgirl from mid Wales, who came to the joint launch on the consultation. She met the Minister there and gave a very good personal account of her views on obesity and overweight. I'm visiting a school, either this week or next week, at Treorchy, to talk with teachers and young people there. nathan cook: I was going to say, we've also had a session with youth ambassadors as well, and what we've actually produced for the consultation is not just the children and young people's version, but also a toolkit in terms of getting schools really engaged and involved in terms of the work that we want them to do to feed into this as well. So, we've already had some really good responses from a lot of youth group and schools already. lynne neagle am: And you've got a structured programme, have you, to roll that out? Okay. We've got some questions now on leadership, and the first questions are from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian. The Minister for health said yesterday, in answering a question from me on the Chamber floor, that you gave him advice not to have a target in terms of reducing obesity among children. Could you confirm that that's what your advice was and tell us why you don't think that a target is needed? dr frank atherton: My advice was not that we don't need a target\u2014we may well need a target, and that's one of the issues we need to consult on\u2014but that the target that had been adopted in England and in Scotland to halve the prevalence of obesity in children was more aspirational than deliverable, and that if we are to choose a target in Wales, then we need to balance deliverability with challenge. So, there is something about performance management, because I would be looking to not just the health system but the health and care system and to public services boards to think about how they're delivering on this, and I think we can use targets to that. But they are one tool in the box that I would think we could use, and part of the consultation is to ask that question\u2014'If we are to go down a route in Wales of choosing a target, what might that look like?' sian gwenllian am: Okay. dr frank atherton: It's certainly something that we could consider in terms of the final strategy. Well, that is contrary to what I was told yesterday on the floor of the Chamber by the Minister, but there we go. I'm glad to hear that you're not ruling out having a target, because without a target, without something to aim for, how do we know that we're getting there? dr frank atherton: I think your point about evaluation is really important. Whatever we produce at the end of this process\u2014and we're looking to produce a final strategy towards the autumn\u2014we do need to have a strong evaluation. So, some metrics in there, it would seem, would be appropriate, but what those are, what the nature of those are, do we frame them as targets or ambitions\u2014that's the point we need to consult on. If the Government is going to be successful in terms of the aim of reducing childhood obesity, then it needs to fund and support the actions. Have you made an assessment of the level of investment needed to implement this plan? dr frank atherton: Resourcing will be important. We currently do make investments in a number of areas that relate to child health generally, and, of course, obesity and overweight in particular. Now, we can't quantify an absolute amount of resource that will be needed to deliver until we know exactly what's going to come out of the consultation and what actions we might want to deliver to a greater degree in Wales. A figure of \u00a38 million to \u00a310 million a year has been banded around as a broad kind of area of what we might need to invest, but that would need to be drawn from existing programmes. Can we make them more effective? Can we get better value from them? And there may well be a case for new investment, and that's a question, of course, that would need to be discussed with Ministers when we're producing the final strategy. nathan cook: But I think a key consideration as well is we already know there is investment across health boards in some kind of obesity-related services. So, I think what we really need to think about across Wales is how we can drive greater scale, how we can look at current programmes in terms of making sure that they're better evaluated, and how we can make sure that we're also drawing up on the existing resources and capacity out there as well. sian gwenllian am: And does the level of investment depend on what the target is\u2014what the goal is? dr frank atherton: I don't think you can necessarily just link the two. The issue of resourcing is one that's there irrespective of whether we choose to put a target in place. sian gwenllian am: But how would we know that it's being used effectively if there isn't something to aim for? dr frank atherton: Which brings you back to the question about evaluation. sian gwenllian am: Yes, but without a target, how can you properly evaluate? If you don't know what you're trying to do, how can you properly evaluate? Anyway, you're open to suggestions about having a target, which is great. Would you agree that Government could use the revenue that's being produced through the levy on soft drinks towards some of these efforts to\u2014? dr frank atherton: Well, of course, there are some consequentials that are coming to the Welsh Government as part of the levy on sugary soft drinks. That funding, of course, is less than we had anticipated, and that reflects, actually, a success story because industry is reformulating, and so the amount of sugar in soft drinks is already starting to decrease, which is a good thing. I'm not personally in favour of hypothecation, I think I'm more interested in the totality of resource that goes into public health programmes than into marginal resource. And when I think about obesity, I don't just think about the relatively small marginal amounts of money that come in through whatever source, but I think about the totality of the \u00a37 billion we spend in health and social care and how we can divert and channel some of that towards broad prevention initiatives in general, and towards tackling being overweight and obesity in particular. Could you give us any kind of figure? dr frank atherton: I'm sorry, could you repeat the question? sian gwenllian am: You say that there is less money that's come in through these consequentials from the levy, can you mention some sort of figure? dr frank atherton: The figure that I have in mind is about \u00a356 million that's coming in in terms of revenue over a two-year period. When the sugar levy was first brought in, there was some modelling at UK level about what level of revenue that would bring, but it was based on the amount of sugar that was currently then in drinks and the fact that the sugar has reduced in drinks, the total amount available to the UK is less and hence our consequentials are less. nathan cook: Yes, I was going to say, there was a mid-year report done where the levy has raised \u00a3150 million to date since coming into force in April, and the original forecast was \u00a3520 million a year. So, I think that shows the amount of work that's been done by industry around reformulation. sian gwenllian am: And the consequentials of that? That is the consequential\u2014\u00a3150 million. sian gwenllian am: Yes, so what's the Welsh consequential? lynne neagle am: Fifty-six. Anyway, it's a good sum of money and you're talking about investing \u00a38 million to \u00a310 million. So, obviously, you know, we can be more ambitious because there is money in that pot if that money was ring-fenced for this particular scheme. dr frank atherton: Well, the resource is going to be a real issue that we need to address, and I think as Nathan has said, there is funding of various initiatives currently in the system, and we need to look at that and make that as effective as possible. Will there be a need for some additional resource? There may well be, and that's a question that we'll have to look at in terms of the strategy when we develop it and have a discussion with Ministers about the level of resourcing. lynne neagle am: Can I just ask on that before Si\u00e2n moves on? What assessment have you made of how that money is being spent in other UK nations? Because my understanding is that the money is being used in other UK nations to directly impact on obesity. Have you given any consideration to\u2014? As I understand it, that money now is being dispersed around a plethora of programmes, including the transformation programme, and what I found very odd, really, was vaccination, which is surely the core business of the NHS. Have you got any view on that? dr frank atherton: I'm not sure I understand your point, Chair, in terms of the link between the consequentials from\u2014. Are you talking about the consequentials from the sugar levy or are you talking about\u2014? lynne neagle am: Yes, because in other nations, it is being used to directly impact on initiatives to tackle obesity, whereas, we've kind of put it here in Wales into the general pot and it's being used to fund a plethora of different things. My preference\u2014it's a personal view\u2014is that hypothecation doesn't really help us too much. , what we need to look at is whether the programmes, the sorts of programmes that are being funded in England, or indeed in Scotland, are working effectively, and if they are, are they being delivered here in Wales? We have looked very carefully at the plans that England and Scotland have for tackling obesity and overweight, and we've made a comparison with what we're doing in Wales, and our ambition in Wales is to go further than those nations, in many ways. But I come back to the point that just linking the hypothecation of a relatively small amount of resource is likely to be less impactful than asking a question of public services boards and of the health system, indeed, about how much money, overall, are we putting into prevention. lynne neagle am: No, I recognise that, and I think we're talking about additional resource. suzy davies am: I was just wondering whether you thought that there was a useful psychological link on the part of the public between saying, 'Here's a sugar levy', and 'It's going to be used to help children and adults stay healthier.' Going into a pot, it actually makes it quite difficult to explain the purpose of the tax in the first place. So, I take your overall point, but in terms of the people who we're trying to help in all this, actually creating a direct link might be quite helpful. You're putting an emphasis on the whole-system approach in implementing the plan, how are you going to create a system that co-ordinates action and drives change across relevant partners, avoiding a situation where it's everyone's role, but nobody's responsibility? How are you going to avoid that? dr frank atherton: It's a very important question, and one of the four strands in the consultation is exactly related to that, around leadership and drive nationally. You may notice, by the way, that we've chosen not to talk about an obesity strategy but a healthy weight strategy, because I think having a positive construct is really quite important to us here in Wales. But leadership will be really important, and we will need some sort of structure to lead this, to provide oversight. I'm not a great believer in creating new structures, so we do need something that will give that drive, but the leadership comes from the top down. And then we need to make sure that the public sector generally is engaged in this, but it goes way beyond the public sector, of course, because we have to work with industry, and we have to work with communities, and we have to work with the public on this. Interestingly, we had quite a large discussion two days ago between health and social care, but also involving the third sector and some members of the public, around how can we drive prevention more generally. It wasn't specifically on obesity, but of course obesity came up because it's such a pressing issue. This question of governance was discussed quite extensively, and we do have governance systems, of course, in Wales. We have public services boards, we have regional partnership boards, and how we can get those aligned behind this common agenda is really important. But I'd like to see\u2014and I know I'm a public health professional, so I know that only maybe 10 per cent, 15 per cent, possibly 20 per cent of what makes and keeps us healthy as individuals and as communities can be driven through the health system; but I would like the system to step up and take these kinds of issues more seriously as well. So I'd be looking for local leadership through directors of public health and indeed through chief executives to work with their public services boards on this. So, we'll need some sort of national oversight, absolutely, but we need local ownership and local leadership, too. Which Minister do you believe it should be accountable to, or, given the complexity of obesity, should the board be directly accountable to the First Minister? dr frank atherton: Ultimately, the First Minister will be responsible for this and will want to have a strong oversight of this. It is often framed as a health issue, and the Minister, Vaughan Gething, has a strong personal commitment to this, I know. We've talked extensively with him and with sports and recreation colleagues about that, so there's a link there. It does cut across all portfolios, and so this is an issue that I have discussed with Cabinet, and that collective ownership is really important, and will be, because it can't just sit in one domain. I think what you do need to have is you do need to have a lead organisation or a lead ministry, and I would see health as\u2014I work within health, so I'm perhaps biased, but I would see health as leading this, but it needs broad ownership across Government. janet finch-saunders am: I know my colleague Si\u00e2n Gwenllian mentioned earlier targets and things, but I know in Wales we're not too good at collecting data. What data is currently available on childhood obesity and what metrics will be used to measure progress against the plan's objectives? dr frank atherton: Well, of course, our main data source is the child measurement programme, which collects information on children entering school aged four or five. Well, I'm sure you're familiar with the statistics, but it'll be just under a third of children at that age who are overweight or obese\u2014 janet finch-saunders am: Could I just ask\u2014sorry to interrupt\u2014how up to date is that? dr frank atherton: The last survey was just last year. dr frank atherton: So, it's pretty up to date, and what it shows\u2014. It's not getting radically worse\u2014there's always statistical variation in these things\u2014but it's not getting any better. And, for the first time last year, we did look at the question not just of children who were overweight or obese, but we actually singled out the proportion who are obese, severely obese. So we have a figure for that for the first time, which is about 12 per cent, which is quite shocking, in a way. Does that answer your question? janet finch-saunders am: Yes, but how will any gaps in your data be addressed? dr frank atherton: Well, one of the questions that are often asked is: could we measure more on a longitudinal basis? By that  in England, for example, children are measured at school entry and then again at year 11\u2014at age 11 or 12., that kind of age group. I think that would be helpful to us in Wales, and it's one of the questions in the consultation about whether we should expand that. Obviously, that would have significant resource implications, not just for the funding, but also for schools and for the system to deliver it. But it's something that maybe would help us in terms of better understanding and better evaluation\u2014the point that was made earlier. nathan cook: And the other data we do have is the millennium cohort study, which has been released, for 14 and 15-year-olds. We're starting to think about how we can utilise some of that data, looking at that longitudinal picture around children as well, which will be really helpful. lynne neagle am: Can I just ask about the child measurement programme? The strategy commits to looking at whether we can have a second measurement taking place in Wales. Can you just tell us a bit more about your thinking on that and when you would see a second measurement taking place and how you would use that data? dr frank atherton: I touched on that just now, but personally I do think it would be helpful to have more information. It's always the case, There's always a trade-off between the cost of getting that information and the value of the information. We know an awful lot about obesity and being overweight and the causes of it, but we don't really have a very clear understanding, in Wales at least, of the point at which children start to become overweight. Although we know that overweight children tend to go on to become overweight adults, we don't know what proportion of them between school entry and later teenage years\u2014what those changes are. So, it would help us to have some better understanding, which would help to direct some of our initiatives. We'll wait and see what comes out in the consultation, and it's something that we need to give thought to,\u00a0 but we do have to trade off the additionality of what the information would give us with the cost of doing that, of course. In the draft plan, some of the measures in there suggest legislating for restricting price promotions and banning energy drinks, and that sort of thing. Do you think that, if we go down that road, there's going to be time within this Assembly to introduce such legislation? And, if not, what do you think might be the timescale for such legislation? dr frank atherton: It may well be that there are things in Wales that we might wish to legislate on, and you've mentioned two of them, and they're good examples. We would, obviously, need to undertake quite detailed consultation on those and, in a way, we need to mirror what's happening in England and in Scotland\u00a0to some degree around the consultations they're having on energy drinks. We also need to influence the issues that are not devolved to us and we seek to do that. The timing of that will have to be subject to other pressures, and I come back to the point that legislation, of course, is one of the tools that we've got\u2014we need to deploy them all. We've heard from the Government, on other calls for legislation, that the programme's very tight, certainly for this term, so I was just wondering whether we might get that in, but okay. If I turn now to the planning system\u2014and this might not be something that you have great deal of knowledge of; I'd just welcome your view on this, because, when we discussed with stakeholders, we talked about whether the planning system, for instance, could be used to, as an example, restrict hot food takeaways around schools and so on. Would that be a measure that you would support, something like that? dr frank atherton: I think it's definitely something we want to look at and, of course, that question is asked in the consultation, so we would like to know people's views on that. I think there is a question\u2014a really important question\u2014about how we can use the planning system more effectively. I've discussed with Nathan on a number of occasions, with planning colleagues in Welsh Government and in local authorities, about the art of the possible, let's say. I was very interested to see, up in the north-east, some time ago, that one of the local authorities up there did put a moratorium on the opening of new fast-food venues near to schools, or indeed in areas where levels of obesity and overweight were particularly high. So, that gave me comfort, because maybe there are powers within local authorities that can be used more effectively.\u00a0I think my view at the moment is that the jury's kind of out on whether those are effective and how effective they're going to be. But the fact that we have some initiatives around the UK does give us an opportunity to study that and to learn from experience perhaps and then, if it is shown to be beneficial, to think about that here in Wales, yes. Of itself, it wouldn't address the problem, but, added to other initiatives, I guess it would. Can I just ask you briefly, then, about community sport infrastructure and, in particular, of new schools? So, Welsh Government, as you know, has ploughed a huge amount of money into the twenty-first century schools programme. What we heard when we spoke to stakeholders recently, particularly headteachers, was that, in some of the new schools that have been built, we haven't had changing rooms and toilet facilities, for instance, built into the new buildings. So, if we're going to try and utilise these buildings for general community activity to get kids and the wider public, actually, more active, do you think that's something that we ought to be building in? Again, not your particular direct area of responsibility, but something that you might have an input into, is that, when we're developing schools, we should be making sure that they have those kinds of facilities so that they become accessible to the wider public. Is that something that you would be prepared to make a recommendation around? dr frank atherton: Well, it's certainly a fascinating area and one that I think has a lot of potential. You're right to raise it in the context of schools, and I can understand why this committee would, but I think it goes beyond that, actually, into all developments in the public sector and how they're developed and whether we're building health into our environment, which perhaps is your starting point. One of the things that I was really pleased to see in terms of the Public Health (Wales) Act 2017 that was passed a couple of years ago was the use of health impact assessment as a tool, and we're still working on how that will inform policy and how that will be applied in issues such as policy decisions through Government, but also in more downstream issues about how we create the public infrastructure that the public can and should be using. And so I would like to see the use of health impact assessments to a much greater degree to inform those kinds of decisions. If you apply that kind of lens and you take the point, which is inherent in your question, I think, that schools are not just for kids, they're for communities, then you would\u2014it would lead you to a conclusion that you would perhaps design and build them in a different way. So, on a personal basis, I would certainly support your view that we should be looking to use the sports environment in schools in the same way as we use leisure centres. There are all kinds of barriers in there, and I understand all of that, and it's not really my field, exactly as you say, but, as a matter of principle, I think it's a good one to pursue. Yes, perhaps if we could just stay in this area of education just for a moment, I think we all agree that healthy habits acquired early on probably tend to last quite well, so I wonder if you can tell us a little bit about the healthy and sustainable preschool scheme and whether you think some timescales should be made public about what you expect the achievements from that scheme to be. But, in particular, I was struck with what you said about local leadership, and I just want you to bear that in mind in answering the next question, which is about the foundation phase. You're probably aware that this committee has heard from various school leaders that they're struggling in some cases to meet the ratio of staffing for the foundation phase, which potentially compromises the purpose of it in terms of physical activity.\u00a0I'm just wondering how the strategy development board is considering that at the moment. Is it something that's come on the radar for the board? Is it something you're thinking about? And, if so, who do you think should be responsible for pinning that down a little bit? Because this is education, not health, and\u2014. dr frank atherton: Well, look, I've got to confess to you, I'm not an educationist, and so the question on staffing numbers in schools is not one that I have been asked to give a deal of consideration to, and it hasn't really been discussed, I don't believe, in the context of development of the strategy. If there is a specific point around that that the committee would like to make in terms of a response into the consultation, which I presume you'll be making, then we'd be happy to consider that. We have standards and we perhaps need to think about how we tighten those standards and how we\u2014enforce isn't the right word, but how we implement and make sure that those standards are properly implemented, because you're absolutely right to say that habits are developed early in life. That's in the preschool; it's also in the home of course, and then later in the school. So, we do need to look at all of those as settings and are there more things we can do within those settings to drive healthier behaviours\u2014that's exactly why we need the consultation. nathan cook: But I would say, through that scheme as well, we've really got a really good bank of preschools that are actually doing some really great work in this area as well. So, I think the more we can understand the successes that some of those environments are having\u2014you know, how we can roll those out and work across other settings to create that wider impact as well is going to be really important. What I'm thinking about is expectations at that level will be expectations at a slightly older level, which will be contained within the foundation phase. And while you're quite right\u2014obviously, parents have a role in this, or families\u2014there will be, particularly with the introduction of the new curriculum, certain expectations on schools to provide not just healthy environments but to actively work towards well-being and healthy weight in children and things. And that's why I asked you about local leadership, because, if it fails for reasons that have nothing to do with the plan at foundation phase, it's going to fail further up the school years as well. I think it might be something that the board might want to consider here, because at some point there'll be an accountability question and we will want to know how 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' fits in with the new plans for the new curriculum, and whether it's merely persuasive and influential or whether it has the weight to place some obligations on school leaders about what they do in their schools. So, this connection, I think, is quite an important one, and, if the strategy development board could consider that, I think it would be very helpful, because this doesn't exist in a vacuum. dr frank atherton: Well, I'd certainly be delighted to\u00a0take that back and we can look at it in terms of how we move from the consultation into the final strategy. suzy davies am: Because we will want to know who to ask: 'you're the accountable person\u2014why has something worked, or not worked?' We will need to know that at some point. dr frank atherton: Just building on Nathan's point, some of the schools\u2014I know it's schools rather than the preschools, and I take your point, but some of the schools we've been working with have absolutely brilliant models of good practice and good local leadership. I remember the Minister actually at the launch, and one of the schools was represented there, and they presented\u2014the school came and some of the children came and presented\u2014to the whole audience about the activities that they were undertaking in their school around physical activity and on healthy eating, and it was such a model of good behaviour the question was, 'Well, why not everywhere?', so that probably speaks to your question. lynne neagle am: And have you had any discussions, then, with education officials around things like teacher training and CPD, because you'll be aware the Health and Social Care Committee has made a number of recommendations in this area? It's crucial that we skill up the staff to develop these things in an appropriate way, isn't it? dr frank atherton: Well, we certainly discuss with education colleagues in Welsh Government. There's more we need to do in terms of that, because you're absolutely right: there's something about building the whole of the workforce\u2014education is really important, but elsewhere as well; it's about how do we really make every contact count, you know, that construct. So, everybody who's working in the health and social care system should have a role in this; everybody who works in education, whether it's the old\u2014. Do we still have dinner ladies? Or teachers, you know, they have a role to play in supporting children to be as healthy as they possibly can. And, actually, I see them, Chair, as a really essential part of the public health workforce. Suzy, are you going to do your curriculum one? suzy davies am: Well, I've bound it in together, but that final point you make about teachers being part of the answer to this, they're already under a range of pressures: is it fair to make them accountable for whether this works or not? Or should that local leadership lie somewhere else? I don't expect you to pin down a person today. dr frank atherton: I wouldn't like to blame a teacher or performance manage them on the proportion of their children in their class who are overweight. That would clearly be nonsense, wouldn't it? But they are part of the solution, and so the accountability lies further up the chain, doesn't it? The question I think we would have, and public services boards might well ask, and the local education authorities may well ask, is: how effective is any particular school at driving forwards these healthy behaviours? suzy davies am: Okay, thank you. hefin david am: Is that all right, Chair? lynne neagle am: You've got the floor, Hefin. What would that look like? dr frank atherton: Just in terms of the physical activity, I have to say it's a really important dimension and we need to move further on. We know not enough of our children are physically active and they're not meeting the various guidelines, so it's really important. It does have an impact on healthy weight, but it has a huge impact in terms of socialisation, in terms of mental health issues, et cetera, you know. nathan cook: I'd just say that one thing we have got in train is, obviously, Sport Wales, Public Health Wales and Natural Resources Wales\u2014we have them working together as a collaborative at the moment to look at how their joint delivery on physical activity can be taken forward more efficiently. So, one of the things they are looking at is obviously the schools programmes they do through eco-schools, the Welsh network of healthy schools and the sports programme to really think about that physical activity and how we can have better join up in terms of the programmes that we're already delivering as well. hefin david am: With that in mind, I'm going to confess to you, chief medical officer, I did anything in school I could to avoid physical education lessons. Yet, two weeks ago, I played for the Assembly rugby team\u2014I wanted to get that in. How can we get children more engaged with physical education in ways that\u2014? I felt completely alienated in school. dr frank atherton: Well, you're right, and many people go through that same journey and come to physical activity later in life, and that's great if they do that. The sad reality is that many people don't, and we also know that there are issues around the dropping off, particularly for girls, of physical activity towards the teenage years. , at the heart of it, it's about making sports and physical activity enjoyable and attractive to people. Sometimes that's easier, I sense, for boys than for girls, but we need to tailor things to different audiences. hefin david am: Yes, that's the trick, isn't it? It's about finding out what children enjoy doing. It's not just about elite sports; it's about getting everybody engaged and active in sports, and that partnership with Public Health Wales that Nathan talked about is really important, because we need a population approach to driving physical activity. hefin david am: So, do you think, with that in mind, we need statutory guidance for schools on physical education? dr frank atherton: Again, I'd look to the consultation as to whether there was an appetite for any kind of guidance. And finally, with regard to free school meals to all pupils in primary and secondary schools, do you think that extending that to all pupils would be beneficial in providing a more varied diet for pupils? dr frank atherton: I don't have a personal view on that. I think it's the quality of the food that kids are getting, whether that comes from home or through school, and whether it's free or whether it's paid for. The question of children being hungry at school is a really important one and needs to be addressed at a national level. I think that's a\u2014 hefin david am: So, you think that's more about the provision of food for those who might not have access to it than providing a varied diet. dr frank atherton: I think it's important that children have access to food, absolutely, if that's your question, but we also need to look at the quality of the food and what's in that food offer. I've been around some amazing schools in my own constituency, where they've got proper canteen facilities for pupils and really, really good produce in the meals. And, to be honest, I've been very surprised and shocked at what I've seen of the quality of the food in the packed lunches. Nobody can really police, and I wouldn't want to see parents being policed over what goes in a packed lunch, so if there is data out there to suggest that there's a larger percentage of parents providing packed lunched that are really not good at all, then there is some merit to be said for what Hefin is\u2014. Would you be willing to carry out any research? dr frank atherton: So, your point about food that's brought in in the packed lunches is a really important one, and I've talked to some headteachers as well about this. We could go down a route of guidance and prohibition, but that gets you into the role of nanny in chief and I don't really see that as my role or Government's role, and I don't think it's effective either. Do you remember\u2014? You must have seen on tv\u2014I think it was in Scotland; I don't know if it's happened in Wales\u2014parents pushing the fish and chip packets through the school railings. What I have seen, though, is some really good innovative practice in schools where, for example, they reward children for bringing the healthy options. Schools can give guidance to parents about what would be a healthy lunch and what sort of things might be expected to be seen in the lunch box. So, I've seen some of those approaches that have transformed, actually, the offer of what comes in school boxes. So, my point to the question was: isn't there some merit, perhaps, about all children being equal and eating similar good-quality food in schools? dr frank atherton: Yes. The draft plan commits, doesn't it, to updating the healthy eating in schools regulations\u2014the 2013 regulations? I appreciate this is a consultation, but what is it that needs changing in those regulations at the moment, just to give us a bit of steer? nathan cook: It's mainly on sugar content, so, obviously, they don't adhere to current Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition guidelines around sugar levels. So, what we'd want to consider is, you know, what we need to be careful of is unintended consequences of changing that, as well, if you see a shift to more kids bringing in school packed lunches as well. So, I think we want to consider the best way of doing that and consider through the consultation how we can go about it. janet finch-saunders am: The 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' plan commits to a review of the clinical obesity pathway. What are the time frames for this review, and what do you think are the basic essentials of a clinical obesity pathway for children and young people? dr frank atherton: We do have a pathway for managing overweight, and that's been in place since about 2010, I believe, and we do need to bring that up to date in terms of current knowledge and experiences. We've challenged Public Health Wales; we've asked Public Health Wales to undertake a review of that pathway, and they are going through that process now. nathan cook: We were asking them to review the pathway before we launch the final strategy in October because, obviously, what we want is for that to inform what that final strategy looks like. dr frank atherton: The second point of your question about what are the essential elements, they are already there; we need to tweak them and we need to make sure that they're properly delivered. But it's a tiered approach, so, having access to information through schools and through communities and into families is part of the first step of that. And then, if children are overweight, it's a question about how they're identified. There are questions about the ability of the public to recognise large children, so there may be an issue there. But when children are running into issues around weight, what kind of interventions can be put in, either through primary care or through communities through health visitors, et cetera? And then of course we do have\u2014and we've started to shine a light on this, haven't we\u2014the very overweight children. I don't think we have enough in the way of targeted support to be able to support those. So, I think there's something about looking at our whole pathway, mapping out what the current evidence now shows us is needed, and then thinking about what is our provision in Wales and what do we need to do to bring that up to the level of the places that are the best. The draft plan recognises the importance of the first 1,000 days, but it doesn't appear to include any new proposals to help parents to enable lifestyle changes. Are you satisfied that the draft plan does enough to address the influence that family and parents have on children's healthy weight behaviours, particularly in the first 1,000 days? dr frank atherton: Well, the first 1,000 days are really critically in shaping lives, as I'm sure you'd agree. We are absolutely open to any other suggestions that the public or this committee have as to what more we can and should do. There are a number of things, the sorts of programmes you've mentioned, that I think could be more effective. We know that children who are breastfed are less likely to suffer from obesity in childhood and, indeed, to go on to be obese adults. If there are other interventions in other areas that we need to take, then we'd be delighted to hear what they are, but those are the ones that have jumped out so far. nathan cook: Can I just say\u2014? One of the proposals we're looking for is, obviously, we know that during pregnancy it's a really critical time when we can actually look to work with mothers. We know from looking at some of the behaviour change that it's actually a really critical point when new mothers really start thinking about their lives, wanting the best for their child and their families. So, what we are thinking about is how we could develop some kind of approaches to that going forward. But we know our Healthy Start scheme is also a good lever for us, just in terms of how we can look to improve that kind of dietary offer at the earliest stage as well. Finally, we know that for some families day-to-day challenges can make it difficult for them to make healthy choices, particularly for those on lower incomes and/or maybe using food banks. Could the Welsh Government take bolder action to better support low-income families to eat healthily? dr frank atherton: Well, you've touched on a really important point about inequalities because overweight and obesity is not evenly distributed across our population. It absolutely is more prevalent in more socioeconomically deprived communities, and that's something that should really concern us all. So, it gets you to questions of availability of fresh food and produce; it gets you to questions of formulation of products and whether value brands are less healthy than more premium brands. So, it cuts across all of those issues that we talked about in terms of settings and in terms of environment earlier. We do need to think in broad terms\u2014broader terms than just obesity, but we do need to think in broad terms\u2014about how we create a society where families have the wherewithal to lead healthy lives, and that gets you to really important questions about the minimum wage and income poverty. There's no doubt in my mind\u2014I'm a public health professional\u2014and there's no doubt in my mind that economic success and health success go hand in hand. In terms of what we can do through this particular consultation, there are some things in there about providing better access, but without tackling some of those deeper determinants of health, their impact will necessarily be limited. lynne neagle am: Just finally from me, then, you referred earlier to the importance of making every contact count, but some stakeholders have told the committee that they struggle to do that because of difficulties in availability of people to refer to. Is that a situation that you recognise and what, really, can we do to improve that situation? dr frank atherton: Well, it depends what you mean as to where to refer to. What we're seeing across the NHS is a gradual transformation in primary care so that primary care is no longer about going to see your GP, it's about going to see a practice where you have a range of health professionals. Would I like to see more dietetic support, for example, in that setting? Absolutely I would. I think we need to think in terms of that pathway that we were talking about earlier, about access to that kind of advice and support, which can head off people getting into problems and kids getting into problems with weight issues. So, that question of redesign of the pathway really speaks to, I think, your point about, 'Well, where do people go when they have problems with their weight?' That's true for adults and it's true for children as well. Well, can I thank you both very much for your attendance? It's been a really productive session. Thank you, Chair, and thank you to the committee, because getting some input into the consultation from children's perspectives, this would be one of the routes we would absolutely welcome.

        "Summary": "The two groups, the young and trendy and the old and rich, had different preferences for their clothing and products. The young and trendy group preferred a fruit and vegetable theme with a spongy material, while the old and rich group preferred dark colors, simple shapes, and familiar materials like wood. Interestingly, the marketing team found that the trend of incorporating fruit and vegetable themes was widespread across various areas, from clothing to furniture. People seemed to prefer natural and round designs over futuristic ones with sharp angles and titanium.",

Though do you do you wanna do you wanna sh do you wanna hold it user interface: I can hold it like project manager: Make sure the camera's user interface: Yeah , industrial designer: and I'll I'll show you the presentation . user interface: so industrial designer: Can I just nick your project manager: Yes , yes you can . user interface: Oh , where are the hinges ? project manager: industrial designer: Okay , so project manager: Right . industrial designer: And we'll first look at the exterior of what we've  come up with over there . You able to look ? industrial designer: It's gonna have a a plastic body  with a sort of standard colour , either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something . industrial designer:  which there'd be sort of a wide choice they would be attached , but we can we can come up with that . industrial designer:  the  wide choice of colours and sort of patterns , so you've got you've got a lot of customisation with it . industrial designer: and  the  the top L_C_D_ screen that you can see that would b would be sort of  how do you say , it's yeah yeah , it would be sort of inset into the into the top user interface: The black and white touch screen wherein people can project manager:  . user interface: industrial designer: And working on the inside we've  already said d decided on the kinetic batteries , which actually , thinking about it now , could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well , so that you could probably get a bit of project manager: So put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections , industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer:  we decided that  the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of , so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap . So you'd have something like where you'd shout out , where where is the remote and it'll shout back , I'm here , or something . industrial designer:  yeah , if it was going like I d well tha that could be something for next time , maybe .  the standard , there's be a standard transmission with the T_V_ using using all the standard chips that we've talked about . industrial designer:  it would it would have obviously 'cause it's split over two two different layers , it would need two separate P_C_B_s , so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling . And  because , obviously , all T_V_s use this , the same infrared medium , we'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data . And the infrared  sender would be on the on one of the bot the bottom layer , just at the front of the we haven't I don't think we actually put it on . It's still pointing , industrial designer: So when you've actually got it open , it would be facing the T_V_ . The top screen , as we said , is would be an inset  black and white L_C_D_ s touch screen user interface: This one right here . industrial designer: which yeah would  have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it ,  whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons , like the vo volume up and down , channel up and down , power on and off , and  things to that effect . industrial designer: And now we've we also decided on the inside , we could possibly either have  some some kind of sort of bezzled  logo on it , or something inset , or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top . user interface: Which is project manager: But not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product industrial designer: No d not not actually . No , not  interfering with l the whole look of the the product when it's  on the thing . industrial designer: And finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics , project manager: Thank you very much . marketing: This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research . Now , the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company . So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting , are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ? Now the findings that we came up with , just a recap , are here . The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and those the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours . marketing: The design should minimise R_S_I_ and be easy to locate and we were still   slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , but there was also , on the sideline , the though of maybe having a beeper function . Okay , so we can come back to that slide , if you don't have a note of those . I'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this , to what we have so far . We look at each of those criteria that I've just mentioned , I'll call that slide back up , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Does that seem clear ? Any questions there ? user interface: Ah , it's perfect . industrial designer: marketing: we're going to look at these crite So user interface: Is it everybody is going to evaluate , or just the Market marketing: Yes , user interface: okay . industrial designer: marketing: we're going to come to w we'll discuss each one project manager: It will just be criteria one , two , three , four , five , six , or A_ , B_ , C_ , D_ , E_ , F_ to confuse it with the number rating . Actually , it might be an idea , if we each did give our own individual rating , and we could take an average at the end . So I'll just separate the ratings by obliques , and if we go one , two , three , four , we know who's who . industrial designer: Yeah , I'd  yeah I'd probably put it  two yeah , marketing: I'll just go this way . marketing: Adding those up , we've got a six and a five , eleven divided by four is what ?  two and three quarters , it that right . marketing: oh , for you ? You want your rating to be a two ? Is that what you're saying ? user interface:  in Yep , I just got marketing: Okay . user interface: marketing: So , I'll work out the average for that again at the end . It's a very slightly altered Okay , user interface: two point f marketing: and we're just waiting for your rating project manager: It's just two point five for that one . Easy to use ? Based on what you've said there , I would say a one , true . I should've said a two to make the arithmetic easy , shouldn't I ? user interface: industrial designer: marketing: We'll just put almost two , project manager: One point seven f five . marketing: it incorporates current fashion trends , now that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours . So I'm just thinking , before I give it my rating , you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here . industrial designer: Yeah , that's marketing: Is this actually going to be the colours that you would use ? industrial designer: No , no , the the base colour was  white or or like or l sort of a light blue , user interface: White . industrial designer: but the changeable fa faces would  allow you to get any basically any one of a number of colours that  th it's full sort of customised . user interface: Any marketing: So we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do . industrial designer: No , no , 'cause th that's that's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it , that otherwise it's just sort of hard plastic . marketing: We've we've discussed it , we haven't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that . We've talked about pointers , but the very use of a remote control , if you're someone who's zapping , who's sitting like that , and we found so many people did , how do you minimise that on such a small device ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Well the type of button that we're gonna use in the bottom half , the material , minimises R_S_I_ industrial designer: It's meant to be . project manager: maybe because it's slightl industrial designer: project manager: with the size that we've got it's quite small , industrial designer: project manager: but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much . project manager: So maybe because there's more space , it's not kind of moving around trying to hit accurately the buttons in between . Yeah , I'd  I'd f I'd go for a five , actually , marketing: A five , okay . marketing: Twenty one is that twenty one ? user interface: marketing: So that's four point two five . Now we talked about voice recognition , we talked about a beeper , have we really industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: have the designers come to any dec real decision on that ? industrial designer: Yeah , it was it was  a voice voice recognition , user interface: Voice r recognition . And are we happy with the costs on that ? That is going to be feasible , cost-wise . I'd go for a I ca we can adjust the volume on that , just as we could volume on T_V_ . So if sombody's in the other room or if T_V_s in different rooms , or . industrial designer:  I think it would r I think it would probably be a a stand it would be a stand project manager: A standard . project manager: And if you didn't hear it in the room that you were standing in , then you'd realise that it wasn't in that room , you'd go into another room . industrial designer: I do realise that we might be being fairly biased , 'cause it is our product , project manager: marketing: So , user interface: industrial designer: but marketing: how do we feel about this ? industrial designer: marketing: We've got our our we've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the  six criteria there . The lowest rating we've got , which is really n it's not terribly low , i it's close around neutral is for  the minimisation of repetitive strain injury . Do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it , or do we have to make further modifications ? project manager: I don't think so . industrial designer: W I thin yeah , I think marketing: We happy to go ahead ? project manager: I think we yeah . I think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that , and I really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities , we could actually do much more to minimise that . Is there anything you would like to to ask me about the findings before I sum up ? project manager: Don't think so . user interface: You want me to b unplug that ? industrial designer: user interface: That's all . project manager: Now I presume that the screen will go blank , industrial designer: project manager: that  Okay . Right , what's happening with the electronics ? industrial designer: It was a regular chip on print user interface: Chip on print . industrial designer: Oh , no , no , no , the  Yeah , it's you you've put in three for the number of kinetic cells , there should just be one . In the top , it's the number project manager: Oh , right , industrial designer: of c yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , project manager: So , would there be two ? industrial designer: and yeah , just a no , one reg v  project manager: One chip . project manager: So what's a single curve then ? industrial designer: Yeah , I'd say I'd say it was w marketing: It would just be a flat bottom with one curve . industrial designer: yeah , I think I think it's user interface: Single-cu project manager: So just one double industrial designer: One double-curved . industrial designer: no , 'cause one yeah , one's double-curved , and then the other one's marketing: The other curves at the sides , but it's slightly flattened at the bottom so it doesn't roll over . user interface: No I think rubber , since it's being used just as a casing , project manager:  user interface: we can put point five . project manager: Do you think ? user interface: Yeah , I think it allows the point five , yeah . marketing: What does it mean if you put point five for that ? user interface: It means we are not using a lot of rubber actually . project manager: we're not actually using plastic in the case , are we ? industrial designer: No , no , that's it's as an extra . industrial designer: So that shouldn't that shouldn't be actually on there , because that's not incorporated in the cost of the remote you get . marketing: But it is gonna be part of the total cost , and there's nowhere else we can we can put that in , is there ? industrial designer: marketing: There's nowhere else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing . So do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there ? project manager: Okay , we'll just put it in as we'll put in as half . project manager: Or sh we should just put it in as one , because the plastic is zero anyway . Okay , special colour , do we need that ? marketing: Might do , if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours . project manager: Buttons industrial designer: And buttons marketing: S user interface: I think we could change the battery also . marketing: Has that not made any d if you click off that square now , has that not made any difference ? project manager: Has that not gone up ? industrial designer: Well yes . marketing: So is is uncurved completely and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: We haven't been dealin we haven't been dealing with dollars though , marketing: Is there anything on the menu project manager: I think marketing: No . If we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries , would that make a huge difference ? user interface: And going to a regular bat Yeah . The biggest one would be taking away if you took away user interface: What I feel is , customers never said anything about the battery . user interface: But shape and colours , that's something we shouldn't comprimi marketing: And people are used to buying batteries , industrial designer: If if you take away the voice , marketing: they're not gonna say I'm not getting this , 'cause I've got to buy a battery for a remote control . industrial designer: I I do I don't like to say it , but if you take away the voice recognition , then you've got it . marketing: Should we see what difference it makes ? project manager: Where's the industrial designer: Yeah i yeah . project manager: where's the voice recognition ? industrial designer: No 'cause it's samples sens sample speaker .  We can do it some other way , user interface: project manager: we can do it doesn't have to be voice recognition . We could do the voice recognition for , you know , business class or something , you know , like an upgraded version . industrial designer: But they but  in I don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five Euros now , because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product . marketing: But we're still working to  head o project manager: So should we just change the design specification then ? user interface: Make it costly . If we if we're working to head office specifications as this is what this project team's working for , we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings . industrial designer: We c we could s marketing: But we need to work to that specification to start with . industrial designer: Yeah , we could say marketing: And I think the voice recognition sounds wonderful , but our object is so distinctive that that in itself is gonna make it easier to locate as a f you know in a first instance .  as you say , we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers project manager: Okay , we can make the price fit , industrial designer: Yeah , I s project manager: and then say if we'd had our budget , we would've had this , industrial designer: And then say we recommend marketing:  . project manager: Right , okay , so marketing: So if we take voice recognition out industrial designer: That'll do it . industrial designer: Is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty ? user interface: Two five . project manager: Yeah well two , twelve point two five times two is twenty five , marketing: Right . Are they really going to quibble about ten P_ ? Or point zero one of a Euro ? user interface: It's twelve point five maybe , then . So half of the price would be project manager: I think the agenda one was where the  price was , wasn't it ? No . project manager: is that  got us covered for the electronics then ? We don't need something else to take that place ? industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: 'Cause that that was just a bought-on extra , you could just take that out and that would be fine , yeah . user interface: Except voice recognition , everything is project manager: Right , so we've done that . project manager: Because we've got decisions that we would have made that we weren't didn't feel able to make . project manager:  in the sense that  did you feel like a team ? Or did you feel like  autonomy ? industrial designer: Yeah , I'd say , as a team . marketing: And I've certainly felt heard , listened to in that in relevant areas we've been able to , you know , give and take and adjust our remit where necessary . How did you find it ? industrial designer: Yeah , no , I thought it it went really well and I yeah , I I feel that everyone was listened to and all the points that were raised seem to have been sorted out , although we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there , but that's that's good . industrial designer: I think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually if if if we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out , I think maybe it would've come out a d little different , project manager: Yeah . project manager: I liked the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be suggested that that wasn't the best idea , but no one felt like shot down , user interface: Yeah . project manager: you know , y it didn't matter it saying what you thought , because if it wasn't something that was that relevant , then it didn't matter , 'cause it was just another idea in the field . marketing: user interface: I think that was the best part project manager:   I'm still not caught up . user interface: of the industrial designer: project manager: But that's nothing to do with the teamwork at all .  marketing: industrial designer: marketing: Maybe we should think of branching out into children's toys and fake mobile phones as a side line .  means , whiteboard , digital pens , etcetera , what does that mean ? Any ideas ? user interface: industrial designer: Discuss which ones marketing: How do we evaluate the materials we had for communicating and sharing information ? industrial designer: yeah . marketing: Could it've been better , was it adequate ? industrial designer: Yeah , I think I think we probably woulda used the outer email system more , had we actually had had more time and if we'd been separated more . project manager: Yeah , 'cause we could just sort of say , sorry what did you say about that or what do you think about that , rather than having to email it , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , I think it's new ideas in general , marketing: It's really borrowing from other areas , it's , you know , bringing things from other areas in , project manager: rather than industrial designer: Yeah . Well user interface: Yeah , it's project manager: they have to come from somewhere , don't they ? marketing: Absolutely , yeah . user interface: The thing is project manager: And as sh as w sorry , user interface: Yep , sorry , project manager: you go . project manager:  as was shown by your presentation with all of the other controls , remote controls , no one's thought about it particularly . project manager:  they're slightly different , so if someone's been shut in the room and said make ours a bit different from everyone else's , 'cause it's w something we should think about , marketing: They're just like we've got a D_V_D_ player , does anyone remember the remote control ? Can't you get the one that we used for the last one ? Yeah , just jazz it up a bit . industrial designer: because normally , the remote control isn't the product which they're trying to ship . They're trying to ship the D_V_D_ player , the video player , the T_V_ . project manager: But then when it everything is really smart , and you've just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table , it doesn't go , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager:  if you could have something that's a proper funky thing , a funky item that's individual , individual to you , industrial designer: No . project manager:  they could even go into  you go in with an idea and they design it on Photoshop and then they just get it printed on the plastic , you would pray industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: you would pay a lot extra , because it's individually being a plastic was being made for you . user interface: Surprising to me is like  people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones , like a real want to see a new launch or something like that . Like Sarah was telling , everything's marketing: I think it's really good that this has been very market research based , user interface: Right . marketing: because just going back to mobile phones ,  this is the first change in remote control devices that I can really , you know , say is is obvious and visible . We see it in mobile phones a lot , and tha that's where we've borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from . marketing: I see people wanting a model of the phone they were really happy with , and they can't get it anymore project manager: Yeah . marketing: and it's innovation for innovation's sake , and I think it's wonderful our company's so R_ and D_ based . project manager: And you can't get you've got your handset that works fine , but you can't get the battery anymore for that type of phone , marketing:  . user interface: industrial designer: project manager:  our costs are below budget with recommendations that they the budget be increased , but I think I don't know , d what do you think ? Do you think that's takes into account  overheads like us being well paid kind of a thing ? And the heating for the building , do you think our budget includes everything , all the costs that are going out ? user interface: industrial designer: Well . project manager: So it looks well it looks like it's gonna be fifty percent profit , you've still got all of the overheads to come out of that . project manager: So maybe increasing it , you would also have to increase the price that it's sold at . project manager: But I think but you were saying that that's quite industrial designer: Yeah , I think yeah I don't from the market research . marketing: and I think there'll have to be another project team or a new project for us to look at at those kind of things . I don't think that's something we have to look at and find a way of raising the cash for . Yeah , it was marketing: I think we've done very well to get within budget project manager:  . Maybe they are gonna steal our ideas project manager: Maybe someone'll r run down and patent it . project manager: Oh , so we've got about fifty minutes to catch up with everything that I fell behind with , industrial designer: In your project manager: so I'll be delegating in my  role as Project Supervisor , industrial designer: yeah . project manager: I think I've got minutes for two of the meeting and the last thingy . industrial designer: Was that not the questionnaire for the how you felt you'd done in your thing ? marketing: Oh , right . marketing: But do we not sometimes evaluate in these meetings too ? industrial designer: Yeah , the the s marketing: Yeah "

There was a a a fierce argument that broke out over whose tiramisu might be the best and so we decided to have a contest where those people who claim to make good tiramisu make them , grad a: Ah . grad d: and then we got a panel of impartial judges that will taste do a blind taste and then vote . grad a: Seems like Seems like you could put a s magic special ingredient in , so that everyone know which one was yours . Well , I was thinking if  y you guys have plans for Sunday ? We 're we 're not it 's probably going to be this Sunday , but  we 're sort of working with the weather here because we also want to combine it with some barbecue activity where we just fire it up and what whoever brings whatever you know , can throw it on there . grad a: Well , I 'm going back to visit my parents this weekend , so , I 'll be out of town . grad d: So you 're going to the west Bay then ? No , grad a: No , the South Bay , grad d: south Bay ? grad a: yeah . Wonder if these things ever emit a very , like , piercing screech right in your ear ? grad d: They are gonna get more comfortable headsets . I actually  , even though Liz was  kind enough to offer to be the first subject , I sort of felt that she knew too much , so I asked  Litonya . grad d: So , this is what she saw as part of as  for instr introduction , this is what she had to read aloud .  , that was really difficult for her and  grad c: Because of l all the names , you mean ? grad d: The names and  this was the  first three tasks she had to to master after she called the system , and  then of course the system broke down , and those were the l   I should say the system was supposed to break down and then  these were the remaining three tasks that she was going to solve , with a human  . And now comes the This is the phone - in phase of grad c: Wait , can I I have a question . So there 's no system , right ? Like , there was a wizard for both  both parts , is this right ? grad d: Yeah . grad d: One time , pretending to be a system , one time , to pretending to be a human , which is actually not pretending . Isn't this kind of obvious when it says \" OK now you 're talking to a human \" and then the human has the same voice ? grad d: No no no . And  the wizard sometimes will not be audible , Because she was actually they there was some  lapse in the  wireless , we have to move her closer . grad a: Is she mispronouncing \" Anlage \" ? Is it \" Anlaga \" or \" Anlunga \" grad d: They 're mispronouncing everything , grad a: OK . Well , if we we  professor b: So , are are you trying to record this meeting ? grad d: There was a strange reflex .  , that was already anticipated by some people suggested that if we just have bullets here , they 're gonna not they 're subjects are probably not gonna going to follow the order . professor b: S so if you just number them \" one \" , \" two \" , \" three \" it 's grad d: Yeah , and make it sort of clear in the  professor b: OK . That is something that Fey actually thought of a in the last second that sh the system should introduce itself , when it 's called . grad d: And  , another suggestion , by Liz , was that we  , through subjects , switch the tasks . So when when they have task - one with the computer , the next person should have task - one with a human , and so forth .  , we have to refine the tasks more and more , which of course we haven't done at all , so far , in order to avoid this rephrasing , so where , even though w we don't tell the person \" ask blah - blah - blah - blah - blah \" they still try , or at least Litonya tried to  repeat as much of that text as possible . grad d: And  my suggestion is of course we we keep the wizard , because I think she did a wonderful job , professor b: Great . grad d: in the sense that she responded quite nicely to things that were not asked for , \" How much is a t a bus ticket and a transfer \" so this is gonna happen all the time , we d you can never be sure . grad a: I wasn't wasn't sure whether wizard was the correct term for  \" not a man \" . grad c: There 's no female equivalent of grad d: But  grad a: Are you sure ? grad c: No , I don't know . grad d: Well , there is witch and warlock , grad a: Yeah , that 's so @ @ . grad c: Yeah , that 's what I was thinking , but grad d: and  professor b: Right . And  So , some some work needs to be done , but I think we can  And this , and in case no you hadn't seen it , this is what Litonya looked at during the   while taking the while partaking in the data collection .  , do you know exactly how to do that , or is  Lila  , you know what exactly do we do to to put her on the payroll in some way ? grad d: I 'm completely clueless , but I 'm willing to learn . So anyway ,  grad d: N professor b: So why don't you  ask Lila and see what she says about you know exactly what we do for someone in th grad d: Student - type worker , professor b: Well , yeah she 's un she 's not a a student , grad d: or ? professor b: she just graduated but anyway . professor b: So i if Yeah , I agree , she sounded fine , she a actually was  , more  , present and stuff than than she was in conversation , so she did a better job than I would have guessed from just talking to her . grad d: This is sort of what I gave her , so this is for example h how to get to the student prison , professor b: Yeah . grad d: and I didn't even spell it out here and in some cases I I spelled it out a little bit  more thoroughly , professor b: Right . grad d: this is the information on on the low sunken castle , and the amphitheater that never came up , and  , so i if we give her even more  , instruments to work with I think the results are gonna be even better . professor b: Oh , yeah , and then of course as she does it she 'll she 'll learn @ @ .  And also if she 's willing to take on the job of organizing all those subjects and stuff that would be wonderful . professor b: And ,  she 's actually she 's going to graduate school in a kind of an experimental paradigm , so I think this is all just fine in terms of h her learning things she 's gonna need to know  , to do her career . professor b: So , I my guess is she 'll be r r quite happy to take on that job . grad d: And  I told her that we gonna  figure out a meeting time in the near future to refine the tasks and s look for the potential sources to find people . She also agrees that you know if it 's all just gonna be students the data is gonna be less valuable because of that so . professor b: Well , as I say there is this s set of people next door , it 's not hard to grad d: We 're already Yeah . professor b:  grad d: However , we may run into a problem with a reading task there . We could talk to the people who run it and  see if they have a way that they could easily  tell people that there 's a task , pays ten bucks or something , grad d:   Now , I signed us up for the Wednesday slot , and part of what we should do is this . professor b: So , my idea on that was  , partly we 'll talk about system stuff for the computer scientists , but partly I did want it to get the linguists involved in some of this issue about what the task is and all  you know , what the dialogue is , and what 's going on linguistically , because to the extent that we can get them contributing , that will be good . professor b: maybe we can get some of the linguists sufficiently interested that they 'll help us with it , other linguists , if you 're a linguist , but in any case , grad d: Yep . So my idea on on Wednesday is partly to  you  , what you did today would i is just fine . You just  do \" this is what we did , and here 's the thing , and here 's s some of the dialogue and and so forth . \" But then , the other thing of course is we should  give the computer scientists some idea of of what 's going on with the system design , and where we think the belief - nets fit in and where the pieces are and stuff like that . So , I don't I don't think it 's worth a lot of work , particularly on your part , to to to make a big presentation . I don't think you should you don't have to make any new  PowerPoint or anything . The  other two things is  we 've can have Johno tell us a little about this professor b: Great . grad d: and we also have a l little bit on the interface , M - three - L enhancement , and then  that was it , I think . grad a: So , what I did for this this is  , a pedagogical belief - net because I was I I took I tried to conceptually do what you were talking about with the nodes that you could expand out so what I did was I took I made these dummy nodes called Trajector - In and Trajector - Out that would isolate the things related to the trajector . And then I  did similar things for our our net to  with the context and the discourse and whatnot , so we could sort of isolate them or whatever in terms of the the top layer . Let 's go Slide all the way up so we see what the p the p very bottom looks like , or is that it ? grad a: Yeah , there 's just one more node and it says \" Mode \" which is the decision between the grad d: Yeah . grad a: So basically all I did was I took the last belief - net professor b: So   grad a: and I grouped things according to what how I thought they would fit in to  image schemas that would be related . And the two that I came up with were Trajector - landmark and then Source - path - goal as initial ones . grad a: And then I said well ,  the trajector would be the person in this case probably . grad a: you know , we have we have the concept of what their intention was , whether they were trying to tour or do business or whatever , professor b: Right . And then  in terms of the source , the things  the only things that we had on there I believe were whether Oh actually , I kind of , I might have added these cuz I don't think we talked too much about the source in the old one but  whether the where I 'm currently at is a landmark might have a bearing on whether grad d:   And \" usefulness \" is basi basically means is that an institutional facility like a town hall or something like that that 's not something that you 'd visit for tourist 's tourism 's sake or whatever . \" Travel constraints \" would be something like you know , maybe they said they can they only wanna take a bus or something like that , right ? And then those are somewhat related to the path , professor b:   grad a: so that would determine whether we 'd could take we would be telling them to go to the bus stop or versus walking there directly . Similar things as the source except they also added whether the entity was closed and whether they have somehow marked that is was the final destination .  , and then if you go up , Robert , Yeah , so  , in terms of Context , what we had currently said was whether they were a businessman or a tourist of some other person .  , Discourse was related to whether they had asked about open hours or whether they asked about where the entrance was or the admission fee , or something along those lines . grad a: Prosody I don't really I 'm not really sure what prosody means , in this context , so I just made up you know whether whether what they say is or h how they say it is is that . grad a: the Parse would be what verb they chose , and then maybe how they modified it , in the sense of whether they said \" I need to get there quickly \" or whatever . grad a: And  , in terms of World Knowledge , this would just basically be like opening and closing times of things , the time of day it is , and whatnot . grad d: What 's \" tourbook \" ? grad a: Tourbook ? That would be , I don't know , the \" landmark - iness \" of things , grad d:   So let me see if I can ask grad a: Well , this is not a working Bayes - net . No , I understand that , but but  So , what Let 's slide back up again and see start at the at the bottom and Oop - bo - doop - boop - boop . So , you could imagine w  , go ahead , you were about to go up there and point to something . grad a:  I I 'd No , I was gonna wait until professor b: Oh , OK . So , so if you if we made if we wanted to make it into a a real  Bayes - net , that is , you know , with fill you know , actually f  , fill it @ @ in , then  grad a: So we 'd have to get rid of this and connect these things directly to the Mode . And and  Bhaskara and I was talking about this a little earlier today is , if we just do this , we could wind up with a huge  , combinatoric input to the Mode thing . And  grad a: Well I oh yeah , I unders I understand that , I just  it 's hard for me to imagine how he could get around that . Let me just mention something that I don't want to pursue today which is there are technical ways of doing it ,  I I slipped a paper to Bhaskara and about Noisy - OR 's and Noisy - MAXes and there 're ways to  sort of back off on the purity of your Bayes - net - edness . If you co you could ima and I now I don't know that any of those actually apply in this case , but there is some technology you could try to apply . grad a: So it 's possible that we could do something like a summary node of some sort that OK . grad a: So in that case , the sum we 'd have we  , these wouldn't be the summary nodes . We 'd have the summary nodes like where the things were I guess maybe if thi if things were related to business or some other professor b: Yeah . professor b: So what I was gonna say is is maybe a good at this point is to try to informally  , not necessarily in th in this meeting , but to try to informally think about what the decision variables are . So , if you have some bottom line  decision about which mode , you know , what are the most relevant things . professor b: And the other trick , which is not a technical trick , it 's kind of a knowledge engineering trick , is to make the n each node sufficiently narrow that you don't get this combinatorics . So that if you decided that you could characterize the decision as a trade - off between three factors , whatever they may be , OK ? then you could say \" Aha , let 's have these three factors \" , OK ? and maybe a binary version f for each , or some relatively compact decision node just above the final one . professor b: And then the question would be if if those are the things that you care about ,  can you make a relatively compact way of getting from the various inputs to the things you care about . So that y so that , you know , you can sort of try to do a knowledge engineering thing grad a: OK . professor b: given that we 're not gonna screw with the technology and just always use  sort of orthodox Bayes - nets , then we have a knowledge engineering little problem of how do we do that .  and grad a: So what I kind of need to do is to take this one and the old one and merge them together ? professor b: \" Eh - eh - eh .  , so  , Robert has thought about this problem f for a long time , cuz he 's had these examples kicking around , so he may have some good intuition about you know , what are the crucial things . professor b: and , I understand where this the  this is a way of playing with this abs Source - path - goal trajector exp   abstraction and and sort of sh displaying it in a particular way . professor b: I don't think our friends  on Wednesday are going to be able to Well , maybe they will . This is sort of th the second version and I I I look at this maybe just as a , you know , a a whatever , UML diagram or , you know , as just a  screen shot , not really as a Bayes - net as John Johno said . grad a: We could actually , y yeah draw it in a different way , in the sense that it would make it more abstract . But the  the the nice thing is that you know , it just is a is a visual aid for thinking about these things which has comple clearly have to be specified m more carefully professor b: Alright , well , le let me think about this some more , grad d: and  professor b: and  see if we can find a way to present this to this linguists group that that is helpful to them . grad d: ultimately we we may w w we regard this as sort of an exercise in in thinking about the problem and maybe a first version of  a module , if you wanna call it that , that you can ask , that you can give input and it it 'll  throw the dice for you ,  throw the die for you , because  I integrated this into the existing SmartKom system in in the same way as much the same way we can  sort of have this  this thing . So if this is what M - three - L  will look like and what it 'll give us ,  And a very simple thing . We have an action that he wants to go from somewhere , which is some type of object , to someplace . grad d: And this these  this changed now only  ,  It 's doing it twice now because it already did it once .  , we 'll add some action type , which in this case is \" Approach \" and could be , you know , more refined  in many ways . grad d: Or we can  have something where the  goal is a public place and it will give us then of course an action type of the type \" Enter \" . So this is just based on this one  , on this one feature , and that 's that 's about all you can do . And so in the f if this pla if the object type  here is is a m is a landmark , of course it 'll be  \" Vista \" . And  this is about as much as we can do if we don't w if we want to avoid   a huge combinatorial explosion where we specify \" OK , if it 's this and this but that is not the case \" , and so forth , it just gets really really messy . You 're you 're grad d:  ? professor b: It was much too quick for me . So , I I do understand that  you can take the M - three - L and add not and it w and you need to do this , for sure , we have to add , you know , not too much about  object types and stuff , and what I think you did is add some rules of the style that are already there that say \" If it 's of type \" Landmark \" , then you take you 're gonna take a picture of it . Ev - every landmark you take a picture of , grad d: Every public place you enter , and statue you want to go as near as possible . grad d: W professor b: that 's a that 's another kind of baseline case , that 's another sort of thing \" OK , here 's a another kind of minimal  way of tackling this \" . Add extra properties , a deterministic rule for every property you have an action , \" pppt ! \" You do that .  , then the question would be  Now , if that 's all you 're doing , then you can get the types from the ontology , OK ? because that 's all you 're all you 're using is this type the types in the ontology and you 're done . grad d:  ? professor b: Right ? So we don't we don't use the discourse , we don't use the context , we don't do any of those things . professor b: Alright , but that 's but that 's OK , and  it it 's again a kind of one minimal extension of the existing things . And that 's something the  SmartKom people themselves would they 'd say \" Sure , that 's no problem you know , no problem to add types to the ont \" Right ? grad d: Yeah . And this is just in order to exemplify what what we can do very , very easily is ,  we have this this silly  interface and we have the rules that are as banal as of we just saw , and we have our content . grad d: Now , the content I whi which is sort of what what we see here , which is sort of the Vista , Schema , Source , Path , Goal , whatever . grad d: This will  be  a job to find ways of writing down Image schema , X - schema , constructions , in some some form , and have this be in a in a in the content , loosely called \" Constructicon \" . And  and here is exactly where what 's gonna be replaced with our Bayes - net , which is exactly getting the input feeding into here . This decides whether it 's an whether action the the Enter , the Vista , or the whatever professor b: \" approach \" , you called it , I think this time . This is  so what we 'd be generating would be a reference to a semantic  like parameters for the for the X - schema ? professor b: For for for Yes . So that that  i if you had the generalized \" Go \" X - schema and you wanted to specialize it to these three ones , then you would have to supply the parameters . professor b: And then  , although we haven't worried about this yet , you might wanna worry about something that would go to the GIS and use that to actually get you know , detailed route planning . professor b: But , presumably that that that functionality 's there when when we grad a: So the immediate problem is just deciding w which grad d: Aspects of the X - schema to add . professor b: Yeah , so the pro The immediate problem is is back t t to what you were what you are doing with the belief - net . professor b: You know ,  what are we going to use to make this decision grad a: Right and then , once we 've made the decision , how do we put that into the content ? professor b: Yeah . professor b: The harder problem is we decide what we want to use , how are we gonna get it ? And that the the that 's the hardest problem . So , the hardest problem is how are you going to get this information from some combination of the what the person says and the context and the ontology . The h So , I think that 's the hardest problem at the moment is is grad a: OK .  , and that 's so , getting back to here , we have a d a technical problem with the belief - nets that we we don't want all the com grad a: There 's just too many factors right now . professor b: So we wanna think about which ones we really care about and what they really most depend on , and can we c you know , clean this this up to the point where it grad a: So what we really wanna do i cuz this is really just the three layer net , we wanna b make it expand it out into more layers basically ? professor b: Right .  , it 's true that the way you have this , a lot of the times you have what you 're having is the values rather than the variable . So instead of in instead it should really be just be \" intention \" as a node instead of \" intention business \" or \" intention tour \" . professor b: OK ? So you Yeah , right , and then it would have values , \" Tour \" , \" Business \" , or  \" Hurried \" . professor b: But then but i it still some knowledge design to do , about i how do you wanna break this up , what really matters . grad a: I think what was going through my mind when I did it was someone could both have a business intention and a touring intention and the probabilities of both of them happening at the same time professor b: Well , you you could do that . And it 's perfectly OK to  insist that that , you know , th  , they add up to one , but that there 's  that that it doesn't have to be one zero zero . So you could have the conditional p So the each of these things is gonna be a a a probability . So whenever there 's a choice ,  so like landmark - ness and usefulness , grad a: Well , see I don't think those would be mutually professor b: OK grad a: it seems like something could both be professor b: Absolutely right . professor b: And so that you might want to then have those b Th - Then they may have to be separate . professor b: So that 's but again , this is this is the sort of knowledge design you have to go through . It 's you know , it 's great is is , you know , as one step toward  toward where we wanna go . grad d: Also it strikes me that we we m may want to approach the point where we can sort of try to find a  , a specification for some interface , here that  takes the normal M - three - L , looks at it . Then we discussed in our pre - edu EDU meeting  how to ask the ontology , what to ask the ontology  the fact that we can pretend we have one , make a dummy until we get the real one , and so  we we may wanna decide we can do this from here , but we also could do it  you know if we have a a a belief - net interface . But this information is just M - three - L , and then we want to look up some more stuff in the ontology and we want to look up some more stuff in the maybe we want to ask the real world , maybe you want to look something up in the GRS , but also we definitely want to look up in the dialogue history  some s some stuff . Based on we we have  I was just made some examples from the ontology and so we have for example some information there that the town hall is both a a a building and it has doors and stuff like this , but it is also an institution , so it has a mayor and so forth and so forth and we get relations out of it and once we have them , we can use that information to look in the dialogue history , \" were any of these things that that are part of the town hall as an institution mentioned ? \" , professor b:   grad d: \" were any of these that make the town hall a building mentioned ? \" , grad c: Right . So this may be a a sort of a process of two to three steps before we get our vector , that we feed into the belief - net , professor b: Yeah . grad d: and then professor b: There will be rules , but they aren't rules that come to final decisions , they 're rules that gather information for a decision process . So they 'll they presumably there 'll be a thread or process or something that \" Agent \" , yeah , \" Agent \" , whatever you wan wanna say , yeah , that  is rule - driven , and can can  can do things like that . And  there 's an issue about whether there will be that 'll be the same agent and the one that then goes off and  carries out the decision , so it probably will . My guess is it 'll be the same basic agent that  can go off and get information , run it through a a c this belief - net that turn a crank in the belief - net , that 'll come out with s  more another vector , OK , which can then be  applied at what we would call the simulation or action end . So on once you pull that out , it could be that that says \" Ah ! Now that we know that we gonna go ask the ontology something else . \" OK ? Now that we know that it 's a bus trip , OK ? we didn't We didn't need to know beforehand ,  how long the bus trip takes or whatever , but but now that we know that 's the way it 's coming out then we gotta go find out more . So this is actually , s if if we were to build something that is  , and , I had one more thing , the it needs to do Yeah . I think we I I can come up with a a code for a module that we call the \" cognitive dispatcher \" , which does nothing , professor b: OK . grad d: but it looks of complect object trees and decides how are there parts missing that need to be filled out , there 's this is maybe something that this module can do , something that this module can do and then collect  sub - objects and then recombine them and put them together . So maybe this is actually some some useful tool that we can use to rewrite it , and  get this part , professor b: Oh , OK . In particular see what we 'd like to do , and and this has been implicit in the discussion , is to do this in such a way that you get a lot of re - use . What you 're trying to get out of this deep co cognitive linguistics is the fact that w if you know about source source , paths and goals , and nnn all this sort of stuff , that a lot of this is the same , for different tasks . And that  there 's there 's some some important generalities that you 're getting , so that you don't take each and every one of these tasks and hafta re - do it . grad d: There 're no primitives upon which  professor b: u u What are the primitives , and how do you break this grad d: yeah . professor b: So I y I 'm just just there saying eee well you I know how to do any individual case , right ? but I don't yet see what 's the really interesting question is can you use  deep  cognitive linguistics to get powerful generalizations . professor b:  grad d: Maybe we sho should we a add then the \" what 's this ? \" domain ? N  , we have to \" how do I get to X \" . Then we also have the \" what 's this ? \" domain , where we get some slightly different professor b: Could . grad d:  Johno , actually , does not allow us to call them \" intentions \" anymore . professor b: Well , I I don't like the term either , so I have n i  i i y w i i It  grad d: But  , I 'm sure the \" what 's this ? \" questions also create some interesting X - schema aspects . I 'm not a I 'm not op particularly opposed to adding that or any other task , grad d: So . professor b: I 'm just saying that I 'm gonna hafta do some sort of first principles thinking about this . Well , no the Bayes the Bayes - nets The Bayes - nets will be dec specific for each decision . But what I 'd like to be able to do is to have the way that you extract properties , that will go into different Bayes - nets , be the  general . So that if you have sources , you have trajectors and stuff like that , and there 's a language for talking about trajectors , you shouldn't have to do that differently for   going to something , than for circling it , for  telling someone else how to go there , grad d: Getting out of professor b: whatever it is . So that that , the the decision processes are gonna be different What you 'd really like of course is the same thing you 'd always like which is that you have  a kind of intermediate representation which looks the same o over a bunch of inputs and a bunch of outputs . So all sorts of different tasks and all sorts of different ways of expressing them use a lot of the same mechanism for pulling out what are the fundamental things going on . And pushing it one step further , when you get to construction grammar and stuff , what you 'd like to be able to do is say you have this parser which is much fancier than the parser that comes with  SmartKom , i that that actually uses constructions and is able to tell from this construction that there 's  something about the intent you know , the actual what people wanna do or what they 're referring to and stuff , in independent of whether it about what is this or where is it or something , that you could tell from the construction , you could pull out deep semantic information which you 're gonna use in a general way . You might be able to to  say that this i this is the kind of construction in which the there 's Let 's say there 's a  cont there the the land the construction implies the there 's a con this thing is being viewed as a container . So just from this local construction you know that you 're gonna hafta treat it as a container you might as well go off and get that information . So if you say \" how do I get into the castle \" OK , then  Or , you know , \" what is there in the castle \" or so there 's all sorts of things you might ask that involve the castle as a container and you 'd like to have this orthogonal so that anytime the castle 's referred to as a container , you crank up the appropriate stuff . professor b: Alright , so that 's that 's the that 's the thesis level grad d:   professor b:  grad d: It 's unfortunate also that English has sort of got rid of most of its spatial adverbs because they 're really fancy then , in in for these kinds of analysis . professor b: Well , you have prepositional phrases that grad d: Yeah , but they 're they 're easier for parsers . grad d: Parsers can pick those up but but the with the spatial adverbs , they have a tough time . Oh yeah , b But an architecture like this would also enable us maybe to to throw this away and and replace it with something else , or whatever , so that we have so that this is sort of the representational formats we 're we 're we 're talking about that are independent of the problem , that generalize over those problems , and are oh , t of a higher quality than an any actual whatever  belief - net , or \" X \" that we may use for the decision making , ultimately . So , are we gonna be meeting here from now on ? I 'm I 'm happy to do that . We we had talked about it , cuz you have th th the display and everything , that seems fine . grad d: so far I think it was nice as a visual aid for some things and and professor b: Oh yeah . No I I think it 's worth it to ass to meet here to bring this , and assume that something may come up that we wanna look at . grad d: Yeah ? The   , she w she was definitely good in the sense that she she showed us some of the weaknesses professor b: Right . grad d: and  also the  the fact that she was a real subject you know , is is professor b: Right . Yeah , and and and yeah and and she took it seriously and stuff l No , it was great . grad d: So I think that   , w Looking just looking at this data , listening to it , what can we get out of it in terms of our problem , for example , is , you know , she actually m said you know , she never s just spoke about entering , she just wanted to get someplace , and she said for buying stuff . grad d: and in the other case , where she wanted to look at the stuff at the graffiti , also , of course , not in the sentence \" How do you get there ? \" was pretty standard . Nuh ? except that there was a nice anaphora , you know , for pointing at what she talked about before , and there she was talking about looking at pictures that are painted inside a wall on walls , so grad c: Right .  , because graffiti is usually found on the outside and not on the inside , grad c: Yeah "

        "Query": "Summarize the discussion on spectral subtraction and the opinions of the professor and PhD F.",
        "Summary": "The team explored different approaches for spectral subtraction, including both scaling and GGT bins. Each approach had its pros and cons. The professor suggested a simple spectral subtraction followed by a KL transformation. Additionally, he recommended using JRASTRA's technique, which involved adding noise to eliminate noise. The team also discussed VTS techniques. Initially, the professor did not see the advantage of combining the Wiener filter and the subspace, but later realized that a simple spectral subtraction, followed by a KL transform and a Wiener filter, would suffice. The log magnitude spectral subtraction utilized twelve seconds from the past and future to calculate the mean. The use of a short window did not significantly impact the model's performance, which was desirable. The team also removed silence to enhance the model's effectiveness, drawing a parallel to caching utterances. PhD F shared that the preliminary results from spectral subtraction were unsatisfactory, but mean normalization helped reduce noise. However, mean and variance normalization only improved speech, not noise variance.",
        "Article": "We  we abandoned the lapel because they sort of were not too not too hot , not too cold , they were you know , they were  , far enough away that you got more background noise , and  and so forth phd a:  - huh . professor c: but they weren't so close that they got quite the you know , the really good No , th phd a: OK . They were not so far away that they were really good representative distant mikes , phd a:  - huh . professor c: but on the other hand they were not so close that they got rid of all the interference . On the other hand if you only had to have one mike in some ways you could argue the lapel was a good choice , precisely because it 's in the middle . professor c: There 's  , some kinds of junk that you get with these things that you don't get with the lapel  , little mouth clicks and breaths and so forth are worse with these than with the lapel , but given the choice we there seemed to be very strong opinions for  , getting rid of lapels . phd a: The mike number is professor c: So , phd f: your mike number 's written on the back of that unit there . phd f: It - it 's one less than what 's written on the back of your phd a: OK . professor c: And you should do a lot of talking so we get a lot more of your pronunciations . phd f: So what we usually do is  , we typically will have our meetings professor c: Yeah . One thing phd f: Sunil 's here for the summer ? professor c: Sunil 's here for the summer , right .  , so , one thing is to talk about a kick off meeting maybe  , and then just  , I guess  , progress reports individually , and then  , plans for where we go between now and then , pretty much . phd f: I could say a few words about  , some of the  , compute stuff that 's happening around here , so that people in the group know . professor c: Yeah ? phd f: We  So we just put in an order for about twelve new machines , to use as sort of a compute farm . And  , we ordered  , SUN - Blade - one - hundreds , and  , I 'm not sure exactly how long it 'll take for those to come in , but , in addition , we 're running So the plan for using these is , we 're running P - make and Customs here and Andreas has sort of gotten that all  , fixed up and up to speed . And he 's got a number of little utilities that make it very easy to  , run things using P - make and Customs . The simplest thing And I can send an email around or , maybe I should do an FAQ on the web site about it or something .  , professor c: How about an email that points to the FAQ , phd f: there 's a c professor c: you know what I 'm saying ? phd f: Yeah , yeah . And , if you say that and then some job that you want to execute , it will find the fastest currently available machine , and export your job to that machine , and  and run it there and it 'll duplicate your environment . So you can say \" run dash command L S \" , and , it 'll actually export that LS command to some machine in the institute , and  , do an LS on your current directory . So , substitute LS for whatever command you want to run , and  And that 's a simple way to get started using using this . And , so , soon , when we get all the new machines up , e then we 'll have lots more compute to use . Now th one of the nice things is that  , each machine that 's part of the P - make and Customs network has attributes associated with it .  , attributes like how much memory the machine has , what its speed is , what its operating system , and when you use something like \" run command \" , you can specify those attributes for your program . For example if you only want your thing to run under Linux , you can give it the Linux attribute , and then it will find the fastest available Linux machine and run it on that . You can control where your jobs go , to a certain extent , all the way down to an individual machine . If there 's already a job running , on some machine that you 're trying to select , your job will get queued up , and then when that resource , that machine becomes available , your job will get exported there . So , there 's a lot of nice features to it and it kinda helps to balance the load of the machines and  , right now Andreas and I have been the main ones using it and we 're  . professor c: So as I understand , you know , he 's using all the machines and you 're using all the machines , phd f: So . Yeah , you know , I I sort of got started using the recognizer just recently and  ,  I fired off a training job , and then I fired off a recognition job and I get this email about midnight from Andreas saying , \"  , are you running two trainings simultaneously s my m my jobs are not getting run . grad g: I have I have a question about the  , parallelization ? phd f:   grad g: So , let 's say I have like , a thousand little little jobs to do ? phd f:   grad g: how do I do it with \" run command \" ?  do phd f: You could write a script  , which called run command on each sub - job grad g:  - huh . A thousand times ? phd f: right ? But you probably wanna be careful with that grad g: OK .  , so , you know , you should you should probably not run more than , say ten jobs yourself at any one time , just because then it would keep other people grad g: Oh , too much file transfer and stuff . phd f: Well it 's not that so much as that , you know , e with if everybody ran fifty jobs at once then it would just bring everything to a halt and , you know , people 's jobs would get delayed , so it 's sort of a sharing thing . phd f: so you should try to limit it to somet sometim some number around ten jobs at a time . So if you had a script for example that had a thousand things it needed to run , you 'd somehow need to put some logic in there if you were gonna use \" run command \" , to only have ten of those going at a time .  , professor c: I remember I I forget whether it was when the Rutgers or or Hopkins workshop , I remember one of the workshops I was at there were everybody was real excited cuz they got twenty - five machines and there was some kind of P - make like thing that sit sent things out . professor c: So all twenty - five people were sending things to all twenty - five machines phd f:   professor c: and and things were a lot less efficient than if you 'd just use your own machine . phd f: but  , you can also If you have that level of parallelization  , and you don't wanna have to worry about writing the logic in in a Perl script to take care of that , you can use  , P - make grad g: Just do P - make . phd f: and and you basically write a Make file that  , you know your final job depends on these one thousand things , grad g: s   phd f: and when you run P - make , on your Make file , you can give it the dash capital J and and then a number , grad g:   If you \" Run command \" , that I mentioned before , is doesn't know about other things that you might be running . phd f: So , it would be possible to run a hundred run jobs at once , phd d: Right . But if you use P - make , then , it knows about all the jobs that it has to run phd d:   professor c: So \" run command \" doesn't use P - make , or ? phd f: It uses \" export \" underlyingly . But , if you i It 's meant to be run one job at a time ? So you could fire off a thousand of those , and it doesn't know any one of those doesn't know about the other ones that are running . professor c: So why would one use that rather than P - make ? phd f: Well , if you have ,  Like , for example ,  if you didn't wanna write a P - make script and you just had a ,  an HTK training job that you know is gonna take  , six hours to run , and somebody 's using , the machine you typically use , you can say \" run command \" and your HTK thing and it 'll find another machine , the fastest currently available machine and and run your job there . professor c: Now , does it have the same sort of behavior as P - make , which is that , you know , if you run something on somebody 's machine and they come in and hit a key then it phd f: Yes . And if you specify that , in in one of your attribute lines , then it 'll go to a machine which your job won't be evicted from . phd f: But , the machines that don't have that attribute , if a job gets fired up on that , which could be somebody 's desktop machine , and and they were at lunch , professor c:   phd f: they come back from lunch and they start typing on the console , then your machine will get evicted your job will get evicted from their machine and be restarted on another machine . So which can cause you to lose time , right ? If you had a two hour job , and it got halfway through and then somebody came back to their machine and it got evicted . If you don't want your job to run on a machine where it could be evicted , then you give it the minus the attribute , you know , \" no evict \" , and it 'll pick a machine that it can't be evicted from . professor c: what what about I remember always used to be an issue , maybe it 's not anymore , that if you if something required if your machine required somebody hitting a key in order to evict things that are on it so you could work , but if you were logged into it from home ? phd f:   professor c: and you weren't hitting any keys ? cuz you were , home ? phd f: Yeah , I I 'm not sure how that works . I don't know whether it monitors the keyboard or actually looks at the console TTY , so maybe if you echoed something to the you know , dev dev console or something . phd f:  ? professor c:  you sort of you 're at home and you 're trying to log in , and it takes forever to even log you in , and you probably go , \" screw this \" , phd f: Yeah , yeah . phd a: I need a little orientation about this environment and  scr s how to run some jobs here because I never d did anything so far with this X emissions phd f: OK . Yeah , and and also  , Stephane 's a a really good resource for that if you can't find me . Well , why don't we  , Sunil since you 're haven't haven't been at one of these yet , why don't yo you tell us what 's what 's up with you ? Wh - what you 've been up to , hopefully . phd a: yeah , after the submission the what I 've been working on mainly was to take take other s submissions and then over their system , what they submitted , because we didn't have any speech enhancement system in in ours . And then I found that  , if if I combine it with LDA , it gives @ @ improvement over theirs . I just plug in I just take the cepstral coefficients coming from their system and then plug in LDA on top of that . phd a: What I did was I took the LDA filter 's design using clean speech , mainly because the speech is already cleaned up after the enhancement so , instead of using this , narrow narrow band LDA filter that we submitted  , I got new filters . And  , so then after after that I I added  , on - line normalization also on top of that . And that there there also I n I found that I have to make some changes to their time constant that I used because th it has a a mean and variance update time constant and which is not suitable for the enhanced speech , and whatever we try it on with proposal - one . But  , I didn't I didn't play with that time constant a lot , I just t g I just found that I have to reduce the value  , I have to increase the time constant , or reduce the value of the update value . And  , the other other thing what I tried was , I just  , took the baseline and then ran it with the endpoint inf  th information , just the Aurora baseline , to see that how much the baseline itself improves by just supplying the information of the  the w speech and nonspeech . And  , I found that the baseline itself improves by twenty - two percent by just giving the wuh . professor c: can you back up a second , I I I missed something , I guess my mind wandered . Ad - ad When you added the on - line normalization and so forth ,  things got better again ? phd a: Yeah . phd a: With the different time constant I found that  , I didn't get an improvement over not using on - line normalization , professor c: Oh . phd a: But I didn't play it with play play quite a bit to make it better than . The the other thing what I tried was the adding the  , endpoint information to the baseline and that itself gives like twenty - two percent because the the second the new phase is going to be with the endpointed speech . And just to get a feel of how much the baseline itself is going to change by adding this endpoint information , I just , use professor c:  . phd f: So people won't even have to worry about , doing speech - nonspeech then . professor c: G I guess the issue is that people do that anyway , phd f: I see . professor c: and they wanted to see , given that you 're doing that , what what are the best features that you should use . professor c: But but it might be  In some ways it might be better t to rather than giving the endpoints , to have a standard that everybody uses and then interacts with . phd f: So , are people supposed to assume that there is  Are are people not supposed to use any speech outside of those endpoints ? phd a:  phd f: Or can you then use speech outside of it for estimating background noise and things ? phd a: No . Like y you will you will You 'll be given the information about the beginning and the end of speech but the whole speech is available to you . professor c: So it should make the spectral subtraction style things work even better , phd a: Yeah . I found that in s one of the SpeechDat - Car cases , that like , the Spanish one improves by just fifty percent by just putting the endpoint . phd a: Yeah , so professor c: But but phd a: so that is when  , the the qualification criteria was reduced from fifty percent to something like twenty - five percent for well - matched . And  , Yeah , I guess after that , I just went home f I just had a vacation fo for four weeks . phd a: Ye Yeah , and I I came back and I started working on  , some other speech enhancement algorithm .  , so I from the submission what I found that people have tried spectral subtraction and Wiener filtering . phd a: so just to just to fill the space with some f few more speech enhancement algorithms to see whether it improves a lot , I I 've been working on this  , signal subspace approach for speech enhancement where you take the noisy signal and then decomposing the signal s and the noise subspace and then try to estimate the clean speech from the signal plus noise subspace . phd a: So , I 've been actually running some s So far I 've been trying it only on Matlab . phd a: and then I 'll p port it to C and I 'll update it with the repository once I find it it giving any some positive result . professor c: S So you s you So you said one thing I want to jump on for a second . So so now you 're you 're getting tuned into the repository thing that he has here phd a: Yeah . Cuz you did some stuff that you talked about last week , I guess ? phd d:   professor c: where you were also combining something both of you I guess were both combining something from the  , French Telecom system with the u  phd d: Right . professor c: I I don't know whether it was system one or system two , or ? phd d:   phd d: we The main thing that we did is just to take the spectral subtraction from the France Telecom , which provide us some speech samples that are  , with noise removed . So then , one distinction is that  , you were taking the actual France Telecom features and then applying something to phd a: no there is a slight different .   , which are extracted at the handset because they had another back - end blind equalization professor c: Yeah . professor c: What I meant was you had something like cepstra or something , right ? phd a: Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . But I guess it 's the s exactly the same thing because on the heads  , handset they just applied this Wiener filter and then compute cepstral features , phd a: Yeah , the cepstral f The difference is like There may be a slight difference in the way phd d: right ? or ? phd a: because they use exactly the baseline system for converting the cepstrum once you have the speech . But  , I th phd d: Yeah , well I think we should  , have a table with all the result because I don't know I  , I don't exactly know what are your results ? But , phd a: OK . Yeah , but so we did this , and another difference I guess is that we just applied  , proposal - one system after this without well , with our modification to reduce the delay of the the LDA filters , phd a:  - huh . phd d: and phd b: And the filter phd d: Well there are slight modifications , but it was the full proposal - one . In your case , if you tried just putting LDA , then maybe on - line normalization ? phd a: Only LDA . So we just tried directly to to just , keep the system as it was and , when we plug the spectral subtraction it improves  , signif significantly .  , but , what seems clear also is that we have to retune the time constants of the on - line normalization . phd d: Because if we keep the value that was submitted  , it doesn't help at all . But , you can still find some kind of optimum somewhere , and we don't know where exactly phd a: Yeah . professor c: So it sounds like you should look at some tables of results or something phd d: Right . professor c: and see where i where the where they were different and what we can learn from it . phd d: because we change it the system to have phd a: Oh yeah ,  the the new LDA filters . There are other things that we finally were shown to improve also like , the sixty - four hertz cut - off . phd d: And , right now if we look at the results , it 's , always better than it seems always better than France Telecom for mismatch and high - mismatch . But , the problem is that it 's not significant , but if you put this in the , mmm , spreadsheet , it 's still worse . I don't think it 's importa important because when they will change their metric , mainly because of  , when you p you plug the  , frame dropping in the baseline system , it will improve a lot HM , and  , phd a: Yeah . phd a: Because the your improvement on HM and  will also go down significantly in the spreadsheet so . phd a:  the well - matched may be the one which is least affected by adding the endpoint information . But they d the everything  is like , but there that 's how they reduce why they reduce the qualification to twenty - five percent or some something on . professor c: But are they changing the weighting ? phd a: no , I guess they are going ahead with the same weighting . professor c: I guess I I haven't been part of the discussion , so , it seems to me that the well - matched condition is gonna be unusual , phd a: Usual . professor c: Because , you don't actually have good matches ordinarily for what any @ @ particular person 's car is like , or phd a: Mmm . phd a: Yeah , but actually the well well the well - matched  ,  the the well - matched condition is not like , the one in TI - digits where  , you have all the training , conditions exactly like replicated in the testing condition also . The well - matched has also some some mismatch in that which is other than the professor c: The well wa matched has mismatch ? phd a: has has also some slight mismatches , unlike the TI - digits where it 's like prefectly matched phd f: Perfect to match . So remind me of what well - matched meant ? phd a: The the well - matched is like professor c: You 've told me many times . phd a: the the well - matched is defined like it 's seventy percent of the whole database is used for training and thirty percent for testing . phd a: It 's it 's phd d: Because it phd a: OK , it 's professor c: Yeah . So , yeah , unless they deliberately chose it to be different , which they didn't because they want it to be well - matched , it is pretty much You know , so it 's so it 's sort of saying if you phd f: It 's it 's not guaranteed though . phd a: the main mismatch is coming from the amount of noise and the silence frames and all those present in the database actually . professor c: Again , if you have enough if you have enough phd a: No yeah , yeah . professor c: So it 's sort of i i it 's sort of saying OK , so you much as you train your dictation machine for talking into your computer , you you have a car , and so you drive it around a bunch and and record noise conditions , or something , and then I don't think that 's very realistic ,  I th phd a:   professor c: I I you know , so I I I you know , I guess they 're saying that if you were a company that was selling the stuff commercially , that you would have a bunch of people driving around in a bunch of cars , and and you would have something that was roughly similar and maybe that 's the argument , but I 'm not sure I buy it , so . We are playing we are also playing , trying to put other spectral subtraction mmm , in the code .  , it would be a very simple spectral subtraction , on the  , mel energies which I already tested but without the  frame dropping actually , and I think it 's important to have frame dropping if you use spectral subtraction . phd f: Is it is spectral subtraction typically done on the after the mel , scaling or is it done on the FFT bins ? phd d: phd f: Does it matter , or ? phd d: I d I don't know . So - some of the proposal , we 're doing this on the bin on the FFT bins , phd f:  . You can do both , but I cannot tell you what 's which one might be better or I phd f:  . phd a: I guess if you want to reconstruct the speech , it may be a good idea to do it on FFT bins .  it may not be very different if you do it on mel warped or whether you do it on FFT . phd d: Well , it gives something different , but I don't know what are the , pros and cons of both . phd a: The other thing is like when you 're putting in a speech enhancement technique , is it like one stage speech enhancement ? Because everybody seems to have a mod two stages of speech enhancement in all the proposals , which is really giving them some improvement . phd a: And So , there 's something that is good about doing it  , to cleaning it up once more . phd a: so we can phd d: So maybe in my implementation I should also try to inspire me from this kind of thing phd a: Yeah . That 's what professor c: Well , the other thing would be to combine what you 're doing . professor c:  maybe one or one or the other of the things that you 're doing would benefit from the other happening first . So , professor c: Right , so he 's doing a signal subspace thing , maybe it would work better if you 'd already done some simple spectral subtraction , or maybe vi maybe the other way around , phd d: Yeah ,   professor c: you know ? phd a: So I 've been thinking about combining the Wiener filtering with signal subspace , phd d:   phd a:  just to see all some some such permutation combination to see whether it really helps or not . professor c: How is it I I guess I 'm ignorant about this , how does  , since Wiener filter also assumes that you 're that you 're adding together the two signals , how is how is that differ from signal subspace ? phd a: The signal subspace ? The professor c: Yeah . phd a: So , the the different the c the the advantage of combining two things is mainly coming from the signal subspace approach doesn't work very well if the SNR is very bad . So essentially you could do simple spectral subtraction , followed by a KL transform , followed by a phd a: Wiener filtering . Yeah , in general , you don't that 's right you don't wanna othorg orthogonalize if the things are noisy .  , that was something that  , Herve and I were talking about with  , the multi - band stuff , that if you 're converting things to from  , bands , groups of bands into cepstral coef you know , local sort of local cepstral coefficients that it 's not that great to do it if it 's noisy . phd a: So that that 's one reason maybe we could combine s some something to improve SNR a little bit , first stage , professor c: Yeah . phd d: What was your point about about colored noise there ? phd a: Oh , the colored noise  phd d: Yeah . phd a: the colored noise the the v the signal subspace approach has  , it it actually depends on inverting the matrices . phd a:  it has a it 's It doesn't behave very well if it is not positive definite ak It works very well with white noise because we know for sure that it has a positive definite . phd a: So the way they get around is like they do an inverse filtering , first of the colo colored noise professor c: Yeah . phd a: and then finally when you reconstruct the speech back , you do this filtering again .  if you sort of you do the s spectral subtraction , that also gets rid phd a: Yeah . professor c: and then you then then add a little bit l noise noise addition  , that sort of what J JRASTA does , in a way . professor c: If you look at what JRASTA doing essentially i i it 's equivalent to sort of adding a little adding a little noise , phd a: Huh ?  - huh . And maybe we well we find some people so that  , agree to maybe work with us , and they have implementation of VTS techniques so it 's  , Vector Taylor Series that are used to mmm ,  f to model the transformation between clean cepstra and noisy cepstra . Well , if you take the standard model of channel plus noise , it 's it 's a nonlinear eh  , transformation in the cepstral domain . phd d: And  , there is a way to approximate this using  , first - order or second - order Taylor Series and it can be used for  , getting rid of the noise and the channel effect . professor c: Who is doing this ? phd d:  w working in the cepstral domain ? So there is one guy in Grenada , phd b: Yeah , in Grenada one of my friend . professor c: Who 's the guy in Grenada ? phd d: phd b: Jose Carlos Segura . professor c: Yeah , so at any rate , you 're looking general , standing back from it , looking at ways to combine one form or another of  , noise removal , with with these other things we have , phd d:   But for sure there 's required to that requires to re - check everything else , and re - optimize the other things professor c: Oh yeah .  , professor c: Well one of the seems like one of the things to go through next week when Hari 's here , phd d: I professor c: cuz Hari 'll have his own ideas too or I guess not next week , phd d:  - huh . professor c: week and a half , will be sort of go through these alternatives , what we 've seen so far , and come up with some game plans .  one would be , you look at a few things very quickly , you pick on something that looks like it 's promising and then everybody works really hard on the same different aspects of the same thing . Another thing would be to have t to to pick two pol two plausible things , and and you know , have t sort of two working things for a while until we figure out what 's better , phd d:   professor c: and then , you know , but , w  , he 'll have some ideas on that too . phd a: The other thing is to ,  Most of the speech enhancement techniques have reported results on small vocabulary tasks . But we we going to address this Wall Street Journal in our next stage , which is also going to be a noisy task so s very few people have reported something on using some continuous speech at all . So , there are some  , I was looking at some literature on speech enhancement applied to large vocabulary tasks and spectral subtraction doesn't seems to be the thing to do for large vocabulary tasks . And it 's Always people have shown improvement with Wiener filtering and maybe subspace approach over spectral subtraction everywhere . But if we if we have to use simple spectral subtraction , we may have to do some optimization to make it work @ @ . professor c: So they 're making there Somebody 's generating Wall Street Journal with additive artificially added noise or something ? phd a: Yeah , yeah . professor c: Sort of a sort of like what they did with TI - digits , and ? phd a: Yeah . professor c: And then they 're they 're  , generating HTK scripts to phd a: Yeah . There are they have there is no I don't know if they are converging on HTK or are using some Mississippi State , professor c: Mis - Mississippi State maybe , phd a: yeah . professor c: well we 've Yeah , it 's true for the additive noise , y artificially added noise we 've always used small vocabulary too . But for n there 's been noisy speech this larv large vocabulary that we 've worked with in Broadcast News . professor c: and some of the focus conditions were noisy and and phd a: It had additive n professor c: But we but we didn't do spectral subtraction . We were doing our funny stuff , right ? We were doing multi multi  , multi - stream and and so forth . professor c: and and  , that we have  , for the  , the quote - unquote noisy data there is just noisy and reverberant actually . And that 's what most o again , most of our work has been done with that , with with  , connected digits . professor c: but  , we have recognition now with some of the continuous speech , large vocabulary continuous speech , using Switchboard  , Switchboard recognizer , phd a: Yeah . You just take the Switchboard trained ? Yeah , professor c: That 's that 's what we 're doing , phd a: yeah . professor c: but we 're hop  , actually  , Dave and I were just talking earlier today about maybe at some point not that distant future , trying some of the techniques that we 've talked about on , some of the large vocabulary data .  , I guess no one had done yet done test one on the distant mike using  , the SRI recognizer and , phd f: I don't not that I know of . professor c: You 'll see a little smoke coming up from the the CPU or something trying to trying to do it , phd f: That 's right professor c: but  , yeah . But , you 're right that that that 's a real good point , that  , we we don't know yeah , what if any of these ta I guess that 's why they 're pushing that in the  in the evaluation . Anything else going on ? at you guys ' end , phd b: I don't have good result , with the inc including the new parameters , professor c: or ? phd b: I don't have good result . phd a: With what what other new p new parameter ? grad g: You 're talking about your voicing ? professor c: Yeah . professor c: seeing as how Sunil , phd b: I tried to include another new parameter to the traditional parameter , professor c: yeah . phd b: that , like , the auto - correlation , the R - zero and R - one over R - zero phd a:   phd b: and another estimation of the var the variance of the difference for of the spec si  , spectrum of the signal and and the spectrum of time after filt mel filter bank . phd b: and you have the on the other side you have the output of the mel filter bank . phd b: You can extend the coefficient of the mel filter bank and obtain an approximation of the spectrum of the signal . phd b: because , suppose we we think that if the variance is high , maybe you have n  , noise . phd b: To to To The idea is to found another feature for discriminate between voice sound and unvoice sound . And I did experiment I need to change to obtain this new feature I need to change the size the window size size . phd b: And I do I did two type of experiment to include this feature directly with the with the other feature and to train a neural network to select it voice - unvoice - silence silence phd a: Unvoiced . It 's neve e e sometime it 's worse , sometime it 's a little bit better , but not significantly . phd a: is it with TI - digits , or with ? phd b: And No , I work with eh , Italian and Spanish basically . phd b: And if I don't y use the neural network , and use directly the feature the results are worse . professor c:  we 've had these discussions before , and and one of the things that struck me was that  , about this line of thought that was particularly interesting to me was that we  whenever you condense things , in an irreversible way , you throw away some information . And , that 's mostly viewed on as a good thing , in the way we use it , because we wanna suppress things that will cause variability for  particular , phonetic units . And so the question is , can we figure out if there 's something we 've thrown away that we shouldn't have . So , when they were looking at the difference between the filter bank and the FFT that was going into the filter bank , I was thinking \" oh , OK , so they 're picking on something they 're looking on it to figure out noise , or voice voiced property whatever . But for me sort of the interesting thing was , \" well , but is there just something in that difference which is useful ? \" So another way of doing it , maybe , would be just to take the FFT  , power spectrum , and feed it into a neural network , phd b: To know professor c: and then use it , you know , in combination , or alone , or or whatever phd f: Wi - with what targets ? phd a: Voiced , unvoiced is like professor c: no . professor c: No the just the same same way we 're using  , the same way that we 're using the filter bank . And , you know , maybe if it 's used in combination , it will get at something that we 're missing . And maybe , you know , using , orth you know , KLT , or  , adding probabilities , all th all the different ways that we 've been playing with , that we would let the essentially let the neural network determine what is it that 's useful , that we 're missing here . professor c: Well , that 's probably why y i it would be unlikely to work as well by itself , but it might help in combination . professor c: But I I I have to tell you , I can't remember the conference , but , I think it 's about ten years ago , I remember going to one of the speech conferences and and  , I saw within very short distance of one another a couple different posters that showed about the wonders of some auditory inspired front - end or something , and a couple posters away it was somebody who compared one to  , just putting in the FFT and the FFT did slightly better . professor c: but again we have these wonderful statistical mechanisms for quantifying that a that variability , and you know , doing something reasonable with it . professor c: So , It - it 's same , you know , argument that 's gone both ways about  , you know , we have these data driven filters , in LDA , and on the other hand , if it 's data driven it means it 's driven by things that have lots of variability , and that are necessarily not necessarily gonna be the same in training and test , so , in some ways it 's good to have data driven things , and in some ways it 's bad to have data driven things . So , phd a: Yeah , d professor c: part of what we 're discovering , is ways to combine things that are data driven than are not . professor c: so anyway , it 's just a thought , that that if we if we had that maybe it 's just a baseline  , which would show us \" well , what are we really getting out of the filters \" , or maybe i i probably not by itself , but in combination , phd d:   professor c: you know , maybe there 's something to be gained from it , and let the But , you know , y you 've only worked with us for a short time , maybe in a year or two you w you will actually come up with the right set of things to extract from this information . phd a: What one one  p one thing is like what before we started using this VAD in this Aurora , the th what we did was like , I I guess most of you know about this , adding this additional speech - silence bit to the cepstrum and training the  on that . phd a: That is just a binary feature and that seems to be improving a lot on the SpeechDat - Car where there is a lot of noise but not much on the TI - digits . So , a adding an additional feature to distin to discriminate between speech and nonspeech was helping . phd d: Wait I I 'm sorry ? phd a: Yeah , we actually added an additional binary feature to the cepstrum , just the baseline . Well , in in the case of TI - digits it didn't actually give us anything , because there wasn't any f anything to discriminate between speech , phd d: Yeah . But anyway the question is even more , is within speech , can we get some features ? Are we drop dropping information that can might be useful within speech , phd a: OK . professor c: And it 's particularly more relevant now since we 're gonna be given the endpoints . phd a: There was a paper in ICASSP this ICASSP over the  extracting some higher - order  , information from the cepstral coefficients and I forgot the name . Some is some harmonics I don't know , I can I can pull that paper out from ICASSP . phd a: It wa it was taking the ,  It was about finding the higher - order moments of Yeah . professor c: Yeah , phd a: And I 'm not sure about whether it is the higher - order moments , or professor c: cumulants , yeah . professor c: Yeah , but again You could argue that th that 's exactly what the neural network does . professor c: So n neural network  , is in some sense equivalent to computing , you know , higher - order moments of what you phd a: trying to f to Moments , yeah . I can I can just  , share a little bit Sunil hasn't hasn't heard about  , what I 've been doing . grad g: so , I told you I was I was I was getting prepared to take this qualifier exam . So basically that 's just , trying to propose  , your next your your following years of of your PHD work , trying trying to find a project to to define and and to work on . So , I 've been , looking into , doing something about r  , speech recognition using acoustic events . So , the idea is you have all these these different events , for example voicing , nasality , R - coloring , you know burst or noise , frication , that kinda stuff , building robust  , primary detectors for these acoustic events , and using the outputs of these robust detectors to do speech recognition .  , and , these these primary detectors , will be , inspired by , you know , multi - band techniques , doing things , similar to Larry Saul 's work on , graphical models to to detect these these , acoustic events . And , so I I been I been thinking about that and some of the issues that I 've been running into are , exactly what what kind of acoustic events I need , what  , what acoustic events will provide a a good enough coverage to in order to do the later recognition steps . And , also , once I decide a set of acoustic events , h how do I how do I get labels ? Training data for for these acoustic events . And , then later on down the line , I can start playing with the the models themselves , the the primary detectors .  , so , I kinda see like , after after building the primary detectors I see  , myself taking the outputs and feeding them in , sorta tandem style into into a  , Gaussian mixtures  back - end , and doing recognition . grad g: professor c: By by the way , the voiced - unvoiced version of that for instance could tie right in to what Carmen was looking at . professor c: you know , if you if a multi - band approach was helpful as as I think it is , it seems to be helpful for determining voiced - unvoiced , grad g:   And so , this this past week  , I 've been  , looking a little bit into  , TRAPS  , and doing doing TRAPS on on these e events too , just , seeing seeing if that 's possible .  , and  , other than that , I was kicked out of I - house for living there for four years . professor c: or , no ? grad g: well , s s som something like that . professor c: Suni - i d ' you v did  did you find a place ? phd a: no professor c: Is that out of the way ? phd a: not yet .  , yesterday I called up a lady who ha who will have a vacant room from May thirtieth and she said she 's interviewing two more people . And then , you 're coming back  phd a: i  , I I p I plan to be here on thirty - first . professor c: Thirty - first , phd a: Yeah , well if there 's a house available or place to professor c: OK . professor c: They 're available , and they 'll be able to get you something , so worst comes to worst we 'll put you up in a hotel for for for a while phd a: Yeah . grad e: You know , if you 're in a desperate situation and you need a place to stay , you could stay with me for a while . professor c: Do y wanna say anything about You you actually been  , last week you were doing this stuff with Pierre , you were you were mentioning . Is that that something worth talking about , or ? grad e: it 's Well , it I don't think it directly relates .  , well , so , I was helping a speech researcher named Pierre Divenyi and he 's int He wanted to  , look at  , how people respond to formant changes , I think . So he he created a lot of synthetic audio files of vowel - to - vowel transitions , and then he wanted a psycho - acoustic  , spectrum . And he wanted to look at  , how the energy is moving over time in that spectrum and compare that to the to the listener tests . And to  he he t wanted to track the peaks so he could look at how they 're moving . I found the roots of the  , LPC polynomial to , track the peaks in the , PLP LPC spectra . phd a: well there is aligned spectral pairs , is like the the Is that the aligned s professor c: It 's a r root LPC , of some sort . phd a: Oh , it 's like line sp professor c: Except I think what they call line spectral pairs they push it towards the unit circle , don't they , phd a: Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . But what we 'd used to do w when I did synthesis at National Semiconductor twenty years ago , the technique we were playing with initially was was taking the LPC polynomial and and  , finding the roots . It wasn't PLP cuz Hynek hadn't invented it yet , but it was just LPC , and  , we found the roots of the polynomial , And th When you do that , sometimes they 're f they 're what most people call formants , sometimes they 're not . professor c:  Formant tracking with it can be a little tricky cuz you get these funny values in in real speech , phd f: So you just You typically just get a few roots ? professor c: but . phd f: something like that ? professor c: And it depends on the order that you 're doing , but . So , if @ @ Every root that 's Since it 's a real signal , the LPC polynomial 's gonna have real coefficients . So I think that means that every root that is not a real root is gonna be a c complex pair , phd f:   So for each And if you look at that on the unit circle , one of these one of the members of the pair will be a positive frequency , one will be a negative frequency , I think . So I just So , f for the I 'm using an eighth - order polynomial and I 'll get three or four of these pairs professor c: Yeah .  for real speech in real then what you end up having is , like I say , funny little things that are don't exactly fit your notion of formants all that well . grad e: Mmm , professor c: And and what  in in what we were doing , which was not so much looking at things , it was OK phd d: I professor c: because it was just a question of quantization .  , we were just you know , storing It was We were doing , stored speech , quantization . professor c: But but  , in your case  , you know phd d: Actually you have peaks that are not at the formant 's positions , but they are lower in energy grad e: But there 's some of that , yes . phd f: If this is synthetic speech can't you just get the formants directly ?  h how is the speech created ? grad e: It was created from a synthesizer , and  phd f: Wasn't a formant synthesizer was it ? professor c: I bet it it might have may have been grad e: I d d this professor c: but maybe he didn't have control over it or something ? grad e: In in fact w we we could get , formant frequencies out of the synthesizer , as well . And , w one thing that the , LPC approach will hopefully give me in addition , is that I I might be able to find the b the bandwidths of these humps as well . grad e: but I don't think there 's a g a really good reason not to  , get the formant frequencies from the synthesizer instead . professor c: Yeah , so the actual So you 're not getting the actual formants per se . professor c: You 're getting something that is is  , af strongly affected by the PLP model . So it 's a little It 's It 's It 's sort of sort of a different thing . i Ordinarily , in a formant synthesizer , the bandwidths as well as the ban  , formant centers are phd f: Yeah . professor c: that 's Somewhere in the synthesizer that was put in , as as what you grad e:   professor c: But but yeah , you view each complex pair as essentially a second - order section , which has , band center and band width , and  ,  But . So , yeah , you 're going back today and then back in a week I guess , phd a: Yeah "

        "Query": "What were the thoughts of the Project Manager and the Industrial Designer regarding the energy source for the project, and why was the idea of using solar energy rejected?",
        "Summary": "The Project Manager expressed a preference for a disposable remote control that does not have a battery compartment and relies on predetermined battery life. The idea of using permanent batteries was also proposed. On the other hand, the Industrial Designer initially suggested rechargeable energy sources and later proposed a combination of solar and conventional batteries. This would allow the remote to use light as an energy source during the day and switch to the battery at night. However, the convenience of solar energy at night and the cost implications were questioned by the Industrial Designer.",
        "Article": " I did took the minutes from the first meeting and I'll show them to you in a moment .  I know each of you have a presentation and  in thinking about the forty minutes , I thought it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes ,  each of you having about seven minutes or maybe a little more , maybe a little less for your pre presentations and a little discussion , because there's I happen to have been told there were some new project requirements and we have to make some  decision on what functions it will have .  and after the meeting there'll be things to be done and as you can see it says we get to get lunch ,  and then some more individual work and then putting minutes away and individual actions . I opened the meeting , the product was developed  and reviewed , and we talked about the financial end of it .  and it had some implications ,  the four million sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons , bright colours and some of the influence of the Japanese . And we closed early so you could then proceed with your research and getting your reports together for tod this meeting Anybody have any questions on those minutes ? Are they complete , did they discuss everything that we covered last time ? 'Kay . industrial designer:  I think so , project manager: Did I miss something ? industrial designer: we we we talked about the the individual roles that we each had as well . I'm afraid I incorporated that when I said who was present , but yes , we did , industrial designer: Okay . project manager: and we did a little bit of  team building of  of making the pictures , marketing: Okay , I accept the minutes . One of the the biggest issues I found about  from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell four million of these  remote controls and I think that this is an opportunity to really take Real Reaction in the direction of of similar of handheld tools that have been used and are used by many of us and to kind of bring the remote control into the si same realm as an accessible  useful electronic device , as opposed to something that is lost in the couch and what have you . So  my main goal here is to re-envision the remote control in in this context and to think about menu functionality and current technology and the fact that it could be interactive with other tools .  some of the research  in the market has shown that people really are not happy with remote controls as they are now , and  that means we do need to make some decisions about what what keys or or buttons on the on the remote control to perhaps keep and and what ones to discard . And if we devote some energy into this , I think the  recent productions of Real Reaction , the I go everywhere power and the high definition D_V_D_ players although it makes immediate sense to have our remote control interact with these , I think we can also use this as a platform to make it interact with other tools . And  in fact I think the high definition D_V_D_ players and all of this will come along in the  will only benefit from the positive feedback from our well designed tool .  fifty percent I think of all these  numbers the most important is fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons . And eighty percent of users , and if we think about this there are a lot of  television , D_V_D_ , stereo remote control users out there , eighty percent would spend more money on a remote control that looks fancy . industrial designer: Could can I ask where these figures come from , is this market research we've marketing:  it was market research and there were a hundred people in the room , so eighty out of a hundred said they would spend more money . project manager: Now in between , as the Project Manager , they sent me an email from the powers that be industrial designer: project manager: and the internet is coming in as important , but that they want this remote control to only be for T_V_  with incorporating the corporate image , colour and slogan . Well I think we can I I think we can really focus on this remote and and again bring the Real Reaction  brand in in and and get some positive marketing for our other tools , even if we directly don't  advertise for the I go everywhere line . marketing: Now the early adopters , those of us who grew up with technology and  luck lucky for us have the  cash to to pay for it , the young age group without the mortgages and responsibilities , ninety one percent of them would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . Very interesting , I I leave this up to the group to decide if we wanna use this  if and you know , the the designers , project manager:  . marketing: but ninety one percent , fifteen to twenty five project manager: Is that a large enough target market to target it ? marketing: Well , I I I think especially in terms of growth , I think this would be a very smart group to target .  s three quarters of the next age group , twenty five to thirty five are interested , and  with the technologies improving , if we can get these  project manager: In real numbers , does the ninety one percent and the seventy six percent translate to ex in excess of the four million ? marketing: Yeah . But would you pay more and does it work and is it approachable and and did I know that it was it was an project manager:  . industrial designer:  marketing: I don't know if speech recognition should be  should be included , project manager:  . marketing: but I think it's an interesting I think that maybe shows more about  being open to technology . user interface:  it definitely needs  a lot more research marketing: Shall I go back ? user interface: on like how much more it would be and any , you know , existing examples , marketing: Yeah , yeah . industrial designer: How d I'm wondering how how ou how our target price compares with the the typical price of these things . I expect an Industrial Designer should know that , but if we're aiming to to build this thing for twelve Euros fifty ,  is that a lot or a little ? marketing: Exactly .  I I I  did not receive any information on that , but I think the competition , sussing out what other people are doing and what's in the pipeline is very very important , because  there is a question about do you want an L_C_D_ screen and and that wasn't responded to , but  some of the larger remotes do have screens where you can navigate , you know , so it turns into something  perhaps you all have seen  the Osbournes where Ozzy Osbourne is is attempting to manage his super entertainment system with something that looks like a  a small tray . marketing: You know , project manager: marketing: it's I a and I think , you know industrial designer: He must be w one of a s small population . But I think the key is to get the early adopters , people who are familiar with technology and and  they'll be project manager: But we're not looking at whether they're early adopters on that screen , marketing:  . I yes , and I'm making and I'm making the the   leap that people who are familiar younger people are l are more familiar with technology than than older people . marketing: I think the most important thing is an attractive streamlined remote control and to be extraordinarily reductionist , power , channel , volume and everything else is is  up to the designers . industrial designer: And if you want it to go into slide show mode , it's that little button there . user interface: Can I not just  do each one in order ? industrial designer: I you can if you like , it it that that just sets it up to do a p a p project manager: There we are . user interface: That ? industrial designer: Left , left a bit , left a bit , that one , yep .  well I think first off , basically I do agree with what Sarah has defined as as  your personal preferences,yeah . And what we all need to discuss is whether we want these functions  pretty much the same as what existing remotes have . If we can build on this with the speech recognition , that's not something I'd thought about at all , but it's also something we can discuss . user interface:  and and I presume we can miss out the functions really to to a video or D_V_D_ remote control , if this is only gonna be a , you know , satellite , cable , T_V_ remote control . It also has seems to have channel up and channel down , which is which is more what you'd expect from a , you know , like a Sky or cable remote control project manager:  .  but I think we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the right , which has it also has play , stop and pause and everything , I don't think we need them at all . I think we just need channel selection , volume up , volume down and I think an an enter function where you can access it's not like teletext , but along the same lines , access things on the screen .  not related to the internet one that you mentioned , because that'd be far outside our budget and what we want this to do . user interface: So it really exceed the requirements , 'cause the requirements really are just want to be able to change channels and functions , which is more a text on the screen thing than  than actual buttons project manager: Okay . user interface: o I was thinking something some smooth , sleek , little remote control with big user-friendly buttons and  a menu that you can access . user interface: But we could go back to the pictures of the  , what're they called ? The pictures of the remote controls and possibly discuss what we think about them , marketing: Or if user interface: but maybe should hear what Kate has to say first . marketing: Maybe afterwards we could do a  whiteboard with that your the one on the right as a as a basis . project manager: I think the white that one on the right is , as well as less cluttered , marketing: user interface: Definitely less cluttered and  but still it's project manager: It's there user interface: Sorry project manager: but it's user interface: I was just I'll just  resume something else I was gonna say . user interface: I I I really think we need to  not only possibly even materials , like the type of plastic used , but everything including size and shape of buttons , positioning of buttons , the actual shape of the hand-held device , colours , just every e yeah , everything to do with this has to be revolutionised . Okay  , now I wanna bring us down to earth again I'm afraid and talk about the actual practicalities of how the thing needs to work .  basically I've been doing a little bit of web-based research , and if I had a design team , I would've been discussing my ideas with 'em . But the the net result is that I've come up with a first cut for the working design that I'd like to discuss with you . And the the basic components we've got to build in for our twelve Euros fifty are  an energy source , the user interface and which will  in incorporate  an integrated circuit that actually composes the message  based on what the which buttons the user presses , we turn that into a message ,  and then we need a sending mechanism to send it to the receiver . I would have have hoped to  do you a pretty PowerPoint slide of  my first cut design , but unfortunately the technology defeated me , so if you'll bear with me I'll do it on the whiteboard . And the main components in there are the the th the chip that actually has the intelligence of the machine that translates button presses into a message , which it then transfers to some sending mechanism , which encodes it and sends the message to the receiver . But those things as long as we can get those components , the block , that that rectangle for the user interface , is where the user comes in of what what does it look like ? What do the buttons look like ?  what does it feel like ? That's where the user interface is really coming into its own . project manager: The technical end is what's actually gonna be in there , but also it has to be easy enough to change or repair if something goes wrong . For example the battery energy source or  what if the chip , for whatever reason , breaks down after a certain amount of time , do you just replace it ?  is there any  because it may be in the same area with several other user interfaces , like for D_V_D_s , movies , whatever .  does it have to have a a way of being segregated from the others , in a different frequency or something ? industrial designer: Well I may be wrong here , but I'd been thinking of this device as being a a cheap mass-produced device . industrial designer:  that's that's , you know , that's almost one in every tenth household or whatever it is . industrial designer: you just if it goes wrong you chuck it out , and that's why I'm a bit concerned . I like the idea of speech recognition , that's a great idea , but I'm not convinced we can put it into this box for the price that we need gonna need to hit . marketing: Do we have  ki some idea of how much it would cost to create a device that has these basic elements ? user interface: Isn't that your job ? marketing: Because then project manager: Oh . industrial designer: I'm I'm I'm hoping that my personal coach is gonna give me some advice on that , if you're asking me , marketing: I I don't believe I know ,  . industrial designer: but marketing: Be because then we would ha ha figure out how much we had to play with in terms of user interface and this look and feel idea . user interface: It does it does seem as if we're just to do something really simple and mass-produced , the which is pretty much the same as these existing models , marketing: user interface: just maybe a little bit more inspired , marketing: Inspired ? user interface: but basically just the same . user interface: Although what what  suddenly came into my head is , you know how they always take two A_A_ batteries which which is really not very efficient at all . Could it be possible to have  , you know , like a rechargeable internal battery , like , well , like an M_P_ three player does ? With that you could jus or a mobile phone or whatever . user interface: You could you know , you just plug into a power source for a couple of hours , and then it's recharged for ages and ages and ages , and you don't have to worry with replacing A_A_ batteries , marketing: Well user interface: which are marketing: that has another element , which is if every time you're done using the remote you put it on a charger , then you then it has a place . marketing: Yeah , but it also has a place , user interface: And it's not stuck down the back of the sofa . user interface: But then again I d I don't know if this is within our price range or not . industrial designer: Well I  think that's a very interesting idea , but  I'm not a very good industrial designer and I don't know much about what these things cost . industrial designer: Well solar may not be so good when you're watching T_V_ in the night , marketing: Yeah , yeah . user interface: Well it is just so annoying how marketing: Depen project manager: It would have to sor store up the energy marketing:  . user interface: No , but just a rechargeable internal battery would probably  it might cost more to at first to develop and to install , marketing: - user interface: but for long-term use it'll be so much more convenient and economic than fiddling around trying to replace chunky A_A_ batteries and not having any in your kitchen drawer marketing: user interface: and industrial designer: So do you think we might make that a selling point if it was something that we found we could afford to develop ? user interface: you know f marketing: Definitely , project manager:  . marketing: 'cause I'm thinking in terms of   the loss and breakage of  remotes , how much of that is is to do with it not really having a  a home , a  a nest , a place to live , user interface:  . marketing: So if you can dock it ,  you know , you could s argue that this is project manager: And the dock could look very fancy and that could be your inspiration of having it looking decent . project manager: Are we agreed as to what our target group is though ? Pretty much , so that we'd be looking for the younger end . marketing: Well I I brought up some exactly , but I think you raised some good questions about are there enough of these people out there , or are they making purchasing decisions ? industrial designer:  . industrial designer: Yeah , marketing: You know , industrial designer: I was wondering that , marketing: these are the industrial designer: because I ag I agree that there there're people with  how can I put it , more money than sense and who are liable to buy something new , project manager: I I s usually put more money than brains . industrial designer: but Bu but what I was gonna say was , although they they may be buying  , you know , personal music devices and all that , marketing: Oh oh oh I'll make a note of that , Kate . industrial designer: are they necessarily buying T_V_ remote controls ? Because they probably live in a household that has a T_V_ if they're at the lower end of the age range , marketing: Yeah . marketing: It might be good to know   who , you know , who's actually buying televisions and are we in a   s region where people have more than one television in a home ? industrial designer:  . I think we've got a big hill to climb here , haven't we ?  we've gotta persuade people who've got a remote control 'cause it came with the telly that they should buy our product instead . project manager: Or do we s make sure that it goes to the man through the manufacturer ? We sell to the manufacturer as the remote that goes with it . project manager: What would be a more efficient way of doing it ? marketing: Yeah , and and some of our D_V_D_ players incidentally have them , because we have the relationship with our own department , but moreover we need to to go for the the manufacturers . user interface: We're not gonna get any resolutions by the end of the day , project manager: Probably not . Our functions , we've so far decided , I think , that power , channel , volume make it attractive . It has to have big user-friendly buttons and sh n definitely we wanna be inspired that the current styles are just plain awful . marketing: Do we need  let me project manager: Is that agreeable to everyone ? marketing: Br actually ,  industrial designer: industrial designer: Do you want the gizmo ? marketing: yeah , which might project manager: Throw some light on that . project manager:  actually we're , you know , we are almost a half hour out of the forty minutes , so we have to get close to finishing . marketing: Okay , I I my only comment is I think maybe  we could somehow include an enter key in like a power key if power power was enter and pow that was my only just really in terms of streamlining . Again , you know , project manager: Is that okay with you ? marketing: thinking of menus or user interface: Sorry , project manager: Would that industrial designer: H how does that work ? user interface: I was miles away . industrial designer: How so so how does that work , user interface: I was re I was reading the chart to be honest . industrial designer: how do you avoid switching the thing off when you actually wanna press enter ? marketing: if you're pressing enter , the the thing would already be on , and so maybe  when you press power , initially it turns it on , press power again and use that as an enter  project manager: Then you'd have to have an off te off key . marketing: so you press power after you've  well I was thinking maybe you to turn it off you'd have to press power twice in succession , industrial designer: Okay , yep , marketing: and maybe power follows something like a channel up channel down power , and then that would make that choice . industrial designer: It's not getting a bit complicated ? Could granny do this , marketing: Well industrial designer: or are we just not aiming at granny ? marketing: Or y yeah . user interface: Who's got an iPod then ? industrial designer: marketing: Yeah , project manager:  . Anyway ,  that was the only comment about  some of the the decisions people have made , what's most important . user interface: Yeah , things like screen settings and audio settings , I would generally do them on the actual television itself , marketing: Exactly . user interface: like here you have a you know , a little flap th with a little control panel on the actual box itself . user interface: I I wouldn't know how to do it using a remote control , marketing: Yeah . project manager: I guess easy to use is the other thing that we want 'em to be able to do . project manager: As you said , you know , don't make it too hard for the granny . project manager:  so are we agreed then of those things ? And let's go back to agenda marketing: D project manager: and hook me up . industrial designer: How do you do that ? How do you make it do both ? project manager:  you have to keep doing the financi the the F_N_ and F_ eight to five minutes to finish , industrial designer: Ah okay , it toggles through , project manager: thank you a lot for telling me .  will be completed q questionnaire ,  then we'll have some time for individual work to continue our research  and I'll put some minutes of this meeting together .  your individual assignments are for  Kate to do the components , for you , Steph , to do the user interface and for you the trend-watching .  and you'd mentioned I I was just gonna say , could you reiterate the new project requirements , project manager: Okay . marketing: because it they were it has to be for a T_V_ , just to keep myself project manager:  the teletext is outdated , industrial designer: So we're still in meeting , aren't we ? project manager: the internet is important , marketing: Yeah , I think I've project manager: it's only to be for a T_V_ and it must include the corporate image , colour and slogan  marketing: Okay . Sorry , what what actually are these is that the yellow and black ? project manager: It doesn't tell me "

        "Summary": "The group aims to have the question answering mock-up and transcriber interface ready for the DARPA meeting in July, along with available data. Speaker fe008 is currently working on ensuring clean and properly coded transcripts, while speaker mn014's multi-channel speech/non-speech segmenter is being utilized. To save time, speaker mn005 will only mark regions of overlapping speech in the transcribed data. The task of extracting digits will be assigned to the person working on acoustics for the Meeting Recorder project.",
        "Article": "Item 2, then, is a further evidence session, number four, on our inquiry into the status of the Welsh baccalaureate qualification. I'm very pleased to welcome Dafydd Evans, who is chair, ColegauCymru, and chief executive officer of Gr\u0175p Llandrillo Menai; Kay Martin, principal of Cardiff and Vale College, also representing ColegauCymru; Nick Brazil, who is deputy principal, Gower College Swansea, also representing ColegauCymru; Dr Rachel Bowen, director of policy and development at ColegauCymru; and Ed Evans, who is the director and secretary of the Civil Engineering Contractors Association. If it's okay with you, we'll go straight into questions, and the first ones are from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian. dafydd evans: Could I start and then open it up? Thank you very much for the opportunity to give evidence. But just to give you the context, I think, if you were asking about the vast majority of subjects what the view of ColegauCymru\u00a0would be, it would be quite unanimous, but I think on the Welsh bac\u00a0there is a difference of opinion, and I'm sure you'll hear those differences on the panel before you today. To answer the specific question, no, I don't think that employers have a clear understanding of what the Welsh bac\u00a0means or what it includes. Personally I don't think that even the title of the Welsh bac\u00a0is helpful, because it doesn't say what's happening in the tin. So, I think the skills challenge certificate is a better title, and is something that people understand a lot better than the Welsh bac. So, no, I don't think that employers understand the value or what we're trying to achieve through the Welsh bac\u00a0at present. dafydd evans: Yes, it's a huge problem, but not only to employers, but also to parents and young people, of course. That, certainly, where there are larger employers, who've got people who are able to follow policy developments across the education spectrum, they may have more capacity to follow changes, get up to date with how Welsh education is evolving. And while there are lots of small engaged employers who have taken an interest and do understand, the vast majority are more focused on getting on with the day-to-day running of the business. And that means it's quite a challenge to understand what is the Welsh bac, what does it offer. And, certainly, when that's evolved over the past few years and there have been changes, it would have been quite difficult to keep up to date with those, I imagine. nick brazil: Could I add to that? As do many of my colleagues\u00a0within the colleges, we have a number of employer boards, which we regularly\u00a0meet with\u2014employers\u2014and I cannot think back as to how many employers say to us, 'That is what we require\u2014the Welsh bac\u2014to come and work within our industry.' Most of what they are questioning is the level of professional qualifications and the quality of skills within\u00a0those professional sectors. I think many of them believe in the vision that was set out for the Welsh bac\u00a0initially, but the Welsh bac\u00a0has turned into quite a rigorous, some would say demanding, qualification, which is putting a lot of pressure on in terms of bureaucracy, in terms of staff and the student getting all the information together at the end of the\u00a0year, and whether that's developing the skills that employers require is very questionable. And, as I said, from the employer boards that we have, very few of them understand\u00a0the Welsh bac. They certainly don't mention the Welsh bac and, as I said, are very much questioning the qualifications\u00a0that have been provided to develop the actual professional skills needed within the industries. sian gwenllian am: Kay, is that your experience? kay martin: Certainly, it's very similar, and our employers want to make sure they get the right qualification. They're having enough headache getting around the differences with apprenticeships and the levy between England and Wales, and changes to qualifications.\u00a0But they want them to get their main qualification. So, if you're an engineer, they want to get the engineering qualifications and they\u00a0want them to be literate, numerate, and they want them to have digital skills. ed evans: Do you mind if I carry on in English\u2014 sian gwenllian am: Fine. I think it's fair to say employers don't understand it, that's for sure, but I think if they did, they would really appreciate this. For my sector in particular\u2014the civil engineering sector\u2014and particularly the\u00a0contracting sector, which depends very much on pupils who have come through from a less academic background, the Welsh bac gives them that ability, I guess, not to pursue so much of an academic focus, but to test them in terms of the challenges, but also, to\u2014. And I think if it was working properly and we did have employers engaged in this, and\u00a0supporting schools and colleges to deliver it, they would actually be learning a lot more directly from industry. And I think that's the issue for me\u2014that we've not really sold this to employers to actually engage with them. All of my understanding of this is literally as a parent, and that would\u00a0be true of a lot of employers as well. So, perhaps there are differences across the sector, but I think, certainly for my sector, we would really value the growth of the Welsh baccalaureate. sian gwenllian am: What are we going to do, then, to improve employers' understanding of the Welsh bac, and whose work is it to try to persuade employers that it is worth while, if you feel that it is worth while, of course? dafydd evans: I think we need to review the qualification, and I think the voice of employers should be a key part of that review, so that employability skills and entrepreneurial skills have more of a role within\u00a0that qualification. And I think that rather than it being done by the colleges or by a qualifications\u00a0board, I think\u00a0the employers\u2014. And the only way we'll get employer buy-in is that if they feel ownership of what's being done. Because I think that's what the\u00a0vision was for the Welsh baccalaureate\u2014that it was going to improve skills for employment. The aim is an excellent one, but I think we've lost our way in terms of what we do present at the end of the day, and I think having more input from employers would be a great help. I think there are opportunities to join up employers and schools and education facilities a lot more than we do at the moment. I suppose that the bee in\u00a0my bonnet is that we are involved in lots of social value-type contracts in this sector, and that to me is a perfect opportunity to tie in employers into schools and colleges and get that time and input from them into schools in a far more co-ordinated way. They're there to serve a really good purpose, but it's become a little bit piecemeal and a little bit tokenistic, whereas the Welsh bac offers an opportunity\u2014. So, why not link up those contractual clauses, which tie in employers and feed it directly into schools so that we have a far more\u00a0structured way of getting employers into schools? At the moment it's a little bit\u2014we'll pick up the phone, we'll get a phone call, and it'll be, 'Can you come and do something for us?' It's tokenistic. We need to be far more clever in terms of how we\u00a0join these things up, and then I think you'll start to get that business input there, but let's not be ad hoc about it. kay martin: Could I just add something? We've also got several other programmes that are engaging employers really well. Career Ready is a national programme, which we use in the college and which other colleges across the UK use. That's where employers mentor students so everyone has a mentor for the whole of the two years of the programme, from employment, and they all go out for at least six weeks' internship. So, they don't go for a day's work placement or two days\u2014they go for six-week internships. We've got BTEC learners who have gone through that programme and gone into law degrees with Freshfields law in London, which is one of the top law firms in the world. So, there are lots of other programmes as well, and perhaps there's a way of joining it all up together. But, in the college, we've got several different programmes going on with employers and the Welsh bac is one of them, but it's not the one that engages employers the best, certainly in our college. sian gwenllian am: So, do we get rid of it? lynne neagle am: You don't need to answer that. [Laughter.] sian gwenllian am: if there are so many other programmes helping anyway, why do we need it? nick brazil: I think that is a very good question, but I will go back to Ed's point, which I think was a very important point, which is that the initial vision for the Welsh bac\u2014I think when we go back a number of years\u2014was a really good, good vision for the Welsh bac. It was going to be an overarching qualification that developed these skills, and certainly employability skills, and I think it's lost its way since then. It's become a qualification and all the realms around becoming a qualification, and it's become very much focused on outcomes rather than necessarily skills. But you've got to listen to what Kay said as well: there are programmes already out there. So, why are we focusing one way when there are already programmes that work extremely well? I will go to the enhanced programmes, enhanced engineering and programmes that we are running within our college and that I know run in other colleges, which are much, much more focused on skills, much more focused in linking with industry, and they work extremely well. So, I think the question is: have we got programmes already in place, and do we need another one on top? But the vision initially for the Welsh bac, as I said, I will always be positive about. It's important for you to understand that although we always try and put the learner first, funding does drive behaviours, and the Welsh bac is fundable; Career Ready isn't. So, yes, there are options out there, but because we're so focused on qualifications and we will only fund qualifications, that drives certain behaviours, and\u00a0I think you need as a committee to be very much aware of that. suzy davies am: Yes, but that was very useful information for us, because bearing in mind what Nick Brazil said\u2014that the vision of this was created as almost something that could have the status of something like a Duke of Edinburgh award without necessarily being a compulsory qualification; what was important was that the learners got the skills.\u00a0However, if getting the qualification is how you get the money, then you can see why schools\u2014well, and indeed colleges\u2014might be tempted to go for it. What are your views on how well the Welsh bac, at all levels, helps to prepare learners for employment? We've spoken to quite a few learners, and again we've had variable opinions coming back, so it's quite how they, from their perspective\u2014. dafydd evans: I think that one of the problems is that there are a number of priorities. And one of the problems that we have is that we have a number of children coming in to the colleges, and they need to resit their GCSEs\u2014in maths, English and Welsh. It's a valid priority for the Welsh Government for everyone to get a\u00a0C grade in the core subjects. And so there's no room for everything in the curriculum somehow\u2014no room in the funding or also in terms of the time and the capacity of the learner to be able to do that number of qualifications. We've given priority to GCSE\u00a0resits\u00a0rather than doing the Welsh bac\u00a0at present. So, at levels 1 and 2, there are fewer and fewer doing 1 and 2 in the baccalaureate because they're resitting their GCSEs, and there is much more use of the Welsh bac at level 3, and A-level, and vocational level 3. nick brazil: Can I just add to that? I think, again, there's a misconception. The Welsh bac is a combination of qualifications; it's not just one qualification\u2014it's a combination. So, to develop the employability skills obviously is a key part, and developing the skills for employment is a key part. But when you are focused, if you are a learner, on developing or achieving certain qualifications to make up the Welsh bac\u2014for example, resits, your main qualification, plus your work for the Welsh bac, which is the skills challenge certificate as well\u2014that's a huge amount of work. And, obviously, when you're trying to achieve outcomes\u2014and we all get funded on the outcomes\u2014that becomes the priority, and sometimes then we lose the focus on the skills, which are ultimately what were supposed to be part of the development for employability. And I think it was interesting, the comment that was made about the Duke of Edinburgh\u2014I thought that's something that we need to think about. kay martin: If I could just say as well, our job in the college is to develop skills and employable people, and we use every tool in our box to do that. The Welsh bac, where it works really well, does help prepare them, I think, for employment, but it's not for everyone, because some people have to do the other things. Some people doing the equivalent of three A-levels, even in a vocational programme, it's too big for them. As you say, they're coming from schools, some of them with very few GCSEs, or they haven't got literacy and numeracy skills, they're being tested and many of them are below level 1 in terms of literacy and numeracy. So, I think it needs to be reviewed, to look at how we could make skilled and employable people. It helps prepare some people\u2014the A-level students for university\u2014but does it help my health and social care people become more skilled and employable? No, it doesn't. dr rachel bowen: And this, ultimately, has to be about what's in the best interests of learners, and a one-size-fits-all approach isn't going to work. Is there a difference in how the Welsh bac is valued by learners at the different levels that it is studied? ColegauCymru said that learners may have had a negative experience of the Welsh bac in previous study. dafydd evans: That's been a new dimension lately, I think, in that, when the Welsh bac first hit FE, we were leading the way\u2014 kay martin: Great advocates. By now, of course, they're coming to us having been through a Welsh bac experience at school, and therefore many of the learners feel that there's repeating going on then\u2014'Oh, we've done this at school already. Why are we doing it again at college?' So, I think that's a problem for us as well. So, at level 1 and level 2, it's not what we would call a crowd puller in colleges,\u00a0but at level 3 it's more, especially for A-levels, because it can help them get into university, but even for the more able and talented\u2014we were discussing this, weren't we? We have learners who do four A-levels, but they don't do the Welsh baccalaureate because they're part of the Seren network, and they are going to be applying for Oxbridge or high-level Russell Group universities. So, the Welsh bac, although it's technically universally adopted by universities, it isn't adopted by every admissions tutor in every university. So, to get into some areas, like dentistry, for example, and some of the other Seren-type activities, four A-levels is better. But in most colleges that\u00a0have A-level students it's almost compulsory to do the Welsh bac as well, but normally that would be three A-levels and the Welsh bac\u2014normally. And then ColegauCymru say that, increasingly, the Welsh bac is not being offered at post-16 national and foundation level. So, are the different levels of the Welsh bac valued differently by further education professionals? nick brazil: Yes. nick brazil: I think we've got to bear in mind when the students come to us\u2014certainly when they're level 1, level 2 learners\u2014that a number of them have come from school and\u00a0probably not done as well as they'd hoped at their GCSEs. Okay, they've come to us, they're trying to build themselves back up, build their skills back up, and adding another qualification on top, adding the Welsh bac on top, whether that's foundation or national, on top of what they have to do, which is a programme they've come and decided to do\u2014think of the pressure that increases upon them. Plus the fact is that they are resitting; they're probably having to resit GCSE English and maths as well. That's a huge volume of work for a learner who's probably come from a\u00a0low base to begin with and who hasn't achieved what they wanted to. The whole idea when we bring them in at that level is that we want to build their confidence, build them up and, hopefully, eventually they will go to the stage where maybe the Welsh bac will be beneficial to them, when they've potentially hopefully progressed to level 3. And the important point that Dafydd raised was that there's a lot of repetition there in school, pre 16 to post 16 at those levels as well. So, learners don't come in banging at the door saying, 'We want to do the Welsh bac because it's exactly the same or very similar to what we did when we were in school.' They want to see some difference, they want to see some progress, and that's not necessarily the case in the foundation and national levels. dr rachel bowen: And we know that delivery in schools is of variable quality, so obviously that impacts on how learners have experienced it and perhaps how they view it when they get to FE college. janet finch-saunders am: Okay.\u00a0A question, then, just to ColegauCymru: to what extent do you believe that universities in the main understand the value of the Welsh bac? kay martin: Well, we don't think they do, really, especially the experience we have with some of our learners to go to Russell Group universities. I talked earlier about my own daughter who was allowed to drop a grade in order to get into a Russell Group university because she had the Welsh bac as well, but it was a very paper-based exercise. But I think it is mixed, and it does depend on the admissions tutors and the areas that they're going into in universities. In some areas, and certainly the local universities around here\u2014University of South Wales, Cardiff Metropolitan University\u2014value it in a great number of subjects, particularly in sport, when our students go to Cardiff Met, and business studies, when our learners go to USW. It is valued by them and they accept it, but when people go further afield\u2014and we're always trying to push our learners beyond. lynne neagle am: Did you have a supplementary, Si\u00e2n? sian gwenllian am: Yes. A great number of our learners get into Cardiff using the Welsh baccalaureate, but would their admissions tutors prefer four A-levels? Absolutely. nick brazil: Could I jump in there? I've got to jump in there as, from the institution I'm in, we've had a long track record of getting learners into top universities. About 20 per cent of our learners go to Russell Group universities, and there is no doubt\u2014in certainly 50 per cent of those, they do not value the Welsh bac. But if they do offer an option with the Welsh bac, they say it is on top of three A2-level grades. I think the Seren programme that's been put in by the Welsh Government is looking to increase the numbers applying to top universities and top courses, but you look through the range, particularly in science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects as well, across a number and range of universities,\u00a0the Welsh bac is always added as the additional one. So, bear in mind, then, that Welsh students are fighting for places against Scottish, Northern Irish and, potentially, English students who are studying three subjects, whereas our Welsh students potentially could be doing three A2s, three A-level subjects plus the Welsh bac. And, as we talked about earlier on, the Welsh bac has evolved into quite a rigorous, you could say complicated, qualification, which puts added pressure on a learner in year 2 when they're trying to get possibly three A* grades. In relation to the first answer, it is variable, and the admissions tutors throughout a lot of universities will make different decisions, and also make the decision dependent on whether it's a facilitating subject or an enabling subject, which the Russell Group report indicates about facilitating subjects, and Welsh bac at the moment is not a facilitating subject. Because of the nature of our catchment area, there is a greater percentage of our students staying in Welsh universities, and, as Kay said, Welsh universities are much more willing to recognise the bac. But, naturally, we do have students who are looking to go out to universities in England in the Russell Group, and we're having the same experience there where there are differences between the policy that that university extols and what actually happens on the ground when students have interviews in those universities. sian gwenllian am: But in terms of Bangor and Glynd\u0175r University, there's no problem there, though. I think you've already got into this bit of the discussion, but what are your views on how comparable the Welsh bac is to other qualifications? I don't know if you've got any more comments on that. dafydd evans: Well, obviously, as we noted, it's become a very rigorous, very large qualification. And, therefore, regarding the rigour and so forth, that's absolutely fine, but I think one of the problems that you're hearing is that perhaps the Welsh bac is trying to be all things to all men. At one end of the spectrum it's trying to be a rigorous qualification that stands up to a Russell university's expectations, and on the other hand, it's trying to develop softer skills and employment skills for people going into work from a vocational area. Can the same product deliver those two outcomes? I'm certainly not sure, and perhaps we need to think: what are we trying to achieve with this qualification? julie morgan am: Right. kay martin: Yes, and earlier, we talked as well about that difference for the A-level students. For the vocational students, some things like the Career Ready programme, which is used in other colleges, and WorldSkills, you know, where all colleges have really been pushing to get more learners into WorldSkills at national and international level. And for some of our learners, particularly if we take our engineering learners, then having somebody who has competed in Europe as a tiler or an electrician would, I think, make an employer think, 'I'd better look at this person', whereas the other one\u00a0has done the Welsh bac\u2014.\u00a0I think they would look at the WorldSkills person first. So, for some of our learners, we choose that you do WorldSkills, because that is going to be more valuable for you as a skill, and to show to an employer how much extra time you've put in. So, they put a lot of time\u2014you know, to get somebody into a WorldSkills competition is not just a couple of hours a week, it isn't just the normal curriculum\u2014they have extra time. They are more able and talented vocational learners, and that is more valuable to those learners and I think it's more valid for employers than the Welsh baccalaureate. You know, it is comparable, as long as it's right for that learner's future. But if a learner wants to go into a particular sector and the Welsh bac is not accepted, it's not comparable. But, then, if it is into a certain sector and the skills are being developed in the right manner for that sector, absolutely. julie morgan am: What are the reasons why some colleges do see it as being rigorous and others don't? Why does the view vary? ed evans: Can I give perhaps an employer's perspective on that, which might be completely wrong, but it's been interesting listening to what's been said here? About a year ago, we bought the\u00a0WJEC in to speak to our employers, or a number of them, just to explain to them what the Welsh bac was about\u2014back to listening and about understanding, really, and it just was not there at all. I could see that most of the employers\u00a0there were really impressed with it once they understood what it was about and they saw the opportunities at a whole host of levels. We've kind of gone into an university discussion here, but there are school leavers leaving at 16 or 18. The skills that they bring having gone through this process I think most of the employers could get, at least in my sector, they could understand\u2014'I can see what that person can do.' But we've also seen it from university-educated people as well. Those that bring a little bit of world experience, a little bit of the Welsh bac-type of things, just become far more rounded and useful people. I can understand why there's a certain obsession, almost, with the academic side of it, but I think we lose that vocational bit at our peril, and to a certain extent we probably haven't got it in many quarters anyway. And those skills that are learnt in the Welsh bac, can they be learnt in any of the other qualifications? Because I know that Cambridge university said to us they thought, in the four A-levels that they asked for, that those skills were there. kay martin: It probably depends on the subjects that\u00a0people are studying and the combination of subjects and the institution. Generally, in college, even if they're doing A-levels, they go out on some community projects or work-related education, without the Welsh bac\u2014even if they're not doing that. dafydd evans: I think there's a real danger of us perhaps becoming overly critical here as well of the Welsh bac\u00a0in terms of\u2014I don't think it's perfect by a long way, however, learners are getting some value out of that process. Certain learners in departments where they have really worked hard to contextualise the Welsh bac\u00a0within the vocational area, within the A-level subjects that the learners are doing, are finding it very rewarding. I think what we're suggesting is there may be even better ways of doing it and better ways of explaining to people what it's about. nick brazil: On this point about the skills being developed, I think that's debatable if all the skills that are supposed to be developed in the Welsh bac\u00a0are being developed, and that's why I think there's a need to relook at it to make sure those skills are being developed fully. But I will go back to the point that I think a comparable qualification is comparable as long as it achieves the right outcome for that particular learner. If you force a learner to do something that is not necessarily going to achieve the outcome that they require in their future, is it the right thing to be doing for that learner? That's what my concern is. dr rachel bowen: I think the baccalaureate\u00a0approach is best at producing independent, inquiry-based learners who have the skills to look to teachers not as sources of information but just for guidance. That whole sort of approach about creating inquisitive young people with the skills that we've discussed, that's a real positive. The chances are that we've lost some of that by trying to fit it into being a specific qualification. suzy davies am: Yes, to both Rachel Bowen and Nick Brazil, if you don't mind. Both of you mentioned this is about skills and a piece of paper that demonstrates that you have these skills. At pre 16, would it be fair to say that there have been occasions when people have come presenting those pieces of paper but actually show none of the skills that they were supposed to have? The reason I'm asking this question, having had children who've gone through the process myself, is that in some schools, and I'm not saying all, doing the bac\u00a0is something that everybody does in the last four weeks of term, and that undermines the whole idea of the bac\u00a0anyway. Is that a fair observation? dr rachel bowen: I think it's perfectly possible for learners to reach FE college having attained the Welsh bac\u00a0under the process that you've described, and without necessarily having gone through the holistic inquiry-based independent skills that we would want to see. nick brazil: Yes, and at interview process or during an interview, or in the first week, you can see that they haven't developed those skills, and I think it is down to the variable models that have been put in place. There are lots of different models, and if you put, as I said, the model that you've described in place, there is no way, in that period of time, you're going to develop those skills. But that indicates, again, the value that people are putting on the qualification, if they are squeezing it into three or four weeks of term. lynne neagle am: Julie, did you have any more questions? julie morgan am: No, I've finished, thank you. lynne neagle am: We've got some questions now then, from Suzy, on universal adoption. suzy davies am: Well, I'm wondering if I need to ask them, really, because I think I'm getting a strong sense that you all think that universal adoption is a bad idea at this moment in time. However, I do want to test something, because we have had witnesses who say that it would be a good idea because it reduces the amount of competition and advantage that certain institutions have. So, for example, we had an indication from the union representing Welsh-speaking teachers that if the baccalaureate was universally adopted, it would remove an artificial choice, basically, for learners,\u00a0i.e. they were losing Welsh-speaking students who didn't want to do the bac to English-speaking institutions. So, I wonder if you could tell me how much the decision in your individual colleges not to offer bac\u00a0is down to the opportunity that it presents you to attract students, particularly from sixth forms, where students may be obliged to do the bac. I'd like to think that all the staff in all the colleges do what is in the best interests of the learner. In some cases, it's to go back to school, and we absolutely say, 'You need to go back to school.' If somebody comes from a Welsh-medium school, then usually I will speak to the head and make sure that we have\u00a0a programme in place, that either they're studying their programme bilingually or through the medium of Welsh, or that we make sure that they absolutely keep their Welsh language skills. We don't say, 'Come to us and you don't have to do the Welsh bac,' because if they do A-levels, we say it's compulsory, unless you're in the Seren group. Well, that's the point; it's about English-speaking students, not just Welsh\u2014. In the majority of colleges across Wales, it is absolutely not used as a recruitment tool, because most of us, as you see, we value the Welsh bac. We'd like some changes to the Welsh bac, but we value the Welsh bac\u00a0in many cases. , if a course in my college doesn't want to do the Welsh bac, they have to come and give me evidence about why they don't think it's fit and what they're going to do in place of it. So, we don't deliberately tell people, 'Come\u00a0on in and you won't have to do it.' suzy davies am: Okay, can I run that across you all, in an outburst of honesty? dafydd evans: Yes, absolutely. suzy davies am: Oh, yes, for the reasons you've given in the evidence, actually. dafydd evans: Yes, but across the whole of level 3, A-level and vocational, the Welsh bac\u00a0is an integral part of the curriculum, and it isn't an option for the student to opt out. lynne neagle am: Do you let your Seren\u00a0students opt out like they do in Cardiff and the Vale, or do they have to do it as well? dafydd evans: We've forced\u2014. nick brazil: I've got to be honest, at present, with our college, we do not ask. It's an option of one of our choices\u2014we have a large choice\u2014and I think it comes back to that fact that we're just making the assumption all learners are getting all the correct advice and guidance from all the institutions. I think it's something we all need to consider across the nation, that all learners are getting the right advice and guidance for their future. I will go back to the point I made earlier\u2014everything's comparable as long as it's the right thing for the learner's future, and I genuinely believe, and I'm sure a lot of colleagues believe, that that choice element is important to a learner, okay. If it is the right choice and if the Welsh bac\u00a0is the right choice, that is correct, and we move that along. But you've got to be doing the right things for the learner, and we are certainly not selling it, 'Come\u00a0to us; you don't do the Welsh bac.' It is part of what we offer. It is part of what the college's curriculum offers\u2014there is no doubt about that\u2014and then people make a choice according to what they need to do to actually progress to what they need to do in their future. You explained earlier that if people knew what the bac was about in your sector, they'd value it more greatly, which I accept. Are you worried at all, though, that some of the more able and talented STEM students, in particular\u2014who are needed in your sector, after all\u2014might be deterred from doing those four A-levels because of the bac, because, presumably, you need a mix of these talents? You talked about the more able and talented vocational learners, but also you have more able and talented academic learners\u2014presumably you need them all. I think the discussion that I've had with our employers has been around the academic side of things, if you like. Again, I'll come back to the input of businesses to support that delivery of commercial skills and so on, but I think I probably made that point earlier. There's clearly going to be different individuals who will cope better, and they will be, I guess, maybe guided as well by parents to a certain degree in terms of, 'You do those four and forget about that nonsense there', which is not helpful, but I can understand why that happens. I guess that's what a lot of our employers saw the Welsh bac\u00a0as being able to do. nick brazil: Can I just add something to that? I think Ed's just said about the softer skills. Do the softer skills have to be developed through qualification? I think Kay mentioned a programme earlier on within her college. So, I think we're all in agreement about the development of the skills, but does it need to be through a qualification? lynne neagle am: And you've said that you make the decision in the best interests of the learner. Are you aware, then, of any young people who are coming to you from the Swansea area because they've got that flexibility, which they may not have in one of the local schools? nick brazil: As I said, in terms of our offer, we offer a range in the curriculum. We're not going out there saying, 'Come\u00a0to us for this particular reason.' lynne neagle am: No, but does anybody come to you and say, 'Well, actually, I've really come here because I don't have to do the Welsh bac'? nick brazil: The honest answer is it's one of the first questions that people always ask. But, as I've said, as a parent, I've been to open evenings and other open evenings. It's generally a question that people ask,\u00a0'Do\u00a0I have to do the Welsh bac?' It does come across not just in our open evenings, but in other open evenings that I've been to. They do want to know that, and it's usually, as I said, one of the first questions that they ask. sian gwenllian am: And is that the parents asking the question or the pupil? nick brazil: It's a combination. But, honest answer, I would say parents, a lot of the time, but the learners usually\u2014as I said\u2014have sometimes had not the best experience pre 16 and that's why they ask the question straight away. sian gwenllian am: Can I suggest that maybe, then, the perception that parents have is steering the way rather than the actual benefits for the pupil in your institution? If you're telling them, 'Come\u00a0to us, you don't have to actually do it because we know you don't like it', is that the correct way of approaching education? nick brazil: No. nick brazil: Yes, I know, I totally understand, but it's about offering the full range of qualification opportunities for learners. If you don't offer the full range, which, sometimes\u2014if you, obviously, limit and you make qualifications compulsory, that can limit the choice of opportunities as well. There are some places in, I would think, some sixth forms now, where certain qualifications may not be offered now because of the need to pick up an extra\u2014Welsh bac. So, for example, modern foreign languages is reducing quite dramatically in Wales, and, I think, I picked up today a few schools had been saying that one of the reasons is, 'We have to put our focus on the Welsh bac\u00a0to ensure that is achieved rather than giving the opportunity to do the modern foreign language.' sian gwenllian am: But it could be a short-sighted view because what some young people tell us is that at the time\u2014and parents\u2014they didn't really appreciate what skills they were actually learning, and by the time they'd got into employment, that working as a team, the communication skills, they thought, 'Ah, we\u00a0did\u2014. So, to try and, sort of, discourage it at a younger age may be doing them a disservice in the long run. Anybody want to pick that up? dafydd evans: We certainly have experience of that, of young people coming in with quite a negative attitude, originally, to the Welsh bac and taking it on board. But where we are delivering it well, well contextualised, they've really enjoyed the experience, and very much valued the experience. dafydd evans: But don't underestimate the fact that\u00a0if you had a poor experience of the Welsh bac\u00a0at school, that perception is very difficult for us, as institutions, then, to change. dr rachel bowen: It does make it into quite an intensive selling process for colleges when they've got to overcome that negative perception. As people have said already, it is possible to talk parents and learners round, but then that's time spent having to do that selling job when we should be talking about other things. kay martin: Can I just mention as well that there's a bigger job in helping parents to understand that the only qualifications in the world are not A-levels? Perhaps you might want to do an engineering BTEC programme, or you might want to do a health and social care, or you might want to do hospitality. You might want to do BTEC\u00a0programmes, you can still go to university if that's what you want to do, or you can go into an apprenticeship afterwards, and selling that whole range to parents, because there is an overemphasis, by us all, on A-levels\u2014. A lot of this has been covered, actually, but just on those final points there, I'm wondering whether you think that introducing a specialist teacher-training qualification to deliver the Welsh bac\u00a0would actually help in some way in improving its status and perception and so on. What do you think about that? dafydd evans: I'm not assured in terms of\u2014yes, training is required regarding the Welsh bac, but where we are seeing it more successfully is where vocational lecturers have actually taken it on board. When we were bringing lecturers from outside\u2014'Welsh bac\u00a0specialists' in inverted commas\u2014it was not working well. It has started to work well when our sports lecturers have taken the Welsh bac on board and have put it in the context of the sports curriculum. Therefore, no, I think that if it's going to be a success, it's got to be contextualised, and for the vocational lecturers to do that, and we've invested heavily in training those vocational lecturers to understand how to deliver the Welsh bac\u00a0and get positive outcomes of the Welsh bac\u2014. nick brazil: And I think you've got to bear in mind that the number of the skills and the number of challenges that are done within the Welsh bac\u00a0are done very similarly within the vocational qualification as well. I suppose when it comes to the word 'credibility' used in terms of the qualification, yes, I'm sure it would raise that focus on it, but ultimately, it's taking away from the fact that we have got staff who've got those skills and they're developing them within other elements of the vocational qualifications they're doing. Something we were talking about earlier on is the fact is that, sometimes, that work is being repeated twice, because of the nature of the qualification. dawn bowden am: And have you got dedicated time? Because one of the things we picked up from schools was that teachers in particular were kind of fitting it in with other lessons, and therefore, it wasn't being, again, given the same perceived level of importance as doing A-levels were. But your lecturers would all have dedicated time to deliver\u2014 kay martin: On their timetables, yes. ed evans: I was just going to add there, really, if you want to raise the profile amongst parents in particular, if you've got that\u00a0far clearer link between businesses coming in to deliver this\u2014. Apologies, I'd almost forgotten that we were in the Colegau thing, I was thinking 'schools' actually [Laughter.] But in terms of bringing those businesses into schools in a structured way, not an ad-hoc way, which is just a friend turning up to talk about something, a structured way\u2014. We have a programme under way at the moment called 'contextualising the curriculum' in the sector that we hope to roll out. Now, if that was rolled out across the board\u2014I'm not saying that it makes it easier for teachers in particular, but they are going to struggle to deliver some of these commercial and world-skilled, global areas, because it's not their bag. So, bring in\u00a0some experts, bring in some business, raise the profile, and I think then, possibly, you'll start to get parents thinking, 'Actually, there is something more to this than just the academic bit.' dawn bowden am: Okay. Can I just ask\u2014? You've all got slightly different policies; they don't have to do it in Swansea, in Cardiff and the Vale, they do unless they're in the Seren network, and in your college, everybody does it, even if they're doing four A-levels. Do you think that's a satisfactory situation, and are you satisfied with the communication and the guidance and the steer that everyone's getting from Welsh Government on this? Because we're meant to have a policy of universal adoption, but that doesn't really seem to be happening on the ground. kay martin: And I think, if you'd asked us a few years ago, we were all heading for universal adoption, but because the Welsh bac\u00a0has changed into something that isn't 100 per cent what we think it should be, then we've stopped the universal adoption, if you like. So, we are trying to do what's in the best interests of the learner, but I think, as you said, we've mentioned some other programmes, and if we could look at\u2014. We've got industry experts that are brought into colleges as well, some more than others, to bring that to life, if you like. We've got mentorship programmes, we send people out, and we just need to incorporate that better. We need to spend less time in checking what they've done on assessment and more time in the doing, and the experiential learning that they need to do, rather than it being too much of a paper exercise. By the time you've done all the paperwork you haven't got time to do any of the learning. nick brazil: I think, just to support Kay, we're going to need to go back to the original vision of the Welsh bac, which all of us would buy into 100 per cent. I think that has been lost as the qualification's developed over time, and, ultimately, I think all of us would like to see it go back to that to provide those skills that Ed has brought up and everything. We visited Spain recently, and there they have an entrepreneurship and enterprise unit that is mandatory for everybody, but it appeared to be far more fit for purpose than the Welsh bac\u00a0is currently. Therefore, I think what we're saying is, if we're going universal adoption, it can't be with this product. Well, can I thank you all for attending and for answering our questions? It's been a very informative and interesting discussion. We will, as usual, send you a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you again for your time this morning. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care regarding the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill, paper to note 2 is the letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education to the Children's Commissioner for Wales on home education, and paper to note 3 is the letter that the Cabinet Secretary for Education has sent to us in reply to our letter about free school meals. Item 4, then: can I propose in accordance with Standing Order 17.42 that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Yes."

        "Query": "Summarize the presentation on marketing findings, trend-watching, market inspirations, and the evaluation of two versions.",
        "Summary": "The remote control design should prioritize functionality, with a focus on a comfortable fit, clear and obvious functions, and legible text. The appearance of the remote should be visually appealing and eye-catching. To meet the Christmas deadline and stay ahead of competition, the remote needs to be in the market soon. The trend for that year was fruit and vegetable shapes, along with a soft and spongy feel. The star features of the remote should be narrowed down to one or two, with voice recognition as a potential option. Marketing identified three key findings: a fancy look and feel, innovative technology, and high ease of use. They aimed to combine these findings with the trendy fruit and vegetable theme and sponge material, while considering the preferences of both the elder and young markets. Specific topics discussed included color design, related symbols and pictures, and the placement of the business logo. Marketing highlighted three main inspirations: the customer's desire for fashion in electronics, the simplicity of technology, and the importance of aesthetics in the remote's shape and color. Evaluation criteria were established, focusing on a fancy look and feel, innovativeness, and ease of use. The Industrial Designer and User Interface teams scored the prototypes, with emphasis on look and feel, innovativeness, and ease of use. The decision was made to create a remote control without an LCD screen, improving the design to make it more visually appealing. All functions would be included in the same set, but some, like speech recognition, would be optional. The team would also explore different shapes and materials for the remote.",
        "Article": "So we have forty minutes to discuss and  finalise and close the product and project and to move further , okay , so Okay , let's talk about  maybe first  for the prototype . project manager: So I handle to user interface: I've done a presentation , but it pretty much covers work that we've both done , so if I'm missing anything , Christine can just correct me . user interface: It's not the biggest PowerPoint presentation in the world , but industrial designer: marketing: project manager: So in two or three or industrial designer: user interface: Three . industrial designer: marketing: user interface:  okay , can I have the mouse ? project manager: Yes . Alright , so from when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting , we decided that we wanted an ergonomic shape , the material that we chose was wood , and  the colour would be customisable , 'cause you can stain the wood whatever colour .  , so in terms of function , you have to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off , volume and channel control , menu control , voice recognition control , and we've incorporated the L_C_D_ screen on the flip panel as part of the design , if we figure out it's too expensive , well then you just take it off . marketing: user interface: So if you lift up the panel , you can see the lovely yellow L_C_D_ display . The yellow button you have is the on off button , so it's really big , hard to miss . And then you have the numeric pad in the dark blue at the bottom , and on the right-hand side you have the access to the menu on the T_V_ , and on the left-hand side you have the the the ability to turn off the voice recognition . industrial designer: Yeah the d user interface: Additional feature on the back is that you can have your own customised backing and I suppose you could do the same thing on the flip case on the front . That depends on the  s design of the circuit board inside and  what room is left  user interface: Yeah . project manager: I think the microphone is on on the top ,  on the middle , the under the flip . project manager: So that will be the safe , so p any the chip it's not on the chip because you need to have microphone to industrial designer: No ,  it depends on the design of the circuit board . user interface: But it shouldn't be under the flip either , because you can have the remote control closed , but you still might want to activate it by voice . project manager:  it's it's Yeah , but   my opinion I think it's better under the flip because whenever you want to  the talk , okay , so then you can speak then you can close it . But if you put it on the on the flip , okay , then  technical I don't think it's  feasible , 'cause most of the time you speak then it will be recognised . user interface: But if you've already got the remote control in your hand you need to open the flip to use the voice , why use the voice , why not just use your hand ?  the whole point of the voice is that if the remote control is sitting there and I'm too lazy to reach over and pick it up , I can just use my voice . industrial designer: Maybe I've got my hand in the popcorn bowl and I'm holding my cup of Coca-Cola in the other hand . user interface:  it doesn't have to be on the flip , it can be on the side somewhere . user interface: marketing: No , because y you can easily put a microphone on the side that would have no problem would haven't been not be damaged or anything , and it'd be accessible all the time to voice . S I'm fine , I'm satisfi user interface: And maybe the shape of the buttons , project manager: I'm satisfied . user interface: the little egg shapes aren't the most economical , but industrial designer: We're glad you're satisfied . project manager: Of course it's it's it's looks more heo heavy , but I think when it's completely maybe it's a less weight . But And part of the thing is m a lot of people say that they don't like something that's too light , because they don't feel like they have enough control over it . user interface: So  maybe this is excessively heavy , but I think it needs to have some weight , project manager: Yep . marketing: project manager: So any comments or  marketing: Well , the prototype is is very well within the design and ideas that we've we've talked about on the previous meetings . marketing: Now it goes into this next phase as the financial  marketing  project manager: Yes , that  So I'll come back to the So evaluation criteria , I think  that will be good , so then let's come to the finance  , I have some  calculations which I made  as for  the budget .  it's optional , somewhat optional and Ed wants the chip on print , that's what  we were talking about that . industrial designer: project manager: So then we have sample sensor and sample speaker , then  we have the wood material , then special colour and push button . So it's  actually , our budget was  twelve point five Euro , but  it's coming to nine point nine five Euro , so we are under  below the budget , okay , so still we are saving some money . marketing: Well we haven't come to mine yet , so industrial designer: Oh , okay user interface: industrial designer: . It's gonna cost a long way to c you know , cost a lot of money to market it , is it ? marketing: we're gonna have a bit of difference of opinion , yes . project manager: So maybe it's for some money we can utilise for our  marketing , for the sales , okay , and  marketing: Well , it just depends on if we're gonna add a o on this pr provisionary cost analysis , we do not have a L_C_ display . L_C_ display is gonna be very expensive , user interface: No we do , but it's not filled in . marketing: We don't have the price up there , user interface: Oh , yeah , yeah , project manager: Yeah . marketing: okay , so if we add approximately two to three Euro per remote , now we're up around about twelve , twelve and a half as to what  the company had initially  requested .  industrial designer: So that means we can put the  the L_C_D_ in , yeah . But as far as production  I'm putting up a question because we're talking about profit also , and in mine you'll see  the problem with  our survey , the p the possibility that how many units can be sold , what percentage of the market , etcetera etcetera because that has to be taken in into consideration . project manager: marketing:  this is just production cost , it is not  advertising cost , it's not transportation cost  project manager: Yes , so still  we have twelve point five Euro . marketing: And that will inflate quite a bit the cost of the  the cost of the unit for the company . marketing: So to come up with what the company wants is a fifty million Pound profit , we're gonna have to go a long ways . This we are talking about one unit , okay , so when it go into the quantity , okay , and the cost will come down . industrial designer: Although customisation , because this is being done , you know , the on on-order basis , it might be  the the quantity won't m won't  marketing: Slightly . industrial designer: the circuit board will b you're right , would be in producing quantity , but the cost of the case would  be fixed at the  you got some pretty cheap labour that can do this case for one Euro . industrial designer: That's really that's the cost of the material and lab wow , that's really outstanding . But anyhow , still we are under control , okay , so what  I will do is I will try to negotiate with the vendors , okay , to get  the production cost less , okay , so then we can save some money , okay , to put into th our marketing or  you know the promotions , whatever , okay , so that  I will look after . project manager: You're in four ? marketing: Yep The four gives me it's gotta be  TrendWatch . marketing: It shouldn't be user interface: That's no , I think it's the same one . marketing: Although since  we need to have some type of idea on a market  we had independent study that says it this this market has an availability to absorb eight mi eight million units per year . Okay ? Our internal company evaluation puts it between eight to nine million which is approximately the same as the independent study . Which means that  if we have a target of two million would the company has to take twenty five percent of the market in the first year , project manager: marketing: So , if we put an inflated price of fifty Euro at a production cost that cannot exceed twenty-five Euro , okay , we're already in that that price , okay , project manager: Yes . marketing: with transport , promotion , labour , because we hav gi included the promotion in the cost , transport for the material to the stores or whatever how however we're gonna break this down between our our retailers . At two million units , we have to have a profit of twenty-five Euro per unit to get to the fifty million unit Eu Euro profit . marketing: Okay ? So , obviously we w w I just did a run down the evaluation of the form , the fan  the fancy stylishness of the of the unit , the ease of use , speech recognition , cost , we've gone through these . Now , the company must evaluate the feasibility of being able to take enough of the market to justify in production . Or we project this over two years , but being that the market changes very very quickly , maybe there's no more interest in buying this thing in eighteen months from now . marketing: Can it sell it for fifty Euros ? industrial designer: Could could I go to findings ? project manager: Yep . industrial designer:    I would  like to explore the possibility of using  alternative  delivery and sales channel which would be  to use the internet for promotion and ordering project manager: Yes . industrial designer: That way you have no storage , you have no  you do have transportation , still have the labour cost , user interface: user interface: That actually makes more sense if we're gonna make it so highly customisable , 'cause on the web people can look at the different options they have , see maybe what other people have done , what the range of possibility as , industrial designer:  . user interface: whereas if you're in a store , you can't unless you're a highly imaginative person , you may not really know what it is you want , industrial designer:  . user interface: whereas on the web , if you have a bunch of pictures , it can sort of trigger ideas and industrial designer: And you can even have an a movie that you can rotate the object and look at the di the only thing that you're missing really is the weight . It's not quite like trying on a shoe , but people are getting used to buying things online that they can't touch before buying . You can customise a watch , you can see how it is at the f at the end of the production , industrial designer: -huh . marketing: you can change it  There's a lot of online that's that is doing this now . marketing: And when you're rotating , you'll look behind and look this way  it's possible to do with this , maybe there's a possibility of selling more than two million units in one year , which could you know , feasibili feasibility  lower the price of the unit . project manager: I don't think that's  not possible , it's  okay then , l  let's wait for the production , okay , then  you can evaluate the product , so how it looks like technically and  how it look like  the real . user interface: What turnaround time do we have ? project manager: T user interface: 'Cause  production evaluation can be very very quick or very very long . industrial designer: In  We probably should do some market tests  once we have the prototypes and do some orders and things like that and test-market it . marketing:  that'd have to be thrown out on the market for people to get an idea , project manager: So you can take a minimum two weeks to a maximum four weeks . Think minimum two weeks if we're gonna develop prototypes and then try to take them to different places and see how people use project manager: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , because we we are not going to do it in  our factory , okay , so we can give it a product evalua user interface: No no . industrial designer: project manager: So we'll do it in the other place , and I don't think it's take more than four weeks time . Or  Okay , so then the real production we will start once we product evaluation , okay , then  it's approve from  the technical team and  your team , okay ,  from the management , then we can launch in the market . Hm ? industrial designer: Any outstanding ? project manager: S Any any other  questions or  comments to be discuss ? industrial designer: No , I'm user interface: What ab industrial designer: go ahead . project manager: Okay , so then  industrial designer: Did you have something ? user interface: Well I was just wondering about if we're gonna do a product evaluation then what about time for redesign if the users come back and tell us no this is bad , this is bad , we want this done differently . industrial designer: project manager: So no more changes will be made , okay , in this the basic design . Okay ? So we will introduce m this model and  let's introduce in the market and let's take the feedback from the customers , then we can  go for the industrial designer: Second generation . industrial designer: user interface: The problem is there might not be a second generation if the first generation flops for some silly reason that we haven't thought of . Well , every customer , okay , they have their own ideas , they have their own test , okay , so there's no end , there's no limit . user interface: No , but there's a difference between releasing a product that has been minimally tested and fine-tuned to suit a general range of requirements versus releasing a product that we think will work but we don't really have anything to back it up . project manager: Yeah , so that's the reason you are here for  the design , okay , I hope you made a good design . We have our own motivations in mind , we have our own ideas in mind , but that doesn't mean that that's what's gonna sell . project manager: Yeah , but  see , we ought to take a few considerations , okay , one is the price consideration , one is future consideration , okay , like  you can eat  you can all eat more chi I can eat more chilli , okay , so i it's a depends on the individual taste , you know , industrial designer: project manager: so we have we have to balance somewhere . I'm just trying to point out that I think that your evaluation and redesign turnaround time is too short well you have no redesign not you personally , but in the project we have no redesign time and project manager: Yes . industrial designer: Ed , d do you know what season of the year or time of the year is the most important for T_V_ remote control sales ? marketing:  . marketing: they need those things that they have their hands g occupied and they need to be able to talk to the con remote control . industrial designer: maybe what user interface: industrial designer: So I think what we need to do is perhaps to synchronise the final the the launch of a user-tested device with some special event . industrial designer: so that gives us a little more time perhaps then we anticipated , because I don't know when the World Cup is , but I'm sure there's gonna be one . industrial designer: but , so , I'm just ig  pointing out a  a strategy to  do some additional user testing project manager: Research . industrial designer: or  perhaps to  also user interface: That's actually good place to advertise it too . industrial designer: There might be some motion pictures that are coming out  that are coming out on D_V_D_ that  they need to have a m special remote control to work with it , so we could maybe work out a campaign with  with Sony Pictures for example . user interface: It's just something to to keep in mind , 'cause it's really really important . user interface: A lot of products have gone out there without being properly user-tested and completely flopped , when in fact it gets re-released a few years down the line with proper testing and it takes off like crazy . user interface: Really ? industrial designer: Yes , it is one of the first consumer products that was launched about thirty years that was a disposable consumer product , user interface: That I didn't know . industrial designer: and  people the market hadn't really gotten on to the concept that you could use something and then throw it away , 'cause it wasn't  user interface: industrial designer: but then when they re-launched them thirty years later , they were virtually the same design , project manager: . industrial designer: but people had gotten the throw-away , you know , paper cups and napki y all kinds of things that they hadn't  so , you're right , timing is very important , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: You look very relaxed , considering h you know , the  the weight on your shoulders , yeah . user interface: project manager: Okay , so then  let's come to the closing and  are the costs within the budget marketing: Celebration . Okay for  but our time being , so thanks for all your efforts and great work and  great design and  let's leave it to the Ed for later for once production is over and the meantime let's celebrate . user interface: Thanks industrial designer: user interface: project manager: And see you in the evening for drinks "

        "Query": "What were the opinions of the User Interface and Industrial designers regarding the attractiveness and appearance of the product, as well as the price and ease of use, during the evaluation of the prototype and discussion of functional requirements?",
        "Summary": "The User Interface team believed that the product incorporated fashion elements to attract buyers, as some buttons were shaped like cherries and had a spongy texture. They also mentioned a banana-shaped wireless phone that sold for over a hundred Euros, making their product's price of just 25 Euros very attractive to customers. The product would offer basic functions, with the option for users to pay more for additional features such as an LCD and speech recognition with a microphone. To make the product look fancy and meet different customers' needs, the team suggested offering it in multiple colors instead of just one standard grey. During a discussion about creating a new product that was both fashionable and easy for elderly users to use, the User Interface team emphasized the importance of ensuring better usability and making the remote control visually appealing. The Marketing team also suggested considering different colors or shapes for the remote control.",
        "Article": "I'm gonna do an opening , talk about  did you all get the minutes ? I e-mailed them to you .  I'll talk about the new project requirements I've just received , and then we have to make a decision on our remote control functions .  we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification , what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , the functions design , what effects the apparatus should have , and the working design , how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function . marketing:  shall we go in the order that you just did it ? project manager: Sure , please do . How do I hook my screen up ? industrial designer: I think , you might have to disconnect Rose . user interface: Well there's a wee a wee plug just just that one there marketing: Where does it go ?  , I'm not supposed to move this , user interface: marketing: but user interface: Ah that's it , yep . marketing: user interface: And then you have to press function F_ eight project manager: Function , F_ eight , yeah . project manager: Is it plugged in all the way and you screwed it in and industrial designer: Yeah . marketing:  alright project manager: It's taking it a little bit marketing: I've never attached to anything . marketing: I don't know if you guys are able to get access to  the report that was online or if I'm the only one who is . So we're just gonna talk a little bit about the functional requirements that people specified when they were asked . They had a hundred subjects and their usability lab and they watched them watch T_V_ and recorded the frequency that they used particular buttons and the relevance that those buttons had . Focusing on their desires ,  people specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly , seventy five per cent of the a hundred subjects noted that and that they more importantly though , eighty per cent said that they would be willing to pay more for a fancier looking remote .  also they did some questions on voice recognition and found that the desire for voice recognition was inversely related to age , so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition , whereas the older people in the like sixty and above segment or so did not really think that they would pay more money for voice recognitions . marketing:  people also had certain frustrations , that I think that we could try to take into consideration with our design . People are also frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and I think that ties back to what you were saying before industrial designer:  . It also mentioned something called R_S_I_ and I was hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what R_S_I_ is , user interface: Repetitive strain injury . So I guess sort of the carpal tunnel type thing , people do not like that ,  the repetitive use , I guess , caused a strain .  looking at the needs people specified , the problem right now is that people's remotes are not matching their operating behaviour . People also zap like to change the channel , about  sixty five per cent during an hour of use . So we really just need to focus in on those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings , the screen settings and the channel settings , because they're used much more infrequently and probably just complicate what's going on . So I think that some things that we might wanna think about , the idea of an L_C_D_ screen was brought up although they didn't have any details on what people's preferences on that were , so I dunno know if that's coming to me later , or something like that . But something for us to consider also just the phenomenon that less is more when it comes to the buttons on the remote or what we wanna make easiest to use , make sure that , you know , something like an audio setting isn't given as much importance and visibility on the remote as something like channel changing that's used a lot more often . And basically in order for us to win over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like , that it has a fancy appeal and that it's not ugly and that it feels like the way they're gonna use it , so it doesn't give them any hand injuries or things like that . And I think that's in the shared , if I did it right , if anyone wants to look at it . It's a device that allows us to produce certain effects on our television , so i it's basically a communication device . We we tell the remote control what we want to do , it sends a message to the television saying change the channel , change the volume ,  yeah , adjust these settings , adjust the brightness .  how do we actually go about designing a new television remote control ? First thing to do is to come up with the design specifications . We need to know what our final product is gonna be like , so we need a a clear idea of exactly what this product does ,  how it works , and what the end-user is gonna want from this product . Oh , a way I'd suggest that we could go about this is by designing  several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product ,  and then  trying to get some feedback  about marketing: user interface: h how well these particular prototypes work ,  sorta find out what people think of 'em . So in some sense we're gonna we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design  so that we're not completely shocking people . But I think within that there is also room for us to introduce novel ideas  and to make something that's that's perhaps a little bit different , something that stands out .  the first of these is is technological ye  what can we do with the current state of technology as it is . So as you mentioned things like voice recognition would would add to the price  but it would also im improve the design of the product . user interface: So I had a look on the on the web  to see if I could find a few examples of existing television remote controls . In analysing these we can consider what what things what's good about them ,  what things do they get right , what's bad about them , what's wrong with 'em ,  how we can improve on the designs that that that I found and what can we do to make our product stand out from from the large majority of remote controls . project manager: user interface:  on the left here we've got  an engineering-based design for a remote control , industrial designer: user interface: so it's one that's got lots of buttons , it's it's fully featured , everything you might possibly want to do is there , you know , it's got forward , backwards , up , down , channel numbers , volume ,  freeze frame . Yeah , it's it's fully featured and it might take a while to get to learn to use it , but once you've learned it you can you can do whatever you want with your T_V_ . It's just got the essential functions of the T_V_ changing the channel , play , stop , volume . It would be a lot quicker to learn to use it , but again th it's it's swings and roundabouts .  personally wa what I want from a remote control is a device that's simple , it it's easy to use ,  it's got big buttons for doing the things I do most often , changing the volume , changing the channel . It it does everything that I need it to  , as I said before , I'm quite lazy , I don't wanna walk across the room just to adjust my television . I also want something that that looks cool ,  and that that feels good , that's ergonomically designed . user interface: And I think that's that's why companies like Apple've 've 've made a lot of progress . industrial designer: Right , I really can't see what I'm doing , so does anyone have a project manager: You there it is . marketing: So wait , did it let you go on the Internet or was that just what it let you see ? user interface:  that was just on the d on the company web site , yeah . user interface: industrial designer: Alright  No , how do I play again ? project manager:  the it's right above Draw .  I had a bit of some issues with this , because I wasn't able to find everything I needed , but I guess that's we're still in early stages . Though th the thing about working design is the what we're trying to do as a working design is figure out how the aparata apparatus can fulfil its function . It works because it converts electrical energy to grinding the beans and then you put the bean through a filter and that filters out , and then you get coffee at the end that's nice and hot because of the combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work . Don't know if I'm explaining that very well , but how do I get to the next s ah . So h the method as  working designers figure out what you need to make it fulfil this practical function , what what needs to be done and how do we convert all the elements to make that done . marketing: industrial designer: So wha the easiest thing to do is to break down all the points at which you need something to happen . So you make a schematic of the way that the the energy is converted tsh towards this practical function . industrial designer: So the findings that I got  very just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that the information is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infra-red is the best way to do that 'cause you don't need a sight line .  the user interface is critical here , because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls that converts the electrical energy into data , which then goes through the infra-red , so the the chip that  I think Ian is designing , is gonna be crucial . And really it all comes down to the to the user , because they're the one that's controlling most of the working design . So the components that we find here are the energy source , you know the battery or whatever that's gonna m make it work , then the chip , which converts the data , the user that's controlling the chip , and the infra-red bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver . You have your energy source right there which then  brings  energy or information to the chip , which is also controlled by the users . You have energy going to the user who's controlling the chip ooh 's not what I wanted to do   . So you have your energy source , your user interface who's controlling the chip , the chip also uses the energy , and the chip through the use of the user interface is gonna control the switch which will work your infra-red bulb , which will then bring the data to the receiver . And personal preferences , besides the fact that I can't spell , we need a long-lasting energy source , people don't wanna be changing it a lot . We need a straightforward interface , like Ian was saying , simple , not overwhelming it with information and we need a reliable and clear infra-red signal , so that you're not waving your remote around project manager: industrial designer: Rose , do you think you can give me a hand with this ? project manager: Yes , absolutely . marketing: user interface: What's up ? industrial designer: project manager: Lefty loosey , righty tighty . We have a couple new requirements that I was just e-mailed right before the meeting and that we have to keep in in  in mind as we're creating this . project manager: We didn't bring it up yet , or at all in the meetings so far , but we're not gonna work with teletext because  well it that's been taken over by the internet , so we're not gonna worry about  we're not gonna worry about that . Oh , user interface: You don't have it in the States ? marketing: so project manager: It industrial designer: No . W d could would you care to explain it ? user interface: Oh , I didn't realise .  yeah , it's like a I suppose it's kind of similar to a very very basic web browser .  you have like you have  numbers on your remote control ,  y and you type in the page number you want , marketing: user interface: so like you type a hundred on your remote control and this this kind of index appears on the television screen with just some some text and some very blocky looking graphics on it . And you just type numbers to go to different pages and it gives you information , mostly rather boring stuff like what's on T_V_ next and share prices and that kind of thing . industrial designer: But if you ever see the T_V_ saying like go to page one sixty on Ceefax now , that's what they're talking about . industrial designer: I have no idea why we don't have it , but user interface: marketing: That's good . Okay  , well , we're not gonna the management has decided we're not gonna work with that .  marketing: project manager: Okay  and we're also gonna w like your question earlier  whether this is going to be t for television , video , or etcetera . project manager:  and finally there's more marketing , I think , our corporate image has to be recognisable . So while we're gonna make it look pretty we need to use our colour and our slogan i in the new design . user interface: So what's our corporate image like ? It's It's kind of yellow colour with  we put fashion in electronics . project manager: Looks like , yeah , kind of a yellow and black and we have that the emphasis on the R_s in  user interface: It's like double R_ . user interface: marketing: industrial designer: Okay , so we want something that looks good project manager: Yep . You  in your analysis of different market  of the marketing , you identified that different groups wanted different things marketing: project manager: or had certain preferences , for example that  that older people didn't really care for  voice recognition , but younger people did . project manager:  and so who are we aiming this at ? industrial designer: Well if we're gonna say that function  fashion we put the fashion in in electronics then you automatically , I think , a sort of younger group that that's who's gonna be attracted to this . marketing: Yes , I do think , who's gonna have the money to buy that also , that one ? project manager: It's gonna be twenty five Euro remember , so  it has to be avai marketable to  whomever it is . user interface: Is it is it something that's gonna be sold separately from the television or is it something that comes w with a television ? 'Cause that would affect the way that we market it . project manager: Well at least right now what we're doing is  deciding on just the remote itself , so it will probably be sold separately , twenty five Euro by itself . marketing: The only break-down that I was given in terms of age was the voice activation and basically there's a big jump , after thirty five people don't really care if it has voice , so it's like basically fifteen to thirty five that think that that's a good idea . marketing: I dunno I'm gonna be given any other numbers broken down in terms of age later , but if that's sort of the only quality that we have that is divided into age then we would wanna stick between the fifteen and thirty five range . industrial designer: Yeah , that's probably  a population w quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway , so that might be a fairly good target group for us . user interface: I I would say no , because it's gonna add too much to the price . Especially if we are marketing it as a separate product , people are gonna be paying project manager: user interface: well ,  we've got a price limit of was it twelve twelve and a half Euros for to produce it ? project manager:  . user interface: And I wonder if we can get voice recognition into that twelve and a half Euros without having to make too many other compromises . marketing: But what else are we gonna put ,  not that I'm really gung-ho about it , I don't know what else you can put in a remote to make it technologically advanced though . marketing:  it can look really great and still have the same up-n-down buttons industrial designer: But right . marketing: and why's anyone gonna buy a new remote ? industrial designer: Well but why are we why are we aiming for a technological advancement ? Everything we're talking about is ease of use and simple and that doesn't necessarily mean more technology , marketing: marketing: If someone's looking to buy a new remote , don't they want like an upgrade ? I dunno . project manager: Upgrade ? Well , we can look for we can look at upgrade or we can look at  user-friendly . project manager: Simplification , industrial designer: They could have a crap remote user interface: Yeah . project manager: so industrial designer: that came with their T_V_ that's just impossible to use , or maybe it broke , or maybe they're just missing it . And we also need to talk about if we're only gonna have the very simple ones or also have the other ones just separate somehow or industrial designer:  . marketing: Can you like  this may be too complicated , but , I wish I had something to explain it , like if it was just a simple , either this way or this way , that had like the main buttons and then you could like pull something out , kind of and like you got the rest the buttons , industrial designer: Ooh . user interface: The remote marketing: Do you know what I'm saying ? project manager: Kind of pull out of the side . Like some T_V_s they have a sort of  a sliding screen on the remote control of it project manager:  . user interface: So if you wanna do something complicated like programme your television or re-tune it , then you you open up this little hatch or or slide the screen down marketing: marketing: 'Cause then 's like people who don't wanna ever look at them , never even have to see them project manager: marketing: and if you like get the instruction manual that comes with it and you just don't even read it then you'll never even know that those things can pull out . marketing: And you're a happy person and everyone else doesn't have to have like two remotes , one that has the easy ones and one that has project manager: project manager:  we have to be careful that that that doesn't impede  the chip transmitting information , but  that's gonna be mostly technological thing . project manager: Okay  , so what are we emphasising ? I what in this project ? user interface: Si simplicity and fashion . project manager: Okay , those are very good goals , I think ,  that we have to keep in mind in with everything we do . Simplicity and fashion and , yeah , or usability speci however you wanna say that , which includes  an emphasis on making the infra-red very functional , so that you don't have to travel around a lot . marketing: What can you do to like make the infra-red more functional , like why would it not be ? I'm just wondering . project manager: I think it's a lot to do with battery , but that's just my marketing: Okay . industrial designer: The battery and that I think that the chip takes the data and presents it well , without sort of scattering . industrial designer: The quality  quality of all the components really , we can't really do anything shoddy work , 'cause it's user interface: Yeah . project manager: So our target group , we're saying , fifteen to thirty five ? marketing: Well , I dunno how useful that number is if we're not doing project manager: S voice recognition , which I kind of I kind of feel like voice recognition is not necessary in a remote control , marketing: Yeah . project manager: like it might be necessary for a T_V_ but not for the remote c , you know . user interface: It's , yeah , it's pretty it's pretty high-tech . user interface: marketing: And if the whole idea is you're using a remote then why would you have voice , project manager: marketing: like you know what  and then it's like you wouldn't need a remote you'd just talk to your T_V_ . user interface: It's for , like , the ultimately lazy people , project manager: user interface: who can't even be bothered to pick up the remote . industrial designer: I marketing: Maybe  if I get m more numbers , I'll e-mail you before the next meeting in terms of ages . But this doesn't divide up anything and there was only a hundred subjects also , project manager: marketing: which isn't , really isn't that representative , especially if it's a hundred subjects that th they then can subdivide into age groups that means there's very few in each age group , so industrial designer: Yeah , but I th I think regardless we're we're aiming for the under sixty five or something . I'd say we're  can we narrow it down to maybe  teenagers and families ? 'Cause that would go up to like fifty ? industrial designer: Or like single professionals or something . user interface: we we said simplicity is is one of the features , so it's going to appeal to people , maybe people who have problems with technology , you know , people who get scared by having lots of buttons , project manager: Okay . user interface: but then we've also got fashion , which is something that definitely appeals to younger people . marketing: Well maybe we don't have to defi define the target group by the demographic of age , project manager: Right . marketing: maybe we can define it by like the demographic of like h t how much money they have to spend or something like that , user interface: Yeah . project manager: So maybe it's more useful to d d to define objectives like fashion and simplicity than to find specific target group as far as age is industrial designer: Yeah , t probably .  oh , there're a couple functions do we want something so that do we want some kind of thing to find it if it's lost ? Like a button on a T_V_ you can press industrial designer:  . project manager: and it'll ring or something , I don't know like or beep ? marketing: H  , like I said before , fifty per cent of of the fru f like frustration someone can have that was the biggest one and half the people said that happened and we all mentioned it before we knew about it . marketing: And if we're talking about making something easy that sort of goes along with it so it wouldn't be like a random thing to sort of add in . marketing: so project manager: Okay , we have to we have about four minutes left to define our functions . marketing: user interface: Which are kind of hidden away in some way or well not hidden but they're  they're not as prominent as the main features . And we also want it to be fashionable , which I'm not sure if that's a function so much as a  yeah marketing: on your coffee table , it's not like an eye sore , that kind of thing . Any other essential functions that we need ? Battery ? Do we need a long-life battery ? industrial designer: Battery battery use . user interface: but I dunno if you can project manager: Just 'cause it is an electronic device , the industrial designer:  . I don't I don't think of a way you can operate a chip and convert that much data without without one . industrial designer: But you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone , or like a little cradle for your iPod . industrial designer: I dunno , that might contribute to less people losing it too if it it stays in one place . project manager: We have to think about  space in living-rooms , too , like 'cause they're industrial designer:  . project manager: would you put it on top of the T_V_ ? I don't know , just think okay , that's that's a good idea , we'll keep it . project manager:  after the meeting we're gonna each complete a sks  a questionnaire and a summaries summary .  I'll make sure to put up  the minutes and the project documentation and including these PowerPoint slides .  you each have individual actions , I_  I_D_ Industrial Design you've your components concept , User Interface , the user interface concept , market trend wa watching . marketing: project manager: And as as per last time you'll get specific incrat instructions from your personal coach e-mailed to you . And hopefully , I hope , next time you'll be able to access more of the web site that they they seem to tell you that you could . project manager: but  Be sure to note any frustrations or any  issues that come up in your  in your  summary . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: Did you  were you able to like put yours in the group folder ? industrial designer: Yes , I just did that . industrial designer: Yeah ? project manager: Looks like there are  looks like there's a second one kind of of mine that's that I didn't do , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Where is that ? Yours is project manager: Under the shared folder , I don't know it might not even be under yours as well . industrial designer: Yeah , that's what I have as well , R Rose project manager: Okay . marketing: No , but that's 'cause I think yours is in the e-mail separate , like it's not on the server "

        "Query": "Summarize the discussion on the disadvantages of ATLAS and other options and the opinions of C and F regarding these disadvantages.",
        "Summary": "The team discussed the use of different frameworks for the external file representation. While the team was familiar with Perl and preferred a flat file format due to its simplicity, the idea of using ATLAS was suggested. It was proposed to initially use ATLAS and evaluate its suitability before fully adopting it. The team also considered P files, but the concern was that they could become large. One team member, C, emphasized the importance of considering the learning curve of other options and believed that a flat file format works well for everyone. C suggested that Perl could be combined with external representations of ATLAS files to create a functional system. Additionally, C mentioned that exploring alternatives to P files could be interesting, despite the potential learning curve. Another team member, F, focused on dealing with prosodic features at the level of small linguistic units. F proposed attaching these features to words or segments, with the option of extracting smaller units. This approach would allow the team to build on their existing work without starting from scratch.",
        "Article": "grad c: Yeah , we had a long discussion about how much w how easy we want to make it for people to bleep things out . phd d: It it doesn't grad c: Did did did it ? I didn't even check yesterday whether it was moving . phd d: So I don't know if it doesn't like both of us grad c: Channel three ? Channel three ? phd d: You know , I discovered something yesterday on these , wireless ones . grad c:  -  ? phd d: You can tell if it 's picking up breath noise and stuff . So if you yeah , if you breathe under breathe and then you see AF go off , then you know it 's p picking up your mouth noise . phd f: In fact , if you listen to just the channels of people not talking , it 's like \" @ @ \" . It 's very disgust grad c: What ? Did you see Hannibal recently or something ? phd f: Sorry . So , grad c:  phd f: I was gonna try to get out of here , like , in half an hour , cuz I really appreciate people coming , and the main thing that I was gonna ask people to help with today is to give input on what kinds of database format we should use in starting to link up things like word transcripts and annotations of word transcripts , so anything that transcribers or discourse coders or whatever put in the signal , with time - marks for , like , words and phone boundaries and all the stuff we get out of the forced alignments and the recognizer . So , we have this ,  I think a starting point is clearly the the channelized output of Dave Gelbart 's program , which Don brought a copy of , grad c: Yeah . phd f: which phd d: Can I see it ? grad c: And so the only question is it the sort of thing that you want to use or not ? Have you looked at that ?  , I had a web page up . So , grad c: So phd f: I actually mostly need to be able to link up , or I it 's it 's a question both of what the representation is and grad c: You mean , this I guess I am gonna be standing up and drawing on the board . grad c: and then you can have lots of different sections , each of which have I Ds attached to it , and then you can refer from other sections to those I Ds , if you want to . I don't e I don't remember exactly what my notation was , phd a: Oh , I remember seeing an example of this . grad c: Yeah , \" T equals one point three two \" ,  And then I I also had optional things like accuracy , and then \" ID equals T one , one seven \" . And then , I also wanted to to be i to be able to not specify specifically what the time was and just have a stamp . grad c: Yeah , so these are arbitrary , assigned by a program , not not by a user . And then somewhere la further down you might have something like an utterance tag which has \" start equals T - seventeen , end equals T - eighteen \" . grad c: Right ? But it ends at this T - eighteen , which may be somewhere else . We don't know what the t time actually is but we know that it 's the same time as this end time . Right ? So you could you could have some sort of other other tag later in the file that would be something like , oh , I don't know , \" noise - type equals door - slam \" . You know ? And then , you could either say \" time equals a particular time - mark \" or you could do other sorts of references . So or or you might have a prosody \" Prosody \" right ? D ? T ? D ? T ? T ? phd f: It 's an O instead of an I , but the D is good . grad c: you know , so you could have some sort of type here , and then you could have ,  the utterance that it 's referring to could be U - seventeen or something like that . So , that seems that seems g great for all of the encoding of things with time and , grad c: Oh , well . phd f:  I I guess my question is more , what d what do you do with , say , a forced alignment ? phd a: How - how phd f:  you 've got all these phone labels , and what do you do if you just conceptually , if you get , transcriptions where the words are staying but the time boundaries are changing , cuz you 've got a new recognition output , or s sort of what 's the , sequence of going from the waveforms that stay the same , the transcripts that may or may not change , and then the utterance which where the time boundaries that may or may not change ? phd a: Oh , that 's That 's actually very nicely handled here because you could you could all you 'd have to change is the , time - stamps in the time - line without without , changing the I Ds . And you 'd be able to propagate all of the the information ? grad c: Right . phd a: You 'd have you 'd have phd f: The we we have phone - level backtraces . grad c: Yeah , this I don't think I would do this for phone - level . I think for phone - level you want to use some sort of binary representation phd f:  grad c: because it 'll be too dense otherwise . So , if you were doing that and you had this sort of companion , thing that gets called up for phone - level , what would that look like ? phd a: Why grad c: I would use just an existing an existing way of doing it . But but why not use it for phone - level ? phd f: H h phd a: It 's just a matter of it 's just a matter of it being bigger . But if you have you know , barring memory limitations , or  I w  this is still the m grad c: It 's parsing limitations . I don't want to have this text file that you have to read in the whole thing to do something very simple for . You would use it only for purposes where you actually want the phone - level information , I 'd imagine . phd f: So you could have some file that configures how much information you want in your in your XML or something .  , you 'd y phd f: phd a: You grad c: I I am imagining you 'd have multiple versions of this depending on the information that you want . grad c: I 'm just what I 'm wondering is whether I think for word - level , this would be OK . grad c: For lower than word - level , you 're talking about so much data that I just I don't know . I don't know if that phd f: we actually have So , one thing that Don is doing , is we 're we 're running For every frame , you get a pitch value , phd d: Lattices are big , too . phd f: and not only one pitch value but different kinds of pitch values grad c: Yeah , for something like that I would use P - file phd f: depending on grad c: or or any frame - level stuff I would use P - file . phd d: But what what 's the advantage of doing that versus just putting it into this format ? grad c: More compact , which I think is is better . grad c: if you did it at this phd f:  these are long meetings and with for every frame , grad c: You don't want to do it with that Anything at frame - level you had better encode binary phd f:  grad c: or it 's gonna be really painful .  , b you can always , G - zip them , and , you know , c decompress them on the fly if y if space is really a concern . phd d: Yeah , I was thi I was thinking the advantage is that we can share this with other people . grad c: Well , but if you 're talking about one per frame , you 're talking about gigabyte - size files . These are really  grad c: Right ? Because you have a two - gigabyte limit on most O Ss . But for phone - level stuff it 's perfectly phd f: And th it 's phd a: Like phones , or syllables , or anything like that . So , you know , people don't v Look at it , words times the average The average number of phones in an English word is , I don't know , five maybe ? phd f: Yeah , but we actually phd a: So , look at it , t number of words times five . That 's not that not phd f: Oh , so you mean pause phones take up a lot of the long pause phones . grad c: So I think it it 's debatable whether you want to do phone - level in the same thing . grad c: But I think , a anything at frame - level , even P - file , is too verbose . phd f: I haven't seen this particular format , phd a: I 've I 've used them . phd a: I 've forgot what the str phd d: But , wait a minute , P - file for each frame is storing a vector of cepstral or PLP values , grad c: It 's whatever you want , actually . grad c: So that what 's nice about the P - file It i Built into it is the concept of frames , utterances , sentences , that sort of thing , that structure . So , the only problem with it is it 's actually storing the utterance numbers and the frame numbers in the file , even though they 're always sequential . Is there some documentation on this somewhere ? grad c: Yeah , there 's a ton of it . I I was just looking for something I 'm not a database person , but something sort of standard enough that , you know , if we start using this we can give it out , other people can work on it , grad c: Yeah , it 's not standard . phd f: or Is it ? grad c: it 's something that we developed at ICSI . But ,  phd f: But it 's been used here grad c: But it 's been used here phd f: and people 've grad c: and and , you know , we have a well - configured system that you can distribute for free , and phd d: it must be the equivalent of whatever you guys used to store feat your computed features in , right ? phd f: OK . phd a: Yeah , th we have Actually , we we use a generalization of the the Sphere format . phd a: but Yeah , so there is something like that but it 's , probably not as sophist grad c: Well , what does H T K do for features ? phd d: And I think there 's grad c: Or does it even have a concept of features ? phd a: They ha it has its own  , Entropic has their own feature format that 's called , like , S - SD or some so SF or something like that . grad c: I 'm just wondering , would it be worth while to use that instead ? phd d: Yeah . Th - this is exactly the kind of decision It 's just whatever phd d: But , people don't typically share this kind of stuff , right ? phd a: Right . phd f: Actually , I I just you know , we we 've done this stuff on prosodics and three or four places have asked for those prosodic files , and we just have an ASCII , output of frame - by - frame . phd f: Which is fine , but it gets unwieldy to go in and and query these files with really huge files . I was just thinking if there 's something that where all the frame values are grad c: And a and again , if you have a if you have a two - hour - long meeting , that 's gonna phd f:  ? They 're they 're fair they 're quite large . phd f: and So it 's doable , it 's just that you can only store a feature vector at frame - by - frame and it doesn't have any kind of , phd d: Is is the sharing part of this a pretty important consideration phd f:  phd d: or does that just sort of ,  a nice thing to have ? phd f: I I don't know enough about what we 're gonna do with the data . But I thought it would be good to get something that we can that other people can use or adopt for their own kinds of encoding . phd f: And especially for the prosody work , what what it ends up being is you get features from the signal , and of course those change every time your alignments change . So you re - run a recognizer , you want to recompute your features , and then keep the database up to date . phd f: Or you change a word , or you change a utterance boundary segment , which is gonna happen a lot . And so I wanted something where all of this can be done in a elegant way and that if somebody wants to try something or compute something else , that it can be done flexibly .  , it doesn't have to be pretty , it just has to be , you know , easy to use , and grad c: Yeah , the other thing We should look at ATLAS , the NIST thing , phd f: Oh . phd f:  grad c: I 'm not sure what to do about this with ATLAS , because they chose a different route . Your your file format can know about know that you 're talking about language and speech , which is what I chose , and time , or your file format can just be a graph representation . So what it looked like ATLAS chose is , they chose the other way , which was their file format is just nodes and links , and you have to interpret what they mean yourself . phd f: And why did you not choose that type of approach ? grad c: because I knew that we were doing speech , and I thought it was better if you 're looking at a raw file to be t for the tags to say \" it 's an utterance \" , as opposed to the tag to say \" it 's a link \" . grad c: So , but phd f: But other than that , are they compatible ?  , you could sort of grad c: Yeah , they 're reasonably compatible . phd f: Yeah , that 's w So , grad c: So , well , the other thing is if we choose to use ATLAS , which maybe we should just do , we should just throw this out before we invest a lot of time in it . phd f: just sort of how to  , cuz we need to come up with a database like this just to do our work . And I actually don't care , as long as it 's something useful to other people , what we choose . phd f: So maybe it 's maybe oth you know , if if you have any idea of how to choose , cuz I don't . phd a: Do they already have tools ? grad c: I I chose this for a couple reasons . phd f: And you can have as much information in the tag as you want , right ? grad c: Well , I have it structured . So what What NIST would say is that instead of doing this , you would say something like \" link start equals , you know , some node ID , phd f: Yeah . So grad c: end equals some other node ID \" , and then \" type \" would be \" utterance \" . phd f: So why would it be a a waste to do it this way if it 's similar enough that we can always translate it ? phd d: It probably wouldn't be a waste . It would mean that at some point if we wanted to switch , we 'd just have to translate everything . But it se Since they are developing a big phd f: But it but that sounds phd d: But that 's I don't think that 's a big deal . And so it seems to me that if if we want to use that , we might as well go directly to what they 're doing , rather than phd a: If we want to Do they already have something that 's that would be useful for us in place ? phd d: Yeah .  , how stable is their Are they ready to go , grad c: The I looked at it phd d: or ? grad c: The last time I looked at it was a while ago , probably a year ago , when we first started talking about this . Since then , they 've developed their own external file format , which is , you know , this sort of s this sort of thing .  , and apparently they 've also developed a lot of tools , but I haven't looked at them . phd f: would the tools would the tools run on something like this , if you can translate them anyway ? grad c: th what would would would what would worry me is that maybe we might miss a little detail phd a: It 's a hassle phd f: that I guess it 's a question that phd a: if phd f: yeah . phd a: I I think if it 's conceptually close , and they already have or will have tools that everybody else will be using , it would be crazy to do something s you know , separate that phd f: OK . phd f: Actually , so it 's that that would really be the question , is just what you would feel is in the long run the best thing . phd f: Cuz once we start , sort of , doing this I don't we don't actually have enough time to probably have to rehash it out again grad c: The Yep . The other thing the other way that I sort of established this was as easy translation to and from the Transcriber format . But , I suppose that as long as they have a type here that specifies \" utt \" , grad c: It 's almost the same . phd f: it 's yeah , close enough that grad c: The the the the point is with this , though , is that you can't really add any supplementary information . Right ? So if you suddenly decide that you want phd f: You have to make a different type . phd f: So Well , if you look at it and  , I guess in my mind I don't know enough Jane would know better , about the types of annotations and and But I imagine that those are things that would well , you guys mentioned this , that could span any it could be in its own channel , it could span time boundaries of any type , grad c: Right . And then at the prosody - level we have frame sort of like cepstral feature files , grad c: Yep . And that 's sort of the world of things that I And then we have the aligned channels , of course , grad c: Right . phd a: And then phd f: I I definitely agree and I wanted to find actually a f a nicer format or a maybe a more compact format than what we used before . phd f: Just cuz you 've got ten channels or whatever and two hours of a meeting . phd a: Now now how would you how would you represent , multiple speakers in this framework ? Were You would just represent them as grad c: phd a: You would have like a speaker tag or something ? grad c: there 's a spea speaker tag up at the top which identifies them and then each utt the way I had it is each turn or each utterance , I don't even remember now , had a speaker ID tag attached to it . grad c: And in this format you would have a different tag , which which would , be linked to the link . grad c:  Let 's see , would it be a node or a link ?  And so so this one would have , an ID is link link seventy - four or something like that . grad c: And then somewhere up here you would have a link that that , you know , was referencing L - seventy - four and had speaker Adam . phd f: Actually , it 's the channel , I think , that phd a: Well , channel or speaker or whatever . phd f: w yeah , channel is what the channelized output out phd a: It doesn't grad c: This isn't quite right . phd f: Yeah , but phd a: But but so how in the NIST format do we express a hierarchical relationship between , say , an utterance and the words within it ? So how do you tell that these are the words that belong to that utterance ? grad c: you would have another structure lower down than this that would be saying they 're all belonging to this ID . And then each utterance could refer to a turn , phd d: So it 's it 's not hi it 's sort of bottom - up . phd f: And what if you actually have So right now what you have as utterance , the closest thing that comes out of the channelized is the stuff between the segment boundaries that the transcribers put in or that Thilo put in , which may or may not actually be , like , a s it 's usually not  , the beginning and end of a sentence , say . phd f: So , I assume this is possible , that if you have someone annotates the punctuation or whatever when they transcribe , you can say , you know , from for from the c beginning of the sentence to the end of the sentence , from the annotations , this is a unit , even though it never actually i It 's only a unit by virtue of the annotations at the word - level . grad c: And , what phd f: But it 's just not overtly in the phd a: OK . phd f: cuz this is exactly the kind of phd a: So phd f: I think that should be possible as long as the But , what I don't understand is where the where in this type of file that would be expressed . phd f: S so it would just be floating before the sentence or floating after the sentence without a time - mark . grad c: You could have some sort of link type type equals \" sentence \" , and ID is \" S - whatever \" . phd a:  grad c: Can you can you say that this is part of this , phd f: See , cuz it 's phd a: Hhh . phd f: it 's phd d: You would just have a r phd f: S grad c: or do you say this is part of this ? I think phd d: You would refer up to the sentence . phd f: But they 're phd a: Well , the thing phd f: they 're actually overlapping each other , sort of . grad c: So phd a: the thing is that some something may be a part of one thing for one purpose and another thing of another purpose . phd a: s  , well , s let 's let 's ta so let 's grad c: Well , I think I 'm I think w I had better look at it again phd f: Yeah . phd a: y So for instance @ @ sup grad c: There 's one level there 's one more level of indirection that I 'm forgetting . phd a: Suppose you have a word sequence and you have two different segmentations of that same word sequence . phd a: I don't know if that 's true or not but let 's as phd f: Well , it 's definitely true with the segment . phd f: That 's what I exactly what I meant by the utterances versus the sentence could be sort of phd a: Yeah . So , you want to be s you want to say this this word is part of that sentence and this prosodic phrase . grad c: I I 'm pretty sure that you can do that , but I 'm forgetting the exact level of nesting . phd a: So , you would have to have two different pointers from the word up one level up , one to the sent grad c: So so what you would end up having is a tag saying \" here 's a word , and it starts here and it ends here \" . grad c: And then lower down you would say \" here 's a prosodic boundary and it has these words in it \" . phd f: So you would be able to go in and say , you know , \" give me all the words in the bound in the prosodic phrase grad c: Yep . The the o the other issue that you had was , how do you actually efficiently extract ,  find and extract information in a structure of this type ? phd f: OK . phd a: So you gave some examples like phd f: Well , and , you guys might I don't know if this is premature because I suppose once you get the representation you can do this , but the kinds of things I was worried about is , phd a: No , that 's not clear . phd f:  phd a: yeah , you c sure you can do it , phd f: Well , OK . So i if it phd a: but can you do it sort of l l you know , it phd f: I  , I can't do it , but I can  , phd a: y y you gotta you gotta do this you you 're gonna want to do this very quickly grad c: Well phd a: or else you 'll spend all your time sort of searching through very complex data structures phd f: Right . But an example would be \" find all the cases in which Adam started to talk while Andreas was talking and his pitch was rising , Andreas 's pitch \" .  , that 's gonna be Is the rising pitch a feature , or is it gonna be in the same file ? phd f: Well , the rising pitch will never be hand - annotated . So the all the prosodic features are going to be automatically grad c: But the  , that 's gonna be hard regardless , phd f: So they 're gonna be in those grad c: right ? Because you 're gonna have to write a program that goes through your feature file and looks for rising pitches . So normally what we would do is we would say \" what do we wanna assign rising pitch to ? \" Are we gonna assign it to words ? Are we gonna just assign it to sort of when it 's rising we have a begin - end rise representation ? But suppose we dump out this file and we say , for every word we just classify it as , w you know , rise or fall or neither ? grad c: OK . grad c: r phd f: So we would basically be sort of , taking the format and enriching it with things that we wanna query in relation to the words that are already in the file , grad c: Right . phd a: You want sort of a grep that 's that works at the structural on the structural representation . There 's a standard again in XML , specifically for searching XML documents structured X - XML documents , where you can specify both the content and the structural position . phd a: Yeah , but it 's it 's not clear that that 's That 's relative to the structure of the XML document , phd f: If phd a: not to the structure of what you 're representing in the document . grad c: It 's it 's you would use that to build your tool to do that sort of search . phd f: But as long as the grad c: It 's a graph , but phd a: That 's different from searching through the text . phd f: But it seems like as long as the features that grad c: Well , no , no , no . phd a:  grad c: So that  th phd f: That 's true if the features from your acoustics or whatever that are not explicitly in this are at the level of these types . phd f: That that if you can do that grad c: Yeah , but that 's gonna be the trouble no matter what . Right ? No matter what format you choose , you 're gonna have the trou you 're gonna have the difficulty of relating the the frame - level features phd f: That 's right . phd f: You know , it Or another example was , you know , where in the language where in the word sequence are people interrupting ? So , I guess that one 's actually easier . phd d: What about what about , the idea of using a relational database to , store the information from the XML ? So you would have XML basically would  , you you could use the XML to put the data in , and then when you get data out , you put it back in XML . phd d: but then you store the data in the database , which allows you to do all kinds of good search things in there . grad c: The ,  One of the things that ATLAS is doing is they 're trying to define an API which is independent of the back store , phd f: Huh . grad c: so that , you could define a single API and the the storage could be flat XML files or a database . grad c: My opinion on that is for the s sort of stuff that we 're doing , I suspect it 's overkill to do a full relational database , that , just a flat file and , search tools I bet will be enough . phd a: But grad c: But that 's the advantage of ATLAS , is that if we actually take decide to go that route completely and we program to their API , then if we wanted to add a database later it would be pretty easy . phd f: It seems like the kind of thing you 'd do if I don't know , if people start adding all kinds of s bells and whistles to the data . And so that might be  , it 'd be good for us to know to use a format where we know we can easily , input that to some database if other people are using it . grad c: I guess I 'm just a little hesitant to try to go whole hog on sort of the the whole framework that that NIST is talking about , with ATLAS and a database and all that sort of stuff , phd f: So grad c: cuz it 's a big learning curve , just to get going . grad c: Whereas if we just do a flat file format , sure , it may not be as efficient but everyone can program in Perl and and use it . grad c: Right ? phd a: But this is grad c: So , as opposed to phd a: I I 'm still , not convinced that you can do much at all on the text on the flat file that that you know , the text representation . e Because the text representation is gonna be , not reflecting the structure of of your words and annotations . It 's just it 's grad c: Well , if it 's not representing it , then how do you recover it ? Of course it 's representing it . You you have to what you have to do is you have to basically grad c: That 's the whole point . grad c: Right ? So what I was saying is that phd a: But that 's what you 'll have to do . And it 's a set of tools that let you specify given the D - DDT DTD of the document , what sorts of structural searches you want to do . So you want to say that , you know , you 're looking for , a tag within a tag within a particular tag that has this particular text in it , and , refers to a particular value . And so the point isn't that an end - user , who is looking for a query like you specified , wouldn't program it in this language . phd f: Is a See , I think the kinds of questions , at least in the next to the end of this year , are there may be a lot of different ones , but they 'll all have a similar nature . They 'll be looking at either a word - level prosodic , an a value , grad c:   But you know , we 'll do something where we some kind of data reduction where the prosodic features are sort o  , either at the word - level or at the segment - level , grad c: Right . They 're not gonna be at the phone - level and they 're no not gonna be at the frame - level when we get done with sort of giving them simpler shapes and things .  , one that Chuck mentioned is starting out with something that we don't have to start over , that we don't have to throw away if other people want to extend it for other kinds of questions , grad c: Right . phd f: and being able to at least get enough , information out on where we condition the location of features on information that 's in the kind of file that you put up there . grad c: And so it seems to me that  , I have to look at it again to see whether it can really do what we want , but if we use the ATLAS external file representation , it seems like it 's rich enough that you could do quick tools just as I said in Perl , and then later on if we choose to go up the learning curve , we can use the whole ATLAS inter infrastructure , phd f: Yeah . phd f: I I don't So if if you would l look at that and let us know what you think . phd f: I think we 're sort of guinea pigs , cuz I I want to get the prosody work done but I don't want to waste time , you know , getting the phd a: Oh , maybe phd f: Yeah ? phd a:  grad c: Well , I wouldn't wait for the formats , because anything you pick we 'll be able to translate to another form . phd a: Well Ma well , maybe you should actually look at it yourself too to get a sense of what it is you 'll you 'll be dealing with , phd f: OK . phd a: because , you know , Adam might have one opinion but you might have another , so grad b: Yeah . phd f: Especially if there 's , e  you know , if someone can help with at least the the setup of the right grad c: Hi , Jane . phd f: the right representation , then , i you know , I hope it won't We don't actually need the whole full - blown thing to be ready , grad c: Can you Oh , well .  , so maybe if you guys can look at it and sort of see what , grad b: Yeah . phd f:  I think we 're we 're we 're actually just grad c: We 're about done . phd f: wrapping up , but ,  Yeah , sorry , it 's a  short meeting , but ,  Well , I don't know . Is there anything else , like  that helps me a lot , grad c: Well , I think the other thing we might want to look at is alternatives to P - file . phd f: but grad c: th the reason I like P - file is I 'm already familiar with it , we have expertise here , and so if we pick something else , there 's the learning - curve problem . phd a: Is there an is there an IP - API ? grad c: And so Yeah . And , phd a: There used to be a problem that they get too large , grad c: a bunch of libraries , P - file utilities . phd a: and so basically the  the filesystem wouldn't grad c: Well , that 's gonna be a problem no matter what . phd a: Maybe you could extend the API to , support , like splitting up , you know , conceptually one file into smaller files on disk so that you can essentially , you know , have arbitrarily long f grad c: Yep . That that most many of them can s you can specify several P - files and they 'll just be done sequentially . phd f: So , I guess , yeah , if if you and Don can if you can show him the P - file stuff and see . grad c: if you do \" man P - file \" or \" apropos P - file \" , you 'll see a lot . phd f: Yeah ? phd d: I don't remember what the \" P \" is , though . grad c: But there are ni they 're The Quicknet library has a bunch of things in it to handle P - files , phd a: Yeah . phd a:  phd f: And that isn't really , I guess , as important as the the main I don't know what you call it , the the main sort of word - level grad c: Neither do I .  , so grad c: Yeah , I 've been meaning to look at the ATLAS stuff again anyway . I guess it 's also sort of a political deci  , if if you feel like that 's a community that would be good to tie into anyway , then it 's sounds like it 's worth doing . grad c: Yeah , I think it it w phd a: j I think there 's grad c: And , w  , as I said , I what I did with this stuff I based it on theirs . So now that they have come up with a format , it doesn't it seems pretty reasonable to use it . grad c: As I said , that phd f: Cuz we actually can start grad c: There 's one level there 's one more level of indirection and I 'm just blanking on exactly how it works . phd f: we can start with , I guess , this input from Dave 's , which you had printed out , the channelized input . Cuz he has all of the channels , you know , with the channels in the tag and stuff like that . And so then it would just be a matter of getting making sure to handle the annotations that are , you know , not at the word - level and , t to import the grad b: Where are those annotations coming from ? phd f: Well , right now , I g Jane would would grad c:   postdoc e: Are you talking about the overlap a annotations ? phd f: Yeah , any kind of annotation that , like , isn't already there . And since we w we I I think it 's important to remain flexible regarding the time bins for now . And so it 's nice to have However , you know , you want to have it , time time  , located in the discourse . So , if we if we tie the overlap code to the first word in the overlap , then you 'll have a time - marking . It won't it 'll be independent of the time bins , however these e evolve , shrink , or whatever , increase , or Also , you could have different time bins for different purposes . And having it tied to the first word in an overlap segment is unique , you know , anchored , clear . postdoc e: Or the ? phd d: I 'm not sure what that @ @ grad c: Well , is that phd d: It probably doesn't matter . phd d: No , I d postdoc e: We don't have to go into the codes . W the idea is just to have a separate green ribbon , you know , and and and let 's say that this is a time bin . This is the first word of an overlapping segment of any length , overlapping with any other , word  , i segment of any length . And , then you can indicate that this here was perhaps a ch a backchannel , or you can say that it was , a usurping of the turn , or you can you know , any any number of categories . But the fact is , you have it time - tagged in a way that 's independent of the , sp particular time bin that the word ends up in . postdoc e: we sh change the boundaries of the units , it 's still unique and and , fits with the format , phd f: Right . phd a: it would be nice  , eh , gr this is sort of r regarding  ,  it 's related but not directly germane to the topic of discussion , but , when it comes to annotations , you often find yourself in the situation where you have different annotations of the same , say , word sequence . phd a: And sometimes the word sequences even differ slightly because they were edited s at one place but not the other . phd a: So , once this data gets out there , some people might start annotating this for , I don't know , dialogue acts or , you know , topics or what the heck . And the only thing that is really sort of common among all the versi the various versions of this data is the word sequence , or approximately . But , see , if you 'd annotate dialogue acts , you don't necessarily want to or topics you don't really want to be dealing with time - marks . phd a: You 'd it 's much more efficient for them to just see the word sequence , right ? phd f:   phd a: most people aren't as sophisticated as as we are here with , you know , time alignments and stuff . So So the the the point is grad c: Should should we mention some names on the people who are n ? phd a: Right . So , the p my point is that you 're gonna end up with , word sequences that are differently annotated . And you want some tool , that is able to sort of merge these different annotations back into a single , version . OK ?  , and we had this problem very massively , at SRI when we worked , a while back on ,  well , on dialogue acts as well as , you know , what was it ?  , phd f: Well , all the Switchboard in it . phd a: Because we had one set of annotations that were based on , one version of the transcripts with a particular segmentation , and then we had another version that was based on , a different s slightly edited version of the transcripts with a different segmentation . So , we had these two different versions which were you know , you could tell they were from the same source but they weren't identical . So it was extremely hard to reliably merge these two back together to correlate the information from the different annotations . But once you have a file format , I can imagine writing not personally , but someone writing a tool that is essentially an alignment tool , that mediates between various versions , phd f:   phd a: and  , sort of like th  , you know , you have this thing in UNIX where you have , diff . phd a: There 's the , diff that actually tries to reconcile different two diffs f based on the same original . phd a: Something like that , but operating on these lattices that are really what 's behind this  , this annotation format . phd a: So grad c: There 's actually a diff library you can use to do things like that that so you have different formats . phd f: You could definitely do that with the phd a: So somewhere in the API you would like to have like a merge or some some function that merges two two versions . phd f: But the one thing that would work here actually for i that is more reliable than the utterances is the the speaker ons and offs . So if you have a good , grad c: But this is exactly what  , is that that the problem i phd f:  Yeah . The problem is saying \" what are the semantics , phd f: And grad c: what do you mean by \" merge \" ? \" phd f: Right , right . So so just to let you know what we where we kluged it by , doing  , by doing Hhh . phd a: Both were based on words , so , bo we have two versions of the same words intersp you know , sprinkled with with different tags for annotations . phd a: And that 's how grad c: That 's just wh how I would have done it . But , you know , it had lots of errors and things would end up in the wrong order , and so forth . phd a: it it was a kluge because it was basically reducing everything to  , to  , to textual alignment . grad c: A textual phd a: so phd f: But , d isn't that something where whoever if if the people who are making changes , say in the transcripts , cuz this all happened when the transcripts were different ye  , if they tie it to something , like if they tied it to the acoustic segment if they You know what  ? Then Or if they tied it to an acoustic segment and we had the time - marks , that would help . phd f: But the problem is exactly as Adam said , that you get , you know , y you don't have that information or it 's lost in the merge somehow , postdoc e: Well , can I ask one question ? phd f: so postdoc e: It it seems to me that , we will have o an official version of the corpus , which will be only one one version in terms of the words where the words are concerned . We 'd still have the the merging issue maybe if coding were done independently of the phd a: And you 're gonna get that postdoc e: But but phd a: because if the data gets out , people will do all kinds of things to it . And , s you know , several years from now you might want to look into , the prosody of referring expressions . And so that 's exactly what we should somehow when you distribute the data , say that you know , that have some way of knowing how to merge it back in and asking people to try to do that . postdoc e: Well , then the phd d: What 's what 's wrong with doing times ? I postdoc e: I agree . phd f: yeah , time is the grad c: Well , postdoc e: Time is unique . You were saying that you didn't think we should phd f: Time is passing ! phd a: Time time times are ephemeral . grad c: what if they haven't notated with them , times ? phd f: Yeah . postdoc e: But then couldn't you just indirectly figure out the time tied to the word ? phd f: But still they Exactly . phd d: But can they change the words without changing the time of the word ? grad c: Sure . The the point is , that that they may have annotated it off a word transcript that isn't the same as our word transcript , so how do you merge it back in ? I understand what you 're saying . grad c: And I I guess the answer is , it 's gonna be different every time . grad c: I it 's exactly what I said before , phd f: You only know the boundaries of the grad c: which is that \" what do you mean by \" merge \" ? \" So in this case where you have the words and you don't have the times , well , what do you mean by \" merge \" ? If you tell me what you mean , I can write a program to do it . phd f: And beyond that , all you know is is relative ordering and sometimes even that is wrong . grad c: So so in so in this one you would have to do a best match between the word sequences , phd f: So . grad c: extract the times f from the best match of theirs to yours , and use that . postdoc e: But it could be that they just  , it could be that they chunked they they lost certain utterances and all that stuff , grad c: Right , exactly . phd f: Well , I guess , w I I didn't want to keep people too long and Adam wanted t people I 'll read the digits . phd f: if not , I guess phd a: For th for the for the benefit of science we 'll read the digits "

        "Summary": "The team discussed potential improvements for their model, specifically focusing on MSG and multi-band. However, the professor acknowledged that the task was challenging and their current model was not yet suitable for a real system. Despite this, the team was enthusiastic about the Aurora data, which provided a more realistic scenario, and expressed their interest in continuing to explore the task. The professor emphasized the need for further work and encouraged the team to share any ideas they had for pursuing new directions.

Alright . industrial designer: And why did you choose this animal ? marketing: So project manager: He said it was slow . marketing: A cat who had an accident or project manager: Why a cat ? industrial designer:  yeah I dunno . Yeah I'm not so good at drawing with this kind of project manager: The pen , industrial designer: st Oh shit . It's my favourite  pet animal , 'cause they're cute , they're independent and cuddly , I dunno . industrial designer: Or do I need to use more colours and project manager: I think it's okay . Okay industrial designer: So we have to s project manager: now it's time for some discussion . project manager:  did any of you already do some work on this part or industrial designer: Well I started making an overview for myself ,  what I had to do , 'cause we have three design steps and in every step I have a s specific task to perform or whatever . industrial designer: So I had to  , I dunno , make an overview for myself about what I have to do , project manager: industrial designer: and kind of let it work in to get ideas about well how I have to fill it . And do you have any ideas about the product  so far ? industrial designer: Well I started I started with the first phase , I think was the functional . industrial designer: And  let's see I had to focus on the working design , which you said . industrial designer: and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the T_V_ . Yeah I kept it global 'cause that it activates or deactivates specific functions , user interface: Okay , yeah . project manager:  and what did the Marketing Expert do ? marketing:  well from a marketing  perspective ,  well the function des design phase  consists out of the user requirements . marketing:  what needs and desires are to be fulfilled ? So there are a few means to reach that  by by doing research  to see what existing products are there out in the market . marketing:  especially what are their shortcomings ? Are there any new functions  which can be added to our product ? project manager: For example for  well what kind of applications do current remote controls support , and what are f featur features of  current and future televisions ? project manager: Yep . What w what would they like to see  on a new remote control ?  especially for future users , project manager: Okay . marketing:  I'm thinking of early adopters , because they they use new technology first , project manager: marketing: and they play with a lot of tools and stuff so maybe they have some good ideas to  to add . project manager:  but have you any idea so far as what  the user requirements are ? marketing: No n not specifically . user interface: I got some  requirements marketing: and project manager: Yeah ? user interface: it has  it has to be user-friendly . user interface:  really easy to use buttons , not not  very small buttons , but not the the also the big big buttons , but just normal buttons . project manager:  what do you mean by that ? user interface:  the distance  from your television to your  remote control has to be ,  yeah  yeah , quite a big distance . project manager:  user interface: Are you going to put the the notes on the project manager: Yeah , in the project folder . industrial designer: Well no I'm just a bit wondering what we're gonna do the next  session ? user interface: Yeah . Because then we have a user interface: After that we are going to the conceptual  project manager: Yeah . project manager: Y you do some individual work , marketing: We're just working the three phases . And then I have to prepare  I have to defend our design , user interface: project manager: so make it good . marketing: Better make it industrial designer: I am gonna work on the conceptual design already 'cause yeah it's fairly important to know what kind of components we want to put in . industrial designer: Do we  , is it gonna be a multimedia control centre ? Do we want to be able to use the video recorder with it ? marketing: Yeah . user interface: I would first m industrial designer: So if I don't know what components to put in , it's kind of hard . marketing: Yeah project manager: You can always add a few marketing: well like l li like some like some some remotes who are out there , which I know , there's one button which is very easy to switch between devices . marketing: So you can switch to your video project manager: marketing: and then the same buttons control your video . marketing: And another function I'll think of switch to your media centre , because that's getting very popular . industrial designer: Yeah so marketing: And then use your Windows media centre under your T_V_ with the same remote control . industrial designer: Yeah I I know what you mean , but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player . industrial designer: And and for a t  teletext you need additional buttons as well , marketing: No . project manager: We could just start with the assumption that's only for T_V_ and video "

        "Article": "project manager: Okay , is everybody ready ? industrial designer: Yeah ? marketing: Yeah I'd to just put on my microphone here and I'll be right with you . marketing: Okay ? project manager:  I take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do industrial designer:  ? user interface: Yes . project manager: marketing: Well , could you  put my slides up 'cause I think it might be helpful if  we looked at the slides at the same time . marketing: so the functional requirements are is is part of my goal but why don't we pass right to the second slide . Right well  since I'm in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since I have to try to sell it . marketing:  I thought that the method I should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody , and th the reason I just put that there like that is that  in the init in the initial stage I think I should just be open to lots of suggestions . You know you can say anything you want no matter how silly it sounds you know it should run your car , it should heat up your motor if should  turn on your C_D_ whatever you want it to do industrial designer: 'Kay . marketing:  and then as we go on what we'll have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to  design and budget feasibility . So I'll be coming to you  frequently as the Industrial Expert to tell me how hard it's gonna be to add a feature or how expensive it's gonna be or if your time , if it takes five years to develop this it's just something we can't do . marketing: So in the beginning just have a big puddle of things that we anybody can th throw anything in industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: and then just weed things out that can't be done for one reason or another , and then the things that seem the most attractive that to  to a customer we'll try to then prioritise those . marketing: So that was  what I meant there , and as I said on the slide there consulting the Industrial Engineer about that and the other thing is timing is really gonna be as important as money , because if we're gonna sell this thing , I think the best time to sell it is as a Christmas present . Twenty five Euros makes a nice little present , and we want it to be an impulse purchase , industrial designer:  . marketing: we want somebody to see it and think it's , gee I just gotta have that . So it's gotta be really attractive and it but it's gotta go to market by September , 'cause anything that you don't already have out there in September showing it around , isn't gonna sell for Christmas . marketing:  and then I'll be coming to you as the User Interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to prior help me with that prioritising of  of the features and of the the look and the colour user interface: Okay . marketing: and I'll be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view . marketing: So I'll be coming to you for how much is it gonna cost us and how long is it gonna take you , industrial designer:  marketing: and I'll be coming to you to tell me what's gonna make somebody take out their wallet you know , user interface: What features . marketing: what what's what's gonna really be what they call a sizzle , user interface: S sellable . industrial designer: marketing: A lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view isn't the thing that somebody's really just gonna take out their wallet and buy for Christmas for for their child or for their husband or whatever . marketing: Okay can we go to the next slide please ? Alright I I already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the  the whole house idea really isn't gonna be possible . So I'd like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where I was saying we we could suggest anything . project manager: marketing: I'd like the suggestions to be really specific , so that we'll have a list of things we can cross off , not something like you know whole house control what'll be And then I found on the internet from from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible . At the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at , we should be able to make it work the T_V_ , the V_C_R_ , the stereo set  maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp . project manager:  okay , can can I at this point interject  something ? marketing: I have to wind up ? Yeah , sure .  the one thing for example something to eliminate maybe that's the teletext , marketing: Okay . project manager: and according to to higher management the it should only control the T_V_ , marketing: project manager: mostly because they feel that it's too comp complex a task to  to to include other things , industrial designer: Complicated , yeah , of course . project manager:  and the marketing: Okay , so that's something project manager: and the third thing that they wanna make sure  that their that the corporate image is being maintained , and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product , so that it's easy that that that they can be easily identified as a product of of of the company , and that there's no mistake that it could be somebody else who is bringing this out . project manager: So I just wanted to interject this here so we're not getting too much off track here with  with the things we wanna look at . These were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate  these things , so it's only gonna be T_V_ , marketing: Okay so project manager: but the one thing maybe that could be  eliminated is the teletext  idea .  alright now other things that I found out on in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now . 'Cause a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use , and that was thirty four percent but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room .  so those are two things that we definitely do wanna address ,  we wanna s make it as simple as possible , we wanna make it  obvious and intuitive to use , and then the things about finding it we talked about the a light emitting thing as well as  maybe a beep , and I think that those are things after my research that we definitely wanna try to incorporate . 'Kay can we go to the next slide please ? Okay , so , my personal preferences in this  project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle .  because once there's no be-back , well in sales they always say you know , be-backs don't come back . industrial designer: marketing: If somebody says , oh I'll come back and get it next week you're dead . You've gotta make it attractive enough so they buy it now now now w now is a big word in in my book for selling this thing . And , in order to make it really sellable we've gotta shorten the learning curve , make sure it's really intuitive and easy to use . We have to have as few buttons as possible , because more buttons is more confusion , so that's why I'm saying , simplicity is good . Finding it's important , obviously you can't use it if you can't find it . So we've gotta concentrate on the features that help you find it , and I've already said this several times but I put it down in writing here , it should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five Euros . So it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it they say ,  twenty five Euros I'm not gonna take that .  and then maybe a motto , like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign . project manager: And you are number three ? industrial designer: Number two , project manager: Number two . industrial designer: The metal is like  in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller . It takes the power from a battery say a battery it it can be a elec an electric supply like you have to  like  switch connec connect connect your remote controller to  power supply from the you know electricity or something like that . It should be a battery because   remote controller should be like you you you should take it t to wherever you want and then   th marketing: industrial designer: this integrated circuitry takes energy from the power source and whatever like if you press a button it's like a input for the remote controller and it takes the input and it it transforms into a infro infrared bits and it sends it into the device , like a T_V_ or a air conditioner , something like that so . If you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency like  th the remote controller it sends some bits some  waves like with a particular frequency the device should know what the frequency is . It should re re recognise the  waves which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action like if you press a button channel or something like that then  the remote  remote controller will send a send a se send a signal , marketing: Signal . industrial designer: and the T_V_ it should translate that into like change the channel or something like that , change the volume control user interface: Receive . project manager: Yo and it's marketing: Yeah well that's already been eliminated by management , so we're off the hook . So  user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages like there should be a user user in interface like you know switch pad or something like that buttons should be there . So  you can control whatever you want , you want to change the channel you want to control the volume you you want to  mute  mute the  T_V_ or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations there's a there should be some device to tell what to do to the  in  integrated circuit so that the integrated circuit can s send the signals and T_V_ can perform the actions . industrial designer: So I I just would like to  add some extra features to the remote controller  I think these are the very simple features and  they don't take much   much of the   investment also , marketing: industrial designer: it's like el the text or buttons which  which are there on the  remote controller they those we can make   like fluorescent  they'll be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote controller if it is dark . industrial designer: And ther there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and a and she she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that it's this this is not a a you know a a action , there can be no action taking to that so . And there should be a child lock , like   you should be able to lock your remote controller so that   whatever buttons are pressed by a child they can't be like y you i you if you have ki kids and all then they'll be pl playing with the remote controllers so can lock the remote controller . If make it useable for more than one device it's a it's hard but I think it's possible project manager: Yeah well yeah well that has been e that has been eliminated , so that's that's unfortunately a moot point now . And  different shapes that we can do like  we can have you know a all animals shapes or you know comfortable  whi which can fit into your hands project manager: industrial designer: and  so that  marketing: Now that's good from a marketing point of view , the fun the fun shape . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah , yeah and colours also , different colours , and project manager: Yeah I user interface: - colours . marketing: And that you you say that won't add too much to the budget ? industrial designer: No no no , it won't  I don't think it will be like , marketing: To d the shape is  industrial designer: you can have you know for  if you want ther there to be more project manager: It just build a mould basically and  you know . project manager: As the budget we're looking at if you build one mould I don't think that's going to make a big difference whether it's gonna be square or industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Do you think there's any chance of  having ser in having basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes ? industrial designer: Yeah that is also possible I  yeah I I yeah . project manager: I think we will have to look at the budget on that industrial designer: Yeah that will be project manager: but I think in principle that that would be that would be kind of fun , you know . marketing: Because we had something sort of sexy for adults and we could have something sort of industrial designer: marketing: silly for children project manager: Like an animal or marketing: or a little animal shape or in a or a little elephant so they can remember where it is . industrial designer: And and the butto buttons also I think if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons . If you have less features then your remote controller won't be attractive , so I think  we need to make some buttons which are which are like   f in  in intended for two or three operations , like if you press one button in one mode then it will change the channel , if you press the other button in another mode it will change the colour . So if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but I think it will complicate the matter more I think so . Well , I think I think that that's something that we'll have to discuss  with the User Interface person user interface: Yes . marketing: because I think there's a lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature . Because I think one of the things were complaining about in my what I found out in my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one . marketing:  you and I , all f all four of us we work with computers all the time , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: changing modes is nothing for us , but people who project manager: Yeah , a little elderly , a little arthritic hand you know , marketing: N and project manager: and and it's a small button and and it they don't press it exactly industrial designer: project manager: you know something else happens n not their favourite channel comes up but something else industrial designer: Yeah , yes . marketing: And that's and that's the kind of thing people learn by feel , and  you don't feel the mode change . marketing: You know , like the a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels , so that people can  develop a tactile sense of it . industrial designer: yeah , and also text should be very clear so that there there won't be any ambiguities and  marketing: That's right , yeah . project manager: industrial designer: And  display clock i if you want more features then we can display a clock it I I don't think it will take any money extra money because anyway we have an integrated circuit I think we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit so it's marketing: Yeah , that's that's a good that's a good one , project manager: - , industrial designer: Yeah , and then you can just see your remote controller yeah yeah yeah so project manager: Yeah you're sitting there already or maybe you have no other  user interface: Yes . marketing: and Yeah , and a lot of time there's not a clock on the screen , and you have to go somewhere but you just wanna look at the news for a minute . industrial designer:  components  the main components we need for  it ha like buttons and  underneath that there should be switch . Like  we can have a bulb like whenever we are operating a remote controller or  whenever the T_V_ is on suppose , user interface:  . industrial designer: Then it will be like if you switch on your T_V_ through anoth another source , not from through a remote remote controller and you you lost your remote controller maybe you can find with the light . industrial designer: chip which is like a brain to the remote controller which does all the operations , project manager: And   of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things and , you know different shapes or whatever it is there should be a case to put to give a shape .  I have referred the site  the homepage of the  our website ,  from where I have   I got s few points . marketing: So it  we should visit this site and have a look at  what's up there ? Or industrial designer:  . industrial designer:  it's not like that , I have referred the page to get new ideas or like what can be the working design to how it works and all and so and so . Could you go back to that slide where she had that  s slide up Betsy ? industrial designer: it's actually there now , there on the screen . Would you want it full full screen ? user interface: I can make it full ? Yes yes yes . As  User Interface Designer I did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote . user interface: So I found out that  but  the main purpose of a remote is to  f control the function of a television at a far off distance at remote distance . Now for that ,  a remote controller should have a switch on off button by which a user can sit anywhere in the room in front of the T_V_ and he can control the functionalities different functionalities of the T_V_ . user interface: There should be a signal  something like a radio wave or a infrared light or a LED which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television if the user wants to  change the channels or increase the volume he can change it . user interface: Now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular a particular programme or switching on and off a  a particular programme according to the user choice . So if if he want to view a particular programme at say nine o'clock he can set the time , and the T_V_ will automatically it will switch on at that particular time . user interface: So he can use that kind of   properties of features and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular  for a certain age , then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the ch children cannot view that channel . user interface: And  the  the  and the one of the feature a user would like to have is the compactness of the co remote . user interface:  t the remote should be compact and it should ha it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the T_V_ television . And   as   this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a T_ in alphabet for more compactability . user interface: And  and  and it is one more point which I noted it down , like  the material which which which is used for remotes should be human friendly it should not cause any skin disease or something some al allergy to either children or to  ad adult person . user interface: And it should have an  it can have an alarm clock a a person if some if somebody wants to get up at around eight eight P_M_ then he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock , industrial designer:  . user interface: and I don't think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a remote . user interface: and as John Reece said the buttons can be ,  can me we can use the fluorescence to light up the buttons so different  buttons will glow differently . So in even in the dark the user can know what buttons to use to switch on a particular channel . And   the design of the   remote should be in such a way that there should not be any sharp projections so that if a child plays with a remote , he  he should not be harmed in any way . user interface: And findings ,  I found out  y  on different sites that  there are different remotes which can be used , there are remotes which use the infrared for controlling the different functionalities , there are remotes which use the radio waves to control the functions and there are  So  there you have different  types of remotes for different light source which are used which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of a television . Not ,  no  like it can it can be used as a T_V_ control as plus an alarm clock to set an alarm a timing and it should have a child lock , and then to save electricity  there should not be  much s move  lots of circuits and all that . And if a person if if if parents wants the television to be switched off by ten o'clock then it should be switched off ten o at ten o'clock automatically , so that nobody else comes later and use it . industrial designer: It's like a t okay , it's like a timer it's like a lock to the television . project manager:  okay , now I have On my slide show basically we already we have already done the agenda , and  on the closing  basically there will be lunch break and all that . project manager: Yeah , and I think today there are probably not many people who don't have a T_V_ . Now , talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody , but I think within the target group we have subgroups . We have we have earlier it was mentioned about  for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands , user interface: project manager:  then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything  unless it's really very clear . project manager: And  I don't know how much we want to cater to children's use . project manager: So this these are just some thoughts I have on it , and  I dunno what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we're gonna design this one thing marketing: project manager: or whether we're looking at what we like we we talking about different shapes , whether that different shape also includes maybe different  buttons  for different groups . marketing: So if you've designed something that's very attractive to children  the mummy please mummy please  you know we want it now we wanna go to the store and see it  that has  a lot of marketing pull . user interface: project manager: That has a lot of that has a lot of appeal but I think  I'm I'm talking about the functionality now on it whether we're looking at different groups . project manager: You know , like you make it nice and pink , fluorescent , banana colour or whatever you know user interface: Different colours . project manager: Do we look at one target group ? And with the twenty five Euros you know can we can we afford to have  I'm asking the technical people here whether  to look at sort of subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group how much would that throw us out of the cost we are supposed to respect ? user interface: marketing: Respect . No  generally we can we can design a remote which is mainly for people with  f age from ten to  forty project manager: Right . user interface: and and then we can add on  specific functional buttons for children as well as the elderly people or the people wit with who have nervous problems , yes . industrial designer: We can design different remotes for different people , like for aged people there will be big buttons and you know . project manager: Well that's that's user interface: But in a family in a family there will be a aged person , children and a middle aged but they cannot buy three different remotes . user interface: They would like to buy just one and  just one which can be used all the three  industrial designer: Yeah of course that we can do , but specifically if y if like elderly people want big buttons then you can't really make a bi big remote controller so maybe specifically you can design a big con remote controller for elderly and for children , like in a different you know . marketing: What about the electronics ? That's not really gonna change much , is it ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: No marketing: That that w that won't change much , will it  ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: The the quest the question to be addressed here is only who is the target group and how will it function , marketing: I d I wouldn't think so . project manager: and I think the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons you know , within the target group or subgroups . project manager: The question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense . project manager: but the question is how much will that set us back if let's say  forty percent we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons for example . project manager: So that remains to s to be seen but  the target group as a whole is is basically everybody with a T_V_ . marketing: and can we can we is it even feasible to make one one remote control with something for everyone , or would we have to use the same electronics and make three different shapes ? project manager: Yeah , well that's that's the question . marketing: And in that case we could probabl moulded plastic isn't all that expensive is it ? industrial designer:  no . marketing:  you as an industrial person ? project manager: Well maybe there's there's an idea you know t the new for example new portable phones ? marketing: project manager: They have like removable plastic cases , so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one , or whatever , marketing: Yeah . project manager: that in each package you know you have you you have you have for example  you have let's say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have  another colour or stripe whatever that already comes in a package . project manager: You know , industrial designer: Yeah , like for mobile phones we have  different you know covers , like designs and all so that w we can have that . project manager: and but like if if then everybody is is is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the striped or whatever they have as another one in the package , marketing:  yeah . project manager: then they can go to the store and for a few  Francs or Euros whatever they can buy industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: But  yeah I I have a doubt like will it be cost wise effective if we if we design a remote having all the  different features for different people or designing three different  remotes for three different categories of people . project manager: Well I think I think the idea here is to  to to d design one remote industrial designer: Yeah , but  marketing: Well I think we can only aff , yeah . project manager: the functional functional cosmetics if you want to put it that way , user interface: Okay . project manager:  having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people  either for children  user interface: user interface: industrial designer: marketing: Well we may have to come back to one or two of these points at our next meeting but  industrial designer: Yeah , maybe , yeah , yeah . industrial designer:  yeah , project manager: Do we agree , do we ? industrial designer: I think maybe seventy percent is a unique   remote controller and thirty percent is yeah it's sort of like yeah . marketing: Okay but we have to l project manager: Do we agree on on that in principle , like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not "

        "Query": "Why did the Industrial Designer disagree with Marketing and User Interface on various design aspects of the product?",
        "Summary": "The marketing team suggested that the remote control should have only one button and be compatible with Windows media center, allowing it to operate multiple devices simultaneously. However, the industrial designer disagreed, stating that additional buttons, such as play, fast forward, and stop, would be necessary for a video player. The industrial designer also proposed using titanium for a tough and stylish cover, appealing to older customers. They emphasized the importance of using real titanium instead of titanium-like plastic or compromising the LCD screen. The industrial designer also raised questions about the remote control's universality and programmability, suggesting the need for different modes to send out signals. They also considered the size of the remote, given the complexity of integrating various technical parts. Ultimately, the industrial designer proposed an integrated material approach to reduce costs.",
        "Article": "industrial designer: user interface: project manager: Yeah I kinda like this I'm kinda getting into it . So just to kick off the meeting basically  so we're working now for a real reaction , this is  so it right . Just got an agenda to set out what we're gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting .  We're gonna just do a quick opening and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another  then we're gonna start talk a little bit about tool training . Essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we haven't tried out yet , the whiteboard .  we've got a general plan for the project how we're gonna go about accomplishing this and then just a bit of discussion close up .  I guess you know game or something  in real life  so yeah basically I want to I'm just gonna you got of course you can discuss that , I'm thinking about   proposing that since we've got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just don't ask , don't tell .  so  if you say something about marketing , right , sorted ,  y is marketing: You're just gonna believe me , industrial designer: marketing: we'll go from there . project manager: obvi if if you guys if if at the same time if you like logically if something doesn't like if I'm like we're gonna sell a remote control that's the size of this paper book you know  you say like well that doesn't seem like such a good idea because of X_ obviously go with it .  we'll discuss it but I'm not gonna ask do you know that or  yeah it seems like marketing: Prove it project manager: yeah yeah exactly marketing: yeah , okay . project manager: so , 'cause we're what we're sort of role playing is y g yeah you're gonna tap into your own knowledge as well  . And that's the same for your when we do introductions   and you talk about your background you know have fun , you know maybe you went to   you know maybe i you're like in Maine you went to U_C_S_B_ but you wanna say you went to Harvard or something like that , why not , you know industrial designer: marketing: project manager: you can this is you know I guess we can have a little bit of fun with it . So are you guys okay with that does that seem logical ? industrial designer: Oh yeah , that's fine . So I guess that that we're totally we're making a remote control which is thrilling industrial designer: Right . project manager:   but the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate model I dunno if you guys had time to check the in real life I dunno if you guys  checked the   the corporate website .  we've got to make something as fashionable as possible , that's kind of the corporate strategy is we're gonna try to take ordinary stuff that nobody really thinks about and try to make it nice you know like John Lewis nice or you know if you go to Debenham's or something . So  basically we are reinventing the wheel but we wanna try to do it in a user friendly  slick sleek kind of way .  way we're gonna go about doing that is basically at first we're gonna start on the basics . And that's where I'm gonna need you guys the User Interface Designers and the   the other designer that I can't remember , marketing: project manager: the the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ right  the Industrial Designer industrial designer: user interface: marketing: project manager: hey right on alright , user interface:  . project manager: to guide me and guide us on this project 'cause you're gonna be you're g you guys are the bottom you know you're like no you can't do that you can't have you know X_ and Y_  at the same time . And then  we'll work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good , you know like  I I think you guys probably got the same emails I did but the idea of  , yes a coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee but it's also better if it's not like really cheap glass so that it if you touch it you hurt your hand , or something like that .  and so we'll work up from there and  then we'll meet on and talk about it and then finally we'll incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me tell us what's possible and then you tell us what we can  hope for and what way to go take the the the take the basics and make it nicer and then ov obviously  the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ you know you you can keep on the you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible  to try t of sync it all up .  right so for now just for th the white board  basically  just to get used to it , I haven't tried it yet either  I'm just gonna start and   carry like five remotes around  and just write down I'm just gonna write down one of the names of my  desert discs you know if you if you were trapped on a desert island and you could only bring five C_D_s along with you name one of them that you could , not all five , if you wanna write all five go for it but name one of them that you could  . marketing: project manager: I'm Marty , industrial designer: user interface: project manager:  I went to uni at  U_C_ Santa Barbara and I'm here working on a P_H_D_ in psychology . So marketing: I'm Sarah , I went to Michigan , and I'm here doing cultural studies and I'm the Marketing Manager or something . industrial designer: I'm Nathan , I'm from California , and I'm here doing a Masters degree in social anthropology . project manager: Where did you go to uni Nathan ? industrial designer: U_C_L_A_ . marketing: So do we have to wait for you to write it down or are you gonna tell us ? project manager: Well I'll t i marketing: I'm waiting to know . See I'm a big music fan I don't know if you guys are , I'm assuming everybody likes music to some lesser or greater extent marketing:  project manager: but there's some other options , if you're a T_V_ slut marketing: Fair enough . project manager: like I am like Smallville terrible television show industrial designer: user interface: project manager: but I happen to love it , marketing: Oh , Smallville .  and  oh well I might as well throw a British person in there  you can't go wrong with Radiohead . Alright so  user interface: project manager: whoever wants to get up next , you can write down some telly that you watch or whatever you want . Right now I'm listening to a lot of somebody nobody's ever heard of , Chris Bathgate , project manager:  . marketing: really lame user interface: marketing: and   what else did I bring with me ? Probably classical , to totally geek it out , project manager: Okay yeah yeah . Isn't h has h industrial designer: project manager: do you watch the new season ? marketing: No . Are you getting it online , project manager: I think I'm gonna start downloading it marketing: or is it on sky ? project manager: yeah . user interface: marketing: It's the five by five , I can't read that much . user interface: I just came from Glasgow project manager:  marketing: Seriously ? user interface: and I'm  happy to say that there's the there's the same quantity approximately . project manager: I have to be here for three years so I might as well get the terminology right . And I'm gonna go home next week and everyone's gonna be like oh my God you're turning into one of those people , project manager: Oh , have you been home yet ? user interface: project manager: They'll be like , say something British , marketing: no . project manager: Bad religion ? marketing: 'Cause industrial designer: Yeah , that's the music I grew up listening to . user interface: industrial designer: And so there marketing: Oh , now I can think of so many other ones . project manager: Where are you from in California by the way ? user interface: industrial designer: I grew up in San Diego , project manager: Did you really ? What part ? industrial designer: but yeah  La Jolla , P_B_ . industrial designer: But really  I last lived in San Francisco , I haven't lived in Cali well I haven't lived in southern California since I was eighteen . project manager: Going to s like North Carol I'm sorry you you just can't get a better burrito than what's available in the s in San Diego . 'Cause in San Diego th the tortillas are cooked on the grill and in northern California they steam them . project manager: Well it's it's i there's other things too there's you just can't place it marketing: Ah . project manager: like I when I went to school in the U_ in Santa Barbara which is central California the Mexican food is okay , it's just not good like and yeah it's like two bucks , industrial designer:  . industrial designer: Close t  do you know where Clare de Lune coffee shop is , project manager: Yes . industrial designer: Cafe Forte project manager: Yeah it's actually like literally half a mile from my house . project manager: a little bit introductions we talked about some of our C_D_s industrial designer: Wow . user interface: project manager: and things we like about the city you know , I think we'll user interface: project manager:  right so marketing: project manager: moving on to not fun stuff  project finance . user interface: project manager:  basically what we're trying to do is sell this remote for twenty five Euros . This is what the finance department has told me , the C_F_O_ but I don't know , I'm not sold on this , it's pretty dear ,  twenty f that's like you know forty bucks for a remote . project manager: what we can maybe work on that a later but we're gonna make a lot on it , the profit aims to make fifty million Euros on it . So  one of the things I I was gonna mention to you  you guys the designers is that  it m we probably need a rever it needs to be a universal remote control probably . project manager: something that could do N_T_S_C_ as well as PAL as well as various other formats like if it's gonna control D_V_D_s marketing: Makes sense . project manager: I'll leave that to you guys but that's something that i i it is gonna be an international sold thing .  s right so  just to close up , I'm not sure how much time I've used  next time right Project Manager , sorted . Is  we'll meet in another half an hour or so  and I'd like the  Industrial Designer to get ge think about what needs to be done , like what the basic function of it .  U_I_D_ well yeah you right g your assignments are up there and you'll also get s assignments from in your email as well more spec specifics on what do do . project manager: So actually in a way you guys c maybe in our next meeting chat a bit about what the user's gonna want and what the user can have , you know like  so marketing: And negotiate that . project manager: yeah well it is and we'll discuss the trade-offs in between  so yeah specific instructions will be sent in your email . But I think that that is more or less a good place to start for now  and as more things come up we'll have meetings and you'll get emails and so forth .  any questions , before we get started ? user interface: I assume that we're building a stand alone  remote control , we can't kind of build it into other  products . project manager: You mean to like user interface: For instance like a mobile phone or something like that . user interface: Or or you know can we produ can we sell a remote control phone for twenty five pounds or less ? project manager: Well , have a think about it . project manager: I'm I'm certainly op it seems like yeah it it seems like it's certainly do-able marketing: W yeah .   or if we can't have a full mobile phone maybe a remote that has some other kind of useful function . We'll see what see what industrial designer: Maybe a remote with changeable faces , like the faces that you can buy for phones . That's true , I guess we we probably have some time , maybe we should brainstorm a bit like what we wanna do , go back to  I don't really have any . user interface: Now are we also discussing kind of our initial ideas at all here ? project manager: Yeah yeah let's do it , let's do . user interface: S does anybody have any initial ideas ? project manager: I'm gonna go ahead and take notes on this too 'cause marketing: Good idea . marketing: right , we decided that already and it may be functioning for other things , as soon as you said that I was thinking like all the other things you could get a remote to do , like your microwave or your front door industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: or like to have everything on one thing , project manager: marketing: but then , I've never been a fan of those huge remotes that have like a million buttons , project manager: user interface: But I'm thinking I'm thinking kind of P_D_A_  design marketing: Yeah . We want it to be munt multifunctional but at the same time if you get it to do too much you're not gonna be able to tell them apart , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: of  so you like maybe like an L_ like a touch screen type of remote ? user interface:  I don't know if there's such a thing out there , I guess we could do some  do some research on or one of us could do some research on it about whether or not there are  multi-format like  you know PAL , N_T_S_C_ , region one marketing: Right . user interface:  I I have a friend who has a P_D_A_ project manager: Okay . user interface: that he just points at his telev any television he wants marketing: That user interface: and it'll figure out the the specifications of it marketing: Yeah . I li I'm liking that idea , this idea of a touch screen remote with multi-format features . industrial designer: I think , making it out of a nice material would be very important , because so many of those remotes that you see , these universal remotes look so cheap and low quality . And I don't know , like , there's such a problem with losing them , project manager: marketing: that adding this whole like P_D_A_ pen business is only one more thing to lose , industrial designer:  . marketing: Just something like keep in mind when we start actually dealing with this stuff but that would be really cool . industrial designer: user interface: In in marketing: Fi b like what are they called , those face plate things ? project manager: Think they're just called face plates ? marketing: Isn't there a name for them ? project manager: I don't know . industrial designer: I think , it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have a like a locator device , maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote . user interface: If you're not doing that then we can have something that just kind of rings from either marketing: True . project manager: Cou could we not do something where like just a little lit like literally just a very small kind of thing that comes with the remote that you could place something else that you press and it makes the remote page . Kinda like how on a lot of   cordless regular phones , you have a page button and it goes , user interface: Th marketing: Right . project manager:  yeah I think this material quality as well like I guess what we can think about what kind of   you know Apple 's been really successful with this surgical white kind of business or this sleek kind of marketing:  . marketing: And that titanium the new silver sleek ones that's last couple of years , very much so . project manager: We do have the minimum am amount  we were talking finances I dunno , selling a a forty Pound remote would h or a forty Dollar remote , twenty five Euro remote would be pretty you know it's pretty expensive marketing: Right . Without without getting into that whole like you know go down to bargain store remote you know bargain store universal remote marketing: Right . project manager: But  have a think about what we can do , have a think about what we want to do , how we're gonna sell it marketing: Yeah . project manager: and  marketing: Or if you our users in mind , like these grandmas are not gonna be into this whole new let's design , no it's they're used to the buttons so we'll have to be careful of exactly who we're marketing this to , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: But user interface: We're talking twenty five Pounds or twenty five Euros ? project manager: Twenty five Euros . project manager: They serve  right they sa tha s they will sell things overseas so you can buy stuff in America marketing:  . Right so  let's go ahead and wrap that up here for now , I'm gonna put these initial ideas that we've got in the  project documents , so if you guys wa need a reminder about what we've talked about  the different you know kind of trade-offs that we've got and the other ideas , you can consult them at your leisure . Let's just  head back to work on what we were talking about bef  goi h h getting into "

        "Query": "Why did the team have doubts about relying solely on speech recognition and eliminating buttons for the remote control? What challenges did they face in implementing speech recognition in the new remote controls?",
        "Summary": "Age group data for remote control use was not available, but it is acknowledged that many people may not want to learn how to use a new remote control. Despite this, certain buttons such as channel control, volume settings, and on/off are still necessary. The Industrial Designer raised concerns about the size and bulkiness of remote controls with too many buttons, while a small and slim design was deemed prone to being lost. The User Interface suggested a PDA or hand-held type of remote control, but this was deemed unfriendly in terms of unit price. Marketing expressed concerns about the cost and price implications of implementing voice recognition, arguing that the elderly would not find it user-friendly compared to an LCD screen. The Project Manager agreed with Marketing's opinion and prioritized the LCD screen over voice recognition. The Project Manager also noted the difficulty of implementing speech recognition in remotes due to noise interference, which was expensive to solve. However, the User Interface proposed a solution involving a signal-emitting device built into the TV and a microphone and transmitter on the remote control, utilizing subtractive cancellation of noise.",
        "Article": "Okay and the agenda will be the opening and  that's  the product manager or secretary that's me and  the presentations from the Christine and  Agnes and from Mister Ed . And finally in this meeting we have to decide marketing: project manager: and we are to take a decision on the remote control concept and  the functional design So we have forty minutes , I think it's  little bit  low , but I I hope we can finish it up so I'll handle to the the functional team , to the Christine , okay , to discuss about  the components concept . So  project manager: industrial designer: we were looking he specifically at the components  the following components ,  the case , the power supply ,  the means of communications with the television set . In instance we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition , project manager: industrial designer: you have to have microphone well no you don't actually I haven't have to have microphone in the device , but  maybe you do have it a a way marketing: industrial designer: it has to it has to hear the speaker user interface: industrial designer: and  , so it could be in the television set , could be in the device , but somewhere you have to put the microphone ,  and a w a way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it's gets lost . Our method for going about this is we've looked at  the histo hi historical record , what's worked , what hasn't and then we also  we wanted to evaluate some new materials marketing: industrial designer: and we contacted manufacturing for their input because , course , we m might come up and choose the material that then manufacturing didn't have the technologies or capabilities to offer us , so  this is the approach that we took during our  our research . marketing: industrial designer: So  for the case ,  we told we were making a specifica specific assumption that it would be curved in design . marketing: industrial designer: Course , you know , I wanted it to be expandable and shrinkable , but  that  doesn't seem to b be one of the choic non-option we can  we can really seriously explore , user interface: industrial designer: so then we were thinking about  rubber , but  unfortunately that's been eliminated because of the heat  factor user interface: industrial designer: and th  there might be some problems with the m  how it's  goes with the board .  and  then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it's brittle it gets brittle after a while , user interface: industrial designer: so  we still had titanium and and wood available , but  unfortunately   titanium's also been eliminated  , user interface: industrial designer: the m people in manufacturing said that you couldn't make d curved cases out of titanium , although how Apple did it with th PowerBook I'm not su quite sure but  nevertheless  they've eliminated all of our options except wood . marketing: industrial designer: And a as she said , it's an environmentally friendly  material , so we're we're currently  proposing , marketing: industrial designer:  we'll get to all my personal preferences in just a second . marketing: industrial designer: So then there's this other matter of the chips and  well we could use a simple design on the board , user interface: project manager: industrial designer:  these simple chips , but that's only works for the bu you don't get very much  intelligence with this simple one . And  then there was the regular which I regret that I've forgotten exactly why I'm eliminating that one .  the other option was this advanced chip on print , and  we liked th we we found that it it includes this infrared sender , marketing: industrial designer: which w 'member the beam was that was an important component of finding the right chip . marketing: industrial designer: And  manufacturing has told us that they've   recently developed a  a sensor and a speaker that would  be integrated into this advanced chip on print , so  we we  now jumping right to our personal preferences  I I'd really think we should , you know , use some of  some really exotic woods , like  , user interface: industrial designer: you know  , well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods . I think that people will might really want to design their own cases , you see , they could do sort of a this  three-dimensional design on the internet , and then they could submit their orders , kinda like you submit a custom car order , you know , and you can choose the colour and the size of the wheels and the colours of the leather and things like that , and then I  think we should go with the solar cells as well as the  microphone and speaker on the advanced chip . So this is the findings of our research marketing: industrial designer: and my recommendations  for the new remote control w  would be to have  have it be made out of wood . Do you have any problems with that ? project manager: Can you go back  one slide ? industrial designer: I'm not sure , how do I Oh , I know , let's see . project manager: Yes ,  question , what's mean exactly , advanced chip on print ? What's the meaning of that ? industrial designer: I think it's   a multiple  chip design  and it's  maybe printed on to the circuit board . project manager: Yeah , is it means it's on the yeah is it on a micro-proc micro-processor based or  industrial designer: I don't know , but I'll find out more at our next meeting . project manager: Okay , tha that would be great , so if you find out from the technology background , okay , so that would be good . user interface: Why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material ? industrial designer: Because  it gets brittle , cracks user interface: user interface: industrial designer: I don't know , speak for yourself , I'm planning to be around for a while . user interface: Although I think marketing: user interface: I think with wood though you'd run into the same types of problems , wouldn't you ,  it chips , it if you drop it , industrial designer: marketing: user interface:  it's I'm not su industrial designer: project manager: So so you're not convinced about the the wood , yes . user interface: industrial designer: you're what ? marketing: Actually , I'm ready to sell it . user interface: I think if you re if you use really good quality wood , then it might work , marketing: I'm ready to sell it . industrial designer: You think ? And you could you could sell oils with it , to take care of it . user interface: but you can't just use marketing: No y no no no , the o the only w the only wood you can use are the ones that are hard , extremely hard wood , user interface: Yeah , exactly , yeah . industrial designer: Well I'm glad you user interface: marketing: That's actually very innovative idea . marketing: industrial designer: marketing: Well , it's actually a very innovative n different idea that  you know you can choose your colour of wood , your type of wood . marketing:  it's each person is gonna have their own personalised , individualised speech recognition remote control in wood , that's not on the market . user interface: project manager: Yeah , so it it's looks good the the design the functional design  , what about yo you ? marketing: user interface: in terms of comments on this or in terms of my own project manager: Yes , in t yes , in term in terms of comments first marketing: In turns of wow . industrial designer: user interface: industrial designer: She works in the cubicle next to me so she's  she was already a little bit prepared for this . user interface: marketing: Wood ? user interface: I think we can get the quality materials then it shouldn't influence the design principles too much , which you'll see with my presentation . marketing: user interface: One thing we'd have to check though is what the users whether how quickly the novelty wears off of having  industrial designer: Yeah , you wouldn't wanna have to have splinters in your hand while you're using your user interface: Yeah , for example . So , have to see how kid-friendly it is and and all that , marketing: industrial designer: It's really good if your dog gets ahold of it , they can use it for teething . user interface: but marketing: user interface: marketing: They do that anyway with the rubber and plastic , industrial designer: Yeah , they do it with other materials as well , yeah . So , it's a very short presentation , 'cause I'm actually gonna draw you the layout on the board so if you want to just go straight to the second slide , which basically shows , sort of marketing: user interface: I took the ideas that we were talking about last time  and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that y you can actually see on it are the on off switch , volume and channel control , the menu access button , ergonomic shape , which I completely agree with Christine's idea to have it sort of molded , so it's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the r standard very straight remote controls . And actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customising idea , is that people can actually do sort of quasi-measurements on their hand size , so if someone has larger hands , you have a wider remote control .  , one thing I thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip screen on it , just like you have on flip phones , marketing: user interface: so that you don't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it , especially if you have little kids around , they're not pressing the buttons while you're trying to watch a T_V_ show and accidentally change the channel or turn it off . user interface: And also  you had issues with the batteries running out , marketing: user interface: so I thought maybe we could put a little battery life-light on it that kind of goes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer as your battery is starts to die . And in terms of invisible features , audio and  tactile feedback on button presses and , like you said , speech recognition . user interface: So , in terms of what this thing would actually look like marketing: user interface: Despite working in interface design , I'm not the greatest artist in the world , so you'll have to forgive me . You'd have something like this with an on-off switch fairly big , sort of in the corner and by itself , so you don't accidentally turn your T_V_ off while you're trying to manoeuvre other buttons . And then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for , oops , channels and volume , sort of for surfing channels and then volume , so the volume would be the up and down , 'cause volume goes up and down and then channels left to right . And then on one side you would have an access to the menu on your T_V_ project manager: user interface: and on the other side a way to turn off the voice control . So that if the user doesn't want to use their voice , they can just turn it off and you don't have the remote control accidentally changing things on you . user interface: so again you can have a little L_C_D_ light somewhere , the flip thing and Have I forgotten anything ? I don't think so . project manager: user interface: which is one of the things I really wanted to keep , is keep it simple , not have too many buttons , not have too many functionalities thrown into it . Think the design can pretty much carry over to everything , although with the wood the flip screen might have to do something slightly different . But you also have to d start watching out for the weight , 'cause depending on how much the the flip screen will add to the weight of the remote control , you don't want it to start getting too heavy . user interface: But that's the general layout with the general functionalities , if we come up with something else . As you can see , there's still lots of space on the actual remote control and if you do it customisably , you can make this thing fairly small or fairly o large , depending on personal preferences . user interface: So , that's pretty much all I had to say , everything else in terms of design issues .  the centering of the key pad and the channel is just depending on where your thumb is and you tend to use the the volume control and  the browsing more than the actual number pad , so that would be sort of in direct line of where your thumb goes when you are holding the remote control , industrial designer: user interface: So once we decide exactly what we want , then we can figure out the exact positioning , but more or less I think it should go along those lines . We've been giving simple questionnaires in different areas because th obviously we have to see what the com consumers are looking for today , 'cause  trends change very very quickly . In six months maybe this idea is already gone out the window , so it's gonna be a question how fast we can act . This is what we know from the last  from the questionnaires from the the all the p surveys we've done , fancy and feel-good , that's what we've been looking for , something that feels good in the hand , that's easy to use . Looking for next generation of innovation , because all the remotes out there now , they're all very similar , they all do the same thing , project manager: industrial designer: marketing: we have to have something completely different . Okay ? Easy to use , has always has become has become another major interest that  , with the whiteboard we can see that it's a remote that's easy to use . And I think this is another thing that's interesting is the consumers actually willing to pay the price for exciting tel technology . So even if we have a product that may be more expensive , if it comes out right , if they look it looks and feels good and has technology . The second one , there is about  forty-five thousand different buttons on it , which makes it fairly hard to read ,  very hard to use . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: The first one , I see that they put in a display . Now there's something else  with the little flip-up , now we're adding all kinds of things in , user interface: marketing: but with the little flip-up , if you have a little display on the flip-up that when you close it everything is locked . marketing: Maybe the display also makes it easier to use , because sometimes when you're looking for buttons , maybe if you see a display user interface: industrial designer: Context-sensitive instructions , depending on what the tel what mode the T_V_ or the D_V_D_ or something else is in . marketing: Okay Because I've seen mostly the standard ones , user interface: Especially you might need something like that for training the speech recognition and marketing: yeah . marketing: So maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use , trendy , fancy , feels good ,  with a display , wood , designer wood , designer colours user interface: industrial designer: user interface: project manager: industrial designer: You know , maybe what you could do is when somebody orders the device id you could send them like  a   b some sort of a foam rubber  ball , marketing: we might've user interface: Oh yeah . user interface: Yeah , so it's really molded to to your specific industrial designer: To t an and then you would know like  what the geometry of their hands would be and  marketing: project manager: marketing: How hard they squeeze ? user interface: industrial designer: Yes you'd know what kind of wood to get . user interface: But th for that you'd also have to do sort of an average across families and things like that if unless everyone has their own personal remote . industrial designer: That's right , that's right , you wouldn't wanna go too far down that . user interface: industrial designer: marketing: No , but incorporating the three  obviously it'd be something totally new on the market , totally different user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: marketing: and from user interface: Well , already the customisability is a really good sort of new gimmick . marketing: Right , you take it apart , and put on another face , take it off and put on another face user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: We'd also have to wor  consider that  who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes , we might wanna  learn about  labour laws . project manager: industrial designer: You know in different countries and stuff wher so we can do it cheap , but you don't wanna exploit  labour in  third world countries . industrial designer: So actually you could turn it y turn around and say that you're  par the reason the cost is high for the device is because  you're paying a a working wage to the person who made the device . project manager: Yeah , but we can get a production in , countries like , India industrial designer: Cost of living is low . project manager: yes , yes , countries like India or China or Malaysia , so you can go a better features and better price and you can sell more . So industrial designer: Good , well th that'd be something that manufacturing would have to  explore more project manager: Yeah , yeah , so Yes . project manager: So Yeah , so industrial designer: Yeah marketing: We're here to design , come up with a nice product . project manager: Yes  , but  that that we can that we can talk about the production later , okay , depends on the the quantity , okay . project manager: So we don't need to have our own  fabric factory or something , industrial designer: project manager: so we can have a tie-up with who the do the fabric , okay , for the different  electronics items , then we can have a business tie-up and to get to cut the cost , okay , to sell more . So , but  le let's decide first about the components concept and  interface concept , okay , if is acceptable for both of you , what  Ed was talking . And your design whether you want with the display or without display or just a simple , so user interface: I think it depends ,  I think it's a good idea , but we need to really think about how useful it's gonna be because theoretically with the T_V_ you already have a big display right in front of you . user interface: So , if we're trying to keep costs down , then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go . user interface:  it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for industrial designer:  . user interface: 'cause if it's only used for one little thing , then putting in a big display case or a big display that's probably expensive just to do the training on the chip for the speech recognition or whatever , may not be the most cost-efficient way to go , project manager: user interface: but that's just sort of speculation ,  . industrial designer: What do you think Ed ? Do you he liked the display in one of the concepts that you showed , do you know how much it costs , to to add a little display like this  ? marketing: No . No industrial designer: Do you wanna take an action item to go find out ? marketing: no p spec It's 'cause we have to find out cost on it . industrial designer: So the the advanced chip on print is what  what we've we've deci we've determined marketing: industrial designer: and the  engineering industrial design is the recommendation , and  I think we've kinda come to some agreement regarding  this concept of a wooden case . user interface: What about the buttons , would Would the buttons be wood too , or industrial designer:  I don't think so , no , project manager: I don't think so . industrial designer: so you have that tactile experience of project manager: Don't looks nice  . Yeah , so  what we'll do is , we will stick with the the simple design for time being until  th Ed find outs about the how much it's cost to the extra , in case we go for the display . project manager: maybe what you can do is  , both of you , you can come up with the the prototype , okay , the model . project manager: user interface: industrial designer: So  are we done with this meeting ? project manager: Yeah , I hope , if is it okay if  they will come up with the prototype design , okay . Then they can show you how it looks like , and then we can  submit to the I will submit to the management . Okay ? Then meantime you can come up with the price , how much it's cost as extra for  the display . user interface: project manager: Of course you'll make money too , industrial designer: project manager: so it it's not only pay-out , you make money too , your commission . user interface: marketing: user interface: marketing: project manager: Okay , so , any questions ? user interface: No . project manager: So , by next meeting , so , please come up with the the prototype , okay , then  , then we can proceed from there . project manager: So thanks for all your  efforts and coming for the meeting again , and see you soon then "

        "Summary": "The professor expressed his frustration with the constant delays in the TORRENT chip schedule. Grad F presented his proposal, focusing on the section on intermediate categories and suggesting the inclusion of features from these categories as a means of reducing error. The professor was particularly interested in understanding the impact of the neural net on older models that lacked pure features. While acknowledging the potential for improvement, he also cautioned against overusing nets.",
        "Article": "phd a: And what was that , Morgan ? What project ? professor b: the , TORRENT chip . professor b: we went through it Jim and I went through old emails at one point and and for two years there was this thing saying , yeah , we 're we 're two months away from being done . phd a: So , should we just do the same kind of deal where we go around and do , status report kind of things ? OK . phd a: Any objection ? Do y OK , M professor b: All in favor phd a: Do you want to start , Morgan ? Do you have anything , or ? professor b: I don't do anything . I No , I I 'm involved in discussions with with people about what they 're doing , but I think they 're since they 're here , they can talk about it themselves . Why don't you go ahead , Barry ? grad f: you 're gonna talk about Aurora stuff , per se ? phd a: OK . Well , this past week I 've just been , getting down and dirty into writing my my proposal . I just finished a section on ,  on talking about these intermediate categories that I want to classify , as a as a middle step . And , I hope to hope to get this ,  a full rough draft done by , Monday so I can give it to Morgan . phd a: So , is the idea you 're going to do this paper and then you pass it out to everybody ahead of time and ? grad f: Right , right . So , y you write up a proposal , and give it to people ahead of time , and you have a short presentation . phd a: Have you d ? I was just gonna ask , do you want to say any a little bit about it , grad f: Y s phd a: or ? Mmm .  , a little bit about ? phd a: Wh - what you 're what you 're gonna You said you were talking about the , particular features that you were looking at , grad f: Oh , the the phd a: or grad f: Right . Well , I was , I think one of the perplexing problems is , for a while I was thinking that I had to come up with a complete set of intermediate features in intermediate categories to to classify right away .  , build a system that , classifies these ,  these feat  , these intermediate categories using , multi - band techniques . Look at then I would look at the errors produced in the phoneme recognition and say , OK , well , I could probably reduce the errors if I included this extra feature or this extra intermediate category . phd a: So you 're gonna use TIMIT ? grad f: for that for that part of the the process , yeah , I would use TIMIT . grad f: that 's that 's ,  that 's just the ph the phone recognition task . So , I would mov I would then shift the focus to , something like Schw - Switchboard , where I 'd I would be able to ,  to model , intermediate categories that span across phonemes , phd a:   grad f: not just within the phonemes , themselves , and then do the same process there , on on a large vocabulary task like Switchboard .  , and for that for that part I would I 'd use the SRI recognizer since it 's already set up for for Switchboard . phd a: It 's about a month from now ? grad f: It 's a it 's a month and and a week . phd a: So , you want to go next , Dave ? And we 'll do grad e: Oh . And , we we got an improvement , in word error rate , training on the TI - digits data set and testing on Meeting Recorder digits of , six percent to four point five percent , on the n on the far - mike data using PZM F , but , the near - mike performance worsened , from one point two percent to two point four percent . And , wh why would that be , considering that we actually got an improvement in near - mike performance using HTK ? And so , with some input from , Andreas , I have a theory in two parts .  , first of all HTK sorry , SR - the SRI system is doing channel adaptation , and so HTK wasn't .  , so this ,  This mean subtraction approach will do a kind of channel normalization and so that might have given the HTK use of it a boost that wouldn't have been applied in the SRI case . So those finer - grained acoustic models could be more sensitive to the artifacts in the re - synthesized audio . And me and Barry were listening to the re - synthesized audio and sometimes it seems like you get of a bit of an echo of speech in the background . And so that seems like it could be difficult for training , cuz you could have different phones lined up with a different foreground phone , depending on the timing of the echo . So , I 'm gonna try training on a larger data set , and then , eh , the system will have seen more examples o of these artifacts and hopefully will be more robust to them . professor b: I had another thought just now , which is , remember we were talking before about we were talking in our meeting about , this stuff that some of the other stuff that Avendano did , where they were , getting rid of low - energy sections ?  , if you if you did a high - pass filtering , as Hirsch did in late eighties to reduce some of the effects of reverberation , Avendano and Hermansky were arguing that , perhaps one of the reasons for that working was ma may not have even been the filtering so much but the fact that when you filter a an all - positive power spectrum you get some negative values , and you gotta figure out what to do with them if you 're gonna continue treating this as a power spectrum . So if you imagine a a waveform that 's all positive , which is the time trajectory of energy , and , shifting it downwards , and then getting rid of the negative parts , that 's essentially throwing away the low - energy things . And it 's the low - energy parts of the speech where the reverberation is most audible . You know , you have the reverberation from higher - energy things showing up in So in this case you have some artificially imposed reverberation - like thing .  , you 're getting rid of some of the other effects of reverberation , but because you have these non - causal windows , you 're getting these funny things coming in , at n And , what if you did ?  , there 's nothing to say that the the processing for this re - synthesis has to be restricted to trying to get it back to the original , according to some equation . professor b: And one of the things you could do is , you could do some sort of VAD - like thing grad e:   professor b: and you actually could take very low - energy sections and set them to some some , very low or or near zero value .  , I 'm just saying if in fact it turns out that that these echoes that you 're hearing are ,  grad e:  - huh . professor b: or pre - echoes , whichever they are are are , part of what 's causing the problem , you actually could get rid of them . professor b: so that if you made a mistake you were more likely to keep in an echo than to throw out speech . phd g: what is the reverberation time like there ? grad e: In thi in this room ?  phd g: On , the the one what the s in the speech that you are you are using like ? grad e: Y Yeah . professor b: so it 's these are just microphone this micro close microphone and a distant microphone , he 's doing these different tests on . I think it 's I would guess , point seven , point eight seconds f  , R T grad f:  ! professor b: something like that ? But it 's you know , it 's this room . But the other thing is , he 's putting in w I was using the word \" reverberation \" in two ways . He 's also putting in , a he 's taking out some reverberation , but he 's putting in something , because he has averages over multiple windows stretching out to twelve seconds , which are then being subtracted from the speech . And since , you know , what you subtract , sometimes you 'll be you 'll be subtracting from some larger number and sometimes you won't . professor b: So you can end up with some components in it that are affected by things that are seconds away .  , and if it 's a low energy compo portion , you might actually hear some funny things . grad e: O o one thing , I noticed is that , the mean subtraction seems to make the PZM signals louder after they 've been re - synthesized . So I was wondering , is it possible that one reason it helped with the Aurora baseline system is just as a kind of gain control ? Cuz some of the PZM signals sound pretty quiet if you don't amplify them . I don't see why why your signal is louder after processing , because yo grad e: Yeah . professor b: I don't think just multiplying the signal by two would have any effect .  , I think if you really have louder signals , what you mean is that you have better signal - to - noise ratio . phd c: Well , well professor b: So if what you 're doing is improving the signal - to - noise ratio , then it would be better . professor b: But just it being bigger if with the same signal - to - noise ratio grad e: It w i i it wouldn't affect things . phd c: Well , the system is use the absolute energy , so it 's a little bit dependent on on the signal level . professor b: So if the if the if you change in both training and test , the absolute level by a factor of two , it will n have no effect . phd a: Did you add this data to the training set , for the Aurora ? Or you just tested on this ? grad e:   . Did I w what ? phd a: Well , Morgan was just saying that , as long as you do it in both training and testing , it shouldn't have any effect . But I didn't I 'm not sure if it made the clean ti TI - digits any louder . If it 's if it 's like , if it 's trying to find a a reverberation filter , it could be that this reverberation filter is making things quieter .  , there 's there 's nothing inherent about removing if you 're really removing , grad e: Nuh - huh . phd a: I wonder if there could be something like ,  for s for the PZM data , phd c: Eh phd a: you know , if occasionally , somebody hits the table or something , you could get a spike . I 'm just wondering if there 's something about the ,  you know , doing the mean normalization where , it it could cause you to have better signal - to - noise ratio . It it i maybe i If ,  Subtracting the the mean log spectrum is is is like dividing by the spectrum . So , depending what you divide by , if your if s your estimate is off and sometimes you 're you 're you 're getting a small number , you could make it bigger . professor b: So , it 's it 's just a a question of there 's It it could be that there 's some normalization that 's missing , or something to make it grad e:   professor b: y you 'd think it shouldn't be larger , but maybe in practice it is . So , you trained it on TI - digits ? But except this , it 's exactly the same system as the one that was tested before and that was trained on Macrophone . Right ? So on TI - digits it gives you one point two percent error rate and on Macrophone it 's still O point eight . grad e: If you 're talking about the Macrophone results that Andreas had about , a week and a half ago , I think it 's the same system . So you use VTL -  , vocal tract length normalization and , like MLLR transformations also , grad e:   phd c: and professor b: I 'm sorry , was his point eight percent , er , a a result on testing on Macrophone or or training ? phd c: all that stuff . grad e: That 's phd c: It was training on Macrophone and testing yeah , on on meeting digits . I I 've just been text testing the new Aurora front - end with well , Aurora system actually so front - end and HTK , acoustic models on the meeting digits and it 's a little bit better than the previous system . professor b: So , what w ? phd c: And phd g: With the with the HTK back - end ? What we have for Aurora ? phd c: Yeah . phd g: I know in the meeting , like phd c: On the meeting we have two point seven . phd c: we have the new LDA filters , and I think , maybe I didn't look , but one thing that makes a difference is this DC offset compensation .  , eh Do y did you have a look at at the meet  , meeting digits , if they have a DC component , or ? grad e: I I didn't .  , any all of the mikes have the DC removal some capacitor sitting right in that bias it . professor b: typi you know , unless Actually , there are instrumentation mikes that that do pass go down to DC . And you can get , I think it was I think it was in the Wall Street Journal data that that I can't remember , one of the DARPA things . professor b: we didn't we didn't know about for a while , while we were messing with it . And , the interesting thing that I tried was , Adam and Morgan had this idea , since my original attempts to , take the mean of the phase spectra over time and normalize using that , by subtracting that off , didn't work .  , so , well , that we thought that might be due to , problems with , the arithmetic of phases . They they add in this modulo two pi way and , there 's reason to believe that that approach of taking the mean of the phase spectrum wasn't really mathematically correct . So , what I did instead is I took the mean of the FFT spectrum without taking the log or anything , and then I took the phase of that , and I subtracted that phase off to normalize . professor b: You see , all he has to do is go back and reverse what he did before , and he 's really got something . phd a: Well , could you take what was left over and then subtract that ? professor b: Ex - exactly . phd g: Oh , it 's professor b: Just listen very carefully to what I say and do the opposite . I 'm more interested in trying to figure out what 's still the difference between the SRI system and the Aurora system . So , I think I will maybe train , like , gender - dependent models , because this is also one big difference between the two systems .  , the other differences were the fact that maybe the acoustic models of the SRI are more SRI system are more complex . But , Chuck , you did some experiments with this and phd a: It didn't seem to help in the HTK system . professor b: Well , it sounds like they also have he he 's saying they have all these , different kinds of adaptation . phd a: Like they do ,  I 'm not sure how they would do it when they 're working with the digits , phd c: The vocal tr phd a: but , like , in the Switchboard data , there 's ,  conversation - side normalization for the non - C - zero components , phd c: Yeah . phd c: So , it might be it might be better with it might be worse if the channel is constant , phd a: Yeah . phd g: And the acoustic models are like - k triphone models or or is it the whole word ? phd c: SRI it 's it 's tr grad f: SRI . So there 's there 's these kind of , pooled models and and they can go out to all sorts of dependencies . professor b: They have tied states and I think I I I don't real I 'm talk I 'm just guessing here . And maybe see with Andreas if Well , I I don't know how much it helps , what 's the model . phd a: So so the n stuff on the numbers you got , the two point seven , is that using the same training data that the SRI system used and got one point two ? phd c: That 's right . grad e: You know , the the Aurora baseline is set up with these ,  this version of the clean training set that 's been filtered with this G - seven - one - two filter , and , to train the SRI system on digits S - Andreas used the original TI - digits , under U doctor - speech data TI - digits , which don't have this filter . professor b: So is that ?  , are are these results comparable ? So you you were getting with the , Aurora baseline something like two point four percent on clean TI - digits , when , training the SRI system with clean TR digits TI - digits . And , so , is your two point seven comparable , where you 're , using , the submitted system ? phd c: Yeah . grad e: W w it was one one point two phd c: Ye grad e: with the SRI system , professor b: I 'm sorry . professor b: OK , so the comparable number then ,  for what you were talking about then , since it was HTK , would be the  , two point f phd c: It was four point something . Right ? The HTK system with , b grad e: D d professor b: Oh , right , right , right , right . phd c: MFCC features grad e: Do you mean the b ? The baseline Aurora - two system , trained on TI - digits , tested on Meeting Recorder near , I think we saw in it today , and it was about six point six percent . And another thing I I maybe would like to do is to just test the SRI system that 's trained on Macrophone test it on , the noisy TI - digits , professor b: Yeah . But I wonder if it 's just because maybe Macrophone is acoustically closer to the meeting digits than than TI - digit is , which is TI - digits are very clean recorded digits professor b:   phd c: and phd a: You know , it would also be interesting to see ,  to do the regular Aurora test , phd c: f s phd a: but use the SRI system instead of HTK . phd c: So we don't professor b: You 'd have to train the SRI system with with all the different languages . phd a: So , like , comple professor b: It 'd be a lot of work . phd a: I guess the work would be into getting the the files in the right formats , or something . phd a: Because when you train up the Aurora system , you 're ,  you 're also training on all the data . professor b: That 's true , but I think that also when we 've had these meetings week after week , oftentimes people have not done the full arrange of things phd a:   professor b: because on on whatever it is they 're trying , because it 's a lot of work , even just with the HTK . professor b: So , it 's it 's a good idea , but it seems like it makes sense to do some pruning phd a:   professor b: first with a a test or two that makes sense for you , phd a: Yeah . But , just testing on TI - digits would already give us some information about what 's going on .  , the next thing is this this VAD problem that ,  So , I 'm just talking about the the curves that I I sent I sent you so , whi that shows that when the SNR decrease , the current VAD approach doesn't drop much frames for some particular noises , which might be then noises that are closer to speech , acoustically . I They were supp Supposedly , in the next evaluation , they 're going to be supplying us with boundaries . First of all , the boundaries might be ,  like we would have t two hundred milliseconds or before and after speech . professor b: Do we ?  , is there some reason that we think that 's the case ? phd c: And No . professor b: But maybe we 'll get some insight on that when when , the gang gets back from Crete . professor b: And then the thing is if if they really are going to have some means of giving us fairly tight , boundaries , then that won't be so much the issue . phd g: Because w we were wondering whether that VAD is going to be , like , a realistic one or is it going to be some manual segmentation . And then , like , if if that VAD is going to be a realistic one , then we can actually use their markers to shift the point around , the way we want professor b:   phd g: to find a  , rather than keeping the twenty frames , we can actually move the marker to a point which we find more suitable for us . phd g: But if that is going to be something like a manual , segmenter , then we can't use that information anymore , phd c:   phd g: because that 's not going to be the one that is used in the final evaluation . There 's an  , I think it 's still for even for the evaluation , it might still be interesting to work on this because the boundaries apparently that they would provide is just , starting of speech and end of speech  , at the utterance level . phd c: So phd g: with some pauses in the center , provided they meet that whatever the hang - over time which they are talking . professor b: So if you could get at some of that ,  phd c: So professor b: although that 'd be hard . It might be useful for , like , noise estimation , and a lot of other things that we want to work on . So I did I just started to test putting together two VAD which was was not much work actually .  , I im re - implemented a VAD that 's very close to the , energy - based VAD that , the other Aurora guys use . phd c: and , detect detecting the first group of four frames that have a energy that 's above this threshold , and , from this point , tagging the frames there as speech . And it really removes it , still o on the noises where our MLP VAD doesn't work a lot . phd c: professor b: Cuz I would have thought that having some kind of spectral information , phd c: and professor b: you know , in the old days people would use energy and zero crossings , for instance  , would give you some better performance . Right ? Cuz you might have low - energy fricatives or or ,  stop consonants , or something like that . So , your point is will be to u use whatever professor b: Oh , that if you d if you use purely energy and don't look at anything spectral , then you don't have a good way of distinguishing between low - energy speech components and nonspeech . professor b: just as a gross generalization , most nonsp many nonspeech noises have a low - pass kind of characteristic , some sort of slope . And and most , low - energy speech components that are unvoiced have a a high - pass kind of characteristic phd c:   professor b: you know , at the beginning of a of a of an S sound for instance , just starting in , it might be pretty low - energy , phd c:   Whereas , a a lot of rumble , and background noises , and so forth will be predominantly low - frequency .  , you know , by itself it 's not enough to tell you , but it plus energy is sort of phd c: Yeah . professor b: if you look up in Rabiner and Schafer from like twenty - five years ago or something , that 's sort of what they were using then . It it might be that what I did is so , removes like low ,  low - energy , speech frames . Because the way I do it is I just I just combine the two decisions so , the one from the MLP and the one from the energy - based with the with the and operator . So if the energy - based dropped dropped low - energy speech , mmm , they they are they are lost . phd c: But s still , the way it 's done right now it it helps on on the noises where it seems to help on the noises where our VAD was not very good . But but , I guess what you 're saying is that the the MLP - based one has the spectral information . professor b: Well , you can imagine phd c: The way I use a an a \" AND \" operator is So , it I ,  professor b: Is ? phd c: The frames that are dropped by the energy - based system are are , dropped , even if the , MLP decides to keep them . phd a: No professor b: but  , I guess in principle what you 'd want to do is have a  , a probability estimated by each one and and put them together . phd a: Something that that I 've used in the past is ,  when just looking at the energy , is to look at the derivative . phd a: But , I 'm I 'm trying to remember if that requires that you keep some amount of speech in a buffer . phd c: Well , actually if I don't maybe don't want to work too much of on it right now . I just wanted to to see if it 's what I observed was the re was caused by this this VAD problem .  , which I 've just started yesterday to launch a bunch of , twenty - five experiments , with different , values for the parameters that are used . So , it 's the Makhoul - type spectral subtraction which use an over - estimation factor . So , we substr I subtract more , noise than the noise spectra that is estimated on the noise portion of the s  , the utterances . And after subtraction , I also add a constant noise , and I also try different , noise , values and we 'll see what happen . But st still when we look at the ,  Well , it depends on the parameters that you use , but for moderate over - estimation factors and moderate noise level that you add , you st have a lot of musical noise . On the other hand , when you subtract more and when you add more noise , you get rid of this musical noise but maybe you distort a lot of speech . So the next thing , maybe I what I will try to to do is just to try to smooth mmm , the ,  to smooth the d the result of the subtraction , to get rid of the musical noise , using some kind of filter , or phd g: Can smooth the SNR estimate , also . So , to get something that 's would be closer to what you tried to do with Wiener filtering . phd c: It phd g: And it 's phd c: Maybe you can phd g: go ahead . And there are there were some bugs in the program , so I was p initially trying to clear them up . Because one of the bug was I was assuming that always the VAD  , the initial frames were silence . So the it wasn't estimating the noise initially , and then it never estimated , because I assumed that it was always silence . phd c: So , in some cases s there are also phd g: SpeechDat - Car Italian . And , so once it was cleared , I ran a few experiments with different ways of smoothing the estimated clean speech and how t estimated the noise and , eh , smoothing the SNR also . And so the the trend seems to be like , smoothing the current estimate of the clean speech for deriving the SNR , which is like deriving the Wiener filter , seems to be helping . So we 'll have , like , a few results where the estimating the the More smoothing is helping . And , so I 'm I 'm trying a few more experiments with different time constants for smoothing the noise spectrum , and smoothing the clean speech , and smoothing SNR . So , one is fixed in the line , like Smoothing the clean speech is is helping , so I 'm not going to change it that much . But , the way I 'm estimating the noise and the way I 'm estimating the SNR , I 'm just trying trying a little bit . So , that h And the other thing is , like , putting a floor on the , SNR , because that if some In some cases the clean speech is , like when it 's estimated , it goes to very low values , so the SNR is , like , very low . So , I 'm thinking of , like , putting a floor also for the SNR so that it doesn't vary a lot in the low - energy regions . The results are , like So far I 've been testing only with the baseline , which is which doesn't have any LDA filtering and on - line normalization . So it 's just VAD , plus the Wiener filter , plus the baseline system , which is , just the spectral  , the mel sp mel , frequency coefficients . And the other thing that I tried was but I just took of those , Carlos filters , which Hynek had , to see whether it really h helps or not . And it 's it seems to be like it 's not hurting a lot by just blindly picking up one filter which is nothing but a four hertz a band - pass m m filter on the cubic root of the power spectrum . So there must be something that I can that can be done with that type of noise compensation also , which I guess I would ask Carlos about that .  , how how he derived those filters and and where d if he has any filters which are derived on OGI stories , added with some type of noise which what we are using currently , or something like that . So maybe I 'll professor b: This is cubic root of power spectra ? phd g: Yeah . professor b: So , if you have this band - pass filter , you probably get n you get negative values . phd g: So it has , like the spectrogram has , like  , it actually , enhances the onset and offset of  , the the begin and the end of the speech . So it 's there seems to be , like , deep valleys in the begin and the end of , like , high - energy regions , professor b:   phd g: So , those are the regions where there are , like when I look at the spectrogram , there are those deep valleys on the begin and the end of the speech . There are a few very not a lot of because the filter doesn't have a really a deep negative portion , so that it 's not really creating a lot of negative values in the cubic root . So , I 'll I 'll s may continue with that for some w I 'll I 'll Maybe I 'll ask Carlos a little more about how to play with those filters , and but while making this Wiener filter better . professor b: last week you were also talking about building up the subspace stuff ? phd g: Yeah . I I I would actually m m didn't get enough time to work on the subspace last week . phd a: How about you , Carmen ? phd d: Well , I am still working with , eh , VTS . And , one of the things that last week , eh , say here is that maybe the problem was with the diff because the signal have different level of energy . professor b:  ? phd d: And , maybe , talking with Stephane and with Sunil , we decide that maybe it was interesting to to apply on - line normalization before applying VTS . But then we decided that that 's it doesn't work absolutely , because we modified also the noise . I don't hav I don't this is I didn't do the experiment yet to apply VTS in cepstral domain . professor b: The other thing is So so , in i i and Not and C - zero would be a different So you could do a different normalization for C - zero than for other things anyway .  , the other thing I was gonna suggest is that you could have two kinds of normalization with with , different time constants . So , you could do some normalization s  , before the VTS , and then do some other normalization after . phd d: Well , we s decide to m to to obtain the new expression if we work in the cepstral domain . It 's k it 's k It 's quite a lot It 's a lot of work . phd d: And I want to know if if we have some feeling that the result I I would like to know if I don't have any feeling if this will work better than apply VTS aft in cepstral domain will work better than apply in m mel in filter bank domain . Well , you 're I think you 're the first one here to work with VTS , so , maybe we could call someone else up who has , ask them their opinion . phd c: Actually , the VTS that you tested before was in the log domain and so the codebook is e e kind of dependent on the level of the speech signal . phd d: Yeah ? phd c: And So I expect it If if you have something that 's independent of this , I expect it to it to , be a better model of speech . And then you have one number which is very dependent on the level cuz it is the level , phd d:   phd d: Ye phd c: Because it 's like first doing general normalization phd d: Yea phd c: and then noise removal , which is phd d: Yeah . We I was thinking to to to estimate the noise with the first frames and then apply the VAD , professor b:   phd d: We we see Well , I am thinking about that and working about that , professor b: Yeah .  , one of the things we 've talked about maybe it might be star time to start thinking about pretty soon , is as we look at the pros and cons of these different methods , how do they fit in with one another ? Because we 've talked about potentially doing some combination of a couple of them . Maybe maybe pretty soon we 'll have some sense of what their characteristics are , phd d:  -  "

        "Query": "What were the key points discussed by the group regarding the style, design optimization, design goal, evaluation criteria, features, and use cases of the remote control?",
        "Summary": "The team discussed the integration of remote controls for different appliances into one, but Marketing raised concerns about the excessive number of buttons and suggested incorporating a menu display instead. The Project Manager and User Interface agreed, but insisted on keeping basic buttons as well. However, the idea of a flip top was rejected due to cost considerations. As a temporary solution, lightweight plastic was chosen as the material. The team aimed to create an original, trendy, user-friendly, durable, creative, and characteristic remote control that would be intuitive for users. They also determined the price, cost, and expected profit of the remote control. Creativity was emphasized, with the goal of introducing fashion into electronics without compromising functionality. Marketing emphasized the need for a fashionable, technologically innovative, easy-to-use, customer-friendly, uncomplicated, functional, and ergonomically-friendly remote control. The Project Manager agreed and added that it should be quick to learn how to use. User Interface highlighted the importance of channel switching and suggested keeping the remote control as basic as possible. Marketing proposed that the remote control should be multipurpose to compete with existing products. The Project Manager agreed to explore innovative use cases and suggested operating different devices such as TVs, video recorders, and DVD players with the remote control.",
        "Article": "project manager: Are we done ? Right , okay  , this is our second meeting and I might be a bit all over the place . industrial designer: project manager: right our agenda for today , do you want us to give you a second ? marketing: no that's okay , project manager: Okay ,  marketing: sorry . project manager: we decided upon a universal control , one handset for all , T_V_ , video equipment . project manager: that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone . We decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , you know that kind of s thing .  , our budget would have to affect  try not to reflect our budget ,  that we might have a bit of oh oh you can see it , okay . industrial designer: project manager:  want it to look uncluttered , undaunting to the customer . We discussed a flip-open design ,  reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel  for further features like programming , things like that .  , three presentations , I've got written here so shall we hear from Marketing first ? marketing:  is it okay if I postpone that til later , I just want to get access to a little bit more information , project manager: No that's fine , that's fine . What do I have to press ? Oh , F_ eight ? project manager: F_N_ function F_ eight . project manager: industrial designer: 'Kay , this is where I went a bit mad with PowerPoint so . What the first thing question I asked was what are we trying to design ? Well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the T_V_ to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel  or the volume , everything is just  some sort of signal to change the state of the T_V_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to .  , so I decided I'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that . But  although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make sure that our design stands out and I thought that was something that well it wasn't really my area because I'm dealing with the inside really . So  , yeah I ran out of time so I couldn't do this one as fun as the last one . project manager: industrial designer:  and  I found out that most  controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the T_V_ presumably because of the cost issue of  something like  the same thing that computers use , wireless and , you don't need to send very much information . Now our one , I'm I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple A_ batteries but those can be quite bulky so I d I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else  so we could shrink down the size of the control . marketing: is that appropriate ? You're saying the triple A_ batteries are small or the surrounding it ? industrial designer:  no no , if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries , marketing: marketing: Right , the triple A_s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ? industrial designer: Yeah the the user interface: Okay . industrial designer: well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones but I'm just wondering about power consumption marketing: Oh I see . industrial designer: and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round .  , now the ones at the moment are small but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller . Now the main components I came up with  were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work ,  as I said about the w which batteries we were gonna choose , we can  discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the T_V_ unless they're in a cinema , which not most people do so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine . And then I was  just had a quick look at the external design but I d I left that mostly to the  interface designer . user interface: industrial designer: It's not a proper circuit , I'm not sure if it'd work or not , I'm not even confident that those are the real  the real way you'd wire it up but anyway , we've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the  U_I_ interface  which would basically , when you when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of I_R_ data which could be decoded by the T_V_ receiver , which obviously means that we're gonna have to conform to whatever  whatever form of communication that the T_V_s are already using and since that that's another use and reason to use that infrared because that's what all T_V_s use at the moment . And then finally ,  we want  the it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that I've put forward are  low in cost so that that should be good .  it should should be different enough  from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , we were talking about it before and also just something that I was thinking about ,  because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have , marketing:  . marketing: That's a very important part , it came up in our market research findings too so I can refer to that , whenever you like me to present . industrial designer: Alright okay , and yeah , that's that's what I came up with there , project manager: Okay , thank you very much . industrial designer: so if you wanna project manager: would you like to continue on from that ? user interface: Yep . user interface: but basically my method was like  whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll  take a feedback from the marketing because  , I haven't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable . So purpose , as William already said , I would put it to simplify the interaction with T_V_ to make make it as simple as possible . And to summarise I I would say it's it should be user-friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having  a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever . But we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will this two features together . The main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top . So it's like it could be accessed by a wide ra range of  audience and we can punch in new f features such as  added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people . Findings most people prefer us user-friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like  people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it's not of no use of punching in the  trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user . As we saw we we have to make a profit also so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production  by fifty million we said ? Yeah , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: with that I think we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also , so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly .  , that's so this is if you ask me personally , I would make  flip-top with a trendy   design and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after  continuous use usage and all that . project manager: okay so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end ,  industrial designer: Yeah sure . user interface: I think you'll have to marketing: Have I got to keep this here ? user interface: You can't marketing: Does it matter ? user interface: It'll have to this can't be pulled . marketing: I'll have t I'll have to move it won't I ? project manager: We just do the best we can . marketing: Okay , I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and  obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research .  , so that's where we started , we used our our usability lab , the company's usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards and  we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there . The overall thing which I've I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , so it has obvious design implications there . Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but  that's quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking . For example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot , user interface: Yeah .  , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , so again a big design issue there .  and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control .  the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were  something that you you mentioned earlier ,  remote controls are often lost in the room , it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing ,  fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that .  thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use and I think that ties in with the  the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions .  the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like  a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid I think in  when they've lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition . Something we didn't put to them , but which I'm thinking of now is  even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light , possibly . So thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses , they're not so bothered with this . marketing: but I think I'll just keep it simple , industrial designer: marketing: if there's any more information I can email you extra details , user interface: That's fine . project manager: we have new project requirements ,  we're not going to be using teletext , user interface: Okay .  our control is only going to be for T_V_ , it's not going to be a combined control , which limits you know all of the different things that it limits the cost for us , user interface: marketing: - , so can we not programme a video with this remote control ? project manager: It says for T_V_ only , so looks like it's just marketing: Just channel-hopping . project manager: yeah , I think maybe Sky things like that might be incorporated into it , but I don't know , what do you think ? It just said , for T_V_ only . I d well I dunno 'cause  the w if you've g project manager:  you bu well som you get com you get combined T_V_ and videos don't you ? industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: and if you got if you got a Sky box , they have one of those plus boxes , you can record straight off the T_V_ anyway so on to on to like the T_V_ hard drive or so . user interface: Anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want a combined something like that ? marketing: Yes . marketing:  we didn't really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about  ten percent of the buttons , user interface: Ten perc project manager:  . marketing: I think th th those do tend to be the basic channel-hopping things and on and off for the video , fast-forwarding , so on industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: and I think it's sort of general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Ju  just as an idea on the  speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing marketing: marketing: In fact I've just called up that table there , industrial designer: Alright , okay . marketing: we asked those two questions , the table relates to both questions , so we didn't differentiate . Would you prefer an L_C_D_ screen , that's multi-function remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control ? industrial designer: Alright , okay . marketing: So you can see how the the yes no sort of varies across the age group there , project manager: marketing: and a substantial number of don't knows in the older age group , I think that's just general fear of new technology . project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: Yeah but  on on that again I just thought 'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is user interface: project manager: We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves , so I think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing marketing:  . project manager:  because it is something I it needs to be the thing that you use to find it needs to be something that you don't lose , you were saying whistling , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: maybe on the T_V_ you could put like a pack on the T_V_ or something so you can't see the remote , you go and press the button on top of the T_V_ and it beeps user interface: Okay . project manager: and you're like oh okay it's over there , something like that , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager:  the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset .  so we want logo , we want  fashionable , trendy ,  what you were talking about with the marketing . marketing: Yes , further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is , it's gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who's sixty project manager: Yeah . What is  attractive to a trendy New Yorker and what is attractive to a retired South African , I dunno , project manager:  . At the end of the day , th the engineering design is one thing , it's the user interface design that may and th the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world . user interface: So are we talking of a single model or maybe five , six designs ? project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Well y yeah you could you could have a number of different designs user interface: Alright . user interface: So project manager: What about you were talking about the buttons , user interface: Yeah . project manager:  the controls that are coming out now have kind of big , rubber buttons , not tiny little one , big , rubber buttons , but what about , 'cause we got to make it original , what about  you know with the touch screen computers industrial designer: 'Kay . project manager: yeah ?  so you it's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which shouldn't wear out as much either , not sure about the user interface: industrial designer: No , well no 'cause you wouldn't have to you don't actually have to press them you just project manager: You don't have to press it , you just have to put your thumb onto it . project manager: think that might appeal I'm thinking kind of Japan , I'm thinking  young ,  office people , marketing:  . marketing: Yes it will appeal to sections of the market def project manager: but quite , easily labelled so that anyone can oh yeah that's obvious what that's for marketing: project manager: and it's not daunting to maybe the older generations ,  marketing: - ,  . But also er ergonomics as we're saying with the different designs , ergonomics  there's sort of physically different things 'cause  if you've ever seen the X_ Box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in Japan wouldn't buy it because the controller was physically to big project manager: Were too big . industrial designer: so they couldn't get round the controller which is  so if you I don't know what 'cause you obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others . user interface: Yeah ,  maybe to as  it it was indicated that   risk  of  repeated use , the injuries , maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that . user interface: So , a bigger b okay so y you're dividing designs based on not only segment age groups , you're desi  dividing it according to the countries also , the market . user interface: Maybe for U_S_ and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: in the sense that they can make it smaller , or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly ,  . project manager: It's gonna be the same , so we need to focus on just one thing , not get bogged down in lots of different  possibilities ,  . I'm concerned , when you read the the R_S_I_ issue again , repetitive strain injury , I don't think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough , I think that is still a kind of a question mark issue how we deal with that . marketing: I'm j I really can't get my head round this one , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: this may have to be postponed to a future meeting but it's something we should think about . industrial designer: I yeah I was just thinking about how you could combat that 'cause without without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel marketing:  . project manager: which is extremely expensive , industrial designer: but project manager: I think that's the only way that you kind of avoid that kind of issue . Do we have to initially  , you know looking at the findings here , focus on a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later . user interface: If say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market ? industrial designer: Ge  marketing: And when we've been throwing up our ideas we're automatically talking about business people , young people , trendy people . project manager: We are we're talking about  the type of company that we're working for as well . That they want  it to be fashionable , marketing: project manager: they want it to be trendy and you wouldn't automatically assume associate that with the older generations . project manager: Now with the baby boomers , the older generations are actually larger , they have a greater population than us young people , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: but I don't think we're focusing on that , I think we are focusing on a sort of mid-range  , business kind of class type people . I'm just thinking of budgetary issues too , for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage , we want to , you know , not waste money , not be profligate project manager: marketing: and  you know focus on where the idea will be taken up , first it's most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this . project manager: we've got the video , now there's  I can't remember what it's called , the little code at the end of programme details , industrial designer: Video plus . We could use that as an alternative to programming in times , things like that , is that industrial designer: Yeah yeah . project manager: because you've got your general record anyway so if you there's a programme on you want to put record on , that's fine , but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you're not sure if you're going to , you put the number in industrial designer: Just whack in the number . project manager: and it's just a number , it's not a date , it's not a time , it's not a channel , it's not when it finishes , it's not anything like that , industrial designer: And you w project manager: it's just a number . And you wouldn't you wouldn't need  a whole host of extra buttons for that , project manager: No . industrial designer: you just need one 'cause you've already got all the numbers there anyway , project manager: You've already got the numbers for typing in anyway . project manager: It is industrial designer: project manager: after  if you look in the newspaper , T_V_ guide or any T_V_ guide there's a five , six digit number afterwards industrial designer: It's not Yeah . project manager: and that's the number you put in and it's recorded that it's going to be on on Tuesdays at ten o'clock on the seventeenth marketing: Ah ,  . project manager: so you don't have to worry about dates and you don't have to worry about times , marketing: Right . industrial designer: It's been been around for a long time it's just it's not very well advertised as to how to use it and things . project manager: No it's not  but I think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that marketing: Superb . industrial designer: Though if y if you've got something like Sky anyway you can just click on it you can just press the button on the programme once and it'll record that programme when it's on project manager:  . project manager: Okay so marketing: Can I just run this past you while it occurs to me , I don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another , but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me , to produce our own mobile phones , that that's kind of what led us on to comparing T_V_ remote controls with with their design features , chain companies like Carphone Warehouse , you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Is it worthwhile with with our retail outlets having a a similar  kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this , if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets , th you know , which button is it I press for this ? Th as free as a free aspect of our service , would that not make it more attractive to them ? industrial designer:  . project manager: industrial designer: But the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract so they  the companies who  who you deal with have actually they've they've got an obligation to to help you out marketing:  . industrial designer: and also  it's it's fair enough to have some sort of help service but I I'm not sure how much the cost would be of having marketing: Right . project manager: The functionality of it in the sense that you're sitting there , you're pressing this button and your T_V_'s not doing it . Taking your T_V_ and your control and saying look this is what I'm doing , it's not working , what should I do ? marketing: Alright . Yes user interface: marketing: If it was something as simple as you couldn't change the channel , industrial designer: marketing: but  for if there were any more or are we absolutely definite it's only gonna be for T_V_ and video , project manager: I think so . project manager: there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: and that way there's no call out charge , there's no extra , t the person has to walk to a shop on the high street ,  . user interface: I think it will be too much of an effort for a person to for a phone maybe he might walk down the street , industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: And they're marketing: Not for such simple functions industrial designer: yeah , they should be f yeah . project manager: It does , industrial designer: It's the  project manager: you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong industrial designer: yeah . project manager: and then you try and search through it , so that should be something we think about . project manager: what other functions ? We need I'm not sure if we need a design  decision now , but we should think about c 'cause you've got the dilemma between oh batteries , that's what I was thinking about . Mobile phone batteries , what kinda battery is that ? industrial designer:  they're they're specially made for the for the mobile phones , but they come with a charger ,  you could you could bundle a charger in with it but project manager: Well they la they they last quite a long time , industrial designer: project manager: and if you had  when you th the thing that you get with mobile house phones , you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or t at night or something , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: but it doesn't really matter 'cause it never really runs out 'cause it lasts a long time once it is charged . industrial designer: Yeah and if yeah if you if you had if you had one of those  just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could  project manager: Yeah it could be on that yeah , okay . user interface: So are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ? project manager: S industrial designer: Yeah project manager: Yes . industrial designer: and also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time . I don't wanna big box with lots of things , you don't want a tiny sort of little thing either , marketing: project manager: because then you have got the repetitive strain injury no matter how many how much you try and make it simple , marketing:  . project manager:  marketing: And we don't w  so many remote controls look absolutely identical , project manager: They do . marketing: these long , brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface . We definitely an ob an obvious thing , a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles , we don't want that . project manager:  user interface: What I was thinking of a design which Nokia h  came up with almost six or seven years back . user interface: That's very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up , so they came up with something like this , curled up , so here , marketing: user interface: and you don't have to you don't bend your thumb too much , so it's like  you can say a banana shape kind of thing , curled up like a boat . user interface: G  so what happens is you don't have to press your thumb too down like . user interface: y yeah so we can have a s like you know moulded according to your marketing:  . user interface: the way you h hold of it's kind of semi-circular in the bottom , something like that . project manager: Can you look into the company logo ?  , things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product . project manager:  for example , if it was a C_ or something like that , you could have it in a vague C_ shape that opens up kind of like a shell , or something , user interface: project manager:  something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite  obviously into the design , marketing: project manager: while also making it quite different from anything else that's there . What we were talking is to make it more rather than like sea-shells , marketing:  look at the mobile . user interface: logo could become as you could put a logo in the corner of  the model , rather than you know , trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like . marketing: I think that's that sounds a really attractive idea , user interface: A sea shell ? marketing: I've not come across anything like that before , if it kind of yeah and that opens out into your flip-top . marketing: Then it's nice t to h you can make it lightweight plastic , nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers , that's gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that I would think . marketing: and plus you can get you know even though we're using plastic , you can still  think of the designs you can get in plastic , we can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior . project manager: Or you could do  different , like you get with mobile phones , different fascias . project manager: So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and marketing: Yeah . Less chance of it being lost too , it's not like a chocolate brown lozenge that's gonna go down the sofa project manager: Yeah . marketing: and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament they don't not gonna lose it so much either . user interface: Yeah maybe we could come at some say five , six des designs and then choose which are whichever appeals the most like , project manager: Okay . Right , I think we have to round it up ,  marketing: Can I just quickly  go over the new project requirements so that I haven't missed anything . marketing: So it's no teletext , it's only for T_V_ and by implication video , user interface: project manager: That was  in cutting down the number that was kinda separate that was cutting down the number of functions , making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date marketing: Right . Right , so when they press for programming you it comes up on the L_C_D_ , a reminder about using Videoplus ? So that they have a look at the guide and Or was is this nothing to do with the project requirements , is this just that was an add-on feature ? project manager: It's kinda takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel , things like that . Right , so it's kind of doing away with the programming feature ? project manager:  it could be it c It yes , industrial designer: Yeah . And it also paid  lip service in the instruction manual , 'cause it's very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful . marketing: Was there anything else there that we in the new new project requirements ? project manager:  user interface: Yeah . project manager: We've got the buttons but I think we'll work through that with the design of it ,  . That's not at the moment a requirement , it's something we're looking at , project manager: Yes . marketing: what preference so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like . project manager: And we've talked about  there being an alarm or something , a beeping for being lost ,  . But there aren't gonna be that func that many functions incorporated into it so it should be fine and the I the instruction manual , I don't know if we deal with that ,  . I think user interface: Yep , project manager: Yep , user interface: I think project manager: and different from what's out there . marketing: What would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting ? industrial designer: Okay . marketing: Or shall I just sort of generally look at all the issues involved ? project manager: I think you might get guidance , but  I th Instruction manuals , 'cause there tends to be a demonised thing , marketing: Okay . project manager: u  , they're everyone's got like a big pile of them , but no one really uses them . user interface: I think it's time for us to get back to marketing: 'Cause we're at lunchtime now I think "

        "Query": "Summarize the discussion on the appearance, materials, and desired features of the television remote.",
        "Summary": "The company recommends incorporating its corporate colors and design into the product, including the option for different colors like pink or banana yellow and fun shapes such as animals. They also discussed the idea of using buttons with various shapes, like triangles for volume and squares for channels. It was agreed upon that the text on the remote should be clear and the remote itself should be compact. \n\nDuring the discussion, the group realized that balancing the budget and maintaining quality would be challenging. To save costs without compromising user experience, the Project Manager decided to use high-quality recycled plastic as the material for the remote. However, they were willing to invest in a cutting-edge lithium battery for optimal performance.\n\nThe company's slogan and design target revolve around incorporating fashion into electronics. While the idea of providing user-customizable skins was rejected due to the amount of work involved, they decided to add the company logo on the boot-up screen and introduce a dormant mode. This was because most people prefer a non-flashing remote when the TV is on.\n\nThere were two main reasons behind these design choices. Firstly, the unit price of each remote control was relatively high, at twenty-five Euros. To justify this price point, the features of the remote had to be satisfying and of high quality. Secondly, there was competition in the market from other TV remote controls. Therefore, the new remote controls needed to be special and different in order to attract customers.",
        "Article": "lynne neagle am: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to today's meeting of the\u00a0Children, Young People and Education\u00a0Committee. Can I ask Members whether there are any declarations of interest, please? darren millar am: Yes, I have a declaration of interest, Chair. I understand that my daughter features in one of the videos that is going to be used to contribute evidence to this inquiry. And, in addition, I'm a governor of one of the schools that features in the video. So, item 2, then, today is our first session on the provision of textbooks and learning resources for pupils, which is a video of interviews with young people and teachers. The committee team has been out to take video evidence around Wales, and we're now going to watch the results of that on the screen. Well, I'm sure that the committee\u00a0would want me to place on record our thanks to the young people and the teachers who took part in that very helpful and informative video. We'll move on now then to our evidence session, and I'm very pleased to welcome Gareth Pierce, chief executive of the WJEC,\u00a0Mike Ebbsworth, assistant director educational support, WJEC,\u00a0Philip Blaker, chief executive of Qualifications Wales, and\u00a0Emyr George, associate director general qualifications\u00a0at Qualifications Wales. So, thank you all of you for attending and thank you for the papers that you provided in advance as well. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions now, and if I can just start by asking you to outline what you see as your role in ensuring that students and teachers in Wales have the resources that they need to pass general qualifications and what you think the role of commercial publishers and Welsh Government is. philip blaker: Shall I start? So, Qualifications Wales is the regulator of the awarding bodies, so we regulate awarding bodies. In regulating the awarding body, our primary focus is also on the design of the qualifications and then the delivery of the assessment. That said, when we are going through the design of the qualifications, we go through an approval process, so we develop approval criteria and we ask WJEC\u00a0to submit their specifications against those approval criteria and sample assessment materials as well. So, our focus is very much on making sure that teachers are able, through the sample assessment materials and the specifications, to have a good understanding of what is going to be expected of them in the examinations and of their pupils in the examinations. So, that's setting out the knowledge, skills and understandings\u00a0that will be assessed by WJEC\u00a0when those exams are sat. So, during the last round of approvals, we pulled together interested parties in Welsh Government, regional consortia and WJEC\u00a0to look at resources that would be available with a view to facilitating the discussion about who would be best placed to fill the gaps where there may be perceived to be gaps in resources. Our other primary role is in maintaining standards.\u00a0So, as the regulator of qualifications, what we want to do is we want to make that the awards of qualifications\u2014so, the grades that people get\u2014are fair.\u00a0One of the things we do is set out the way in which the awarding bodies will set grades\u2014so, the awarding process, the methods that will be used\u2014and then we monitor WJEC's\u00a0award of grades against those processes. During a period of change, we prescribe the use of comparable outcomes as the primary approach, largely because comparable outcomes are designed for circumstances like this, where there's a change in a specification particularly, because there are any number of reasons, including resources, why performance may be different from one year to the next, but comparable outcomes is there to ensure that, all things being equal, if the cohorts have the same ability, the same grade should be awarded from one year to the next. Much of that has been related to the timelines that we've all had to deliver new specifications against, which have been far from ideal for everybody involved. We think that particularly our role moving forward will be looking at the timelines for reforms\u00a0that will be necessary for the new curriculum to make sure that this situation isn't repeated and that there is sufficient time in future reforms to allow for greater system readiness. In terms of the roles of others, Welsh Government have a role at the moment in terms of grant funding of translation of materials into Welsh medium. And there is, through the common model at the moment\u2014and this is a model that is common between England and Wales\u2014a reliance on commercial publishers to provide textbooks. Now, that's something that probably needs to be looked at in the future in terms of potential\u00a0different models for how that might be achieved and also, potentially, around a paradigm shift in what's expected of those materials. The WJEC does provide what's required in a regulatory sense, and there are two things there\u2014the specification, which tends to be very comprehensive in providing guidance in terms of drawing up a programme of teaching, and also exemplar assessments, which include marking, and those go to the regulator before they are published. The WJEC also do invest a great deal in resources that we produce digitally in both languages simultaneously. Each new course has substantial teaching guidance, which includes a great deal of useful information for teachers and pupils. And we run a professional development programme for teachers that is free of charge when courses are new, and then annually there is some charge for those events. Indeed, the regulations as they stand in Wales, Northern Ireland and England preclude examination bodies from having commercial links with providers of textbooks, but that is something that emerges from the three-nation regime that existed in terms of qualifications. So, that is one point that we noted as something that needs to be considered for Wales as we move forward, whether it would be possible\u2014. As\u00a0we are not talking about examination boards competing with each other in Wales for GCSE and A-levels, in passing, that is something that I would want to suggest may deserve review. At the moment, these tend to be England-based\u2014Hodder Education and Illuminate Education, for example\u2014and then the Welsh Government does provide funding to the WJEC to support the process of providing Welsh-language versions for those textbooks. So, we use that funding to provide editorial support to the process, and also to pay for translation costs, and we give significant guidance in terms of terminology. We have a language services team including excellent editors and translators within the WJEC, and we work closely with external translators too, and we use translation technology increasingly, which facilitates a great many things. Beyond that, I think the WJEC does see the need for flexibility, particularly when difficulties arise, and you heard there of some of the methods used by Mike and others to get digital resources available earlier than the print versions. And I should also note perhaps that, as the WJEC is very much involved with stakeholders, we feel that we do have a contribution to make in terms of ideas for the future. What is your view on that as a good use of teachers' time in Wales? gareth pierce: I think the question of translation is an interesting one. I think perhaps we need to understand what causes the need for that because, as I mentioned earlier, there are so many resources available digitally in both languages at the same time. Perhaps an interesting question is: is that source useful for teachers, being able to draw resources from two sources? Another interesting question, I think, is\u2014. The Welsh language, of course, is a language that is used in an educational context, but we are in a big world that's an English language world. I'm very aware that many of the websites we refer to in our resources and many of the case studies, as was mentioned in that video\u2014they are available\u00a0in English only.\u00a0Therefore, I think another interesting question is: can we discover what those additional resources are that are worth translating? And, certainly, it would be very unfortunate\u00a0if there were a dozen Welsh-medium schools, for example, translating material from the same website independently of each other. If there are a few websites, or a few case studies, in this big external\u00a0digital world that are worth translating, shouldn't we able to source those early? Because I don't think it's a good use of teachers' time. What is the vision in terms of teaching in a Welsh-medium class, in particular, perhaps, in the\u00a0A-level classes? I'm sure that some teachers feel that there is a way\u00a0of enriching\u00a0the\u00a0teaching by referring to terms in both languages, as well as explaining those terms in their own language. But the impression I got from the video was that there was quite a lot of mechanical translating happening, and\u00a0perhaps there is a need to understand more of the context. llyr gruffydd am: Just to pick up on your point on the additional\u00a0materials, whose role would it be to asses\u00a0this or to take that overview, and then to respond to the demand? gareth pierce: Mike, in the WJEC, has conversations about resources in the team he's part of. That is extremely important\u2014to identify, as Gareth has just said, those materials that need to be translated, and not everything\u00a0needs to. We've made a lot of use recently of speaking with teachers and\u00a0the consortia, and ensuring\u00a0then that we are focusing on those things that need that attention. llyr gruffydd am: But would you\u2014? The question I'm asking is: would you still see that as a core part of your work, although\u00a0it's not necessarily essential in terms of the provision that you're required to provide? gareth pierce: Yes, we invest substantially from the WJEC budget into digital resources. So, through the types of conversations\u00a0that Mike mentioned, in terms of identifying needs, deciding on priorities with\u00a0teachers in individual subject areas, that can provide very useful\u00a0information\u00a0for us in terms of prioritisation. llyr gruffydd am: And do we need further resources for that? gareth pierce: Well, it's an interesting\u00a0question. The WJEC is doing as much as we can\u2014 llyr gruffydd am: Why isn't it happening to the extent that it needs to happen, then? gareth pierce: One can always do more, of course. The WJEC is trying to use its budget prudently, and most of our funding comes from payments made by schools and\u00a0colleges in terms of taking assessments. So, we do need to make choices within the substantial budget we have in terms of the work that Mike is undertaking. mike ebbsworth: There is a need to be careful as well in identifying resources and needs, and that those are suited towards the requirements. Quite often a teacher\u2014and I've been a teacher myself\u2014has this idea that there is a need to have everything. There has been a move towards different means of assessment over recent years, and we've moved our resources towards that to meet the needs of teachers on how to undertake\u00a0that sort of assessment. lynne neagle am: Did you want to come in on any of this? philip blaker: I'm just going to say one thing. Teachers will want to be creative in the use of resources, and, in doing that, they'll potentially want to adapt resources from either language. I think one of the things that we would be quite keen to try and establish moving forward is what is the common core that should by default be available bilingually, and then what sits around that that would be for schools to use creatively and adapt. And what I wouldn't want to see is a default\u00a0position where all materials were bilingual\u2014a wide range of resources that might be created from all sorts of diverse, different channels\u2014because\u00a0that may inhibit the creation of some of those materials that may be more creative, which could then be used by teachers as they see appropriate. But I think it is reasonable to\u00a0expect for that core, common body\u00a0of knowledge\u00a0to be available bilingually by default, and for teachers not to have to spend time translating that. The \u00a3500,000 funding for Welsh-medium educational resource that's in the budget for 2018-19\u2014are you able to share any information\u00a0with the committee as to how that's going to be spent? gareth pierce: Tthe WJEC has some information in terms of that budget. It is a Welsh Government budget, and they have annual discussions with us as to what resources we are likely to be working on along with publishers, and where we would like to make a claim against that grant to pay for the editorial and translation costs that we will have incurred. Now, there have been conversations recently about possible support from that grant for some research work into the use of various materials and resources, and also, although this would be a very small part, a contribution towards seminars for publishers. But that isn't a full picture of the \u00a3500,000; I think you would have to ask the Welsh Government about the exact allocation of that total fund. We've just started this financial year; I'm sure there is some flexibility in their thinking in terms of the use of some of this resource. We have contributed a list of publications, for example, that are ongoing, and they're aware of that, and a percentage of that funding then will go towards ensuring that those are there through the medium of Welsh. darren millar am: This is a huge mess, isn't it? It's a huge mess, which is causing lots of pressure and extra work for teachers, lots of pressure and extra work for learners, and is affecting the well-being of students, at a time when they need to be mentally fit, in order to go through the general stress that learners face when they have exams coming up. We know that the problems are not confined to Welsh-medium resources; they're also being experienced in English language resources as well, particularly in terms of the availability of textbooks. You've both mentioned\u2014both of your organisations have mentioned that there needs to be some sort of common core of resources available for learners and teachers, and I would agree with you on that front. But isn't a textbook a pretty basic element of anybody's toolkit for supporting a child getting through the information that they need to learn, and swot up on, in advance of exams? gareth pierce: I think that the evidence is that different learners see their requirements differently. But I think the evidence also shows that not every young person will use them; perhaps the teacher uses them. There is an emphasis, for example, from one pupil there, on that traditional model of revision, namely class notes and his own revision notes, but that he personally also wanted a textbook. So, certainly, the content of a textbook is going to be important, and that that's available in some form or other. It was very interesting to know, for example, that when he was describing the traditional model of revision, he felt that he'd had quite a lot of the content of the textbook through the classroom notes. Much of that digital content, of course, corresponds to the content areas of a textbook, but it's just in a different form. And some of our frustration as well is that the timetables of some individual publishers don't always get us to the point where there is a textbook available in time. That doesn't happen so often in English medium, but we know about that gap in time in the Welsh provision. darren millar am: Well, it's happened fairly regularly in the English-medium textbook world, hasn't it? My daughter\u2014she featured in that video\u2014has got her RS qualifications coming up, and she only had a textbook over the Easter period. You mentioned digital resources; not everybody's got access to digital resources in their own homes, even, in Wales. So, aren't we giving a significant disadvantage to those learners who might need the traditional 'swotting up\u00a0from a textbook' method\u00a0of revision and benefit from that? mike ebbsworth: We do ensure that those digital resources include things that the teachers can also print. Most of these are resources for teachers so that the teachers can\u00a0adapt them for their own use, to suit the learners who are in front of them at any given time. If there are activities, then those\u00a0activities can be printed off and handed to pupils so that they can take them home. gareth pierce: I think you're right that the\u00a0availability of technology is an\u00a0important part of this big picture. The young\u00a0people talk about websites and blogs, and we're talking about digital resources, so being able to reach those resources, I think, is vital in Wales.\u00a0It's interesting to note two contradictory remarks from the teaching\u00a0associations in the letters. One\u00a0teaching organisation says that it\u00a0just creates more work, while another\u00a0organisation says that the digital resource is something that's\u00a0very valuable. Of course, the headteacher at the end was praising the fact that, in a\u00a0situation of\u00a0crisis or\u00a0unacceptable timetables, we have succeeded in\u00a0creating some\u00a0resources that\u00a0will be in the textbook later, but\u00a0available digitally at an early stage. But I agree with your core comment that technology is vital, and access to that, and also the content of a textbook in some form is\u00a0vital as well. darren millar am: Mr Blaker, you would agree that a textbook should be an essential core piece of the resource pack available for each qualification. philip blaker: I think we wouldn't want to underplay the desirability of textbooks, recognising that different learners have different learning styles and may look to different resources. I think what I'd like to raise is a wider concern about textbooks in their current model, which is very much around the fact that\u00a0every time there's a change in a specification, there's a new textbook, which is designed around that specification and is endorsed by an awarding body, which is a nice model for a publisher, because every time there's a change, there's an opportunity for a new textbook. Ofsted and also Estyn have raised concerns about the focus in teaching on teaching to the test as a common concern in both nations. I have a concern that having a textbook that is endorsed by the awarding body and is designed specifically around that specification may lead to some of that tendency. I think I'd much rather see that textbooks are seen as a curriculum resource that are broader than, perhaps, the model of endorsement and the current model of publication suggest. darren millar am: So, you don't think that a textbook for each subject should be a core resource for pupils who are learning in advance of examinations. I think a textbook for each subject is absolutely an essential part of the broad range of resources that you'd want to see available for people to choose what they prefer, but on a subject, perhaps, rather than a specific specification, because I think there's a tendency to conflate the two, and much of the underlying content that is assessed in one specification, or a new updated specification, will remain unchanged. It is true that there may be a different focus or emphasis, or a different style of questioning, but that can be picked up more nimbly through supplementary digital resources, for example,\u00a0which can highlight that change, particularly to a teacher, so that they can shape their lesson planning around that. What we are looking at here are reformed GCSEs and\u00a0reformed A-levels in subjects that are well-established, traditional subjects, and so whilst it is not necessarily the ideal, I think it's\u00a0important to remember\u00a0that there is already a good deal of pre-existing resources, including textbooks, out there in schools already. We're not for a moment saying that that is the situation that we would want everybody\u00a0to be in. I think it might be preferable\u00a0if the textbook was perfectly bespoke to the course and didn't contain any extraneous\u00a0material, but that perhaps is an ideal picture and I think we do need to remember that there are already many resources out there that are available to teachers and to students. darren millar am: But of course, unlike their peers in perhaps other parts of the UK, we have teachers who are having to go meticulously\u00a0through some of these other resources that might be available to determine whether\u00a0they're appropriate for use in the classroom, given that the specification\u00a0is different in terms of the new qualifications. Can I just ask you about the disadvantage that some learners\u00a0might face as a result of the lack of textbooks? Mr Blaker, I note that you sought to reassure the committee in some of your opening remarks about the fact that equivalent outcomes are what you aim to achieve in discussion with the WJEC in terms of the outcome of assessments, and I think that that's a very positive thing. But, how do you differentiate between the different learning styles of individual students who are in that cohort to ensure that the disadvantage that one faces because\u00a0they're somebody who relies particularly\u00a0heavily on textbook-type learning, traditional\u00a0sort of swotting up for examinations, versus someone who is much more digitally aware and able to use digital resources\u2014? How do you make sure that it's fair to the cohort as a whole, while still enabling some of these individuals\u00a0for whom textbooks are important not to face disadvantage within that cohort? philip blaker: The systems that are in place are very much around making sure that awarding is fair across the whole cohort. It's very difficult\u2014in fact, it would be impossible\u2014to unpick all of the different factors that might affect performance, because\u00a0you could well have a textbook that's been available\u00a0for some time, it may be somebody's preferred leaning style to use a textbook, but did they use that textbook effectively? You know, did they open it in revision or did they not open it in revision? So, there are so many different factors that can affect individual\u00a0performance. They particularly wanted to stress this point I think; that the quality of teaching is\u00a0probably the most dominant and the most important factor in relation to a learner's ultimate performance\u00a0in the examination. darren millar am: I understand that, but you also understand that someone who doesn't have the resources that they feel are best suited to them face some element of a greater disadvantage\u00a0than others for whom, perhaps, textbooks are less important. gareth pierce: I think also, perhaps, related to that, it is important to mention digital literacy here. Every young person in Wales, I would hope, taking GCSE or A-level, should have that digital literacy in order to source\u00a0the valuable materials available\u2014that they should have those skills. Then, they have the choice whether they go down the digital route, or do they do as Mike suggested\u2014much of the digital material can be printed\u2014or do they then turn to textbooks, in the hope that those would be available? That would then allow for a pupil's personal learning choice to be reflected. It's also important for teachers to confirm that their ways of teaching do support these alternative approaches taken by pupils. darren millar am: I understand that, but I've got people in my constituency who haven't even got a broadband link at home, so there's a digital disadvantage as well. Can I just ask you about the reason why this has taking so long to sort out? It was back in 2015 that concerns were first raised\u00a0about the availability\u00a0of textbooks in both English and Welsh for the new qualifications. We're three years\u00a0on, what on earth has been happening in the interim and why is it taking so long? If you've got these resources digitally, why can't they just be compounded into textbooks pretty straightforwardly? gareth pierce: I think the main reason for that is that there are three series of reforms of qualifications that have happened. Those three cycles of reform have all suffered from the short timetable\u00a0that was between approving a qualification and publishers being able to start the work. Perhaps an interesting comparison would be a subject being taught for the first time in 2015\u2014where that subject has reached now in terms of resources. I would hope that each one of those subjects have more available now in terms of resources, and therefore we are adding each year\u2014not textbooks but digital resources. So, every subject is moving on over a period of time of five to six years while that specification is being studied. But those same difficulties have, unfortunately, affected 2015 subjects and 2017 subjects, and that's why we're discussing the same thing in 2018. darren millar am: So, it's the scale of the challenge and the volume of the work? gareth pierce: Yes. philip blaker: I think Gareth, in the evidence that he has provided to the committee previously, has said about the timeline, the schedule, for reforms. Now, that's a schedule that we inherited and was largely dominated by the schedule for reforms in England. Now that we've reached a point of divergence in GCSEs and A-levels, between England and Wales, it gives us much more agency in the future to establish a timeline that doesn't place the pressures on the system. So, Gareth has quite\u00a0rightly pointed out that there are three waves of reforms, but the pressures that build up in the first wave are consequential onto the next wave and the wave after that. So, the whole system\u00a0has been pressured both from a regulatory perspective of the approval process, the awarding body preparing its submissions to use, and then system readiness\u00a0thereafter. I assume that advice was given by WJEC and Qualifications Wales and your predecessor organisation to the Welsh Government\u00a0at that time protesting about the timescale\u00a0that you were being expected to abide\u00a0by. gareth pierce: Yes, and similarly in England, the examination boards working in England would have provided the same advice to the Government there. And, of course, the Welsh Government programme was associated with the reform programme in England, in particularly for those A-level subjects, where there was a strong influence from the universities across the UK in terms of what they wanted to see differently in the A-level subjects. So, England and Wales have run on a very short timetable common to both countries, and I would say that every exam board and every publisher has seen this very challenging in Wales and England. But our advice is that there is a real need for between 18 months and two years from completing a specification that has been approved, then being able to work with teachers on what their needs and requirements will be, thinking about what the teaching programme will be, and then starting to work with publishers and get resources available\u2014ideally, with a year of preparation then for the teacher before they start teaching. So, as they will know what resources will be available, we'll be able to discuss the use of those resources in our professional development programmes, and then that timeline is convenient for everybody. llyr gruffydd am: Estyn, NAHT, UCAC, NASUWT, WJEC and Qualifications Wales have pointed to the way in which the Government has managed the reforms that have been happening over the past few years as one of the things that has led to some of these difficulties. Well, what about the tsunami of curriculum reform that we're currently facing? That is, how confident can we be that the situation won't deteriorate as the new curriculum is introduced\u2014rather than improve? gareth pierce: That is a very key question, isn't it? We have started to discuss this, specifically in particular in a forum that includes publishers in Wales, with the Welsh Government around the table and Qualifications Wales around the table. I think one of the very interesting questions and important questions is: what will\u00a0the nature of the information available in April 2019 be\u00a0in terms of the new curriculum? At what level of detail will it be? To what extent will it be adapted again after April 2019? Is it detailed enough, really, for teachers to start discussing their programmes of teaching, and that we then still have a role with publishers, even though this is for this curriculum and not for qualifications? WJEC has a tradition of publishing resources over the key stages and other key stages as well. I think there is a need to discuss the implications of the timetable as it starts to appear, because there is a need to start teaching the new curriculum in September 2022. If we're talking about working on resources available for that preparation year, we're talking about September 2020. So, the timetable does appear already tight, particularly if there's something that's not quite certain about that curriculum statement in 2019, and that there is a lot of work to turn that into teaching programmes. So, I think it is a key question, and I can't be confident at the moment that this is going to work. lynne neagle am: Did you want to come in, Philip? philip blaker: I think one of the big differences is it's a tsunami we can see coming. So, young people will be assessed for the first time, assuming linear exams, in the summer 2027, which is some way away, and, actually, given the reform process historically, this is probably the most foresight\u00a0we've seen of a big change like this. There is a big dependency on the curriculum and the curriculum being described in such a way that we can relate qualifications to that curriculum, because qualifications should relate to the curriculum rather than drive the curriculum, so we do need to see something coming out of that. I think, for us, once we've seen the curriculum, and we've got better sight of it, we'll be able to plan things out. We've already started engagement with awarding bodies over the possible supply chain for these new qualifications, and, ultimately, there'll be a go/no-go decision that would need to be made, probably in 2023, which would be that if the conditions don't appear right for safe implementation, then we would make a recommendation to Welsh Government that these reforms are delayed in terms of the qualification, not in terms of the curriculum, for a year to allow the system to be able to catch up. So, we're starting to plan out not only the whole of the process, but also thinking about where we might have to make key decisions. gareth pierce: Just one very brief comment in that context: I think that the comment of the consortia jointly is important there. They emphasise, in the context of the curriculum, the importance of the autonomy of teachers in interpreting and providing, therefore I think we truly need to discuss that. Does that suggest that there won't be so much need for national resources, or are those resources required to support that autonomy in any case? We need to discuss that at an early stage and in detail, I think. llyr gruffydd am: Yes, certainly, and one is concerned that that conversation isn't already happening, but, yes, okay, you've made that point clearly. If I could return, therefore, to the commercial issue\u2014clearly, there is a shortage of providers in Wales, and we are reliant on others. You suggested that the WJEC may be interested in stepping up and taking some sort of role if regulations were changed. I assume that that would be something that you would be eager to see happening in terms of the change to regulation in that context. I think that I haven't described correctly the purpose of a seminar to encourage interest: the interest is there, but there needs to be an understanding of what the implications are of working towards that kind of\u00a0timetable, what the implications are of working in two languages, what kind of business model, perhaps, would be suitable for the publishers in Wales, how much certainty could be given to them that there is a period of work, because they would want to build their teams, and develop skills within those teams, and to have enough certainty that this is worth doing. And therefore, those are the sort of issues that we're starting a discussion on, in the hope of having a discussion in June to move that forward. Of course, Welsh Government, Qualifications Wales and other stakeholders are part of this discussion, not only WJEC, but we've been part of initiating that discussion. llyr gruffydd am: Is this developing at the pace that you would like to see it developing? gareth pierce: Yes, I think, and there is some enthusiasm. For example, a number of publishers in Wales are within an association describing itself as Cwlwm Cyhoeddwyr Cymru. Myrddin ap Dafydd is chair of Cwlwm at the moment, and there is enthusiasm and vision, certainly. So, there's a wonderful opportunity, I think, for Wales to interpret\u00a0these possibilities swiftly and then hopefully take action on them. llyr gruffydd am: And we're talking here not just about translating but developing resources, and the point, I think, is an important one around some of the evidence that we've received about the importance of developing resources naturally bilingually from the very beginning, rather than having to translate something. Because\u00a0there have been comments that translations are clunky, difficult to follow and not\u2014I'm not saying that they're not fit for purpose, but certainly don't facilitate teaching, perhaps, as easily as one would wish. gareth pierce: Yes, I would agee, and that begins with the authors, doesn't it? We must have the authors\u2014 llyr gruffydd am: So, the expertise, and the same capacty with the publishers as well. gareth pierce: Yes, and we do want to nurture authors within Wales, particularly given that the new curriculum has to do justice to a Welsh dimension within the curriculum in so many different subjects. So, we need authors who can be developed, and authors who would be willing to work with the publishers. llyr gruffydd am: Would that market be viable without any sort of subsidy, if it were to develop bilingually? Or do we have to accept that they have to have an element\u00a0of public subsidy? gareth pierce: Our view in the WJEC is that subsidy will be necessary. Why not rethink that and think of a subsidy for producing resources in two languages for the Welsh curriculum? And perhaps we would need a little more funding for that. But there will be organisations such as the WJEC who will still be interested in contributing, because we are a charity, and within our mission is investment in various things\u00a0that supports education in Wales. llyr gruffydd am: But in terms of where we are now, resources have to be translated. But also, how long is acceptable to wait for a translation, in your view? mike ebbsworth: We've done a great deal of work recently, over recent years, to ensure that that delay between having an English version and a Welsh version is reduced. We are highly aware of the fact that the best-case scenario is that the Welsh and the English are available simultaneously. In those terms, we've taken huge steps forward with the publishers that we've named this morning, so that we have discussed translation as the textbook is being produced. The nature of books is that the author may change his or her mind, or edit as he or she is writing. Well, with that model, we would have to ensure that we approved as we moved forward, chapter by chapter perhaps, so that there would be no changes to be made from then on. At the end of the process, then, the publishers in England have agreed to hold the English version back for a period of time until the Welsh version is available, and then to publish both simultaneously. Unless that timetable is followed throughout the process, there are inherent risks in that process, of course, as I've mentioned in terms of translation as we author materials, and in ensuring that that timetable is stuck to. gareth pierce: And perhaps there is a need to emphasise that the process is translation and editing as a package, and that sometimes the same amount of time goes on the editing, how the Welsh works in terms of diagrams and things that aren't text necessarily\u2014pictures and so forth. So, eight weeks, I think, is the time that we've succeeded in agreeing with the publishers so that we can turn around the Welsh version in that period of time. So, you\u2019re telling us, Mr Ebbsworth, that the WJEC has agreed with Hodder and Illuminate that, in future, even if an English textbook is available for publication, and it\u2019s already late, you will further delay the availability of that textbook so that it can be published on the same day as the Welsh-medium textbook? mike ebbsworth: We can only work on those books that are in the process of being developed. Naturally, if something is late in English, then that timetable would be affected in terms of\u00a0a decision that\u00a0will ultimately have to be taken. But that's the hope: that when new textbooks are produced in English and authored in English, we would look at that eight-week period as a turnaround. darren millar am: I understand the point that you made earlier about the chapter-by-chapter approach, which seems much more equitable. But to suggest that you will delay books that could be available for students and could be available for teachers to be able to access by two months because you haven't got the systems in place to be able to produce them on the same day, seems to be wholly inappropriate. Can I ask, also, why on earth it isn't possible to produce Welsh-medium textbooks first and then translate them to English on occasions? mike ebbsworth: We're entirely open to that and to that sort of model. darren millar am: So, why has that never ever been done? gareth pierce: Well, of course, it would happen with subjects that stem from Wales, but I think the problem is that we work with publishers and those publishers and their authors, therefore, tend to work through the medium of English. But, just to be clear, this idea of delaying an English version is something that the Welsh Government is eager for us to experiment with, but not with textbooks that are already late. They are within the new programme of textbooks that are contained within the grant that you mentioned of \u00a3500,000. So, in a way, this is an experiment and the Welsh Government wants to look at this as one way of responding to the complaint that there are different timetables available. darren millar am: So, you're being forced to do this by the Welsh Government, rather than\u2014 gareth pierce: Well, we've agreed to do it in discussion with them. darren millar am: So, are you happy with that approach? gareth pierce: Well, as long as the textbook isn't late in the first place, then yes; it's worth trying. There is a challenge on the eight weeks, there is a challenge in the publisher sticking to the timetable in terms of the English version first of all, but we are willing to use this as a test bed, and we're working on two specific textbooks on this. lynne neagle am: I think the committee is struggling with this idea, so what do you understand to be the rationale behind that, then? Is it that both sets of pupils should be equally disadvantaged? gareth pierce: Well, no, in a way, it uses the same principle as we have regarding our use of digital resources. With the digital materials, the intention is that things are available\u00a0in time and that they're available in both languages at the same time. So, trying to imitate that with printed text is what we're trying to do, but not with texts that are already late. So, if these books keep to the timetable, then they will be available in time in both languages, but that the English version has stayed before going out on the shelves. llyr gruffydd am: So, that's to say that the English version will be completed eight weeks beforehand so that you have eight weeks for translation. mike ebbsworth: Well, ultimately, I may have used the wrong words in saying that we're holding the English back. The English version would still be in the process, just as the Welsh version would be, and then they would catch up as they approach the date for publication and printing. There is an element of editing the English as well as the Welsh and that would happen in that\u00a0eight-week period. So, a draft\u00a0form might be available, and we do ensure that our draft versions are available on our secure website as soon as possible, but then that has to be held up before publication. john griffiths am: Just on that, Chair, it's nonetheless the case, as we've heard, I think, and as the letter to the committee from Kirsty Williams has made clear, that there might be a situation where the English-language version of a textbook could be made available, but it isn't made available because there isn't a Welsh-language version. And, as the\u00a0Chair said, is that\u00a0about putting those students in Wales on the same footing, and if so, how does that\u00a0relate to the\u00a0fact that\u00a0these students, including those who could have had earlier access to the English-language version, are competing with students over the border, as we heard on the video earlier, for those precious university places? Doesn't it place the English-language student using the English-language version at a potential disadvantage, compared to students over the border? gareth pierce: I think this is a point for Qualifications Wales to a certain extent, but applicants for qualifications in Wales are assessed as a national cohort, if truth be told, so, each piece of information we have on the standards is evaluated for that national cohort. So, in discussion with Qualifications Wales, we ensure that there is no disadvantage to any cohort in Wales in any subject, be that because of a textbook being unavailable or for any other reason. philip blaker: Certainly, from a comparable outcomes perspective, the fewer differences that there are that are differential\u2014. So, the idea of textbooks being available in English and Welsh at different times could potentially create another dimension in terms of disparity. So, if we're looking at it strictly speaking from a comparable outcomes perspective, it makes the awarding easier if everybody's on a common playing field. It's worth remembering\u2014we provided some evidence in our original letter particularly looking at religious studies on the basis that religious studies was a subject that had been mentioned. This subject has already been awarded at AS-level last year, so it has gone through an award and will go through the full A-level award this year. The comparable outcomes approach did protect those learners last year, in the absence of a textbook, and we saw stability in the results that came out of the cohort level. Similarly, with other subjects that have gone through reforms, we've seen it with the GCSEs that were awarded last year, ASs that were awarded last year and A-levels\u00a0that were awarded last year: we saw good comparability year on year. Is that okay, John? darren millar am: Just a very brief follow-up on that, at the cohort level, yes, you suggest that there is some evidence that students were protected, but what you don't know and can't tell, because you're not able to drill down to the individual student level, is whether children, young people, were disadvantaged as a result of their learning style being more textbook orientated than that of their peers. philip blaker: I guess we're in a situation where there's no evidence either way that that\u2014 darren millar am: The absence of evidence doesn't mean that it didn't happen. darren millar am: Well, I think you've seen plenty of evidence about the stress that it's causing, and the concern that learners have about their outcomes. I think it would be very interesting, actually, to take some teacher assessments and expected grades and compare those to the actual grade outcomes. Is that something that Qualifications Wales could do on a sample basis? philip blaker: Historically, that sort of evidence has been very unreliable. Certainly, back in my day at an awarding body they were provided, and there tended to be a very low correlation between the predicted grade and the actual achieved grade. gareth pierce: No, we agree with you that the comparisons are not that reliable, because there are so many factors. But I think, at the end of the day, what we see is, yes, I agree there is evidence of stress, but I think there's also evidence of young people and their teachers really using the available resources and the available skills in approaching revision and preparation, and tending to do that very well. That's the evidence that we've got, for example, in the AS religious studies last year, that the cohort did extremely well in fact. We can't disagree that there's evidence of stress, but I think we can also point towards resilience and excellent approaches to drawing together the various sources that they've got: classroom notes, revision notes, as they mentioned, and the various other materials that they referred to. john griffiths am: Coming back to the effect of the lack of resources, we heard on the video, as you've just mentioned, Gareth, that pupils were experiencing a lot of stress and anxiety, and it affected their well-being in terms of their perception that they might be disadvantaged by the lack of resources, as we discussed. We know exam time is very, very stressful\u2014I'm sure all of us would agree with that\u2014in general, without any additional problems or perceptions of problems. So, with that sort of background, would you accept then that some students have been negatively affected by the lack of suitable support materials for general qualifications? I know we've discussed this in terms of it being difficult, perhaps, to show cause and effect, but I think most people watching that video would clearly come to the view that some students have been negatively impacted. There is evidence of their concern, isn't there? But as Philip said, what we don't have is evidence that that anxiety then has an impact on their attainment, because there are so many factors, there are so many different kinds of resources that they've referred to\u2014even those who want to see textbooks, they're also talking about so many other materials that are available to them. Of course, it's also clear that they are conscientious young people who have worked hard, so you have a picture there of young people who are concerned, yes, and as you've said, examinations are a stressful time in general, but they are also young people who are doing their level best, and usually do get the results that they have worked for. Coming back again to matters that we've already discussed, but just to put to you in a fairly focused way, would you accept that it isn't fair that some pupils are not having the support material that others are having, depending on whether their particular subject is involved and the language that they're studying through? Would you accept that that is a basic unfairness in the system as it currently exists? gareth pierce: Ideally, resources, digital accessibility and digital literacy should be available for every pupil on an equal basis. But I think perhaps if we analysed this in much detail, different individuals would be able to say, 'There are different types of unfairness.' You referred earlier to the digital inequalities. Is there an economic inequality? There is some evidence from the teaching unions that suggests that not every school is in the same situation as each other in terms of buying the resources that are available. So, I think your question drives at a very important point: what sort of inequality could be having an impact on young people in terms of their achievement during their school time? Ideally, each one of those elements of potential inequality should be levelled. So, I don't think I can go any further than acknowledging that any inequality is unfair, but there are so many different kinds and the textbook is not the only one, and therefore we're not going to be able to analyse the impact of that on its own. john griffiths am: Could I put to you, finally then, what Estyn have said about reported delays in the production and distribution of educational resources such as textbooks, marking criteria and specimen papers, that that delay has impeded the ability of teachers to plan adequately, and that this effect on their ability to plan adequately is very likely to have had an impact on pupils' achievement? Would you accept that? gareth pierce: It's interesting\u2014they link three quite different things there, don't they? We've discussed the textbooks in some detail. When they refer to sample assessments, we have to provide those within the regulatory time frame, and they have to be approved. So, in every subject there are sample assessments and marking schemes, and they are statutorily available, in a way. One request that we receive often from schools is for exemplars in terms of the work of pupils that has been assessed and marked by us. Of course, they're not available until the young people have taken those exams for the very first time. But in some subjects the demand has been so strong that we have worked with schools in order to ensure that work is produced by pupils before that first examination, is marked by us, and is then made available. I would like to have a conversation with Estyn, indeed, to interpret on a more detailed level some of the things that they refer to. emyr george: May I offer a comment on that quote from Estyn? They talk about a reduction in attainment and that, to some extent, brings us back to the point in terms of the comparable outcomes method that we're talking about. That method is based on research and evidence that says that in a period of change to an exam or qualification, we know that performance in an exam can fall, and that is due to a number\u00a0of different factors. Certainly, knowing that you're the first to sit that exam perhaps raises your concerns about that examination, and examinations are a matter of concern already. It's very difficult, if not impossible, to differentiate between those factors, but what we know on the whole is that they come together to have an impact on pupils' performance in an exam, and that's why, when it comes to awarding qualifications for the first time and looking at the grades, we look very carefully at what that the mark means in terms of the grade in order to try as best as we can, on the level of the whole national cohort, to eliminate as much unfairness as possible because they are the first cohort to sit the exam. gareth pierce: Could I just make a brief comment on the sample assessments? Now, interestingly, when the English, Welsh, maths, and maths and numeracy GCSEs were new, the Welsh Government were very eager that we invest in more sample assessment materials. We had to produce one for the regulator, but they wanted to see us produce far more, and we did that. If we create more and more sample assessments, then does that create more risk of teaching to the test? And every time we produce one of these, of course, we are using robust assessment ideas, and they're out there to be used for test purposes. So, we need to be careful that we don't weaken\u00a0the real assessment by providing too many of the examiners' good ideas in the sample material. So, it's an interesting theme, but it would be interesting\u00a0to have a further conversation with Estyn on that. I think what we need to do is we need to think about the future reforms, particularly knowing that we've got some on the radar already, and to think about what this paradigm is and how we can isolate some of these factors in the future. So, if we look at resources and if we look particularly at textbooks as being a curriculum resource, rather than a qualification resource, I think we can change the timeline to which some of those materials are produced. So, going back to when I studied my A-levels in the 1980s, there was this common body of knowledge that was an A-level textbook in biology that wasn't focused around an individual awarding body. When we talked to unions about this on Monday, they said, 'Yes, when we used to teach many years ago, there were curriculum resources like that, and then when a particular topic or a particular area of content dropped out of the qualification, we either did or didn't teach it according to whether it was in the curriculum'. That's a little bit worrying by virtue of the fact there might have been a component of that subject that didn't get taught because it was no longer in the text, despite the fact that it was in the common body of knowledge. But I think if we can shift this paradigm\u2014and I would really like to a shift in the paradigm for resources particularly, away from the focus on the qualification and into more of a focus on the curriculum\u2014then that provides an opportunity for, I would suggest, a much healthier model in the future. In the United States, for example, there are some states within the United States that produce a state textbook. Now, that can have issues, particularly if it's politically orientated\u2014so, if politicians are seen to have a strong influence in the content that's taught. Equally, if you look at somewhere like Hong Kong, they've actually tried to de-emphasise textbooks. So, Hong Kong, which is a very high-performing jurisdiction, is trying to move away from that model in the future. gareth pierce: Could I just add very, very briefly\u2014 lynne neagle am: Very briefly, because I want to bring Hefin in. gareth pierce: I know that, in our letter to you, we emphasised that this is not just to do with the body of knowledge.\u00a0The assessment objectives have shifted in many subjects towards analysis and evaluation. So, therefore, we really do need resources that support that way of working, and I'm sure that lots of the young people we've heard from\u2014what they're really doing in\u00a0their revision is actually not just studying the content, but thinking about how they respond analytically and evaluatively.\u00a0In fact, an interesting question for us as an awarding body to debate with the qualifications regulator, maybe, is whether some of the content should actually be able to be taken into the assessment hall.\u00a0Do young people need to remember all these terms and their precise definitions, sometimes in both languages if they've learnt it in that way? Shouldn't some of the reference material be more and more available in the assessment arena? And then you are really getting towards analysis and interpretation and evaluation. hefin david am: I want to welcome these particular comments, because having come from a higher education background, what I've tried to deliver in my courses are\u00a0textbook-free modules, where you're relying on academic journal articles and you're piecing together the story yourself, based on the curriculum you develop yourself. I fear that students who are nurtured on a textbook diet,\u00a0when they go to university, they are not expected to repeat what's in the textbook;\u00a0they're expected to do exactly as Gareth says and analyse and combine information into a discursive argument. So, therefore, I'm interested to know how you've worked with higher education to develop that approach. lynne neagle am: Can I ask for brief answers, please? gareth pierce: Yes, well some of the people who provide\u00a0ideas into our digital resources certainly are either teachers who are very well aware of that progression to HE and therefore what their learners want or, in some cases, they are HE\u00a0people themselves. We do draw on a body of expertise, and we are more than willing to emphasise the importance of that approach to the support resources we provide. hefin david am: I think the difficulty and the difference is that, at HE\u00a0level, the kind of journal articles that are available are probably not consumable at GCSE level. And I think, interestingly\u2014I know we've pointed towards some of our\u00a0religious studies\u00a0resources as examples\u2014I think some of the websites\u00a0we point to are quite ambitious. They would be described as scholarly, and I think some of the young people on the video made that point, didn't they\u2014that they need to engage with that material to understand some themes? But we need to assist them in doing so. We need to almost make those scholarly items that are worth including in their curriculum accessible and user friendly for them at their point of learning. We recently published a report on the Welsh baccalaureate and skills challenge certificate, and I think it's relevant to pull in at this point that the independent study that pupils would be expected to do through the skills challenge certificate in doing their project work is really designed to try and draw out some of those skills that would be relevant in higher education.\u00a0Through the reforms that we are starting to think about for the skills challenge certificate, there's a real opportunity to start honing some of those skills, particularly at the advanced level bacc,\u00a0to make people really HE-ready so that they're better able to engage with that different style of learning. So, I think there's a huge opportunity that shouldn't be diminished within the advanced Welsh bacc. mark reckless am: Gareth, can I just put to you\u2014? On the Estyn criticism, I think you've answered one aspect of their criticism that WJEC\u00a0did not make as many sample assessment materials available as schools would have liked early on in the reform process, and I understand your position there,\u00a0but they went on and said, 'At times the sample assessment materials were provided\u00a0with incorrect mark schemes' and also, 'It would be\u00a0helpful if the WJEC\u00a0ensure that all necessary resources were made available before the start date of each qualification.' Do you have a response to those points? gareth pierce: Again, probably, I'd like a conversation with them about any problems with the specimen assessments and their mark schemes, because if they are the statutory regulatory ones they would have gone through Philip's team as well or his Welsh Government predecessors as regulators, depending on which qualifications they were. Very occasionally,\u00a0somebody will identify an error, and obviously we then correct them, because\u00a0these are available digitally online. So, if there is a problem, we want to hear about it and then we can correct it. But, yes, I agree with their fundamental premise, that ideally the whole package of resources should be available before teaching starts, including, as we mentioned earlier, so we can draw on that set of resources in the events we run as WJEC free of charge for teachers leading up to the first teaching. We need that information ourselves as well so we can talk about the use of these\u00a0valuable resources in an appropriate pedagogical context in that preparatory year. mark reckless am: So, what mechanism do you have for picking up on this type of criticisms from Estyn and having that conversation with them? Has that not happened? gareth pierce: We have met with Estyn a couple of times recently, actually\u2014once when they were beginning their review of the key stage 4 qualifications\u00a0that had been in place for two years\u00a0and a bit, and also when they were planning a review of some of the A-level work. Because\u00a0we do have regular meetings with them, we will have an opportunity to explore their comments here I'm sure. mark reckless am: Looking at the structure and the relationship between Qualifications\u00a0Wales and the WJEC\u2014. I understand in the model in England\u2014you've got Ofqual, the regulator, and you have various\u00a0competing\u00a0exam boards, some I think with for-profit motivation. We don't have\u00a0that in Wales; there is a sole regulator and a single, dominant examination board. Does that mean that there's significant overlap and potentially cost duplication between the work of the two bodies, particularly\u00a0given WJEC is a charity and seems to have many of the same objectives as you in Qualifications Wales have? philip blaker: The roles are very distinct, so I'd tell you there's\u00a0no overlap. What we try and do is try and make sure that there's a good connection between the work that we do. I would say a strength of the Welsh\u00a0model is that there is an independent regulator and a single awarding body largely, because\u00a0much of the work that Ofqual would need to do in terms of its maintenance of standards is about ensuring that the competition between awarding bodies doesn't lead to what's been termed in the past as a race to the bottom in terms of standards. Now, the opportunity that we have in Wales is, where we have a single awarding body, we can have a close and good working relationship\u00a0with WJEC, but guarding\u00a0very strongly to make sure that we keep that regulatory distance to make sure that we preserve our role as the regulator and look at WJEC as one of our regulated bodies. gareth pierce: Can I make a general point? Perhaps the important opportunity in Wales is to look anew at how national and regional organisations, such as the consortia, can collaborate to make a success of the broad range of resources and CPD that will be required to support the new curriculum, and also the next set of qualifications that will be reformed. The Learned Society of Wales is a player that wants to introduce ideas into the Welsh dimension of the curriculum. There will be a need for some financial resource from the Welsh Government\u2014yes, certainly\u2014and the WJEC can provide some resources, but I think we all want to collaborate in order to ensure the success of the next round of resources. mark reckless am: But doesn't that national approach and collaboration preclude the model that Philip was talking about\u00a0earlier, where we had textbooks based on the curriculum, and there's that core, but that was separate from what the exam body decided to do and the textbook wasn't there for the particular exam approach? If you have a single, dominant exam board, and you have a Welsh curriculum that's developed with that board, how do you then have this separation\u00a0between textbook and exam? philip blaker: So, if we look at qualification, a qualification should be based on the curriculum that's being offered, because learning should be based around the curriculum, and the role of the qualification is to measure attainment against knowledge of that curriculum\u2014knowledge, skills and understanding, the dispositions that that curriculum is trying to develop. Now, of course, what will inevitably happen is once the curriculum is known and developed, there will be a level of detail that comes across from what the qualification is looking for. I think what we're trying to say is, from an educational perspective, what we'd like to see is a broader focus on the curriculum and less of a narrow focus on the qualification and some of the problems that that can drive, so that, if a learner is well-versed in the curriculum and has been taught well and has acquired the knowledge, skills and dispositions that the curriculum is trying to create, they should succeed in the qualification. mark reckless am: And you suggested earlier that, if need be, the qualification could be pushed back a year, but not the curriculum. Does that mean that it would be possible to teach the new curriculum while keeping the old qualification? philip blaker: It would be possible. mark reckless am: But satisfactory? philip blaker: Because, if we're looking at qualifications predominantly being 14 to 16, what Professor Donaldson said at the very beginning, with 'Successful Futures', was, actually, if the curriculum is preparing people better for that qualification stage, so that they're better versed as learners and better able to perform in those qualifications and we see a rise of attainment\u2014. Ideally,\u00a0you'd be in a position where you've got GCSEs that have been reformed to marry up to any change, but I don't see there being a huge problem in itself of a delay if we think that is the right thing to do. We would much rather be in a position of having reforms, but, equally, I'd want to see any reforms delivered safely, and I wouldn't want to compromise fairness and safety of delivery of those qualifications on the basis of a timeline. But I think all too often the case is that a timeline dominates over doing what is the right thing and I think as we get further into this we'll have to really assess and keep a grip of what's the right thing to do. darren millar am: Just on this issue of shaping the curriculum and making sure that we've got textbooks that can be used to support the delivery of the curriculum\u2014. So, who should be responsible for developing these curriculum resources? philip blaker: I think, for a new model, that needs to be determined. They have responsibility for curriclum and they've already started work with the seminar last year, and then drawing people together now to look at a new model for the future. I think we need to evolve that approach, and I think Welsh Government taking a lead on some of this thinking about how things might be prepared for the future is probably a good position to be in at the moment. darren millar am: Are there any other models that you can point us to in terms of how these things are done elsewhere? philip blaker: Yes, there are models where you can have\u2014. For example, in Northern Ireland, you have the regulator, the awarding body and the curriculum body all under one roof. So, you can have a position where everything is tied together as it is in Northern Ireland with the\u00a0Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment. Equally, if you look at somewhere like Hong Kong, you have very distinct bodies that are looking after each individual component. But, of course, in Wales, and also previously in England, the qualifications regulator has also had a responsibility for curriculum. I mentioned earlier that, in the past, the WJEC has produced a fair few resources in collaboration with publishers in key stage 3 and even at primary stages. Certainly, key stage 3 is closely linked to GCSE, and, therefore, if the WJEC continues to be a player\u2014as I hope it will\u2014in the area of resources for GCSE and A-level, then the WJEC is also well positioned in terms of our investment in editing, translating and the use of technology to contribute to key stage 3 most certainly and perhaps even the primary stages. So, I'm sure that the WJEC would want to offer itself as a national organisation that wants to contribute as best we can in this area. Well, we're out of time, so can I thank you very much for attending this morning and for answering all our questions? I think it's been a very useful and informative session. In view of the time, can I ask whether Members are happy to note all those papers in a block? Can I just flag that I would like to return to paper to note 3, which is the letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education on minority ethnic, Gypsy, Roma and Traveller learners, when\u00a0we go into private, if that's okay with Members? Item 5, then, is for me to\u00a0propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting.\u00a0Are Members content?\u00a0Thank you."

Currently, digit extraction has been carried out on approximately half of this data. Moving forward, there are plans to explore the reading of digits in various prosodic groupings as part of future work.",
        "Article": "anthony rota (nipissingtimiskaming, lib.)): I call this meeting to order. Welcome to the sixth meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 pandemic. members that if you want to speak English, you should be on the English channel; if you want to speak French, you should be on the French channel; and should you wish to alternate between the two languages, as I just did, you should change the channel to the language that you are speaking, each time you switch languages. In addition, please direct your remarks through the chair and speak slowly and clearly at all times to help our interpreters. I recommend the headset for your fellow members, but also for the interpreters as it gets loud, up and down, and it squeaks. I understand that there are no ministerial announcements today, so we will proceed to presenting petitions, for a period not exceeding 15 minutes. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. World Maternal Mental Health Day took place last week, and today I'd like to take a moment to present a very important petition on behalf of the Canadian Perinatal Mental Health Collaborative. Whereas perinatal mood and anxiety disorders are the most common obstetrical complication, whereas in Canada and worldwide 20% of women and 10% of men suffer from a perinatal mental illness, resulting in an annual economic cost to Canada of approximately $11 billion, and whereas the U.K., Australia and parts of the U.S. have perinatal mental health strategies and screening guidelines in place and Canada does not, the Canadian Perinatal Mental Health Collaborative is calling upon the House of Commons in Parliament assembled to create a national perinatal mental health strategy that will provide direction, policy and funding to develop specialized, comprehensive perinatal mental health care services, which include universal screening and timely access to treatment for all women and men during pregnancy and the postpartum period. If we were in the House now, as May is Cystic Fibrosis Awareness Month, one of the days this month we would all be wearing yellow roses in sympathy and solidarity with those who suffer from what is the number one disease killer in Canada of young people. The petitioners have asked us to look at the situation with the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board, which is scheduled to go through some important and potentially detrimental regulatory changes very soon. They ask that the amendments to the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board be rescinded, as these will restrict Canadians from receiving life-saving medications for cystic fibrosis and other illnesses, but in particular, a medicine called Trikafta, which can have the effect of treating cystic fibrosis in the case of 90% of cystic fibrosis sufferers. They ask the government to work with the provinces to find a strategy to jointly allow for the delivery of this life-saving medicine to Canadians across the country and to take a leadership role in negotiating a price for gene modulators throughout all the provinces of Canada. Petitioners in my community point out in this petition, which, of course, predates the pandemic, that the family doctor shortage is severe in this country. This problem is particularly profound in more rural areas, including, as the petitioners reference, the community in which I live, Sydney, British Columbia. The petitioners call on the government to work with provinces and territories to find a collaborative, holistic solution so that every Canadian has a family doctor and we address the family doctor shortage. I'm presenting a timely petition today that emphasizes the concerns constituents in my riding of MissionMatsquiFraser Canyon have with the Liberal government's inherently flawed and undemocratic approach to firearms legislation and regulation. The petitioners call upon the Government of Canada to stop targeting law-abiding firearms owners; to cancel all plans to confiscate firearms legally owned by federally licensed RCMP-vetted Canadians; to focus taxpayer dollars where they will actually increase public safety, which is on keeping at-risk youth from being involved in gangs and on anti-gang enforcement; and to provide our men and women in uniform at the Canada Border Services Agency with the resources they need to stop the flow of illegal guns into this country. Through this petition, my constituents take issue with how the Liberal government continues to target law-abiding firearms owners instead of the gangs, drug traffickers and illegal weapons smugglers responsible for the violence in our communities. They note that the use of the phrase military-style assault rifle is purely political posturing, as the term is undefined in Canadian law. They also draw attention to the numerous inaccuracies about current firearms legislation and regulation the chair: I'd like to remind the honourable members that this is a concise prcis of what a petition says, not a speech. It's a huge honour to table e-petition 2512, which was signed by 1,198 petitioners, primarily from the province of Nova Scotia. The Province of Nova Scotia invited multinational companies to scope out and develop expansive open-net salmon farming operations. The petitioners cite that the expansion would increase environmental degradation, as seen in similar aquaculture operations in British Columbia, Newfoundland, Norway, Vietnam and elsewhere in the world. It also, they cite, would pose risks to native fish stocks, pollute coastal ecosystems, impair at-risk wild Atlantic salmon, and threaten established fisheries and tourism operations. They also raise concerns that open-net fish farming would not create significant employment and would undermine existing lobster and other fisheries. They are calling on the government to uphold Bill C-68 and species-at-risk legislation, protect our oceans, ban expansion of open-net finfish aquaculture in our oceans, work to phase out any existing open-net fish farming operations currently in place and, lastly, invest in land-based, closed-containment finfish aquaculture. I want to thank these petitioners for fighting for clean oceans, for their local economy and for the well-being of Nova Scotia. It calls upon the House of Commons to commit to upholding the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the calls to action from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada by immediately halting all existing and planned construction of the Coastal GasLink project on Wet'suwet'en territory, ordering the RCMP to dismantle its exclusion zone and stand down, scheduling nation-to-nation talks between the Wet'suwet'en nation and the federal and provincial governmentssomething that has already happened, thankfullyand prioritizing the real implementation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. yasmin ratansi (don valley east, lib.): Thank you, Mr. The petitioners are asking that the Government of Canada not provide any financial assistance to Canadian airlines until they promptly provide full refunds for flights that were cancelled due to COVID-19. dan albas (central okanagansimilkameennicola, cpc): Thank you, Mr. Today we've learned that federal workers have been told to ignore obvious signs of fraud when it comes to applying for government benefits. Can the Prime Minister confirm that 200,000 applications have been flagged as potentially fraudulent? right hon. We moved very quickly to get the Canada emergency response benefit out, to get the wage subsidy out and to help Canadians in this unprecedented situation. Chair, can the Prime Minister confirm that the instruction has been given to federal employees to ignore these 200,000 applications being flagged as potentially fraudulent? This is important. Our decision from the very beginning was to get the help out to people and figure out, with retroactive action if necessary, where and when there may have been fraudulent use. justin trudeau: Again, in this unprecedented situation, our focus has been on helping as many people as possible, as quickly as possible. Other parties might have made a different choice had they been in government, but our focus was getting help to people when they needed it as quickly as possible and cleaning it up afterwards. Did the Prime Minister or his minister sign off on this memo that was issued by the deputy minister, yes or no? right hon. Chair, we have been focused entirely on getting help to Canadians when they need it, and that has meant that yes, there will be things we will need to clean up after the fact and work to fix, but getting that help into Canadians' pockets during this pandemic was our priority. Will he at least then commit to investigating every individual case of fraud, or will he write them off, as the story said? right hon. Chair, in this unprecedented situation Canadians have lost their jobs; they've lost their paycheques; they don't know how they're going to be able to support their loved ones and pay for their groceries. We made a decision as a country that we would be there for them and that has been and will continue to be our priority. Will he commit as a government to enforce the rule of law and to enforce the attestation that says that if someone commits fraud, the fraud will be pursued? right hon. All along we've been told fraud would be detected through audits after the fact, and we expect that to happen. justin trudeau: When we made the determination that we needed to move quickly to help Canadians, we knew there would be a need to clean up after the fact, to go after fraudulent cases. Our priority now and in the coming months is to ensure Canadians get the support they need, and our economy comes roaring back. gabriel ste-marie (joliette, bq): Mr.Chair, yesterday, the Prime Minister announced the large employer emergency financing facility. One of those conditions forces companies not to resort to tax evasion or tax avoidance through tax havens. Excellent! Unfortunately, I quickly became disillusioned because it is more about abusive tax evasion and avoidance. Companies that legally take advantage of tax havens to avoid paying their taxes will have access to the large employer emergency financing facility. justin trudeau: Mr.Chair, we will always be there to counter tax evasion and tax avoidance. In the current situation, our priority is to help workers across the country who could lose their jobs or who have lost their jobs. gabriel ste-marie: Mr.Chair, I'm delighted to hear the Prime Minister say that there's no tolerance for tax avoidance. justin trudeau: Mr.Chair, when we announced the large employer emergency funding facility, we recognized that those who wanted to receive tax dollars had to have paid their fair share of taxes. That's why we're putting in place measures to carefully assess the tax structures of these businesses before we loan money to them. gabriel ste-marie: Mr.Chair, sometimes a bank will relocate its most profitable activities carried out in Canada and register them in a subsidiary in the Bahamas, Barbados or another tax haven. Does the Prime Minister consider this bank to be paying its fair share of taxes in Canada? right hon. justin trudeau: Mr.Chair, we will assess applications for the large employer emergency funding facility on a case-by-case basis. Before we provide any money, we're going to make sure that whoever wants to access these funds is transparent about how the money is being managed, including internationally. Consumers are paying more and more with their credit cards, which allows contactless payments in shops, not to mention online shopping. This benefits Visa and Mastercard, which charge appallingly high user fees, known as interchange fees. These are almost 10times higher than in Europe and Australia, and it costs our merchants a fortune. Can the Prime Minister follow the example of Europe and Australia by capping interchange fees at0.3%? right hon. We have worked with the big banks and the financial industry to ensure that people who need it have access to the help they need. Right now, we're sending money to consumers across the country who need it to get through this crisis. A credit card company, such as Visa and Mastercard, that charges a fee of 2.5%to3% per transaction undermines the merchant's profit margin and gets richer at the expense of consumers. I invite the Prime Minister to follow the example of Europe and Australia by capping these fees at0.3%. justin trudeau: Mr.Chair, we continue to work with financial institutions and the big banks to help consumers during this exceptional and difficult situation. Instead of providing a universal direct payment for all, the government has decided to implement a complicated program that leaves many people behind. A single parent with four school-age children lost her spousal and child support due to COVID-19. Will the Prime Minister step in and fix this gap so that the single parents and their children can get the support they need during this pandemic? right hon. Chair, to correct the honourable member by pointing out that we actually moved in the most rapid and simplest possible way in providing income replacement to millions upon millions of Canadians who needed it through the Canada emergency response benefit. However, as the member points out, when one moves quickly and efficiently, there will be gaps, and that's why we've been working diligently to try to fill those gaps. jenny kwan: While the Minister of Employment has been aware of this for three weeks and says she is looking into it, there's still been no action. The truth of the matter is that single parents and their children who depend on spousal support and child maintenance are not getting support. justin trudeau: We recognize the particular challenge faced by families, single parents and families with young children, which is why we increased the amount of the Canada child benefit to be able to support people in this particular moment. On top of that, we have looked to fill further gaps that have existed with the Canada emergency response benefit. Well over seven million Canadians have access to CERB, and we will continue to work with them ms. Across the country there is no national standard to address the homelessness crisis amidst this pandemic, leaving communities at heightened risk from COVID-19. Canadians who are homeless or living in substandard housing have no access to bathroom facilities for basic hygiene. government has implemented an initiative to house some of the homeless population in empty hotels in the short term, support from the federal government is needed to secure permanent solutions post-COVID-19. Will the Prime Minister commit to providing matching funds and take the right to adequate housing seriously? right hon. justin trudeau: I know that the honourable member wouldn't want to inadvertently mislead the House. The fact is, the federal government almost immediately sent significant resources, hundreds of millions of dollars, to shelters across the country to enable them to create facilities, including renting new spaces, to be able to house homeless people without increasing the danger of the spread of COVID-19. I recognize there's always more to do, but as we demonstrated with our national housing strategy, we are serious about fighting homelessness and supporting vulnerable Canadians, and we will continue to do that. Cutting chronic homelessness by 50% over the next decade is not good enough, and that is this Prime Minister's national housing strategy. Will the government stop just making empty promises and ensure that every Canadian has the right to housing? Will he top up the support for provinces to at least match their funds? right hon. Chair, cutting chronic homelessness by 50% is an ambitious goal that no one else has ever been able to do as a government, and we are well on track for it. I would suggest that the member opposite not dismiss that as an empty promise, because we have demonstrated actions on it. jenny kwan: I would remind the Prime Minister that it was the federal Liberals who eliminated the national affordable housing program in 1993, so we have this homeless crisis today as a result of the Liberals. We in Vancouver East have the third-largest urban indigenous population in the country, yet we got less than 2% of the pandemic urban indigenous housing funding. We have moved forward, both through the Minister of Indigenous Services and the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations, to address the challenges facing urban aboriginal populations. We will continue to work with them, recognizing that they are among the most vulnerable people in Canada who deserve the right support from all orders of government, and we will be there to support them increasingly in the coming years. Chair, I'm hearing in my riding of PortageLisgar that individuals who are dealing with Service Canada through the mail are experiencing delays. In fact, one of my constituents sent documents, including a doctor's note, two months ago on March 12 and is now being told that she must resend them because they've never been opened. Can the government tell us whether this is a widespread problem, and how are they dealing with unopened mail at Service Canada? the chair: The honourable minister. Chair, I want to assure the honourable member that we are doing everything that we can in Service Canada to meet the expectations of Canadians. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have had unprecedented volumes, but we have redeployed thousands of staff to front-line services by phone and by other means. We had to close a number of the centres because of COVID-19 concerns and the safety and well-being of Canadians. candice bergen: Is the minister aware whether this is a widespread problem? Is this happening rarely, or frequently? I'm hearing about it. I know, from many MPs, we are at the front lines of dealing with and helping constituents who are not only wanting to get support but also are trying to get programs unrelated to COVID-19. Chair, the Iver Johnson single-shot rifle is a standard farm gun used by many farmers in my riding, in fact, passed down from generation to generation in some cases. Why are the Liberals making this gun illegal? What's the purpose of banning this particular farm rifle? the chair: The honourable minister. I just wish to advise the member that we worked very closely with the Canadian firearms program, with law enforcement and with their firearms verification to identify the makes, models and variants of nine rifles, all of which had in their earliest provenance a design for military use, for soldiers to use in combat. We're hearing from front-line officers that they are concerned about gangs, drug dealers and illegal weapons being smuggled across the border. They are not concerned with these types of farm rifles that are being used by our farmers and, in some cases, hunters. Chair, we'd like to see the evidence on why the Liberals are once again targeting law-abiding Canadians, ignoring gangsters and drug dealers. bill blair: It's a great opportunity, I think, when the member opposite says what the police are saying. The Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police declared that military assault rifles were produced for the sole purpose of killing people in large numbers and urged the government to enact legislation to ban all military assault rifles, except for law enforcement and military purposes. They said, In our view, these weapons have no place in our communities and should be reserved for use by Canada's military and law enforcement. Chair, we've seen this before, where the Liberals introduced a long-gun registry that cost billions of dollars and did absolutely nothing to stop violent crimes. bill blair: Actually, what I'm saying, and what our regulations say very clearly, is that weapons that were designed not for hunting and not for sport purposes but for soldiers to use in combat to kill other soldiers have no place in Canadian society. Is it true that Canada Revenue Agency employees who process applications for the Canada emergency response benefit, or CERB, have been asked to send the payment even if fraud had been detected, as was pointed out in a national media report today? hon. diane lebouthillier (minister of national revenue): Mr.Chair, our government considers these to be very difficult times for Canadians. We're going to do everything we can to support them by helping them pay for their housing and their groceries. alain rayes: I repeat my question, which is extremely simple: Is it true that the Canada Revenue Agency sent a memo to its employees asking them to ignore the fraudsters and still send the CERB payments?? hon. diane lebouthillier: I'll finish my response, which was interrupted: Nearly 7.8million Canadians have applied for the Canada emergency response benefit. alain rayes: Yes or no: Did the Canada Revenue Agency send a memo to its employeeswho are doing an exceptional job, I'd like to point outso that they would ignore the 200,000potential cases of fraud that they detected? hon. The federal government website clearly states that if an employee returns to work, the employee must pay back the CERB. Can the Prime Minister tell us whether employees who decide to return to work have to pay back the full $2,000per month, or only $500for week of the month? hon. diane lebouthillier: As I mentioned, we believe that Canadians are going through a very difficult time, and we need to support them. That's what our government is committed to, and that's what we'll continue to do. alain rayes: Mr.Chair, the extremely simple question I am asking the Minister comes from companies and workers. None of the officials dares to answer it when we call on technical matters, even though they are supposed to give us information that we can pass on to the public with complete transparency. If an employee is called back to workwhich is perfectly fineagrees to do so and wants to reimburse the CERB, must he reimburse $500for each week he works during the month, or the entire $2,000? hon. Chair, I can clarify that Service Canada will work closely with anybody who transitions either from the CERB to the wage subsidy or from the CERB back to employment to ensure that there's no overpayment, but of course that there's no undue hardship on the individual. It seems to me that my question is not complicated: do people have to reimburse $500for each week they work in a month, or the full monthly amount of $2,000? hon. That's why Service Canada is reaching out to individuals to make it as seamless as possible for them. If an employer complies with the hygiene conditions, can employees still refuse to return to work, and therefore continue to receive the CERB? hon. Chair, I can assure all Canadians that at the same time as employees have a right to refuse work and employers have an obligation to ensure healthy and safe workplaces, we want all people to be able to go back to work and feel safe. There are established processes and federal and provincial labour processes for refusal to work, and at the end of the day the CERB is there for workers who aren't working due to COVID-19. jamie schmale (haliburtonkawartha lakesbrock, cpc): Thank you, Chair. The Wet'suwet'en elected chiefs and community members have been excluded from negotiations on a memorandum of understanding affecting land rights and titles. The elected chiefs have issued a press release asking for the government to halt the joint announcement scheduled for May 14 on the MOU until the community has had a chance to look at and understand how the MOU will affect them. Will the minister agree with the democratically elected chiefs and the Wet'suwet'en people they represent and delay any announcement until proper consultation can be completed? the chair: The honourable minister. carolyn bennett (minister of crown-indigenous relations): I want to reassure the member that communication is ongoing with and between our partners on how to go forward on implementing the Wet'suwet'en rights and title with a Wet'suwet'en-led solution. We encourage the leaders to continue their ongoing, necessary and important conversations with their community on how they want to proceed on a path toward implementing their rights and title. As we work to rebuild Canada's relationship with the Wet'suwet'en, we need to give them space for these important discussions. jamie schmale: Minister, is that a yes that the signing will be delayed until the elected chiefs have a chance to look at the agreement? hon. jamie schmale: The current health crisis should not be used as an opportunity to sideline the Wet'suwet'en people and their elected chiefs. The federal government should be bringing the community together rather than actively excluding Wet'suwet'en members. The chiefs are so concerned that they are now calling for the resignation of the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations for failure to engage in proper consultations, which has stoked divisions within the community. Will the minister reconsider and put in place a consultation process that honours both their traditional house system and the governance responsibilities of elected chiefs and councils? hon. carolyn bennett: Yet again, it's very important the member understand the engagement must take place and be led by the Wet'suwet'en nation. That means the elected chiefs and the hereditary chiefs need to work with all clan members as they determine how they wish to work with Canada and the Province of British Columbia to implement the rights and title of the Wet'suwet'en people. jamie schmale: I agree that the Wet'suwet'en should have the opportunity to look at the proposed agreement, but we are still seeing news coming out of the elected chiefs and the people they represent that they have not had a thorough chance to look at this proposed agreement. carolyn bennett: I think the member will agree that there's a lot more work to do with all the parties. I believe, in terms of the kind of engagement that has taken place in the feast houses and the notification that took place even before COVID-19, that the work is under way and it will have to be Wet'suwet'en-led in terms of what eventually will be their choice as to how they implement their rights and title. Chair, for two weeks now the Liberals on the indigenous affairs committee have shut down Conservatives and witnesses every time we mention the word Wet'suwet'en. They don't want to talk about the issue, an issue that is very much aggravated by the COVID-19 crisis. I don't believe that there's, at any time, an interest in shutting down discussion or debate. I think, though, that at the COVID committee the issues facing indigenous communities, first nations, Inuit and Mtis around COVID-19 are very important to them. jamie schmale: I would argue with the minister and challenge her to talk to her committee members. Each time Conservatives have brought up the topic of the Wet'suwet'en and the situation happening with the elected chiefs and the people they represent, we have been shut down every single time. carolyn bennett: Again, in a committee, it is the work of the committee and the decision of the committee. I believe the chair and all members want first nations, Inuit and Mtis to be able to keep their communities safe during COVID-19. It has been three months since this pandemic started and the Liberals just got around to announcing help for seniors. I've just had the opportunity to introduce additional measures today wherein we are introducing a one-time special payment for those who receive OAS. stephanie kusie: Nearly two months into living in some form of isolation, watching their retirement savings take a hit and having to take additional health precautions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, eligible seniors are set to receive a one-time payment of up to $500. deb schulte: I just want to make sure that my honourable colleague remembers that we have already given a GST top-up of almost $375 for single seniors and over $500 for couples. This is in addition to what we've just done today where, as you said, it's $500. stephanie kusie: According to Abacus Data, 69% of Canadians feel that there will be a second wave in the pandemic, and 52% of Canadians believe that there is a shortage of medical equipment, including personal protective equipment. Given these surprising figures, what is the government's plan to bring in enough personal protective equipment, should there be a second wave of the pandemic? hon. anita anand (minister of public services and procurement): Our government is aggressively buying life-saving equipment and supplies that Canada needs, from a diverse range of suppliers around the world and here at home. We're working directly with businesses across the country to rapidly scale up domestic production capacity to meet current and future needs. At this point, our primary focus is on front-line health care professionals, but we are also exploring federal government assistance in areas of essential services so that PPE exists where workers need it. stephanie kusie: According to Public Services and Procurement Canada, despite 1.8 billion units of PPE being procured, less than 6% of N95 respirator orders have been filled, less than 8% of surgical mask orders have been filled, and just 1.4% of face shield orders have been filled. anita anand: Let me start by saying that we are working in an incredibly difficult and competitive global environment and are procuring millions of items: face shields, gowns, hand sanitizer, and N95 surgical masks, and ventilators every single day. There is a delay in the production of these goods, but we have had many deliveries coming into Canada, including over two million face shields the chair: We'll have to go back to Mrs. stephanie kusie: A national security expert from the University of Ottawa has said that the national emergency strategic stockpile has failed in the current crisis, resulting in some provinces such as Saskatchewan using expired PPE, and provinces such as Alberta using faulty PPE that cause rashes and headaches. What is the government doing to expedite procurement and to counter the risk of faulty PPE, given that 34 of the suppliers are from China, which has already supplied significant faulty PPE? hon. anita anand: I will start by saying that we have multiple supply chains operating at the same time, from China, and domestically, and from the United States and other countries around the world. Our first priority is to make sure that we get safe, effective equipment and supplies into the hands of our front-line health care workers. Given the global supply chains and their competitive nature, this is an ongoing project and we are having success for our front-line health care workers. Ten weeks ago the Minister of Fisheries, in responding to my question in question period, acknowledged that the lobster fishery was being negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and was facing losses of up to 95% of its Asian markets. Chair, on April 28 I asked the minister what she was doing to support harvesters who were left out of the $62.5 million aid package. Can the minister tell us what the government's plan is to directly support seafood harvesters? the chair: The honourable minister. bernadette jordan (minister of fisheries, oceans and the canadian coast guard): Thank you, Mr. We know that the fish and seafood sector has been extremely adversely affected because of COVID-19. We've started to put measures in place to address the issue with the $62.5 million for processors, as well as to make sure that the CERB is available for seasonal workers as well as people who have run out of their fishery EI, but we know that more needs to be done. The fishery enterprises are uniquely structured, which is why we're looking at measures to address the concerns they have. Chair, most fishermen are not eligible for the wage subsidy program due to the stipulation that it cannot be used for employees who are related to their employer. Many fishermen have their wives, their sons, their uncles or their fathers working for them, and sometimes it's the whole family on the boat. Can the minister explain what the government's plan is to support fishermen who do not fit into any actual program and who desperately need direct financial help from the federal government to survive? hon. Chair, we know that, because of the unique structure of fishing enterprises, they are not eligible for many of the supports we have put in place. We have made changes to the CERB to make sure that people who run out of the fishers EI are eligible as well as seasonable workers. We have put in place measures to address processors' concerns so that harvesters continue to have a place to sell their product. I am working with my cabinet colleagues to find solutions, and I hope I will have more to say about that very soon. chris d'entremont: In recent weeks, lobster fishermen in the gulf region of the Maritimes were shocked to read an additional subsection of regulations that was added to their fishing conditions for the 2021 fishing season. This addition was for a catch limitation or quota to which none of the harvesters or advisory members were privy. Can the minister tell us how these detailed regulations managed to get added without her authorization, and can licence-holders expect to see these same regulations in their conditions when their season gets going in the future? hon. Chair, I want to thank the people who brought to my attention the conditions that were put on licences in the gulf. Chair, on Wednesday, February 26, after the death of 23-year-old Chantelle Lindsay from Nova Scotia due to complications from cystic fibrosis, I asked the Prime Minister whether the government was going to make Trikafta, which might have saved Chantelle's life, available to Canadians. Now that almost 12 weeks have passed, we understand that Vertex Pharmaceuticals has not yet applied to Health Canada for study. Many of my Conservative colleagues and I have recently sent a letter to the minister asking for an update on how we support those negotiations with Vertex. Can the Minister of Health tell us when this drug will be available to CF patients in Canada? the chair: Honourable minister, the floor is yours. In fact, the majority of people who have applied through the special access program to get access to the drug have received access. chris d'entremont: Mr.Chair, the tourism season is already deeply affected by COVID-19. In my constituency, tens of thousands of tourists use the ferry between Bar Harbor, Maine, and Yarmouth, Nova Scotia. What is the government planning to do to help the ferry to survive and to resume service next season, if the borders remain closed this summer? hon. mlanie joly (minister of economic development and official languages): I have had the opportunity to speak to my colleague Mr.d'Entremont about solutions to assist people in the tourism sector all over the country, and particularly in the Atlantic region. In light of the new funding for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, ACOA, I will be happy to work with him and with the leaders of the tourism sector. simon-pierre savard-tremblay (saint-hyacinthebagot, bq): Thank you, Mr.Chair. Despite all the upheaval it causes, the crisis we are experiencing, considerable in scope though it is, can also be an opportunity to begin a transition. Many of us in Quebec feel that, when a company knocks on the state's door to ask for assistance, it is totally legitimate for the state to impose conditions before providing its support. We in the Bloc Qubcois feel that there should be a limit, a ceiling, on the assistance provided to large companies, in order to avoid abuses in executive compensation. A few years ago, after the Bombardier affair in QuebecI will not dwell on that because Quebecers are all too familiar with itthree of the four political parties that sat in the National Assembly and that still sit these took a position of that kind. The United States, which, you will agree, is no bastion of socialism, has already implemented similar policies for periods of crisis. According to a report published by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives on January2, the 100highest-paid CEOs in Canada earned 227times more in 2018 than the average worker. Given that inflation was then at 2.3%, it can be said that there was practically no increase. By contrast, the salary increase for CEOs in the same period was 18%, even in cases where the companies suffered losses. Does the government intend to put a ceiling on executive compensation to ensure that they are not the only ones to profits from the support at this time of crisis? The question is clear and I am asking you to give me a clear answer. If I don't get one, I am going to have to demand a new version of the Clarity Act. We know that our approach has to help small and medium-size companies, but also large companies in order to provide a bridge to the end of the crisis. Yes, we do want to make sure that the facility is available for companies that are going to continue to support our economy, to protect their employees, and to make a significant contribution to our communities. We are going to consider the rules and conditions that are needed in order for the facility to be available to the companies, the operations and the employees. Of course, conditions are required to ensure that the facility is available for operations, not for dividends or share buybacks, for example. sgro (humber riverblack creek, lib.): Thank you very much, Mr. In my own riding of Humber RiverBlack Creek, 30% of the population are 65 or older. Can the minister please tell us what our government is doing to ensure that vulnerable seniors get the support they need during this very difficult time? the chair: The honourable minister. Seniors have faced increased costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and our government today has responded to that with additional action. We announced a one-time, tax-free payment of $300 for seniors eligible for OAS and an additional $200 for seniors eligible for GIS. This means there will be up to $500 for the most vulnerable seniors to help them with their financial security to get through this challenging time. Beyond this, we announced $20 million to expand the new horizons for seniors program to kick-start initiatives and services that will help seniorsfor example, to get grocery deliveries right to their door and to stay connected. We've worked tirelessly on this as well as on other recent measures like the GST credit to help the most vulnerable seniors. I know she's been working extremely hard to make sure that we get some additional announcements over and above all of the ones we have already made, so congratulations. Seniors across the country have been communicating with us and letting us know their needs, and we have been responding. It's always a privilege to have a chance to speak on issues that matter to Canadians, whether it's from the floor of the House of Commons or, indeed, from my house here in Nova Scotia. Like my colleagues, I'd like to thank the staff of the House of Commons for their continued work to make sure that we have this forum to be able to continue the democratic process. I would also quickly like to thank my staff both here locally in KingsHants and in Ottawa for their continued work for my constituents. We have the Kentville Research and Development Centre and the Hants County agricultural exhibition, the longest-standing exhibition in North America. Can the minister specifically provide an update to the House on the measures our government has taken on those two particular commodity groups that are so important in my riding? the acting chair (mr. Last Tuesday I was proud to announce our emergency processing fund for a total of $77.5 million, $50 million for the surplus food program and $125 million through AgriRecovery to support our beef and pork producers. Concerning the dairy sector in particular, I'm hopeful that tomorrow we will get the support of all of the parties to be able to respond to their request for an increase in their loan capacity from $300 million to $500 million. I would like to encourage all farmers to apply to the business risk management programs, including AgriStability, for which we have improved some of the mechanisms. bruce stanton): We'll go on with questions, but I'll also just ask Mr. brian masse (windsor west, ndp): During the COVID-19 pandemic, the State of Michigan has become an epicentre of the outbreak. The border communities of Sarnia and Windsor have higher per capita infection rates than the rest of the province. With the premiers of B.C., Quebec and Ontario opposing the opening of the border at this time, will the restrictions be extended, or is the Prime Minister discussing changing the restrictions? the acting chair (mr. chrystia freeland (deputy prime minister and minister of intergovernmental affairs): Let me assure the honourable member that, first and foremost, all decisions about Canada's border are taken by Canadians and with the health and safety of Canadians first and foremost in mind. When it comes to the current agreement's coming up next week, we are in very close conversations with Americans about next steps. chrystia freeland: Let me just be clear that I didn't speak about any changes; I spoke about a very collaborative conversation with our American neighbours about next steps. chrystia freeland: I found during the NAFTA negotiations that negotiations are best not conducted in public, but let me just assure Canadians that the health and safety of Canadians is first and foremost. chrystia freeland: Let me just say that I think the honourable member was actually seeking to know what exactly is being discussed with our American partners. brian masse: Will more information be shared between your government and the American government on Canadians and Americans crossing the border on both sides? hon. chrystia freeland: I'm not sure what the member is alluding to, but let me just say that the current arrangements are working extremely well. brian masse: With border communities having more rates of infection, will they receive additional PPE and financial assistance to deal with the loosening of current border restrictions that is being discussed? hon. chrystia freeland: Let me just emphasize to the honourable member that on a couple of occasions he has implied that a loosening of the current restrictions is being discussed. I'll move to the large commercial banks who are profiteering off or squeezing Canadians during this public crisis. Will the government use its statutory powers and force the banks to offer the credit card relief that Vancity has already done? the acting chair (mr. I would like to say that we recognize the challenges that Canadians face, especially with issues like credit card rates. Most recently, during the COVID-19 crisis, we've negotiated with the banks and encouraged them, and they have come out with reductions in their credit card fees that are significant, and deferrals for customers mr. brian masse: Will you use your statutory powers, yes or no, to do what Vancity has done to help Canadian consumers? hon. We're continuing to work together with banks to make sure that they are giving the kind of support necessary to their customers, and we've seen actions in this regard, supporting customers. brian masse: Why do banks have to profit at higher interest rates on Canadian consumer and retailer exchange rates during COVID-19? hon. Chair, I think it's important to clarify that banks have come forward and given deferrals to customers in trouble and cut their interest by half  Mr. brian masse: Will the minister use his powers if the banks continue to charge Canadian consumers interest rates that are higher than Vancity's? hon. Chair, again, we will continue to work with banks to ensure that they're supporting their customers. What banks have done on credit cards by cutting their fees in half is an important nod in that direction. jacques gourde (lvislotbinire, cpc): Thank you, Mr.Chair. Quebec is Canada's biggest producer of hydroelectricity, a renewable energy that is the pride of the Quebec nation. The only problem is that it seems to be a tough sell west of Quebec, in Ontario, for instance. Will the government show leadership and allow Canada's provinces to share renewable energy through an energy corridor, as we proposed? hon. jacques gourde: Mr.Chair, Canada's dairy processors have been hit hard by the COVID-19 crisis and the new CanadaU.S.Mexico Agreement, or CUSMA. Will the government commit to granting import permits under CUSMA to Canada's dairy processors, not retailers directly? hon. chrystia freeland: Mr.Chair, I can assure you that dairy producers will receive fair compensation. That is important to Canada and Quebec, and I'm very pleased that we were able to do that. Canada's dairy processors invest hundreds of millions of dollars a year to bring high-quality products to consumers, while contributing $19billion to GDP. Will the minister commit to giving Canada's dairy processors import permits, instead of encouraging American multinationals? hon. chrystia freeland: Mr.Chair, I'd like to thank the member for his question. I fully understand, as we all do, the important role processors play in our system and our country. I can assure the members of the House that we will continue to work with Canadian processors as the agreement comes into force. jacques gourde: Mr.Chair, when it comes to the COVID-19 crisis, what Canadians will remember is that those with access to reliable high-speed Internet will have fared better, feeling less financial strain, than those who are cut off from the rest of the world. Is the government ready to invest in making high-speed Internet available to all Canadians, no matter where they live in the country? hon. jacques gourde: Mr.Chair, the current economic situation could lead to the disappearance of Canada's tourism industry. The pain will be felt by thousands of Canadians, who will have to find new jobs in order to survive. Is the government going to protect the tourism-based economy by investing in tourism infrastructure and upgrades to ensure Canada's tourist regions are ready when the economy reopens? hon. That is why we're here, providing a helping hand at this difficult time so they can come out the other side. bruce stanton): Continuing with questions, we'll go to the honourable member for SaskatoonUniversity, Mr. With respect to entering Canada, does the government consider spousal reunification as essential travel, yes or no? the acting chair (mr. bill blair: The CBSA has exercised the appropriate discretion in determining when a non-Canadian citizen, who has no status in Canada, attempts to enter the country for any consideration considered non-essential.  Changing gears a little, all Canadians would agree, or can agree, that the Prime Minister requires suitable accommodation. Why did the government simply not tell Canadians that the Harrington cottage needed to be rebuilt and massively expanded? the acting chair (mr. The work at Harrington Lake is part of a broader program to preserve and maintain and restore all official residences under NCC management, and we will support the NCC in its important work. corey tochor: Was there something in particular that this government did not want Canadians to know about the cottage, or is secrecy all this government knows how to do? hon. corey tochor: Respectfully, Canadians feel misled on this, and we're not clear on what the expenses were, how large an expansion it was the acting chair (mr. Chair, I believe this has absolutely nothing to do with the pandemic, so the questions are out of order, in my opinion. Certainly the scope of the special committee on the COVID-19 pandemic does expect and anticipate that the subject matter will be related to the matter at hand, so I would ask honourable members to continue to keep within those bounds. Of course, members will also know that we're unable to gauge that until members have spoken, so I would ask members to keep on subject. The point I was making was about transparency or lack of transparency that is hurting our efforts with COVID-19. Changing gears onto CERB, who came up with the number for CERB? Why is it $2,000? A senior gets $1,200, people with disabilities get $1,600, and now we've added another ad hoc program on top of those. carla qualtrough: Working collaboratively between ESDC and the Department of Finance, we determined that that would be an appropriate amount, based on what workers were earning and what we anticipated they would need to live on, and what we anticipated they would be losing by way of employment income. corey tochor: I have a really quick question, which I've heard in my office, on charities and non-profits that do not have their own payroll number and are ineligible for the wage subsidy. Does the Prime Minister have a program fix coming so that charities and non-profits can receive the wage subsidy? the acting chair (mr. Chair, we understand the important role that charities and non-profits are playing to help vulnerable Canadians at this difficult time. We have announced supports in the amount of $350 million to ensure that not only do they continue that great work, but also expand it to serve the most vulnerable to get through the COVID-19 pandemic. Chair, last week markets were shocked when leaks regarding the state of our economy came to light before the market even opened. This caused worry to investors at home and abroad about the integrity of our markets and the nature of the leak, which is, in itself, unprecedented. Section 34 of the Statistics Act indicates the following:     Every person who, after taking the oath set out in subsection 6, is guity of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars or to impreisonment for a term not exceeing five years or both:       wilfully discloses or divulges directly or indirectly to any person not entitled under this Act to receive the same any information obtained by him in the course of his employment that might exert an influence on or affect the market value of any stocks, bonds or other security or any product or article, or       uses any information described in paragraph for the purpose of speculating in any stocks, bonds or other security or any product or article   My question for the minister is this: Does the government consider this case to be subject to paragraph 34 or 34 and a criminal offence, yes or no? the acting chair (mr. colleague is absolutely right that the current situation with regard to the COVID crisis is deeply problematic, and we want to make sure that any information we share with the Canadian public with regard to economic measures or labour market numbers follows the appropriate process. I can assure him that we are looking into this matter and that Statistics Canada is looking into this issue as well. Going forward, we will ensure that such a breach does not occur again, because it's important that we continue to have the confidence of Canadians during this current health care crisis. navdeep bains: As I have indicated very clearly, what has happened is completely unacceptable. This matter is being looked into, and we want to assure Canadians going forward that the acting chair (mr. ziad aboultaif: In that case, the minister said the matter will be looked into. Basically, my understanding of this case is that Statistics Canada is going to investigate itself, or does the minister think that the government should refer this to the RCMP? hon. navdeep bains: Sorry, could you repeat that question? I had a bit of an issue and could not hear the question. ziad aboultaif: Will Statistics Canada investigate itself or will the government refer this to the RCMP? hon. Those protocols will be followed, and the appropriate actions will be taken to ensure that such breaches do not occur going forward. ziad aboultaif: The minister indicated that this will be investigated, but during the investigation into the SNC-Lavalin scandal, the Liberal staff refused to co-operate. navdeep bains: Again, we've been clear that it's important that any such breach be taken seriously. What has happened is unacceptable, and we will ensure that the appropriate steps are taken to make sure that such breaches do not occur going forward. ziad aboultaif: There's no doubt about the general terms, but I need to make sure that the government will commit that its staff will co-operate. The law is very clear, and we will make sure that the process is followed and the law is upheld. david yurdiga (fort mcmurraycold lake, cpc): Thank you, Mr. Before I start my questions, I would like to thank the various ministers, parliamentary secretaries and the Speaker of the House for reaching out to me during the severe flooding in Fort McMurray. Over the past number of years, we have seen tremendous pressure on the federal government from anti-oil and gas lobby groups demanding that the oil sands be shut down. The federal Liberal government's response to the anti-oil lobby was the introduction of the no more pipelines bill, Bill C-69, which will prevent any major oil and gas projects from being developed in Canada; and the oil shipping ban, Bill C-48, for the northern coast of British Columbia, which also had a negative effect on the oil industry. These two bills alone pushed over $200 billion of investment out of Canada, causing the Alberta economy to retract to recession levels. To compound Alberta's economic problems, we have an international oil price war and the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused a huge drop in demand for oil. Chair, 48 days after the finance minister promised liquidity loans to oil producers and service companies, there are still no applications open for these loans. Chair, I'm happy that we were able to announce today some liquidity measures for large cap corporations in the oil and gas sector. These measures will provide them with the liquidity that they needed, and this is also the liquidity that they asked for. It was on April 17 that we started liquidity measures for small and medium-sized businesses in the oil and gas industry, and those are the ones in which 85% of workers are affected. I'm very happy that we've had such people as the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers come out and say that this is what they asked for and this is what they need, and we have produced what they need in order to ensure the future competitiveness of Canada's oil and gas sector. Many of these contractors are indigenous companies, and they are having a difficult time qualifying for programs to save their businesses. Can the honourable Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations inform us of the measures the government is taking to ensure there are no gaps in the current programs, and commit to review the eligibility criteria for owners of aboriginal businesses struggling to qualify for financial help? hon. Chair, Canada's oil sector provides jobs for more than 576,000 people, including 11,000 indigenous people, in every part of Canada. It is essential that we support the many indigenous people who work in our oil and gas sector, particularly in Alberta and Saskatchewan. We have provided supports for those businesses, and we will continue to do so, also keeping in mind that in many of these communities the importance of public health and safety is foremost in our minds. If the global oil markets remain oversupplied into the summer and industry must shut down production, what is the government's plan to ensure Canada's energy security and the economic future of the oil sands with the potential shutdown of oil production? hon. Chair, we have worked with industry and with provinces on every front to ensure the stability of the oil and gas sector of our country. We need the workers in our oil and gas sector in order to lower emissions and achieve a greener economy. Therefore, we are looking after workers and we are looking out for companies that hold onto those jobs for those workers. Chair, the government's assistance package for the Canadian oil and gas industry provides some hope to the industry. Can the minister clarify? On a medium-sized energy company's eligibility, if the company is in default to financial institutions, does it still qualify for the business credit availability program? hon. We have the impacts of COVID and the effects of a global price war, and we have been tackling both of these on each front. As well, through the BCAP, we are making sure that more companies are eligible so that they can remain whole and so they can hold onto the jobs that we need. As we all know, we're being told we need a vaccine, and the quest for a vaccine is all-consuming globally. However, people who think about this issue and the question of the power structure and profit motive, particularly Dr. Can we ensure that public dollars for finding a vaccine will result in a product that is shared globally, openly, and is not for profit? hon. We have an open science model, and we're working with different partners and different jurisdictions to help develop vaccines and look at countermeasures and other therapeutics. Our goal is to make sure that we do so in a collaborative fashion, because this is a global pandemic, but make no mistake: If it's Canadian ingenuity and Canadian IP that's driving it, we want to support them as well. elizabeth may: As a follow-up to the minister's comment, I note it was interesting to see the claim made by this public health institute at Dalhousie about the wonderful research that was being done in Winnipeg on an Ebola vaccine. Because of the for-profit motive and the interests that big pharma had in seeing their market before they developed the product, it is alleged that the Ebola vaccine was actually delayed by the for-profit model. I wonder if we might consider examining this profit motive around the development of life-saving vaccines and other drugs. I'm working very closely with Minister Hajdu and the chief science advisor to look at all options. We are engaging with them and empowering them, and we will continue to share details of this with the public. elizabeth may: Changing gears, we know that the new regulations limiting what are described as military-style assault rifles and guns have been very controversial. It's very clear to me as an opposition member why we haven't seen legislation on any fast track. Wouldn't it be wise to table for first reading the entire legislative framework so that we know what we're talking about in the long term with regard to the buyback program and other aspects of this issue? hon. I want to assure her that at the first opportunity, we will bring forward legislation dealing with a number of aspects of our commitment to strengthen gun control in Canada, including legislation to deal with a buyback program, which we've indicated we will put in place. There are a number of other significant measures as well that we intend to bring forward to strengthen gun control legislation. The pandemic does not diminish our responsibility to do what is necessary to keep Canadians safe, and we will bring that legislation forward at the first opportunity. Some that are being run by not-for-profit societies are actually running very well, certainly in my community, but they are facing increased costs that could bankrupt them. As yet, there's no program to help a well-run seniors home that is not experiencing a loss of revenue and has lots of staff working hard. patty hajdu: I offer my gratitude to the many people who are working in these long-term care facilities day and night to keep seniors safe. The member certainly highlighted that there are not only additional expenses for some of the not-for-profit seniors homes, but also additional new measures that will increase all kinds of things, including costs. We continue to work with the provinces and territories and support them through, for example, generous transfers of money to boost their health care systems in ways that they think are most appropriate. To the Minister of Health, is her government prepared to take strong action to address this crisis in seniors health care? hon. Chair, the member has illustrated some of the horror stories that have appalled us all as Canadians and certainly as parliamentarians. We know that seniors deserve to live in dignity and safety with the utmost care, and that just hasn't been happening in this time of COVID and certainly, in some cases, in previous times as well. As the member knows, I've said publicly that I believe we need to hold long-term care homes to stronger standards. I am working with many ministers across our government to think about how we do that, how we the chair: We'll go back to Mr. Chair, if we treated children the way we do seniors in this country, social services would seize them. Over 80% of the deaths in Canada from COVID-19 have occurred in long-term care homes. Canada has the highest proportion of deaths in long-term care home settings among 14 comparable countries, including France, Germany, Denmark and Ireland. Chair, the member opposite knows that long-term care homes have rested largely in the jurisdiction of provincial governments and, in fact, municipal governments, which often run them and fund them partially as well. That's why it's important that we have those conversations with our provincial and territorial partners, but the member can rest assured that it is on the top of my priority list to engage with my colleagues all across the country, including many experts who have studied this issue multiple times, to come up with stronger standards so all seniors have quality of life, safety and dignity in their elder years. Chair, Canadians don't want politicians pointing fingers at each other; they want our seniors taken care of. Not a single province or territory in Canada is meeting the minimum standards of hands-on care for seniors, and death rates from COVID-19 in private, for-profit facilities are two to three times that of public or non-profit homes. Will the minister agree with New Democrats that we need strong national standards, federal funding tied to enforcement and public delivery of care to effectively improve care for seniors? hon. As a matter of fact, what I hear from my colleagues at the provincial and territorial level is the willingness to collaborate on how, first of all, we get through this crisis together and strengthen safety for seniors in homes right now and then how we look to the future to build a stronger network of long-term care or care alternatives that will ensure that seniors have the right and the ability to live with dignity and safety in their homes. Chair, what I'm not hearing is a single concrete proposal or measure that this minister is suggesting her government can take, but let me move to another subject. Like long-term care, COVID-19 has exposed other major gaps in our health care system. Millions of Canadians lost their prescription benefits when they lost their jobs, revealing the fundamental weakness of medical coverage tied to employment status. Will this government finally move to ensure all Canadians get the medicine they need by bringing in universal pharmacare at the earliest opportunity? hon. Chair, as you know, in the mandate that the Prime Minister gave to me, working on a national pharmacare plan is still there. I know it feels like a lifetime ago, but the member has very aptly illustrated why affordable medication is so important as part of a robust health care system. A few weeks ago, the Prime Minister made a big announcement expressing his desire to launch an economic recovery plan that fast-tracks the transition to a green economy. MinisterGuilbeault, MinisterMcKenna and MinisterWilkinson were appointed to a group tasked with doing just that. Today, I worry that the group is nothing but an empty shell, a convenient post-crisis political pitch. Perhaps there is an environmental component, but I'm having trouble wrapping my head around yesterday's announcement by Export and Development Canada. That's $500million for a pipeline project that will eventually produce 8.6million tonnes of greenhouse gases annually. How does the government reconcile that with its desire to transition to a green economy? the chair: The honourable minister has the floor. Certainly at this time, Canadians are most particularly focused on ensuring that support is provided so that they can put food on the table and pay their rent. Certainly as we move forward, we need to be thinking about the kind of society and economy that we want to create for the future. In that context, we need to learn lessons coming out of this experience, and certainly we need to ensure that we are addressing challenges that are on the horizon, including the challenge of climate change. Those are conversations that will need to be had as we move beyond this phase of the crisis, but at the current time, the focus is clearly on combatting the virus. monique pauz (repentigny, bq): There was absolutely no interpretation while the minister was speaking. the chair: Since so many are having issues with the interpretation, let's take a quick break while I try to fix the problem on my end. I'm going to ask the minister to repeat his answer, and we'll see whether the interpretation comes through this time. If not, please let me know, Ms.Pauz and anyone else who doesn't hear it. That means not just climate change, but also other challenges that we saw during the coronavirus crisis, challenges we need to take into account. Of course, we need to think about the future, but I want Canadians the chair: Mr.Simard has the floor. I want to tell you that, of all industries, the one best positioned to make the energy transition is probably the forestry industry. Unfortunately, in Canadaa petro statethere always seem to be two sets of rules when it comes to helping key industries, including providing liquidity support. Yesterday's announcement suggests that the $500million being provided by EDC is for a single project: Coastal GasLink. In 2017, under the softwood lumber action plan, EDC's entire budget for the forestry industry was exactly $500million. Now, EDC is shelling out $500million for just one project, Coastal GasLink, even though the whole of the forestry industry also received $500million when it needed EDC's support under a 2017 action plan to deal with tariffs. The industry accounts for 58,000jobs in Quebec and $6billion of Quebec's GDP. Does he think this situation is fair? Will he commit to providing the forestry industry with the same amount of liquidity being made available to the fossil fuel sector? hon. Building on our work today, we have included traditional investments to make sure this sector innovates, diversifies and grows. Over these past two and a half months, I have spent an inordinate amount of time with CEOs, with heads of the forestry sectors from coast to coast to coast. A few days ago, I convened a meeting of CEOs from all parts of this country, from Quebec to British Columbia, to talk to them about solutions, about answers. We will continue to work closely with industry to make sure we are there for them and that we stand by them through the COVID crisis, so we make sure that the chair: The next question will go to Mr. I'm hearing from small business owners like Joel, who runs a fitness club here in Pitt MeadowsMaple Ridge, and is very concerned that their landlords refuse to participate in the rent assistance program. These businesses have seen revenue drops between 50% and 100% and are asking for just 25% off their rent. When will the government help small businesses whose landlords refuse to be team players during this pandemic? hon. That's why we've moved forward with a number of measures that are designed to be of assistance. It allows for small businesses to significantly reduce their rent and for landlords to be protected with up to 75% of the rent. A number of my constituents, including Kathy, who owns a beauty salon, are concerned about meeting the PPE requirements. What is the federal government doing to ensure businesses in my riding can get access to the PPE they need to keep their employees and customers safe when they reopen? hon. However, we are actively involved in trying to ascertain how the federal government can work with the provinces and territories to provide essential services and other businesses with PPE. Chair, Craig and Matt are co-owners of Wanstalls, a firearms retail outlet in downtown Maple Ridge that employs eight people and serves thousands of law-abiding firearm owners in my riding, people who are now made to feel like criminals by the Liberal government. Further, they are now stuck with tens of thousands of dollars of inventory that they can no longer sell. What are they supposed to do to keep open in this already tumultuous COVID environment? hon. bill blair: It's important to understand that none of the restrictions that we have put in place, the new prohibitions, in any way impact weapons that are used for the lawful purposes in Canada of hunting and sport shooting, so those weapons remain available to Canadians engaged in those lawful activities. We have prohibited weapons that were not intended for the legal purposes of hunting and sport shooting and for which firearms are available to Canadians. Chair, according to the CERB website, if a recipient earns over $1,000 in a reporting period, their entire $2,000 benefit must be repaid. They're worried that if they take an extra shift, they will lose their CERB, but if they refuse a shift, they will also lose their CERB. Does the government intend to make them repay all their CERB if they barely go over the threshold? hon. Chair, that is why we're working with individual eligible CERB recipients to make sure they are not put in positions of undue hardship. At the beginning, the registration restricted it to basically not working, and then we relaxed the condition to earning up to $1,000. alexis brunelle-duceppe (lac-saint-jean, bq): I have a point of order, Mr.Chair. alexis brunelle-duceppe: There were some technical issues earlier during my fellow member Mario Simard's turn. The good thing is that this is all being filmed, so we can watch the video back to see what happened. alexis brunelle-duceppe: Mr.Chair, because the ministers chose to answer in French owing to a technical issue, their answers were unduly drawn out, which cost my fellow member speaking time. the chair: As I said, I'll check what happened and we'll have a solution for next time. steven guilbeault: I hope the member isn't suggesting that, because some members of the House are making an effort to speak French, they are unduly dragging out the time, as he seems to have said. Good for them, I say, for trying to speak a language they aren't necessarily comfortable in for the benefit of other members. the chair: I think a debate is brewing, but I'm sure that's not what people want, so I don't want an argument to break out over the fact that different languages are being spoken. Mr.Chair, many farmers in my riding and elsewhere are afraid they won't have enough workers this summer and fall. What is the government going to do to make sure those receiving the CERB and CESB have the right information and know about the job opportunities in the agri-food sector in our communities? the chair: The honourable minister has 15seconds to answer. Chair, I can assure the member that while we are supporting Canadians through both the CERB and the CESB, we are creating tens of thousands of jobs, including in the agriculture sector, to make sure there is labour available in this important and essential sector. When I first got elected as Speaker, one of the things I mentioned was that you would want everyone who was watching, including your families and your friends, to be proud of you. I didn't see anybody answer without one, and it is very much appreciated, not only by our fellow members but also by the people who are translating into the other language that you are not speaking"

        "Summary": "The remote control design includes a double-curved plastic case in special colors, with buttons made of rubber or wood in various forms and colors. The remote does not have a clock. The cost of the remote is within budget, excluding the voice recognizer, with only 4.30 euros remaining. The price of the remote is set at 25 euros, with a production cost of 12.5 euros. The company aims to sell at least 2 million units to achieve a profit goal of 50 million euros. The target market for the remote is international, covering different users, cultures, and trends. The remote will primarily be marketed in Europe and North America, and at least 4 million units need to be sold to meet the profit goals.",
        "Article": "anthony rota (nipissingtimiskaming, lib.)): I call this meeting to order.  Welcome to the 23rd meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic.  A reminder to all members that in order to avoid issues with sound, members participating in person should not also be connected to the video conference. For those of you who are joining via video conference, I will remind you that when speaking you should be on the same channel as the language you are speaking, and please use your headsets. I remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of this special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. For members participating in person, I ask that they please come and drop their signed certificates off at the table once the petition is presented. I would ask members to be very brief and concise, and to summarize the exact content of the petition. The residents of SaanichGulf Islands are calling on the government to simplify the process for protection of marine protected areas. The marine protected area first proposed in the 1970s for the southern Strait of Georgia, now called the Salish Sea, has been awaiting designation for so long that it was originally endorsed by Jacques Cousteau. The second petition is from petitioners who are very concerned about our obligations under the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and our commitments under the Truth and Reconciliation Commission calls to action. They specifically reference the RCMP violation of UNDRIP in its actions on Wet'suwet'en territory and ask the government to commit to actually living the principles embodied in UNDRIP. I am presenting a petition on behalf of the one in a million Canadians who suffer severe and adverse effects from vaccinations. GuillainBarre syndrome is very debilitating, and this petition seeks the setting up of a no-fault accident or compensation system to help offset the loss of work, the loss of wages and the loss of quality of life that many of these people suffer. denis trudel (longueuilsaint-hubert, bq): Mr.Chair, culture is the soul of a people. Over the past 20years or so, culture, especially music, has never been as accessible as it is now. The advent of digital technology has completely overturned the system for distributing the wealth generated by creators for the benefit of various Web stakeholders, many of whom are billionaires. The third is for Internet and cell phone providers who sell their services as direct access to culture to share their profits with artists. Six thousand people have already signed the first version of this petition, launched last month by musician JordanOfficer and supported by singer BarbaraSecours. As an artist, I am proud to present this petition today because the issues it raises are fundamental to the survival of Quebec culture. garnett genuis (sherwood parkfort saskatchewan, cpc): Thank you very much, Mr. I will be as brief as you suggested, although I will observe that if some members are going on longer during petitions than they normally do, it might be because the government has taken away so many of the tools that opposition members normally have for raising important issues in the House. The petitioners are concerned that instead of focusing on improving medically assisted life, something that we know is a major issue in light of recent revelations, the government has put so much time and legislative energy into efforts to continually further expand euthanasia in Canada and remove vital safeguards. The reality of the way that bill applies is that people from certain backgrounds who wish to practise their faith are not able to fully participate in Canadian society if they are employed in the public service. This petition asks the government to provide a response on that issue, something it hasn't done in response to past petitions on this. The petitioners want to see the government take a strong response in dealing with illegal guns and gun smuggling. At the same time, the petitioners are concerned that the government has the wrong focusthat is, harassing law-abiding firearms ownerswithout putting in place substantial measures to deal with illegal guns. The petitioners want to see the reversal of the order in council from May 1 and strong measures to deal with illegal firearms. The fourth and final petition deals with Bill S-204, a bill that would make it a criminal offence for a Canadian to go abroad and receive an organ from a person who has not consented to giving that organ. It would also create a mechanism by which someone could be deemed inadmissible to Canada if they were involved in organ harvesting and trafficking. The petitioners are supportive of Bill S-204 and of similar bills in previous parliaments and would like to see us pass that bill as soon as possible. These residents have signed a petition asking the Government of Canada, and in fact all members of Parliament, to put a high priority on assisting our poorest seniors. The increases to the GIS by $200, and $300 to the OAS, have been well received. They just want to highlight how important it is to support our seniors, in particular the poorest of our seniors. the chair: For members present in the Chamber, a reminder that they are asked to bring their petitions to the table. June 21 is National Indigenous Peoples Day, a day of acknowledgement and a day of celebration of the beautiful diversity of indigenous peoples across Turtle Island. I wish to recognize the leadership of Chief Shelley Sabattis of the Welamukotuk First Nation in Oromocto, New Brunswick. Each year she and her council, volunteers and staff go above and beyond to show appreciation for their members and to demonstrate pride and culture while promoting well-being. We gather in an event where all are welcome to take part, from traditional hand drum-making with elders to moose meat and tacos. This year we will celebrate a bit differently, but we will still stay connected, virtually and in spirit, to the vast network of indigenous peoples and allies. Chair, COVID-19 is an unprecedented challenge for all communities across Canada, but as we do our part to flatten the curve, I often think about those who suit up every morning to serve on the front lines of our health care system. Even before the crisis, they would often share the hardships they faced on a day-to-day basis. Share this message and say thanks to our front-line workers, participate in the 7 p.m. doug shipley (barriespringwateroro-medonte, cpc): Thank you, Mr. Slowly, we are getting back to some resemblance of normalcy, although unfortunately not soon enough for some of our great summer festivals. It will not be normal in BarrieSpringwaterOro-Medonte this summer without the iconic Boots and Hearts weekend music festival, Kempenfest, Oro World's Fair, the Elmvale Fall Fair, or the Midhurst Autumnfest. Because of the lack of Canada Day celebrations, I've created Happy Canada Day lawn signs that are available through my constituency office, free to all residents of BarrieSpringwaterOro-Medonte. I'm also hosting a drive-through party on Canada Day at the Royal Canadian Legion on St. Among the countless ordinary Canadians who have stepped up to do extraordinary work during COVID-19, I wish to draw attention to our teachers. My father was a teacher, and my daughter-in-law, Kelly Webb, is one now. I'm certain that my colleagues can all easily remember a teacher in their past who played an important role in helping them achieve their potential. This is not the school year anyone imagined, and what the next one will look like is unclear, but our teachers in London West and across Canada have shown that no matter what, they will be there to help our next generation shine. the chair: Before proceeding to the next presenter, I just want to remind the honourable members in the chamber that I realize that the six-foot limit makes it harder to whisper to each other, but we're hearing a bit of rumble, so I just want you to try to whisper at your best. stphane bergeron (montarville, bq): Mr.Chair, on July1st, we will be celebrating one of the most important events for the riding of Montarville: the 175thanniversary of the city of Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville. The theme Proud of our traditions will be the focus of this celebration for the people of Montarville. This is a good illustration of the rich history of this municipality nestled in the western foothills of Mont-Saint-Bruno. The seigneury of Montarville was granted in1710 to the illustrious former governor of Trois-Rivires, PierreBoucher. The parish of Saint-Bruno, which took root there and in which a village grew, became a municipal corporation in1845. To this day, it is one of the most prosperous localities, with a strong sense of belonging, a very dynamic community life and jealously preserved natural environments. A whole program had been drawn up for the celebration, but the current health crisis has taken over some of the planned activities, which has in no way diminished the pride and festive spirit of the people of Montarville. Chair, thank you for allowing me to take a moment to highlight an initiative that I started early on during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Heroes of EtobicokeLakeshore is an opportunity for citizens in my riding to recognize the contributions of those in their community who make life a bit easier. I'm pleased with the number of nominations I received that honour everyone from front-line workers to businesses that are innovating in these difficult times to volunteers who are finding new ways to reach out. I think of Daniel Lauzon who set up Food for Now, a mobile service that helps take care of the homeless. I think of Toni Varone, who helped his business clients by forgiving their rents, or young Lucas, who wanted to thank his teachers. I've been moved and inspired by the countless stories of generosity, strength, resiliency, kindness, incredible character and creativity. Chair, it gives me great pleasure to thank a local Richmond-based charity, the Social Diversity for Children Foundation, SDC, for its hard work both in raising funds for the purchase of personal protective equipment and in distributing this PPE to long-term care facilities and individual seniors' homes in the lower mainland of B.C. The COVID-19 relief fund is supported by a dozen other non-profits, businesses and community groups. It is amazing to have witnessed how the younger generation have gotten involved in caring for the elderly at this very challenging time. Chair, June is ALS Awareness Month, and 79 years after Lou Gehrig died from ALS little has changed. On June 21, Canadians will gather virtually to raise funds for ALS Canada in the Walk to End ALS. In Halton, normally we meet each year at Bronte Creek Provincial Park on the May long weekend to raise funds for ALS Canada. This year I will virtually join Tim's Titans, a team formed to honour Tim Robertson, my friend who died in 2016 after living with ALS for 13 years. I have a T-shirt, with a picture of Lou Gehrig, that says, Great Player...Lousy Disease and Tim's Titans...Great Team! ALS...Still a Lousy Disease. Join me on June 21 for the virtual Walk to End ALS to raise funds to support patients and their families and for ALS research. The peaceful protests that we're seeing across the country and around the world were not triggered by an isolated incident. They are fuelled by decades of ineffective action against something that is so insidious and deeply entrenched in our history, systems and institutions. It exists when a shocking report exposes the Peel District School Board's failure to work fairly with the black community. It exists when D'Andre Campbell, who was fighting mental illness, loses his life at the hands of the police. We need to dismantle the systems that allow this privilege and oppression to take form, and address the unconscious bias plaguing our institutions. Chair, a few months ago I rose in the House on the eve of our closure due to COVID-19. I told Canadians we must not give in to fear, that we would carry on and get through this crisis stronger than ever. Businesses are reopening, jobs are returning and our lives are starting to feel a bit normal again. Canadians pulled together, and because of that we did not see the devastating death toll that many had predicted. Life may be returning to normal, but unfortunately, here in this chamber of democracy, the people's voices continue to be shut down. In the words of my grandfather, it's time for the Liberals to get with the program and bring back the House. Chair, from in-person learning to virtual classrooms, COVID-19 has drastically changed the lives of students across the country, especially those in post-secondary education who are worried about covering costs like tuition or rent this coming fall. Our government recognized that students should not have to worry or put their futures on pause during this difficult time. If you're a high school student headed to a post-secondary school, or a current post-secondary student or a recent graduate, you can receive the Canada emergency student benefit every four weeks and have the financial support that you need to save for school. We also doubled Canada student grants and loans, enhanced the student loan program, increased supports for indigenous post-secondary education and introduced the Canada student service grant for those who wish to pursue it. I wish them all the very best, and I wish all of you, my colleagues and those across Canada, a very happy National Indigenous Peoples Day, which is coming up on June 21. the chair: I want to remind the honourable members to keep to their 60 seconds so that we don't go over the time. Chair, I rise today to once again implore the government to do something about the horrible lack of access to and crazy cost of rural Internet service. Right now, too many areas of my riding have no access to rural Internet service at all, and those who can get service are paying through the nose. I've even heard constituents say that during this pandemic, they are having to choose between feeding their kids and educating them. Is that too much to ask of the government? the chair: We'll now go to Mr. Chair, these last few months have been incredibly challenging for the residents of CowichanMalahatLangford, who have been forced to deal with the economic and social consequences of COVID-19. The pandemic has laid bare the inadequacies of our social safety net, the weakness in our supply chains and the dependence of our society on essential workers, who often work long hours for low wages, putting themselves and their families at risk. We've also been forced to confront the systemic inequality, poverty and racism that continue to hold so many people back from achieving their full potential. I will not dishonour the sacrifice that so many have made during this time by allowing us to go back to the status quo that got us here in the first place. I will not apologize for demanding that the most vulnerable in our society get the supports and opportunities they need to live with dignity, and I will not relent from pushing my political colleagues to summon the courage necessary to implement policies that lead to environmental, economic and social justice. steven blaney (bellechasseles etcheminslvis, cpc): Mr.Chair, here is a beautiful story, the story of a woman from Bellechasse, a courageous young mother from Saint-Malachie, Marie-ChristineGoupil. With three children, including the eldest daughter with a disability, and realizing that her daughter with a disability had special clothing needs, she decided to go into business to meet the needs of other parents who, like her, were facing their child's clothing challenges. Marie-ChristineGoupil has discovered a passion for entrepreneurship and has moved and inspired many people with her passionate and courageous attitude. yves-franois blanchet (beloeilchambly, bq): Thank you, Mr.Chair. I lend my voice to the Chief of the Assembly of First Nations of Quebec-Labrador, GhislainPicard, whose message is as follows:     There have been no fewer than 14reports and conclusions of commissions of inquiry since1967 highlighting major problems in relations between law enforcement agencies and indigenous people. Are you going to respond, as you too often do, by moving on to the next one, or are you going to do what we expect you to do, which is to recognize that the justice system discriminates against indigenous people and that we have no less right to security than the rest of the population? In three months, police interventions have claimed more victims among our members than the pandemic. rachael harder (lethbridge, cpc): Over the last few months, Canada's democracy has been disregarded and an autocracy has been resurrected in its place. In 2014, he professed that Canadians want their Members of Parliament to be effective voices for their communities in Ottawa, and not merely mouthpieces for an all-too-powerful Prime Minister. A government that does not allow for effective opposition is not functioning in the best interest of Canadians; it is operating in the best interest of itself and, even more so, the interest of the Prime Minister. Canadians deserve to flourish in a democracy, not merely survive under the autocracy that this Prime Minister has created. Chair, I would like to recognize the work of Agincourt Community Services Association and its tireless executive director, Lee Soda, who have been serving our community during the COVID-19 pandemic. Under more pressure than ever, their staff and volunteers continue to serve a community whose need was great even before the crisis. They have opened outdoor washrooms and hand-washing stations for vulnerable communities and are delivering groceries and other essentials to vulnerable seniors. ACSA is a bridge between those who can help and those who need help, and they are just one example of how our community has come together to meet this challenge. There are restaurants and businesses donating meals to front-line workers, residents answering the call to stock the food bank shelves and neighbours looking in on the vulnerable and isolated. Please note that we will suspend the proceedings twice in order to allow employees who provide support for the sitting to replace each other safely. Chair, for months Conservatives have been pointing out flaws in Liberal government programs that are preventing Canadians from getting the help they need. The Prime Minister has refused to make these very technical changes to get more help to Canadians who need it. For example, on the wage subsidy, more than two-thirds of the money allocated for that program has lapsed because businesses don't qualify. Will the Prime Minister change the program to allow companies who have made acquisitions to access the wage subsidy to keep more people working? right hon. Chair, from the very beginning we knew that as we rolled out measures, we would need to improve them and tweak them, and that's exactly what we've been doing over the past three months. But we continued to improve them, to make additions and amendments so that more people could get the help they needed, including with the proposed legislation last week that expanded the reach of the wage subsidy to more businesses. Chair, it was the Liberals who said no to the motion to allow this Parliament to sit to debate that motion, and even in that legislation they refused to allow businesses who have made acquisitions to access the program. Now, when we look at the rent relief program, it is so difficult to apply for it that many landlords are refusing to bother, leaving even more small businesses to fall through the cracks. In fact, of the $3 billion allocated to the rent relief program, only $39 million has been paid out. It's now June and he has refused to fix these programs and has successfully talked out the calendar on the days that the House of Commons could meet to discuss these programs. We recognize, in conversations with the premiers, how important it is to make sure that we're working together, the provinces and the federal government, on issues like rent subsidies where commercial rent is indeed a provincial jurisdiction. Many provinces have moved forward with the eviction bans that are necessary to go along with this, and we'll continue to work with provinces to make sure that we're getting Canadians the help they need. He has run down the clock on parliamentary sittings and he still refuses to make these changes to get more help to Canadians. Some of these sites are very near sensitive government institutions, like government departments, the National Research Council, RCMP headquarters and the Bank of Canada. How long has the Prime Minister known that Huawei technology has been installed in the Ottawa area? right hon. Chair, first off, on the issue of Parliament, it has been meeting four times a week over the past many weeks, and members of the opposition have been able to continue to ask questions on COVID-19 and a broad range of subjects. Moreover, every two weeks the finance department puts forward at the finance committee the full transparent measures that we've taken, so that parliamentarians can study them. justin trudeau: in regard to Huawei technology there are strict rules for companies to follow and we assume they will all follow those. I want to remind the honourable members who are joining us virtually that heckling really does disrupt the whole session. Your face does come up and we do see who it is, so I just want to make sure that you're aware of that. Chair, throughout this unprecedented pandemic, we have been open and transparent about all of the measures we've put forward. Chair, the Prime Minister has pursued a policy of appeasement in pursuit of a personal vanity product at the UN. He's abandoned Israel and committed funding to UNRWA, an organization whose schools have been used as storage facilities for Hamas rockets against Israeli civilians, and whose facilities have served as breeding grounds for racism and anti-Semitism. He has apologized for the Iranian regime when it shot down a plane full of Canadian citizens, and he refuses to list the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist entity. What's the point of having a seat at the table if you have to sell out Canadian principles to get there? the chair: The Right Honourable Prime Minister. That's why, when we took office five years ago, we demonstrated the kind of leadership on values that Canadians expected. elizabeth may: This being a committee, we can have a point of order during what would have been question period. I am not sitting that far away from the Prime Minister, and I'm sorry, but Andrew Scheer used to be the Speaker of the House and should show better decorum. Chair, on the same point of order, it is disgusting for the leader of the Green Party to use decorum as an excuse to interrupt the Leader of the Opposition in the middle of critical lines of questioning. The leader of the Green Party knows the rules of the House and shouldn't be abusing them to advance a partisan agenda. andrew scheer: I appreciate the honourable leader of the Green Party, Elizabeth May, for that reminder. I just want to say to the member, and to all members, that the reason that I cannot control myself is that the Prime Minister used the word embarrassment in answering a foreign affairs question, and it just made me think of the India trip. yves-franois blanchet: Mr.Chair, while the Greens and the Conservatives are saying that they'll be waiting outside after the meeting, I will ask a question. The Prime Minister has extended the Canada emergency response benefit, and that's good news, but it's not enough. For us, it was also urgent to adjust the CERB to the needs of the tourism, arts and agriculture sectors. So what happened to the urgency of reforming the CERB? Why is the government refusing to talk to the opposition parties? right hon. We have unequivocally proposed to extend the debate to reach an agreement, which brings me to my second question. Last week, the issue of assistance to people with disabilities was also a pressing concern, and it's even more so a week later. The Bloc proposed to extend the discussions and split the government's bill in two to help people with disabilities. Why is the government refusing this assistance to people with disabilities, when it could have been debated with the opposition in a civilized and proper way in a Parliament in which it has a minority? right hon. justin trudeau: That was exactly what we wanted, but unanimous consent of the Chamber was required to debate this matter, and the Conservative Party of Canada voted against it. yves-franois blanchet: If the idea is so good and wonderful, why not start over and open the dialogue now? What's stopping the Prime Minister from being a rallying point and inviting us to take to each other and resolve the problem, rather than saying that he is going to pack up his toys and go home? The people with disabilities are the ones who will pay the price. Where was the Prime Minister on October21,2019? He received a minority mandate from Quebeckers and Canadians. Why is he behaving like something between a prime minister with a majority and a monarch by divine right? right hon. justin trudeau: I've heard the Conservative Party and the Bloc Qubcois throw their accusations around. They don't point out that the House of Commons did indeed give its consent to extend the mandate of the Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic until the end of June. Unfortunately, they too are part of a minority Parliament and must respect the voice of the majority of parliamentarians, just as we do. yves-franois blanchet: I might have been tempted, but that's unlikely to happen because the Prime Minister isn't me, he's him. In addition, the government wants to buy the right to interfere in provincial and Quebec jurisdictions for $14billion. However, Quebec and a number of provinces are refusing to allow it to interfere in their jurisdictions and are asking that this money be paid to them unconditionally. Is the Prime Minister trying to take advantage of the crisis or is he trying to create a constitutional crisis? right hon. justin trudeau: Mr.Chair, the safety of Canadians is the responsibility of all levels of government. That's why we have proposed a $14billion agreement to ensure that all Canadians across the country experience a safe re-opening of the economy. This is a proposal that we are working on with the provinces because we know that there are needs across the country, including early childhood centres, screening and support for municipalities. Indigenous leaders have expressed a lack of confidence in the RCMP commissioner's ability to tackle full-scale systemic racism, but the Prime Minister has expressed his confidence in the commissioner. Chair, over the past two years, Commissioner Lucki has made significant strides forward on an issue where there is still much more to do. We know that systemic racism exists in all of our institutions across this country the chair: We'll now go back to Mr. jagmeet singh: This is the same RCMP commissioner who just recently said that they couldn't explain what systemic racism was. Why does the Prime Minister believe that the RCMP commissioner can tackle systemic racism in the RCMP? right hon. Chair, recent events have made it abundantly clear that to tackle the systemic racism at the level of the RCMP, we need a full-scale overhaul of the RCMP. Is the Prime Minister committed to a full-scale overhaul of the RCMP to root out systemic racism? right hon. Chair, I am committed to addressing systemic racism in this country and taking significant, bold actions to reduce the amount of discrimination that indigenous peoples, that racialized Canadians face on a daily basis. What it's saying is that we need to be better at where we spend our money, investing in communities and not policing. Will the Prime Minister commit to a review of the RCMP budget to allocate resources to community services and not to policing? right hon. Chair, over the past years we have been investing more directly and more money in community organizations, in the black community, and working with indigenous partners on the path to reconciliation. We have been investing in the kinds of community-based programs and solutions that are part of the solution. We know there is much more to do, and we will continue to look at all of our expenditures to make sure we're doing the right things. Chair, over the past few years, while the Prime Minister has been in office, the RCMP budget has increased by 31%. In recent events we've seen people who needed a health care response to a health care crisis been killed by the RCMP. Does the Prime Minister believe that we need to be investing in a health care response instead of a police response for people who are faced with a crisis? right hon. We need to make sure that our systems across the board, from our police systems to our judicial systems, to our health care systems, to our community systems, are actually addressing the systemic discrimination issues that are embedded within them That is exactly what we are going to continue to do in the coming years. Chair, with regard to the CERB extension, can the Prime Minister guarantee that everyone who is receiving CERB payments now will continue to do so without any gaps throughout the summer? right hon. Chair, I am happy to highlight that many Canadians who were on the CERB are now returning to work. We know that as the economy gets back to work, people will want to the chair: We will go back to Mr. jagmeet singh: Can the Prime Minister assure people who need it that they will continue to receive the CERB over the summer, yes or no? right hon. justin trudeau: We are very pleased to point out that we are going to extend the Canada emergency response benefit for at least another eight weeks, because a lot of people are going to need it. the chair: We're going to pause and suspend proceedings just for a few moments to allow our support staff to substitute for one another in a healthy and safe way. Chair, it was really a surprise in the middle of a pandemic to see the Prime Minister at his first campaign stop last week in Ottawa. He has a daily report show and he wants to sideline Parliament, dominate the news cycle and keep everyone in the dark about the state of the economy. According to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, there is no reason that he cannot provide the fiscal update during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the PBO has published a number of reports himself. Why won't the Prime Minister provide a fiscal update so we can all understand the state of our economy, or is that just not part of his campaign playbook? hon. mona fortier (minister of middle class prosperity and associate minister of finance): Thank you, Mr. We will continue to be open and transparent about the actions that we are taking to support families, businesses, workers, our health care system and our economy. cathy mcleod: Chair, Canada's economy was in trouble prior to the COVID, with some of the worst numbers since 2009. Government revenues in March dropped by 7.2%, and it's shameful and, quite frankly, it's outrageous that they refuse to provide Parliament and Canadians with an economic update. Households during this challenging time know how much money is coming in and they know how much money is going out. mona fortier: The Canadian economy is going through a period of extraordinary uncertainty due to COVID-19. We've continued to be open and transparent about the measures we've put in place for Canadians, workers and businesses. In fact, we have reported biweekly to Parliament on the total cost and status of our plan's measures. As soon as it's possible to provide clear economic projections, we will provide a comprehensive update to Canadians the chair: We go back to Ms. cathy mcleod: Other governments have managed to provide updates for their citizens and carry out their responsibilities, but of course this government has sidelined Parliament with simply a question-but-no-answer period. The forestry industry was in crisis even before the pandemic, with mills closing down and thousands of jobs lost. Eight weeks ago, Minister Freeland said, I have had many discussions with leaders in our forestry sector and the provinces about what we can do to support the industry today. Meanwhile, we've had support going to the arts and we've had support going to fisheries, just to name a few, but arguably for the industry that was having some of the most numerous challenges, it has been radio silence. Can the government at least commit to releasing an updated softwood lumber transition plan before we rise? hon. Chair, we remain committed, of course, to the forestry industry and seeing it through this pandemic and this very uncertain time. The expanding market opportunities program, for instance, has helped Canada's forestry sector diversify, create jobs and open new markets. We've had new construction projects that are active today, using Canadian wood in key markets like Korea, Japan, China and the United States. Tomorrow this House will vote on our government's investment of $20.97 million for this program. It's part of our budget 2019 commitment to invest $251 million over three years, and I hope the opposition will support us in that. cathy mcleod: It was stated in a major newspaper this morning that this government is like a sexy sports carvroom, vroom, vroombut with a history of breakdowns and major repairs. The sector is also an essential link in the medical equipment supply chain, and we thank them for all the work they're doing. We're aware of the immense pressures faced by this sector, especially at this time, and Deputy Prime Minister Freeland and others are taking that seriously and working through this issue. duties on Canadian softwood lumber are unfair and unwarranted, and we will pursue all means in order to the chair: Before continuing, I want to remind honourable members who are at home to make sure that the boom on their headsets is down. grard deltell (louis-saint-laurent, cpc): Mr.Chair, before I ask my question, I'd like to pay tribute to the Minister of Justice, particularly to his versatility. I like Mr.Lametti very much, but I'd like Mr.Morneau to answer my question. Yesterday, in a Senate parliamentary committee, the Minister of Finance half-opened the door to an economic update. Based on what he said, it seems that, as we speak, a committee of the Department of Finance is working on an economic update. mona fortier: Mr.Chair, as we know, the Canadian economy is going through a period of extraordinary uncertainty. As soon as it's possible to provide clear economic projections, we will provide a full update to Canadians. Right now, we can say that we have supported workers, businesses and Canadians with the emergency measures we have put in place. We will continue to do so, because we need to be sure that Canadians can get through this crisis. We don't know when the economic update will take place, yet all across Canada, provinces are doing economic updates. mona fortier: Mr.Chair, since the beginning of the crisis, we have implemented the economic action plan to respond to COVID-19, and we've provided immediate assistance to Canadians, businesses and workers. In addition, 8.4million Canadians the chair: We are returning to Mr.Deltell. grard deltell: Mr.Chair, next Friday, the Quebec minister of finance, EricGirard, will give an economic update. If EricGirard can give one for Quebec, why can't BillMorneau give one for Canada? hon. mona fortier: Mr.Chair, once again, we have been open and transparent from the outset. grard deltell: Mr.Chair, I cannot judge the quality of the work done by the provinces, but what I do know is that Quebec, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland have also made efforts to support their residents economically. We have reported biweekly to Parliament on the total cost and status of the measures in our economic response plan. Once again, as soon as clear economic projections can be provided, we will provide an update the chair: Mr.Deltell has the floor. So I ask the question: so far, over the past three months, how much has the pandemic cost Canadians? hon. mona fortier: As I said earlier, it is important to note that we have put forward measures, including the wage subsidy, which have helped more than 2.5million the chair: Mr.Deltell has the floor. grard deltell: Mr.Chair, I have been trying for four minutes to get anything remotely resembling an answer, and I'm getting absolutely nothing. Why are the government and the Minister of Finance, Bill Morneau, not able to table an economic update when some provinces are able to? hon. We have continued to support businesses and Canadians during this time the chair: Mr.Deltell, you have time for a very brief question. grard deltell: The only thing that distinguishes the provinces that table economic updates and the current government is political will. As soon as it is possible to provide clear economic projections, we will provide Canadians with a full update. The difference between our government and the previous government is that we will actually consult with Canadians, including black Canadians, including Asian Canadians, to respond to the challenges, including with an anti-racism secretariat and an anti-racism strategy. Chair, this program was made possible by working with the provinces, and we will continue to encourage landlords and tenants to work together to make sure they have relief for this very difficult time in which they're living. We're continuing to monitor the CECRA program and we will make it possible for businesses to have access to the program. What is it going to take for the government to admit that the program is a disaster and needs changes? hon. Chair, we know our government has been working closely with the provinces and territories to deliver the Canada emergency commercial rent assistance. Although the tenant-landlord relationship is ultimately the responsibility of the provinces and territories, our government has stepped up to provide support through the tools we have and through CMHC so that small businesses can get the rent relief they need. At committee, we were told only around 5,500 of them are receiving COVID-19 rent relief. We will continue to monitor this program closely and ensure that Canada's small businesses are supported during this challenging time. Chair, I want to assure the honourable colleague that we are doing everything and will continue to do everything to help small businesses in our country. Chair, on May 27 the CBSA seized 65 small handguns at Pearson airport, the largest firearms seizure on record. Chair, I would point out that gun violence in any of our communities is unacceptable, and it's important that governments and communities take steps to prevent guns from getting into the hands of criminals. That's why we do important work at our border to keep guns from being smuggled into our country, but it also necessitates additional work. That's why our government has taken a very strong position and will strengthen gun control to keep Canadians safe. We know the Liberals' gun ban won't change anything, but a focus on smuggled guns and criminals will. Chair, stronger gun control laws are an effective tool, and that's been told to us by police leadership and communities across the country. is a strong partner of Canada, as is the European Union, and we're looking forward to continuing that strong relationship the chair: We'll now go back to Mr. With respect to the negotiations with the U.K., when will the minister publish her goals and objectives for this agreement? hon. Chair, we're going to continue to work to ensure that any future agreement is going to be based on the best interests of Canadians, and we will the chair: We will go back to Mr. randy hoback: Can the minister confirm whether they've entered into negotiations with the U.K. mary ng: Our government is analyzing the most-favoured-nation tariff regimes schedule the U.K. Chair, during the CUSMA negotiations, a deal was struck between the Liberal Party and the NDP that the government would notify this House 90 days before it starts any negotiations on any trade agreement. Right now, we are analyzing the most-favoured-nation tariff regimes schedule put out by the U.K. Has the minister discussed a WTO reform with the USTR, the United States trade representative? hon. mary ng: The Ottawa Group is a consensus-based group limited to WTO members who are committed to bringing forward ideas and proposals the chair: We'll go back to Mr. randy hoback: Just as with any other trade agreement, the minister has committed to this House that she will publish the list of goals and responsibilities for the negotiations. Chair, I'm thrilled that we had an excellent meeting of the Ottawa Group yesterday where, as a group, we agreed to take concrete action. randy hoback: Will the minister be releasing a list of Canada's objectives we would like to see the new WTO's director-general pursue prior to the upcoming DG election? hon. I would remind the member that we have access to a billion and a half customers through our very robust mr. randy hoback: A billion and a half customers is fine if you have a functioning WTO, but if you don't have a functioning WTO, then a billion and a half customers may not be fully accessible to our suppliers, manufacturers and agriculture producers. Chair, I want to assure the honourable member that nothing is more important than standing up and helping create markets for our Canadian businesses and to help our small businesses get more export-ready so that they can grow into the international marketplace. This is work that we've committed to do, and we will keep working on it, particularly the chair: We'll go back to Mr. Not only did they present the budget, but they'll also actually debate the budget and pass the budget in Parliament. Chair, the House is sitting in this hybrid format so that people can participate in the House on the screens. I'm sure my colleague is happy to see that his own colleagues are able to ask questions and participate. New Brunswick families and businesses are rapidly making adjustments to manage and live with the coronavirus pandemic. Chair, our government is committed to ensuring that Canadians continue to have access to the benefits that they rely on through Service Canada. We have redeployed over 3,000 additional staff to ensure that Canadians continue to have access to their benefits. We've established a 1,500-agent call centre to make sure that people can get access to the phone lines to get the help they need. Provincial governments are working hard to adjust to Canada's new normal by opening up businesses and front-line government services. Chair, we're currently working with our world-class public health experts to determine how best to reopen the Service Canada network for the public. Make no mistake: Our Service Canada employees have gone above and beyond to ensure that Canadians continue to have access to the services that they rely on and the benefits that they need. john williamson: Please don't hide behind health experts when the Prime Minister is appearing in the middle of large protests, yet is afraid to bring back the Parliament of Canada to do its business. Bills are being studied, opposition input is being heard and MLAs are voting on legislation, not rubber-stamping government bills. When will the government table an economic update so taxpayers understand what was spent, what is owed by our kids and grandchildren, and what the government's fiscal footing looks like? hon. The only reason my colleague is able to ask a question and I'm able to answer his question is that he's right there on the screen. We have this hybrid format that cares for MPs across the country, not only the ones sitting in the House. When will the government table an economic update so that taxpayers understand what was spent, what is owed by our kids and grandchildren, and what the government's fiscal footing looks like in today's environment? hon. We have been open and transparent about the measures we have been providing to support families, businesses and workers. Again I will ask when the government will table an economic update so that we can have an understanding of what the government's fiscal footing looks like. Chair, we have included biweekly reports to Parliament on the full cost and status of our economic response plan measures since the beginning. I have said, and I will continue to say, that when it is possible to provide a clear economic projection, we will provide an update. john williamson: What is the full cost to date of the government's COVID-19 relief measures, as the minister just claimed the government has provided to Parliament? hon. Chair, we have provided support for workers, and 2.5 million Canadians have been helped through the Canadian wage subsidy. stphane bergeron: Mr.Chair, as the leader of the Bloc Qubcois mentioned a few moments ago, the government promised $14billion to Quebec and the provinces, but in targeted transfers. But Quebec and the provinces don't just want this money to be transferred unconditionally, they also want a real discussion on a permanent increase in health care transfers. The federal government, which does not manage any hospitals or long-term care centres, must stop playing armchair quarterback and transfer the money to the only governments with jurisdiction over health, that is, Quebec and the provinces. Will it do so without delay and without nitpicking? the honourable patty hajdu (minister of health): Mr.Chair, we know that the Government of Quebec is working hard to ensure the safety of Quebeckers and we are here to support them. As part of this co-operation, we have developed health and safety recommendations for workplaces, we have purchased medical equipment for workers and we have supported the province in developing its reopening program. stphane bergeron: The co-operation is so effective that the money is staying in the federal government's coffers. We see it with housing, for which Quebec has not received a dime of the $1.4billion it is owed. pablo rodriguez: I am pleased to confirm to my colleague that there is no messing around, no quibbling, nothing of the kind. There is a clear willingness on the part of the federal government to co-operate with Quebec and all the provinces. stphane bergeron: We don't want to bicker, we want the money to be paid out. There is $1.4billion that should be paid to Quebec for social housing and is sitting in the federal government's coffers. We are waiting for money for water treatment and water systems, but it is sitting in the federal government's coffers. What is the government waiting for to pay out the money so that we can get our economy rolling? hon. stphane bergeron: MadamChair, things are definitely at a standstill, because the money is owed and has not been paid out. We need more flexibility in the gas tax program and Quebec's contribution to allow municipalities to undertake work on city halls, community centres and fire stations. We need the federal government to contribute to funding public transit operations, which have become a real financial drain because of the drop in ridership. pablo rodriguez: When it comes to just talking, the Bloc Qubcois has a lot of experience, I admit. iqra khalid (mississaugaerin mills, lib.): Madam Chair, I'll be splitting my time with the member for GlengarryPrescottRussell. During a consultation with the business community in Mississauga, the concerns of businesses, big and small, included the need for stable, affordable and safe child care. With the lack of such child care spaces, an economic recovery plan post-COVID cannot be effective until and unless we make sure that people are able to get back to work. I've heard from parents across Mississauga that they're being forced to stay home because of inadequate child care and that they have to choose between putting food on the table and keeping family safe. More and more employers are realizing that good employees are unable to contribute to their business growth because of this challenge. Now more than ever, we need to find long-term sustainable solutions for Canadians who face challenges with regard to child care. I ask our Minister of Families, Children and Social Development this: What is our strategy to tackle this ever-growing need for a national child care plan? hon. ahmed hussen: Madam Chair, I thank the honourable member for her question and for her important advocacy and work on this important issue. That is why we're committed to continuing to work with provinces and territories to renew our agreements on early learning and child care, and to provide, at the earliest opportunity, $400 million in support. In addition to that, the Prime Minister has already indicated that child care will be part of the $14-billion pledge to provinces and territories to assist them with respect to COVID-19 recovery efforts. Over the next decade, we will continue to invest $7.5 billion, and together we have achieved the goal of over 40,000 affordable child care spaces. We are also committed to continuing to create over 250,000 before-school and after-school child care spaces for kids under the age of 10. We will continue to work with our partners in the provinces and territories to ensure that Canadians can continue to have access to safe, quality and affordable child care. francis drouin (glengarryprescottrussell, lib.): MadamChair, small businesses play a fundamental role in the Canadian economy. In an article in LaPresse, the Minister of Economic Development warned us that the economic crisis caused by severe lockdown measures could have more serious consequences in small municipalities than in large cities. Based on discussions with the chambers of commerce in my riding, it is clear that federal government assistance will be essential for the reopening of the economy, specifically for the rural economy. In fact, I would like to acknowledge the work of the Prescott-Russell community development corporation , under the leadership of John Candie. After announcing almost $57million to help SMEs adopt e-commerce, how does the minister plan to help SMEs and the business community in our rural areas? hon. mlanie joly (minister of economic development and official languages): MadamChair, I also thank my colleague from GlengarryPrescottRussell for his important question. It is also why we have doubled the budget of CFDCs and Community Futures organizations across the country.  In southern Ontario we have reinvested over $260million in the regional economic development agency FedDev. In the great riding of GlengarryPrescottRussell, which I am particularly fond of and where there is a very good member of Parliament, there is an additional $1million for entrepreneurs in the region. carol hughes): The honourable member for GlengarryPrescottRussell has 36seconds left. daniel blaikie (elmwoodtranscona, ndp): Thank you very much, Madam Chair. She has been working from home since late March, taking care of her child, who is out of school, and caring for her father, who is living with her and vulnerable to COVID-19. As a parent and a care provider to a vulnerable person, she's not comfortable with physically returning to work. Service Canada won't give Krystal a straight answer as to whether going on leave and collecting CERB would count as refusing a reasonable job offer. With Bill C-17 looming in the background, Krystal is worried about jail time and fines if she does right by her child and her father by applying for CERB. Can Krystal reasonably refuse to go back to work and collect CERB, or will she be considered a fraudster? That's my question for the minister that is specific to Krystal's case. As well, what is the minister doing to provide clear direction to Canadians and to Service Canada agents so that people can get a clear answer before making their decision about returning to work? hon. We recognize that Canadian workers will face various different situations, including those who are ineligible for the Canada emergency support benefit. We'll continue to work with workers to make sure they're able to be supported throughout this pandemic. daniel blaikie: Madam Chair, that answer is really not good enough, because the problem here is that Krystal needs to know whether she can continue receiving CERB or not. That's a federal government decision, and she needs to know whether the federal government is going to accuse her of fraud and put her in jail or assess fines against her if she refuses to go back to work because she wants to take care of her child and her father. ahmed hussen: Madam Chair, I can assure the honourable member that if a Canadian has to take care of a loved one due to circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, they are indeed eligible to receive the CERB and remain receiving that benefit. laurel collins (victoria, ndp): As we deal with the global pandemic, we cannot lose sight of the ongoing climate emergency. Canada has missed every single climate target it set, and we need to break the cycle of empty promises. Canadians want their government to be accountable, and environmental groups such as Ecojustice, CAN-Rac, Environmental Defence and West Coast Environmental Law, as well as the government's own climate institute, are all calling for legally binding climate targets. When will the government put its climate targets into law with legally binding milestones so we never miss another target again? hon. navdeep bains (mississaugamalton, lib.): Madam Chair, I thank my honourable colleague for her question. It is a priority not only for us as a government, but it should be a priority for all Canadians. That is why we have a comprehensive plan that also includes significant investments in clean technology, which will help reduce our carbon footprint. I am confident that these measures will enable us to not only meet but exceed our 2030 target and also allow us to achieve our net-zero 2050 target. navdeep bains: Madam Chair, I think the fundamental issue here is having a plan when it comes to the environment. I'm confident that the measures that we have takenputting a price on pollution, investing in clean technology, and other key measures to reduce our carbon footprint, including the investment in infrastructureunderpin a plan the acting chair (mrs. laurel collins: This government is not meeting its targets, but it is meeting with oil and gas lobbyists. Are we going to choose a just recovery with good, sustainable jobs for Canadian workers, or are we going to keep subsidizing oil and gas companies to the tune of billions, subsidies that we know are ending up in the pockets of CEOs and shareholders? the acting chair (mrs. navdeep bains: Again, Madam Chair, this is the fundamental difference between us and the NDP. We fundamentally believe that the entire economy needs to work together, including the energy sector, to enable us to achieve those 2030 and 2050 targets. We are going to work together to support our workers, including in the energy sector, to reduce our carbon footprint. When I was last here in May, I was on my way back to Saskatoon from Toronto, and there was actually someone on my flight who tested positive for COVID-19. Why hasn't the government put rules in place requiring airlines to reach out to individuals like me who may have been exposed to COVID on their flights? hon. patty hajdu: Madam Chair, it's hard to speculate on what happened from such a vague description of his experience, but I will say that we have every confidence in local public health, which is doing the hard and heavy lifting of contact tracing and working very closely with all kinds of different sectors, including airline sectors, to make sure that close contacts of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 are found, are traced and are isolated. I assume that the member took appropriate precautions on the flight and I hope that he continues to do so. kevin waugh: Madam Chair, it was reported that the individual on my plane who had COVID was actually connecting in Toronto from an international flight. The Prime Minister announced last week that they would begin mandating temperature checks for those bound for Canada in July. Will international travellers be tested when they land in Canada, or will they be relying on the tests that take place in other countries? hon. bill blair: Madam Chair, this is a very important question, because the protection and safety of all Canadiansin particular, Canadian travellersis a high priority for our government. That will initially be done primarily by the airlines that are in the best position to do it at this point in time. We are also now going to be including CATSA, the people who do the security screening, so that when people enter the airport, they will also be screened. kevin waugh: Madam Chair, last week five of the largest professional sports leagues in North America put out a statement of support for my private member's bill, the safe and regulated sports betting act. Given the struggles that clubs and leagues are facing due to COVID-19, including having no fans at all in the stands for the foreseeable future, the legalization of sports betting would be a welcome opportunity not only to engage fans but to generate much-needed revenue. Will the government commit now to supporting the sports and gaming industries by supporting my private member's bill, Bill C-218? hon. bill blair: Madam Chair, I've had the opportunity on many occasions to speak to members of Parliament and also to mayors and councillors and people living in border communities where there are casinos. I would like to advise the member that I look forward to the opportunity for a careful examination of his bill. At the same time, we will examine his bill with all of the necessary attention to make sure it's given full consideration. kevin waugh: Madam Chair, it's the first time in history that we've had the five professional leagues in this country joining together for this bill. I've heard major concerns from a number of newspapers in this country about competition they're receiving today from Canada Post, which is offering massive free postage services. In fact, I have one of their ads here, which says that the first 6,000 pieces of postage are 100% free. If the government is genuine about wanting to ensure that newspapers and journals can succeed in this country, why are you allowing Canada Post to use its monopoly power to actually threaten local newspapers in this country? hon. steven guilbeault (minister of canadian heritage): Thank you, Madame Chair, and I thank the member opposite for his question. As you well know, a healthy news and media sector in Canada is a priority for our government, which is why we have put in place a number of measures before COVID-19 and during COVID-19, and we will continue to be there for them after this crisis has gone by. carol hughes): Before we go on, we will be taking a break to do a bit of a changeover. Blair stated yesterday here in the House that the AR-15 has been used in mass killings in Canada on many occasions. Blair, please provide just one specific instance in which an AR-15 was used in a mass killing in Canada. I think this is an excellent opportunity to point out to the member opposite how important it is to actually listen to what was said. If you go back and review that tape, and I would invite you to do so, you'll see that I said the AR-15 and other weapons like themreferring of course to military-style assault weaponshave been used in mass killings, and I actually cited a number of examples. Madam Chair, I think it would be very useful if the member's questions were based on facts. Blair that I actually have watched the video a couple of times, and he specifically states that the AR-15 was used in mass killings in Canada, yet he has yet to provide one. Out of the recently banned firearms on May 1, how many have been or are still currently in use by the Canadian Armed Forces? hon. bill blair: That's an excellent question, Madam Chair, because it's very important to provide Canadians with clarity. I asked him a question on whether any of them is being or ever has been used in the Canadian Armed Forces. Are any of the recently banned firearms still in use, or have they ever been in use, in any military in the world? hon. bill blair: Madam Chair, I think it's important to also recognize that the basic origin, the provenance of the weapons that we have prohibited, was in their original design. As I've said previously, they were designed for soldiers to use in combat to kill other soldiers. alex ruff: As someone who has used many military-style firearms and who is actually involved in helping define what we purchase in the military, I would use none of the ones that are currently prohibited. Can he please confirm whether Veterans Affairs has a plan to address the claims backlog, yes or no? hon. lawrence macaulay (minister of veterans affairs): Madam Chair, I appreciate my honourable colleague's question, and yes, we've indicated that it's a major priority. That's why I'm so pleased that the supplementary estimates contained just under $90 million to address hiring more staff, improving the process and making sure that we attack the backlog in an appropriate manner. lawrence macaulay: Well, Madam Chair, I can assure you that it's in the supplementary estimates, and of course, this money is the acting chair (mrs. lawrence macaulay: Madam Chair, I can tell my honourable colleague that the money is in the supplementary estimates, and with the money we're able to attack this problem in an appropriate manner, and that's what is important for our veterans. alex ruff: The deputy minister committed on March 10 that a written plan would be provided to the Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs within a month and made public. lawrence macaulay: Madame Chair, I'm sure my honourable colleague wants an appropriate plan and he would be fully aware this just under $90 million would make a big difference in the plan to attack the backlog. Therefore, my question is, if the deputy minister in the department provided him with an appropriate plan or a written plan, why is he questioning how appropriate that plan is? I have complete confidence in the deputy minister's ability to produce a written plan. lawrence macaulay: I can assure my honourable colleague that with the appropriate funding, we will address the backlog in Veterans Affairs. carol hughes): We will go now to the honourable member for Parry SoundMuskoka, Mr. Three weeks ago, I asked this government if the finance minister would meet with the beleaguered summer camp sector. Summer camps, which are a social and economic mainstay in Parry SoundMuskoka and all of northern Ontario, have been crippled by the global pandemic. Aside from a brief follow-up conversation over the phone with the junior minister, there has still been no action from this government. ahmed hussen: Madam Chair, I recognize the honourable member's important question and his focus on summer camps. We will continue to engage with them, as we have, to ensure and find ways in which we can get their feedback and find ways in which we can support them. That work is ongoing, and I assure the honourable member that our focus is on the kids and on ensuring that they have access to summer camps for this year. The summer camps association has given lots of feedback and my office has given lots of feedback, so I don't see what's confusing about this. However, I've become accustomed to not really getting answers to questions, so I will go to the next one. The Ontario government's regional reopening plan permits cruise boats to resume on Georgian Bay, yet the federal government is refusing to allow these vessels to operate until July 1. Therefore, small businesses such as the Island Queen cruiser in Parry Sound, which has only a very few precious weeks to operate in the first place, is losing yet another two weeks because of federal inaction. Will the Minister of Transport take a regional approach himself by lifting the federal ban on Georgian Bay, just like the Province of Ontario has done? the acting chair (mrs. There have been a number of very important discussions with the provinces, in particular with the Province of Ontario, around provisions regarding pleasure craft. We're working very closely with our provincial counterparts to address this issue, but we want to ensure that it will be done safely. scott aitchison: Madam Chair, I actually gave the minister a heads-up that I would be asking that question. He sent me an email today saying he was not going to be able to be in the House, and it's great of him to do that. He said that whoever was going to fill in for him would have an answer, but again, that was not really an answer. The next issue I would like to bring this government's attention to is the deplorable state of rural Internet service in Parry SoundMuskoka. Quite simply, there are too many gaps in service, and what is available is generally way too expensive. We have families trying to work and teach their kids from home on unreliable and outrageously expensive Internet service, and we have too many small businesses that either cannot access or afford reliable Internet services. Today Greg Rickford, the Ontario energy minister, and Laurie Scott, Ontario Minister of Infrastructure, announced $2.3 million for seven northern Ontario broadband projects. Minister, will when your government get serious and become a reliable partner for the Government of Ontario and the private sector to deliver this crucial modern-day infrastructure to rural Canadians? the acting chair (mrs. carol hughes): I remind the member that he needs to address the questions and comments to the chair. maryam monsef (minister for women and gender equality and rural economic development): Madam Chair, in the best of times, life without access to high-speed Internet is hard. Our government's unprecedented investments are already connecting a million more Canadian households to this essential service, but until we achieve universal access our work is not done. We will work with our partners, including provinces across the country, to connect every Canadian household to high-quality Internet access that is affordable and reliable. I'm wondering, then, Madam Chair, since the Province of Ontario has used the Northern Ontario Heritage Corporation Fund to make this announcement, what about using FedNor to make the same kind of announcement, and partner with the province? the acting chair (mrs. mlanie joly: Obviously we believe in the importance of northern Ontario; that's why we nearly doubled the budget of FedNor. We will continue to invest in businesses and people all around Parry Sound, Muskoka and northern Ontario. If my colleague has specific projects in mind, please come and see me and let's have a conversation. carol hughes): The honourable member for Montmagny-L'Islet-KamouraskaRivire-du-Loup, Mr.Gnreux, has the floor. bernard gnreux (montmagnyl'isletkamouraskarivire-du-loup, cpc): Thank you, MadamChair. During this pandemic, we are realizing the extent to which reliable high-speed Internet service is needed for Canada's economy. There are still places where telework is not possible today because of the lack of adequate coverage. Benot Pilotto, who is the mayor of Saint-Onsime-d'Ixworth, in my riding, wrote to me a few days ago. That is why I am asking you what concrete results the government plans to achieve for our rural areas by the end of the year. maryam monsef: At the best of times, life without high-speed Internet access is difficult. bernard gnreux: MadamChair, I am simply asking the minister to tell me when the mayor of Saint-Onsime-d'Ixworth will be able to tell his residents when the Internet will be available in his municipality. What does the government plan to do so that rural municipalities across Canada can have access to the Internet as soon as possible? What is its plan? hon. maryam monsef: We are working with partners across the country to ensure that every Canadian household is connected to a high-quality, accessible and affordable high-speed Internet service.  Madam Chair, I assure my colleagues that we share the same goal, and we will work with all our partners across the country to ensure every Canadian household has access the acting chair (mrs. According to the government's plan, when will rural Canadian businesses and households be connected? the acting chair (mrs. maryam monsef: Madam Chair, those plans are under way, and we will have more to share in the coming days. bernard gnreux: It seems that the Minister of Rural Economic Development plans to announce a new plan this week. Can she tell us how this program will differ from the Connect to Innovate program, which is already in place? Can the minister tell us whether her program will solve the problem of the 25square kilometre hexagonal zones, which unfortunately make many projects ineligible for the CRTC's broadband fund? hon. maryam monsef: Madam Chair, I'm pleased to share with my colleague that the model he's referring to, the hexagon model, is no more. bernard gnreux: MadamChair, this year, the Canada summer jobs program is a real fiasco. On May13, 100jobs were announced in my riding; on May20, 16jobs were announced; on May27, 13jobs were announced; on June3, 12jobs were announced; and on June10, only one job was announced. Can we have an announcement, once and for all? Let's stop the piecemeal announcements and finally confirm the remaining jobs today so that our organizations can have young people before the summer starts on the weekend. We recognize the important role that the Canada summer jobs program is playing in supporting employers and young workers in communities right across the country. Our government is working very hard to help employers adapt to the realities of the COVID-19 pandemic, and at the same time is supporting young Canadians as they begin to look for summer employment. We've introduced flexibilities into the program to ensure that more young workers have opportunities to get employed. The honourable member also has to understand that we're in the COVID-19 pandemic, and as such it will take some time for businesses to equip themselves to hire students. Addiction is a health and social issue, but criminalization creates stigma, so people hide their drug use and die alone. Access to a safe supply of drugs and safe injection sites saves lives and puts addicts in daily contact with people who can help them. Will this government end the war on drugs by decriminalizing them, providing a safe supply and reallocating resources from policing addicts to providing treatment for them? hon. patty hajdu: Madam Chair, I think it's really important we make sure that when we speak about people who use substances, we remove stigmatizing language like the word addict. We can stand together, as this government has, with people who use substances and their families to ensure a range of options for people who are struggling with addiction, who are using substances in a way that is harming their health and their communities. Madam Chair, we're working with communities to make sure there are more community-based approaches to treating the acting chair (mrs. paul manly: Madam Chair, the Geneva Convention considers both tear gas and pepper spray to be chemical weapons and prohibits their use in war, yet our police forces use these weapons on Canadian civilians. Will the government prohibit the use of these weapons and require police to use de-escalation techniques to keep legal protests peaceful? hon. bill blair: Madam Chair, the right to peaceful protest in this country is a constitutionally protected right. At the same time, Madam Chair, we recognize that the use of even less than lethal force can have significant impacts on people's safety. It's prohibited for non-police use, and for the police it is and should be highly regulated. paul manly: Madam Chair, in 2012 the RCMP spent $14 million on 18 armoured personnel carriers. Will the government rein in the RCMP budget and end wasteful spending on militarizing our civilian police forces? hon. bill blair: Madam Chair, it's a very important tradition that our Canadian police are not militarized. At the same time, we've seen a number of tragedies when police have responded to situations in which people were armed with weapons designed for soldiers to kill soldiers, and they've been used to kill police officers. The militarization of our society, so strongly promoted by some, is the direct consequence of the militarization of the police. As we remove these weapons from our society and prohibit them, we'll make it safer for everyone and we can then move away from such a model of policing. paul manly: Madam Chair, the government spent $4.5 billion to buy an old, leaky pipeline. How much is this spill going to cost Canadian taxpayers to clean up? How much contingency funding has been budgeted to repair the environmental destruction from spills? hon. navdeep bains: Madam Chair, I want to thank the honourable colleague for his question. He full well knows that the acquisition that we made with regard to the TMX initiative is a reflection of the fact that we want this initiative to move forward in a sustainable manner and in a manner that protects the environment. I'll continue to work with my colleagues to endeavour to make sure that we have the appropriate processes in place to protect the environment and at the same time create good-quality, middle-class jobs for Canadians. carol hughes): The honourable member for RosemontLa PetitePatrie, Mr.Boulerice, has the floor. alexandre boulerice (rosemontla petite-patrie, ndp): Thank you, MadamChair. In Montreal, the city and the police department have recognized this, and measures will be put in place. Although it spends $10million a day, we see no attempt to reform or change the RCMP. If the Prime Minister really wants to act, why is he delaying the action plan in response to the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls? hon. bill blair: Let me assure this House and the member opposite that we're not dragging our feet. Indigenous people, black Canadians and other racialized people are far too often experiencing systemic racism and disparate outcomes through the criminal justice system. It's incumbent upon all of us who work within the criminal justice system to take the steps and actions necessary to produce more equitable outcomes. All police services, including the RCMP, must be committed to ensuring that the people they're sworn to serve and protect are always treated with dignity and respect. alexandre boulerice: MadamChair, why are the Liberals taking indigenous children to court to challenge the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruling in their favour? hon. marc miller (minister of indigenous services): Madam Chair, as the honourable member knows full well, a number of cases are pending, and we are currently negotiating with the parties. We are making progress, and I would be delighted to tell the member and the House about it in response to a later question. alexandre boulerice: We've been asking questions about it for months, and as I see it, we should keep doing so. The Prime Minister's new pipeline, which taxpayers were forced to buy with their hard-earned money, has leaked. Some 190,000litres of oil spilled, and we can't even make the company pay for it because the Liberals bought the pipeline. Trans-Mountain, KeystoneXL and the resumption of gas exploration and development off the coast of Newfoundland and Labradorare these the projects the Liberals had in mind for their green recovery? hon. Our priority was to protect the health and safety of Canadians throughout the pandemic, especially when it comes to the environment. That's why environmental and climate change laws aimed at protecting the environment, human health and conservation will remain in force. Unions, associations, artists and creators have all taken part in public demonstrations recently to condemn the lack of a specific plan for the living arts, performing arts and festival sector. alexandre boulerice: Well, that wasn't at all what the artists and creators who were out demonstrating in the streets a few days ago thought. The CERB extension announced by the government only brings us to September, but the cultural community is expecting the worst in the fall. steven guilbeault: I'm not so sure those who were protesting last week had issues with our government, but we'd certainly be happy to speak with them. As for a long-term plan, we are currently consulting arts and culture stakeholders to contemplate together how the government can help the sector in response to the ongoing crisis. We are working on finding solutions, but until we have long-term solutions, we have seen to it that our artists and organizations have access to funding until September. carol hughes): The honourable member for BeauportLimoilou, Mrs.Vignola, has the floor. julie vignola (beauportlimoilou, bq): Madam Chair, I will be sharing my time with the member for Montcalm. According to the latest news, Seaspan Shipyards will be spending an additional $1.5billion to build two ships. anita anand (minister of public services and procurement): I'd like to thank the member for her question. Davie is certainly a strong and trusted partner that works very hard to help our government get results for Canadians. Building a new class of ships is highly complex, and it's not unusual for cost estimates to change throughout the procurement project. It's important to make sure additional funding is available for the joint support ships project to ensure the navy's vessels are delivered. In the beginning, eight years ago, the project was supposed to cost $2.6billion. Why haven't the ships been delivered yet? Why is Davie still not seen as a trusted partner? the acting chair (mrs. anita anand: Once again, I would point out that building a new class of ships is highly complex, and it's not unusual for the cost estimate to change for a procurement project as large as this one. carol hughes): It is now over to the honourable member for Montcalm, Mr.Thriault. luc thriault (montcalm, bq): Madam Chair, in Quebec, 12,000people have begun their training to work in residential and long-term care centres. The dedication of the members of the armed forces is paramount, and I want to extend my heartfelt thanks. What does the army have to do right now that is more important than helping our caregivers save lives? hon. pablo rodriguez: Madam Chair, I'm glad my fellow member recognizes the fundamental role the men and women of the Canadian Armed Forces have played and continue to play in residential and long-term care centres and many other areas in support of our seniors. luc thriault: We are short 12,000people, so if the Red Cross wants to help us, all the better. I repeat my question: What does the army have to do 10days from now that is more important if it's not to help caregivers save lives? hon. The people at the Canadian Red Cross are well-trained paid workers who can perform the same work in partnership with the members of the armed forces, who can stay in Quebec as well. Right now, we are working with the Quebec government and discussing how we can keep the measure in place until September15. What does the army have to do that is more important than helping caregivers save the lives of those who built Quebec? the acting chair (mrs. carol hughes): The Leader of the Government in the House of Commons is asked to keep his answer brief. pablo rodriguez: Madam Chair, the Government of Canada is there and will continue to be there to help the people who built Quebec. Madam Chair, on May 14 I asked the Minister of Agriculture when the Liberal government would put aside its usual campaign rhetoric and recognize the very detrimental impact the carbon tax is having on farmers across this country. Minister Bibeau proudly noted that according to their data, the average cost of the carbon tax per farm across Canada is $210 to $819. The fact is that the Liberal government's own Parliamentary Budget Officer has estimated that at $25 per tonne, the cost for an 855-acre crop farm in Alberta is well over $6,000. When will this Liberal government come clean with Canadians and recognize the disastrous impact the carbon tax is having on Canada's critical agriculture and agri-food sector? hon. marie-claude bibeau (minister of agriculture and agri-food): Madam Chair, our pollution pricing policy is designed to grow a clean economy. Farm fuels and fuels from cardlock facilities are exempt, and there is a partial rebate for propane and natural gas used in commercial greenhouses. We will do a review of our pollution pricing system in 2020, focused on competitiveness issues in trade-exposed industries such as agriculture. It is also important to remember that this is about tackling climate change and that 100% of the revenues stay in the province. earl dreeshen: Madam Chair, Minister Bibeau keeps talking about wanting to protect Canadians' environment. Well, the truth is that Canada's farmers, ranchers and processors have for years demonstrated their ability to deliver meaningful reductions in emissions and to safeguard the environment through the adoption of new technologies, education and innovative management practices, but the government ignores these efforts. Will the minister at the very least admit to Canadians that Canadian farmers are unable to pass on the cost of the carbon tax to consumers and instead have to absorb those extra costs out of their own pockets? hon. marie-claude bibeau: Madam Chair, allow me to explain again our government's position on pollution pricing. Madam Chair, Minister Bibeau has repeatedly asked stakeholders to send her data about the impacts of the carbon tax on farmers, so this is exactly what they have been doing. The Atlantic Grains Council, the Grain Farmers of Ontario, Producteurs de grains du Qubec and the Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association issued a joint statement at the beginning of this year in which they estimated that the cumulative indirect inflation of carbon tax on farm costs will be $14.50 an acre this year, with that cost escalating by more than double by 2022 to almost $30 an acre. Why does the Liberal government continue to ignore the facts presented to it and continue to misrepresent the truth to Canadians? hon. marie-claude bibeau: Madame Chair, I can assure you that we have paid close attention to all the information that has been provided to us and that our calculation was also based on this information provided by provinces and different stakeholders. Marie-Claude Bibeau:as well as the 2019 agricultural tax data to estimate the average cost of pollution pricing associated with grain drying at up to 0.4% of overall operating costs. Dreeshen, I am watching the time, and the minister is allowed to answer for the same amount of time that you used to ask the question"

        "Query": "Summarize the discussions and debates surrounding the government's response to Covid-19, including the delay, companies laying off workers, transparency of information, contact tracing apps, and eligibility for art funding.",
        "Summary": "The Prime Minister responded to the opposition party's concerns by highlighting the government's swift implementation of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and their support for small businesses through the Canada Emergency Business Account. However, the opposition party expressed dissatisfaction, believing that the government did not reach out to enough businesses. They also criticized the rigidity and difficulty of the rent relief program. The Prime Minister reiterated that the government's priority has always been to support workers in need and prevent job losses across all organizations and companies. The Minister of Canadian Heritage emphasized the government's commitment to transparency during the crisis, but the opposition party questioned the allocation of $35 billion in infrastructure funds, suspecting that it may have been used for personal salaries. The government assured that they have been actively exploring ways to enhance contact tracing capabilities in collaboration with provinces, territories, and volunteer organizations, while also addressing concerns raised by the Privacy Commissioner regarding privacy and ethical considerations. Additionally, the Minister of Canadian Heritage announced a funding of $500 million to support Canada's arts, sports, and cultural sectors, with further details to be released in the coming days.",

In order to ensure that those joining the meeting via video conference can be seen and heard by those in the chamber, two screens have been set up on either side of the Speaker's chair, and members in the chamber can listen to the floor audio or to interpretation using their earpiece at their desk. Before speaking, please wait until I recognize you by name, and please direct your remarks through the chair. For those joining via video conference, I would like to remind you to leave your mike on mute when you are not speaking. Also, please note that if you want to speak in English, you should be on the English channel. Should you wish to alternate between the two languages, you should change the channel to the language that you are speaking each time you switch languages. Should members participating by video conference need to request the floor outside their designated speaking times, they should activate their mic and state that they have a point of order. Please note that today's proceedings will be televised in the same way as a typical sitting of the House. Chair, I have the honour to table, in both official languages, a report entitled \"Democracy Matters, Debates Count: A report on the 2019 Leaders' Debates Commission and the future of debates in Canada. Chair, on behalf of all of us, I want to thank the Right Honourable David Johnston for his continued service. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. For members participating in person, we ask that you please come to the front and drop off your certificate at the table once the petition has been presented. It would make it a criminal offence for a person to go abroad and receive an organ for which there has not been consent by the donor. It also creates a mechanism by which someone could be deemed inadmissible to Canada if they were involved in organ harvesting and trafficking. This bill is designed to confront and address the horrific practice by which, in certain casesfor instance, inside Chinaminority communities or dissidents may be targeted and have their organs removed as they're killed and used for transplantation. Petitioners are supportive of Bill S-204, and they want to see it passed as soon as possible. Chair, I am presenting a petition today signed by Canadians who are concerned that Bill C-7 removes safeguards from the current euthanasia regime, including the mandatory 10-day waiting period. Chair, these people who are signing this petition would like to see an improvement in assisted living, not assisted dying. It asks that the Government of Canada recognize the Republic of Somaliland as an autonomous state that may result in foreign investments, direct access of development aid, foreign aid for disaster relief and infrastructure development investment loans. fayal el-khoury (lavalles les, lib.): Mr.Chair, I thank the government for the way it has managed this global crisis and its impact on Canadians. Canada is one of the few countries that has acted in the best interests of its citizens and maintained their dignity in these uncertain times. While addressing Canadians, our right honourable Prime Minister showed us leadership, the importance of transparency, and integrity. His top priority was saving lives, along with finding realistic solutions regarding the economic impact on our daily life. Because of his outstanding leadership, we're admired across the world, which is another distinguished privilege of being Canadian. dave epp (chatham-kentleamington, cpc): COVID-19 has emptied food banks across Canada, even in an agricultural community like Chatham-Kent, so Wes Thompson and James Rasmussen, along with Alysson Storey, Randi Bokor, Maureen Geddes, Chris and Terry Johnston, Jason King, Fannie Vavoulis and Brent Wilken, grew an idea into the community's largest-ever food drive. Project manager Morna McDonald estimates that over 3,000 volunteers ended up helping in the May 16 Miracle. Residents put non-perishable foodstuffs on their doorsteps, with drop-off centres organized for rural areas. They accidentally exceeded by over 20% the record in the Guinness World Records book for collected food in a single day. chris d'entremont (west nova, cpc): As much as I like seeing my friends on the big screens, there are no big screens yet, so we don't know who's on and who's not on. Here in Surrey Centre, and across Canada, the Filipino community makes important contributions to our cities and has helped shape Canada into the vibrant multicultural society that we all know and love today. Now more than ever, during these challenging times we must come together as Canadians to celebrate the rich heritage and history of our Filipino neighbours. Throughout June, please join me in celebrating our fellow citizens of Filipino descent by recognizing all the incredible ways in which they have contributed to making Canada a better place for all of us. yves perron (berthiermaskinong, bq): Good afternoon, Mr.Chair. Today is World Milk Day, and I would like to recognize the exceptional work and dedication shown by everyone in the industry. Let's take part in the local consumption movement and rediscover the exceptional products of our dairy producers and processors. Enjoy the yogurts, cheeses and other products because it's true that milk is good. I would also like to thank BrunoLetendre, outgoing chair of the Producteurs de lait du Qubec, and I congratulate the new chair, DanielGobeil. The first step must be the direct allocation of import quotas to processors, and the second must be the full payment of the promised compensation. angelo iacono (alfred-pellan, lib.): Mr.Chair, June is Italian Heritage Month. The situation is special this year, since Italy has been hard hit by COVID-19, with more than 30,000deaths. Like me, many Italian Canadians still have family and friends in Italy, and the news has sometimes been very difficult to take, yet that has not detracted from the great co-operation that exists between Canada and Italy. During the pandemic, Canadians of Italian descent have been united to support anziani, our famiglie and our amici in Italy by participating in the fundraising campaign COVID-19 AiutiAMO lItalia to support the Italian Red Cross response activities. I send a special salute to to my cugino Giuseppe, who is still on the road to recovery from COVID-19. Chair, I would like to acknowledge all of the organizations in Saskatchewan and across Canada that are working hard to help small businesses adapt to the challenges of the current pandemic. As soon as the pandemic hit, RDBID launched a daily electronic newsletter to keep their members informed of support programs, local initiatives and local success stories. They have used their social media channels on a daily basis to promote takeout and delivery services, online and curbside services offered by restaurants and retailers. Through persistent communication and a lot of long hours, RDBID has helped businesses in downtown Regina to weather the storm. stphane lauzon (argenteuilla petite-nation, lib.): Mr.Chair, high-speed Internet will be to the 21stcentury what electricity was to the 20th: an essential service. I would like to reassure the citizens of my riding about the efforts that we are making as a government, but also about the work I've been doing as a member of Parliament since2015 to connect the 41municipalities of ArgenteuilLa Petite-Nation. Aside from this essential service, our students, seniors, entrepreneurs and telework are very important to the regions. We have heard you, and I will continue to fight for you, so that you can have access to affordable high-speed Internet. Chair, a few days ago, we all watched with horror and outrage the death of an unarmed black man at the hands of the police in Minneapolis. For many of us, these images may seem shocking, but it's an all too familiar tale to millions of black people not only in the United States but also here in Canada, in my city of Gatineau and around the world, who must at times live with the scourge of anti-black racism.  Mr.Chair, I can't know what it's like to be black in our society. What I do know, however, is that you and I, and everyone in this House, have the power and the responsibility to make our country more just. Black Canadians and all those who have to endure racism and discrimination are watching us, and they expect more from us. eric duncan (stormontdundassouth glengarry, cpc): Without a doubt, these past few months have been challenging, to say the least, from both a health and economic perspective, but, Mr. Chair, I have to say how proud I am of my community of StormontDundasSouth Glengarry. We continue to successfully flatten the curve in our region and, just as importantly, we are making sure that we are here for each other, whether it is the Cornwall Optimists' GoFeedMe campaign, the Iroquois-Matilda Lions Club delivering groceries to those who are quarantined in their households or the local United Way, the Social Development Council or the Carefor seniors support centre co-leading an effort to deliver 1,500 baskets to seniors in need. I rise today in the House of Commons to say thank you to my constituents and to all Canadians; to our essential front-line workers, our service clubs and our businesses that have stepped up to help out; and to everybody playing their part to get us through this challenge. I couldn't be more proud of my community and my residents, and it is an honour to serve as their member of Parliament. Chair, although Asian Heritage Month has just passed, we recognize the tremendous effort of all Asian Canadians on the front lines of this pandemic, as health care providers or as essential workers. I want to thank the many Asian organizations for donating to ScarboroughAgincourt's hospital, long-term care homes and food banks. As a Canadian born and raised in Scarborough, I'm offended by the reports of violence and vandalism targeting Asian-Canadian communities across this country. In budget 2019 we invested $45 million to launch a new anti-racism strategy, which included the establishment of the anti-racism secretariat, because these efforts are unfortunately clearly still needed. As events continue to unfold in the United States, it is important to recognize that we have work to do here as well. Whether it is anti-black or anti-Asian, racism and discrimination of any kind have no place in Canadafull stop. richard bragdon (tobiquemactaquac, cpc): Thank you, Mr. Over the last few months, Canadians throughout New Brunswick and across the country have stepped up to support their community. Health care workers, truckers, farmers, business owners, pharmacists, grocery store staff, faith-based and non-profit organizations and so many others have all answered the call to do their part. Chair, I would like to specifically highlight the work of those who support and take care of our seniors, who are among some of our most at-risk citizens. It has been said that the character of a nation and its people is revealed most in how they treat their most vulnerable. Whether they be long-term care staff, personal care workers, health care professionals, family members or volunteers, thank you for all you are doing in support of our seniors. Although we've come to the end of Asian Heritage Month, I'd like to acknowledge some unsung Chinese Canadian heroes who shed their blood as patriots for our nation. I commemorate the 6,500 Chinese Canadians of the 9,000 railway workers who helped build and unite Canada. I pay respect to the many Chinese Canadians who died while building the CP Railway on the most dangerous terrains in the B.C. Adult children should not have to call their elderly parents to tell them to stay home because they might be attacked by racists. There's no justification for racial slurs, physical violence or vandalism against any individual or community. I will continue to work together with other elected officials, the police and the RCMP to mitigate these issues toward justice and restoration. charlie angus (timminsjames bay, ndp): Ten years ago today, Cree youth leader Shannen Koostachin was killed in a horrific car accident. She was only 15 years old, yet in her short life she became the voice of a generation of first nation youth who were no longer willing to put up with systemic discrimination. Shannen never lived to see the school that was built in her community, but her work carries on through the Shannen's Dream movement. xavier barsalou-duval (pierre-boucherles patriotesverchres, bq): Mr.Chair, for months now, thousands of consumers who need money to pay their bills have been fighting against airlines and the government to have their rights respected: three class action suits, a unanimous motion by the National Assembly and over 30,000signatures on a petition calling for reimbursement for cancelled flights. Air Canada, which confiscated $2.6billion from its customers, received more than $800million from Ottawa without any conditions. Yet, the company has a year's worth of cash in reserve, $6billion in its coffers, and is in the process of raising more than $1.4billion in the financial markets. alain rayes (richmondarthabaska, cpc): Mr.Chair, I want to pay tribute to a great man who represented the public here, in the House, for close to 15years: MichelGauthier. Michel, in life, we meet a lot of people, but some of them leave their mark on us forever. From the first time I spoke with you two years ago, I immediately understood that I was talking with a man with heart, a passionate man, a man who had Quebec imprinted on his heart. Because of your decision to join the Conservative Party of Canada, I got to know you personally, and I am most grateful. I will remember all the passion and energy you had in the lead-up to a speech to our supporters. Michel, Canadians, Quebeckers and I will remember you forever, the great man you were, the outstanding speaker, a formidable parliamentarian, with integrity, passion, commitment and love for Quebec. emmanuel dubourg (bourassa, lib.): Mr.Chair, the murder of GeorgeFloyd in Minneapolis resonated strongly within black communities in Canada and also in the heart of Montreal North. At a time of pandemic uncertainty when members of our community find themselves on the front lines as essential workers, an event like this rekindles feelings of fear, powerlessness and injustice. It has happened once again in the UnitedStates, but we are not immune to such behaviour here, in Canada. Dear constituents of Bourassa, I know our stories, I feel with you the pain as a parent and as a black person.  There seems to be some interference when you watch the video conference in the chamber and it's being transmitted, so let us make things run more smoothly. Please note that we will suspend the proceedings every 45minutes in order to allow employees who provide support for the sitting to replace each other safely. When the government first starting rolling out programs to help Canadians get through this pandemic, we raised points about some flaws and gaps in the program. Well, Canadians are suffering through both the health and the economic consequences of the lockdown related to the coronavirus. Here we are the first day of June and the government still has yet to address the flaws in its programs; it is still letting so many Canadians down. On April 20 we raised with the Minister of Finance the issue of companies that had purchased another company not being able to demonstrate revenue loss, and therefore not being eligible for the wage subsidy, even though both companies separately would have been able to do just that. I would like to ask the government when it will be fixing this unnecessarily rigid aspect of the wage subsidy program. chrystia freeland (deputy prime minister and minister of intergovernmental affairs): Mr. Chair, I believe that a company with a fantastic Canadian history in the member's riding, Brandt Tractor, which pioneered the manufacturing of augers in Canada, is particularly affected by this. I know that in the case of Brandt Tractor, for example, officials from the Ministry of Finance are directly in touch with the company to work on its issues. It's the same answer we got two weeks before that, and it's the same answer we have been getting from day one. This is a very specific question: Will the government fix this program and allow for companies that have acquired another company to still access the wage subsidy program? hon. Chair, let me just point out that the wage subsidy program is working extremely well for many, many Canadian companies and for many, many Canadians who are able to keep their jobs thanks to the program. Now, for sure there are always going to be companies which, because of specifics in their history, need specific attention, and that the chair: We'll go back to Mr. Chair, reports indicate that up to half of the money allocated for the wage subsidy is going unspent, precisely because this government has left in unnecessarily rigid barriers for companies to be able to access it. It's a yes-or-no question, and the minister still can't answer it. Along the same lines, we asked on April 8 to allow businesses applying for the wage subsidy to demonstrate their 30% revenue loss using other metrics, such as loss of earnings, subscriptions and orders, in order to qualify. Chair, we are very proud of the wage subsidy program and proud of the role it is playing to keep Canadian businesses going and, crucially, to keep Canadian workers connected to their jobs, but I have a question for the member opposite. Half of the questions we hear from the Conservatives in question period are concerns that we're spending too much money, that the deficit is too high. We believe that when times were good, this government should have paid down debt instead of wasting money like $50 million to Mastercard and $12 million to Loblaws. The fact of the matter is that the government left Canadians in a vulnerable position as we were entering this pandemic precisely because of its fiscal irresponsibility, and now they have designed programs that have unnecessary barriers in them that prevent more and more Canadians from getting the help they need. Again, on April 26, Conservatives asked the Prime Minister to change the criteria for the Canada emergency business account so that small businesses that don't happen to have a business bank account can qualify. Chair, I'm really grateful for that question because it allows me to set the record straight for Canadians. Canadians need to know that our country has the lowest debt-to-GDP ratio in the G7. Canada has the fiscal firepower to support Canadians during this unprecedented crisis, and that is what we are going to continue to do. claude debellefeuille (salaberrysurot, bq): Mr.Chair, the wage subsidy was put in place to support businesses and SMEs, to avoid closures and bankruptcy. Have I missed something? Is the Liberal Party on the verge of bankruptcy? Is it about to shut down? Does the Prime Minister consider that the Liberal Party is getting ready to close its doors? hon. More than 2million Canadians have benefited from this the chair: Mrs.DeBellefeuille, you have the floor. claude debellefeuille: Mr.Chair, the Liberal Party made $3million between January and March of this year. I'm wondering why the Liberal Party doesn't use its own money to pay its own employees instead of using the Canada emergency wage subsidy. I would like to point out again that the purpose of the Canada emergency wage subsidy is to support workers across Canada and Quebec, to help them keep their jobs and allow them to stay connected to their workplace. claude debellefeuille: Mr.Chair, does the Deputy Prime Minister think it is moral, fair and honest that employees who have lost their jobs are subsidizing an emergency wage subsidy for the Liberal Party of Canada out of their taxes? hon. There is still a lot to do, but we want to work with all the the chair: Mrs.DeBellefeuille. claude debellefeuille: Mr.Chair, many struggling businesses in Quebec don't have access to the Canada emergency wage subsidy because they don't meet the eligibility criteria. Does the Deputy Prime Minister really think it's moral for her party to benefit from the emergency wage subsidy when it has the financial means to pay its own employees? hon. However, it's important to point out that our government has already done a lot to support Canadians. More than eightmillion people are benefiting from the CERB, and more than twomillion the chair: Mrs.DeBellefeuille, you have the floor. claude debellefeuille: Mr.Chair, what I understand is not really complicated to understand. I understand that the Liberal Party has money, that it has money to pay its employees, but that it doesn't want to cut the booty it has amassed for the next election. It's as if it were telling us that it's indirectly financing itself for the next election. Will the Deputy Prime Minister show some leadership and convince her own party to give up the emergency wage subsidy and even commit to paying back the money it has already received? hon. chrystia freeland: Mr.Chair, I want to point out that our programs do not discriminate. They are there to help all workers across the country, and I want to point out to what extent our programs do that. Eight million people are currently benefiting from the CERB, and two million are supported by the emergency wage subsidy. Our programs are also helping 380,000students and 639,000businesses the chair: We'll now continue with Mr. Canadians and people across the world are reeling after seeing the images of George Floyd being brutally killed in a callous and casual manner. Anti-black racism also impacts Canada, and people here are feeling the frustration of black lives being neglected and ignored. Will the government commit to tracking race-based data in terms of COVID-19's impact on communities, particularly black Canadians, and track race-based data so that we can have a better response based on the evidence? hon. Chair, I would like to start by thanking the member opposite for his very important question and the very important work he has done throughout his career in drawing attention to racism in Canada and in fighting against it. I agree strongly with the member opposite that we, as Canadians, must be the opposite of complacent. We have to acknowledge that anti-black racism is real in our country, that unconscious bias is real in our country and that systemic discrimination is real. I have more to say about disaggregated data and the coronavirus, and I hope I'll have a chance to do that in my next answer. Will the government commit to working with provinces to ensure there are no such practices allowed to exist in Canada, particularly related to discriminatory police practices like carding? Will the federal government work and use its powers to end those discriminatory practices where federal regulation applies, and work with the provinces to ensure this happens across the country? hon. First of all, on coronavirus, our government believes that disaggregated data, including when it comes to race, is extremely important. We will always work to uphold the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and to ensure the human rights of everyone in Canada are protected. At the federal level, RCMP members are guided by bias-free policing based on equality and non-discrimination. How many times did the Prime Minister's Office and the Liberal government meet with lobbyists from for-profit long-term care homes from March 25 to April 22, during the worst impacts of COVID-19 in long-term care homes? hon. Chair, at this moment I can only speak for myself, and I have not met with any such lobbyists during that period or at other times. While seniors were dying in long-term care homes, the Prime Minister's Office and the Liberal government met with private, for-profit long-term care home lobbyists 12 times. Why did the Prime Minister's Office and the Liberal government choose to meet with these for-profit long-term care home lobbyists instead of meeting with those to solve the problem? Instead of making excuses about the federal government not playing a role, why didn't the Prime Minister and the Liberal government show leadership in calling for an end to profit in long-term care homes? hon. chrystia freeland: Let me very clear about one thing, speaking on behalf of our government and on behalf of the Prime Minister. Our government sees as a matter of utmost concern and utmost urgency what has been happening in long-term care homes in our country, and the reports we have received from the brave men and women of the Canadian Armed Forces about facilities in Ontario and Quebec need to be treated as historic documents that the chair: Now it's Mr.Rayes's turn. alain rayes: Mr.Chair, why is it that employers from industry, businesses and community organizations that have been approved in the Canada summer jobs program still haven't received the money they're entitled to? hon. ahmed hussen (minister of families, children and social development): We are ensuring that the Canada summer jobs program is strengthened and enforced. We have lengthened the time period that the program the chair: Mr.Rayes has the floor. Given the importance of the program for our youth who are looking to work, how is it that the organizations haven't yet received the money they need to hire students? As we know, there have been some problems with the CESB. ahmed hussen: Our government is working hard to help employers adapt to the realities of COVID-19. We recognize the important role that the Canada summer jobs program plays in supporting employers and young workers in communities across the country every year. That is why we have introduced flexibilities in the Canada summer jobs program to hire youth while providing more supports to employers. Last year, there was no crisis and, as of April, all employers who had been admitted to the program had received the money. Right now, community organizations are not receiving the money to which they are entitled to hire students, to put them to work and to give them an employment opportunity. Chair, we have managed to introduce flexibilities to take into consideration the difficult environment of the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, the flexibilities we've introduced into the Canada summer jobs program will help with more hiring of youth and more supports to employers, including non-profits and businesses that deliver essential services to Canadians. These changes will help small businesses hire and keep the workers that they need in the Canada summer jobs program. alain rayes: The young people and employers listening to us must be very surprised by what the minister is saying. Right now, there is a $240,000shortfall for about 60student jobs, and the minister has the nerve to tell us that the government has provided more flexibility. Why is the money not available if the government wants to act quickly, to help the economy recover and to help young people? hon. We are listening to the needs of the employers to make sure that this program works not only for them but also for youth, and that it gives them the experiences they need. It is adapted better for the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure that youth have the experience they need to gain life and work skills from the program. It's a great program, and we're making it work not just for businesses but also for non-profits. Last week, the owner of a hardware store in a village in my riding had to close his business because he was unable to hire students and had no one to work. This morning, an employer called me to tell me that his request to hire a student had been accepted, but that the delay meant that he could not proceed with the hiring. When is the government going to release the money required for young people to be able to work? hon. Chair, I join the honourable member in recognizing that in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic there are some difficulties in terms of structuring the program and making sure that employers are able to access it. That is why we've introduced flexibilities to ensure that employers are able to access the program and that youth are also able to take advantage of the program to gain important work skills, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and especially in providing essential services that serve their fellow Canadians. By its own numbers, PSPC has had to cut the number of N95 masks the government has on order after cancelling contracts with companies that were not able to meet Canadian standards. Will the minister commit to making domestic production of PPE, including N95 masks, a priority? the chair: The honourable minister. Chair, our priority is to make sure that we get safe and effective equipment and supplies into the hands of front-line health care workers. We have a contract with Medicom in Montreal for the production of N95 masks and we will continue to work hard to ensure the chair: We'll go back to Ms. Chair, Novo Textiles, a company in my riding, has retooled its factory to produce surgical masks in response to the shortage of PPE in Canada. Additionally, it will soon be producing quality made-in-Canada N95 masks using Canadian designs and Canadian-made machinery. My constituent has invested his own capital and is in active production supplying front-line workers right now, not just talking about it. Is the government serious about growing domestic production capacity, or is it all talk and no action? hon. anita anand: In reality, we have received 101.3 million surgical masks that are being distributed out to provinces and territories. Chair, to make sure Canadian front-line health care workers have exactly what they need to fight this pandemic. Chair, I'm not quite sure what the member is referring to by how many of these, but as I said, we have signed 24 contracts with domestic the chair: We'll have to go back to Ms. Chair, we have surgical masks being produced right here at home, as well as abroad, being brought into Canada the chair: Back to Ms. Chair, as I said, we have a contract with General Motors for the production of surgical masks the chair: Ms. It's been over a month, the I Want To Help platform has no details yet about eligibility, levels of funding, or how to apply. When can students expect to start applying for the CSSG so they can receive their grants? Thank you. Chair, I'm pleased to share that students can anticipate more programs coming out as soon as possible. By visiting Canada.ca/coronavirus, you'll see a suite of programs to ensure that students and young people are able to succeed. The coronavirus will not win, and our government will continue investing in our leaders of today and tomorrow. Last week the President of the Treasury Board wrote a letter to his cabinet colleagues in which he said that, as the federal minister responsible for public access to government information, he has advised his cabinet colleagues of the need for transparency and accountability, even in times of crisis. Does she agree with the President of the Treasury Board's directive? the chair: The honourable minister. Chair, the government remains committed to maintaining the openness and transparency of our government during this challenging time. The Government of Canada, along with provincial and territorial governments, have implemented exceptional workplace measures to curb the spread of COVID-19, and to protect the health and safety of federal employees. These measures have had an impact on institutions' abilities to respond to access to information and personal information requests, since most employees are now working from their homes. john brassard: Frankly, I'm surprised that the answer is coming from that minister when the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities is in the House, but I will ask this question. steven guilbeault: Treasury Board Secretariat has provided guidance to institutions to continue to make the best efforts to respond to Access to Information Act and Privacy Act requests and to provide published content the chair: We'll go back to Mr. john brassard: Can the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities tell us who Pierre Lavalle is? the chair: The honourable minister. He was the CEO of the Canada Infrastructure Bank since the beginning, but let's be clear: Crown corporations work at arm's length from the government and must have the chair: We'll return to Mr. john brassard: Can I ask the minister how well she knows her file: 50%, 75% or 100%? hon. What I know is that Canadians want infrastructure built, they want it built across the country, in the member opposite's riding and in ridings across the country. john brassard: How much of the $35 billion of infrastructure money that was allocated to that bank has been spent so far? hon. Duclos' advice to his cabinet colleagues about openness and transparency, I'd like to ask the minister how much Mr. Our government follows the Privacy Act and the Access to Information Act when it comes to employee compensation, but remuneration ranges are publicly available. I'd note that this information for the bank's CEOs has been in the public domain the chair: Mr. As I say, the information about salary ranges is publicly available, but personal HR the chair: Mr. Lavalle could have received a bonus after year one of zero to 75% of his base salary, which was $510,000 to $600,000 per year; or in year two, which he was in, zero to 120% of his base salary. catherine mckenna: The rate of any remuneration paid to the chief executive officer is based on the recommendations of the board. Will the government commit to reopening the House of Commons with its full powers, with social distancing, on Monday, September 21? the chair: The honourable minister. Chair, as my colleague knows, we're meeting here four days a week, with questions on any topic for an hour and 35 minutes instead of 45 minutes a day. It has no powers to introduce supply day motions, no powers to test government confidence, no powers to do the usual things that Parliament does. At times of crisis, the bedrock principles of rule of law and democracy are tested, and our democratic principles are buckling under the pressure from this government. 6, and in the last election, they rigged the leaders' debates in their favour, and now they have suspended Parliament. Instead of this neutered committee that meets for only a few days with a few members, will the government commit to the full re-opening of this House with all its powers with social distancing on Monday, September 21? hon. pablo rodriguez: Mr.Chair, the government's objective is always to try to resume Parliament as it was before. Today, we have to live with this pandemic, but we will do everything we can to return to a normal situation as quickly as possible. Over the past few weeks, we have sent suggestions to opposition members about the operation of Parliament and they have never responded. Chair, the full parliament with its full powers sat through two world wars, previous pandemics and the October crisis in 1970. It is failing to be strong and clear on Hong Kong and, while the situation today is not that of decades past, it is clear that Canada in the past stood for the rights of people in Hong Kong. There are some 300,000 Canadians living there, and they are looking for the government's support. government has? When will it speak up against the Communist Party of China's United Front workers operating here in this country? When will it do like Australia did in calling for an international investigation of COVID-19, and organize an international coalition of like-minded democracies to defend Hong Kongers and the violation of the Sino-British treaty? the chair: The honourable minister. We all know that the one country, two systemsthe high degree of liberty and freedom enjoyed by the people in Hong Konghas made Hong Kong what it is today, a beacon when it comes to trade and financing. Again, on May 28, with the United States, with the United Kingdom and with Australia, Canada was front and centre in saying that we have deep concerns that the imposition of a national security law by Beijing would undermine the very foundation, the very principles that have made Hong Kong so successful. We said that we and our international partners would look at the implications and the ramifications that this might have on our arrangement. We will be discussing it and will continue to raise our voices to stand up for the people of Hong Kong, and we will do it with our allies. What's the point of having an advance payment program if there's no payment? Can the Minister of Agriculture tell us when these delays will end? the chair: The honourable minister. marie-claude bibeau (minister of agriculture and agri-food): Mr.Chair, I can assure you that we are working with all the independent operators. I can assure you that, under the circumstances, they are doing their best to make the advance payments mr. However, did the minister approve a policy change on April 1 that made the eligibility for these loans more difficult during the middle of a pandemic, yes or no? hon. marie-claude bibeau: Mr.Chair, a number of changes and improvements have been made to the program. To make things easier for our administrators, we have postponed some of the changes that could have been problematic. Who advised her that it would be a good idea to make it more difficult for the farmers to access the advance payment program in the middle of a pandemic? Or did she just go ahead and do this on her own? hon. marie-claude bibeau: Mr.Chair, we are constantly working with the administrators of the program. We are fully prepared to respond to their requests so that the advance payments program can best serve our producers across the country. larry maguire: Livestock producers are telling me that the premiums for the western livestock insurance program are too high. I told the Minister of Agriculture over two weeks ago that this was a problem, and yet she went out and said that farmers needed to make better use of existing support. When will the Minister of Agriculture listen to what the farmers are saying so they can actually use the existing programs? hon. marie-claude bibeau: Mr.Chair, I would like to remind everyone that we have put in place certain measures to improve access to AgriStability. It is now $100million for pork and beef producers alone, not counting the $77.5million for food processors. larry maguire: Livestock producers in my riding and several across Canada are still waiting for the Minister of Agriculture's promise for an AgriRecovery program. When will the Minister of Agriculture stop rubbing salt in the farmers' wounds and provide the rest of the story she has been saying is on its way for over a month now in her AgriRecovery promise? hon. marie-claude bibeau: Mr.Chair, we have committed $50million to beef producers and $50million to pork producers through the AgriRecovery program. Here is how the program works: the federal government contributes up to60% and then the provinces implement it how they see fit. larry maguire: The funding announced by the Minister of Agriculture for the livestock industry was insufficient, and what was promised has not been delivered. This has caused hogs to be euthanized and over 100,000 feeder cattle to become overweight. marie-claude bibeau: Mr.Chair, once again, we have significantly increased the amounts available through AgriRecovery. dominic leblanc: Mr.Chair, we know that not everyone experiences economic recovery in the same way. In some sectors, such as tourism, fishery, hotels and restaurants, we do not know when activity will resume or whether it will resume slowly. Given that the CERB lasts 16weeks, they are all afraid that they will be left with nothing. Chair, we moved very quickly at the early onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to support workersthose who have lost their jobs, who were laid off, or those whose jobs simply disappearedthrough the Canada emergency response benefit. Chair, the workers that the honourable member identified, including those who were not eligible for the EI, were also covered by the Canada emergency response benefit. We recognized the urgency of the situation, which is why we took action to support workers and their families through the Canada emergency response benefit. louise chabot: Mr.Chair, are we going to continue to help workers in these difficult times? The answer is simple. Can you do anything about it? Can I walk out of the House today and tell all those people that the CERB is going to be extended? hon. bill morneau (minister of finance): Mr.Chair, I would like to thank the honourable member for her question. Of course, we are looking at how we can gradually reopen our economy by continuing to help people to be in a good position. People are afraid to go back to full-time jobs because they are afraid of losing all their emergency benefits. bill morneau: Mr.Chair, we know that, with a responsible reopening of the economy, we have to look at our programs to make sure that we are keeping and protecting people. the chair: We are going to take a break so that our employees can change shifts without jeopardizing their health. While we have a few seconds, I would also like to remind members to address their questions to the chair, not directly to the ministers. Today, June 1, under the auspices of the Food and Agriculture Organization, we celebrate World Milk Day. World Milk Day allows us to emphasize the importance of milk as a global food, its benefits for our health as well as our nutrition; and to celebrate the dairy sector, from the primary producers to the processors who ensure that our many high-quality dairy products get to the marketplace. Canadians are fortunate to have a thriving dairy sector that, under supply management, provides high-quality products at reasonable prices to consumers. Even under supply management though, dairy farmers have found themselves facing difficult challenges as a result of recent trade agreements and sudden market shocks as a result of the pandemic. Chair, to acknowledge World Milk Day, I'd love to be able to raise a glass of wholesome white or chocolate milk, but we can't do that. On the other hand, I must ask the Minister of Agriculture what the government is doing to support the dairy sector in these times so we can celebrate World Milk Day next year with more vim and vigour. Today it is particularly important to thank families working on the 11,000 dairy farms across the country, caring for 1.4 million cows to produce each year more than 9.3 billion litres of milk of the highest quality. The dairy sector in Canada is made up of more than 220,000 Canadians and foreign workers who dedicate their lives to feed us. While our society lives through unprecedented changes, the dairy sector demonstrates its resilience and proves more than ever the value of the supply management system. It is why we increased by $200 million the borrowing capacity of the Canadian Dairy Commission to improve its butter and cheese storage programs, giving the flexibility to manage the surplus of milk and support its mandate. Over the past few years, we have invested in dairy farms and given direct compensation to dairy farmers through trade agreements with Europe and Asia. Chair, last week a horrific video surfaced showing the killing of an unarmed black man at the hands of the Minneapolis police. George Floyd's death was the latest in a series of unwarranted deaths of black men and women at the hands of police. Since his death, solidarity protests have erupted across cities in the United States and all over the world asking for justice and a stop to systemic dehumanization of black people. I wish I could say we are, but sadly we are not immune to the reality of what is happening south of the border. The same protests taking place in New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Berlin, Paris and London are also taking place in our own backyard. In cities like Montreal and Toronto, thousands of people have already taken to the streets, not only to decry anti-black racism but also to ask for tangible solutions to effectively combat anti-black racism. We don't have to wait for pain, suffering and outrage to boil to the surface to act. As Canadians are demonstrating and calling on their society and governments to do better, can the Minister of Diversity and Inclusion and Youth tell us what this government is doing to address anti-black racism in Canada and to ensure we are evening the playing field for black Canadians? the acting chair (mr. If we as Canadians truly desire an inclusive Canada, every single one of us must step up, be an ally and do what we can to make workplaces, communities and public spaces safer. The open, transparent, merit-based appointment process is resulting in decision-making tables better reflecting Canadians. We recognize the UN International Decade for People of African Descent; the applications for capacity building in black Canadian communities are being assessed; the anti-racism secretariat is set up for Canadians but also for government departments to improve their systems, including advancement opportunities; and the recently announced immunity task force will provide disaggregated data to decision-makers because decisions need to be based on science and evidence. Although our government is moving in the right decision, there is clearly a lot more work to do and we are committed to doing that work with communities as allies, as partners. Chair, workers' unions, business leaders and analysts across the country are raising a huge alarm over potential bankruptcies due to COVID-19. For years the government has promised to change the laws to protect workers from corporate bankruptcy, but has failed to deliver. Will this government fix the law before more Canadian workers lose their hard-earned pensions? the acting chair (mr. I'd like to thank the member for Hamilton Mountain for that question and for his advocacy on this file. I remind the member that since 2015 one of our first initiatives was the repealing of Bills C-525 and C-377, which were anti-union legislation. Chair, the changes the government made last year to bankruptcy insolvency laws were largely cosmetic and won't protect workers' and pensioners' livelihoods once bankruptcy hits. The government can protect severance, termination pay, pensions and benefits from corporate theft, but will they do it, yes or no? the acting chair (mr. Chair, we made a number of significant changes in budget 2019, including that the process for the CCAA be more open and transparent. One thing we heard in the consultations was the ability for courts to set aside executive bonuses, and we implemented all those changes because we want to continue to protect pensioners. Will the government fix the lawsyes or noto protect workers' and pensioners' rights? the acting chair (mr. daniel blaikie (elmwoodtranscona, ndp): Thank you very much, Mr. Twice, following negotiations with the NDP, the government has committed to provide direct financial assistance to people living with disabilities. I have a lot of sympathy for people across the country who are living with disabilities and are getting impatient with the fact that alongside its initial commitment to seniors, for instance, the government made a commitment to helping people living with disabilities with the same kind of direct financial assistance, and it hasn't come. Why has it taken so long for the government to get around to helping people who are in a crisis right now? I want to know the reason why this hasn't been announced yet. We're moving forward with the Canada emergency student benefit, which will provide $2,000 per month for eligible students with permanent disabilities. We have done a lot, but we will continue to do more, and we will have more to share on our continuing efforts to support persons with disabilities. Their commitment was for direct financial assistance to people living with disabilities who are facing additional costs because of the pandemic. When are they going to get around to it? Why should people living with disabilities have to wait any longer than they already have? the acting chair (mr. Chair, that is precisely why we are listening closely to the COVID-19 disability advisory group to get expert advice. According to La Presse, federal cabinet ministers Steven Guilbeault , Catherine McKenna and Jonathan Wilkinson have been handed responsibility for crafting an economic recovery plan that aims to accelerate the green shift. True to form, this cabal around the Prime Minister has declared let's not let a good crisis go to waste. Can the Prime Minister confirm that his ministers have been working with environmental lobby groups for further financial support to engineer Canada's economy post COVID? the acting chair (mr. As we support Canadians through this time, we will also ensure our long-term economic, environmental and physical well-being. Our government remains committed to building a stronger and more resilient economy to ensure a sustainable, prosperous future for our kids and grandkids. Just like science is guiding us in our response to COVID-19, science will continue to guide us toward reduced pollution and in fighting climate change. greg mclean: The task force for a resilient recovery was quoted as saying last week that they would have recommendations for government action available within eight weeks, notably eight weeks when Parliament is, by this government's design, absent. Can the Prime Minister disclose to this committee how many meetings his 61 environmental activist advisers have had with the task force or its members? hon. mona fortier: Mr.Chair, our most urgent priority with respect to COVID-19 is the health and safety of Canadians. While supporting Canadians during this period, we must also ensure our economic, environmental and physical well-being in the long term. Our government remains committed to building a stronger, more resilient economy to ensure a sustainable future for our grandchildren and children. greg mclean: The task force is a who's who of academics and bureaucrats, but surprisingly, includes no one from the productive part of the Canadian economy. The task force is reviewing work produced by Smart Prosperity, a government-funded institute whose membership overlaps with both the task force and the government's own Canadian Institute for Climate Choices. How many organizations does this government need to fund to recycle work produced by other redundant government-funded entities? hon. mona fortier: Mr.Chair, as we know, our priority right now is the health and safety of Canadians. Just as science guides us in our response to COVID-19, it will continue to guide us in reducing pollution and fighting climate change. Our priority is to support Canadians during this period and we must also ensure our environmental, economic and physical well-being in the long term. Perhaps it's just a coincidence, but can the Prime Minister confirm if this is the same Gerald Butts who was forced to resign as his principal secretary for his role in attempting to force Canada's then justice minister into breaking the law? hon. mona fortier: Mr.Chair, since the beginning of this crisis, our priority has been to support Canadians and their health and safety. We will continue to do so, because it is important that we get through this crisis by supporting Canadians. mona fortier: Once again, Mr.Chair, it is important to talk to Canadians right now to tell them that we are putting their health and safety first. Chair, is this the same Gerald Butts who, in his role as the principal secretary in the office of Ontario's then premier, advanced policies that now saddle Ontarians with the highest energy costs in North America? Is this is the same Gerald Butts who weighed down Ontario with the world's highest subnational debt burden, all for the benefit of new green jobs that, notably, have never arrived? hon. mona fortier: Mr.Chair, as we know, for the past two and a half months, we have been supporting Canadians. chris d'entremont: Yesterday, the Minister responsible for tourism, ACOA and official languages was happy to close our national Tourism Week by announcing investments of $70 million to offset financial losses in the tourism industry across Canada. Southern Ontario received $30 million, northern Ontario received $7 million and western Canada received $3.5 million. Knowing that we just had an announcement from the Minister of Transport that there will be no cruise ships in Atlantic Canada or anywhere in Canada this year, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, where is the program for Atlantic Canada? hon. I know he's a very strong advocate for the tourism sector in Atlantic Canada, so I want to reassure him. Rather than doing marketing internationally, we will be supporting destination marketing organizations across the country, including in Atlantic Canada, to make sure that we launch this new movement to visit local. chris d'entremont: That would be all great if we weren't in the middle of a pandemic and you can't even cross the Nova Scotia-New Brunswick border without having to self-isolate for two weeks. In Saint John, New Brunswick, 79 cruise ships and more than 270,000 passengers will not be giving back to that local community. Prince Edward Island, which was expected to have a record attendance year, will lose visits of 97 ships and 154,000 passengers, and $60 million to the province's economy will be lost. Chair, my question to the minister is this: Who is ACOA going to be working with, and what kinds of programs are going to be available to help them through this very difficult year? hon. It is a bit like the canary in the coal mine; it was the first impacted, and definitely it is still impacted. Again, recently I had good conversations with the chambers of commerce all across Atlantic Canada, including Hospitality Newfoundland and Labrador for the tourism sector. They wanted to have access to it until later in the summer, and it has been extended to the end of August. chris d'entremont: Mr.Chair, like the minister, last week, I spoke with Simon-Pierre Poulin, the director of Le Franco newspaper in Alberta, about the Sauvons Saint-Jean movement. He asked me why we could not continue to work on official languages and on modernizing the act even though Parliament is sitting in a different configuration. Unfortunately, I had to explain to him that many restrictions were associated with the current format of this fake Parliament. The Liberal government made a commitment to modernize the Official Languages Act in the first six months of its mandate. mlanie joly: Mr.Chair, it goes without saying that our two official languages are important and that, when it comes to language rights, we must always be on guard and protect what we have achieved. I had the opportunity to speak with my two counterparts in Alberta late Friday afternoon to tell them about our concerns and the need to protect the institution from drastic cuts. richard martel (chicoutimile fjord, cpc): Mr.Chair, some people for whom the 15weeks of sickness benefits were not enough before the COVID-19crisis now have to exhaust their regular employment insurance benefits before they are entitled to the CERB. Today, I would like to know whether they will be able to exhaust their weeks of eligibility for the CERB after October3. Chair, we ensured that those who switched over to the Canada emergency response benefit would be covered by it, whether they were EI eligible or not. We are committed to supporting all of the workers who have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. richard martel: According to a survey conducted by the Universit du Qubec Trois-Rivires' research institute on small and medium size businesses, the SaguenayLac-Saint-Jean region would be the most affected by the economic effects of COVID-19. In fact, in our region, the tourism industry generates more than $300million in economic activity, including $58million for the cruise industry alone. mlanie joly: Mr.Chair, it goes without saying that the tourism industry is indeed very much affected. We are also providing the Canada emergency commercial rent assistance, as well as the $40,000loans from the Canada emergency business account. I am having good talks with various stakeholders in Quebec, including Martin Soucy from the Alliance de l'industrie touristique du Qubec. richard martel: Mr.Chair, the tourism industry in the SaguenayLac-Saint-Jean region is the sum of all its stakeholders. Overly restrictive standards will prevent some tourist accommodation from welcoming guests this year, even though they will have to pay their bills every month. We really want to be able to reach these small businesses, of which there are many in SaguenayLac-Saint-Jean, in Quebec and across the country. That is why the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance have committed an additional $1billion to help those businesses that fall through the cracks. We need to respond now, and I will have more to say about it in the next few days. richard martel: Mr.Chair, I was very disappointed to see that we had lost asparagus crops due to a labour shortage. When I spoke with the blueberry growers in my area, they told me they were concerned that the same thing could happen to them. Chair, we believe that the flexibilities we have introduced to the Canada summer jobs program will enable more employers to use it, including more businesses, as well as help young people to acquire the necessary skills and benefits from this really important program. richard martel: Mr.Chair, on May19, the government said that it was studying several solutions to help business owners and entrepreneurs who operate their business using a personal bank account. Chair, small businesses are the heart of all of our communities, and we've been working really hard to help them. On Tuesday, May 26, she gained a new resident when Brinnley Lisette Huby was born to parents Adam and Carina Huby. Carina is my daughter, and that makes Brinnley my first grandchild and presently my favourite newest Canadian. Dave Epp: Minister Jordan, the Freshwater Fish Marketing Corporation is allowed access to the seafood stabilization fund, while you deny its competitor, our Ontario fisheries that fish on the Great Lakes, the similar right to apply. The Ontario inland fishers and the people in Ontario are eligible for other programs that are offered through the regional development agencies. We're making sure that we're addressing the concerns of inland fisheries as well as coastal fisheries. dave epp: Minister, will you then direct these regional agencies to provide equitable funding equivalent to the seafood stabilization fund? hon. Chair, we're making sure that they have the same access to programs through the regional development agencies as there is through the seafood stabilization fund. We're making sure that everyone who is in need of support through the programs will be able to access it. dave epp: According to Stats Canada, before my granddaughter turns one year old, her share of the federal debt will be over $39,000. What is Minister Morneau's fiscal plan for Canada so that the interest on this debt doesn't cripple Canada with higher taxes? hon. In that way we can have jobs and we can get through this pandemic and have a strong economy and be able to continue with our approach to managing our economy in a responsible the acting chair (mr. dave epp: Minister, when can Parliament, or this semblance of it, see that plan for economic prosperity? the acting chair (mr. We've been quite clear that we need to be transparent on a daily basis by giving Canadians an understanding of the investments that we're making through this pandemic. Chair, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce said three months before the pandemic that this current government's level of spending and incurring of debt is untenable and that future generations, like my granddaughter, will have to pay for it. Chair, coming into this pandemic in a strong fiscal position with the lowest amount of debt among the G7 countries is a function of our economy that's afforded us the opportunity to invest on behalf of Canadians. dave epp: What is the budget for stopping illegal American guns from getting through our borders? hon. I can tell you that we have invested considerable amounts of money and have earmarked ongoing monies to ensure that we address the issue of illegal guns passing across the border. dave epp: What's the budget, then, to fight government-trained and licensed Canadians in the court challenge that's now been triggered? the acting chair (mr. dave epp: What is the budget for fighting the government-trained and licensed people who are now triggering a lawsuit against your order in council? hon. Chair, I don't have the answer to that question, but obviously the government will defend its position. Chair, COVID-19 has exacerbated the problem of this government's policy of spending the cupboards bare in good times instead of planning for a rainy dayand folks, we're in a storm. The Federation of Canadian Municipalities says they need $10 billion in targeted emergency operating funding, so do municipalities slash services, do they raise taxes, or will we be there for the municipalities? hon. chrystia freeland: Our government absolutely understands the crucial role municipalities play as the engine of our economy at all times, and particularly today, as in many parts of the country we are looking to restart the economy. That is why the Prime Minister announced just this morning that we will be accelerating payments under the gas tax fund. Many did their best to keep employees engaged and tried hard to not lose clients, as the government urged them to do. Thousands of business owners across the country will not be able to pay their rent today and risk closing permanently. Will the government push the provinces to include an eviction moratorium during the pandemic and make this commercial rent assistance program more flexible to ensure small businesses can survive? hon. Chair, I'd like to thank the honourable member for the question, which recognizes the very serious challenge that many small businesses are facing during the course of this pandemic. We know that the programs we've put forward, programs like the emergency business account, are supporting businesses, but the emergency rent approach, on which we've worked together with provinces, can also help significantly. Of course, the suggestion from the member that provinces take action in restricting evictions is one that I've been speaking about to ministers of finance from the provinces over the course of the last couple of months. Chair, this week marks the 31st anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, and we are currently seeing repression of the democracy movement in Hong Kong. In spite of this knowledge, the Harper Conservative government signed a lopsided and anti-democratic investment treaty with China in 2012, the Canada-China FIPA. This Conservative deal gave Chinese state-owned corporations extraordinary powers to challenge our democratic decisions through a secretive private tribunal system. In the years since the FIPA was signed, with no vote in Parliament, Chinese state-owned corporations have been purchasing Canadian assets and resources. These corporations can seek financial compensation from Canadian taxpayers for the loss of potential profit when our laws and policies get in the way of their profit-taking. Can the government tell us whether any of these Chinese corporations has threatened to use the anti-democratic investor-state provisions of the FIPA to seek financial compensation from Canadian taxpayers? hon. franois-philippe champagne: As I'm sure the member will know, Canada is setting up with its allies around the world to protect the freedom and democracy that has been enjoyed by the people in Hong Kong. As he knows, we have issued a declaration with a number of allies we have called upon to make sure that measures remain in place to protect the freedom and liberty of the people of Hong Kong. We know that the one country, two systems treaty system has provided the framework under which the people of Hong Kong have been able to create an economy that is resilient and has made Hong Kong a place where people want to do business, commerce and trade. I would refer the member to the joint statement we have issued with the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom. We have spoken with one voice and we have said we have deep concerns that the actions by Beijing, if they were to proceed with this national security law unilaterally, would undermine the bedrock of what has made Hong Kong, and that we will review the impact that the acting chair (mr. paul manly: That was a trick question, because this anti-democratic agreement states that we wouldn't be able to have permission to disclose that information if there was, in fact, an investor-state dispute. Unlike NAFTA, which had a six-month period for renegotiation, the Harper Conservatives locked us into a 15-year agreement with the FIPA and this anti-democratic agreement. Will the government re-engage the special committee on Canada-China relations so we can do a thorough investigation of this Conservative sellout of Canadian democracy the acting chair (mr. Canada will always pursue trade in the interest of Canadians, and we are in the process of reviewing our FIPA agreements so those agreements can provide the right framework for Canadians to trade, with the interests of Canadians always top of mind. Will the government work with the Freshwater Fish Marketing Corporation and inland fishers to develop and facilitate the delivery of an emergency package that works for them and find ways to redirect product to domestic markets, including communities facing food insecurity now? hon. Chair, we've recognized how hard the pandemic has hit our fishers and our fishing sector. One of the things we're doing primarily is the harvesters' benefit, which allows all harvesters to take advantage of a benefit as well as a grant contribution to help them get through. We're also changing EI so they can now qualify for their EI benefits based on previous seasons, not this one, recognizing they're going to face challenges this year. We are continuing to look at ways we can address the challenges within the industry and we'll continue to work with them to make sure we are addressing those needs. This government has sat by while the Canadian Transportation Agency issued a statement to back up the airlines' appalling actions. What is this government doing to fix this? Why aren't they ensuring that public funds involve reimbursing passengers and an equity stake for Canadians? hon. Chair, I certainly recognize the very difficult situation and the frustration of Canadians who would have preferred a refund. At the same time, at this point if airlines were required to immediately reimburse all the cancelled tickets, it would have a devastating effect on the airlines. That is why the Canadian Transportation Agency, which is an independent body, recommended that vouchers be issued and that they have a reasonable time to be usedtwo years. It is also very important to bear in mind that as we begin to exit this pandemic, we must still have an airline industry in this country. Chair, in Victoria housing and homelessness were at a crisis point long before the pandemic hit, but now people are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. If you don't have a place to live, you don't have the luxury of following public health advice and staying home. As part of the recovery, will this government be increasing funding to build or buy the housing needed to address homelessness? hon. Chair, very early in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our government provided $157.5 million directly to 51 community entities to respond directly to the needs of homeless Canadians. While the province has stepped up, it cost them $18.5 million to purchase just one hotel in Victoria. The $157.5 million, I must note, was additional money on top of the base funding that we provide every year to address the needs of Canada's most vulnerable. We are trusting the community entities to make the decisions on where the funding goes and to respond in a way that meets the the acting chair (mr. This government's national housing strategy reduces the level of targeted funding for lower-income households, according to the Parliamentary Budget Officer. My question is simple: Coming out of the pandemic in the coming months, is the government going to increase housing funding to address the immediate need, yes or no? hon. Regardless of the COVID-19 pandemic, the last time I checked, we still had a democratic system and the government had to remain accountable. Does the government intend to extend the measures over the summer? If so, how will it do so? The government must also present its working scenarios for the economic recovery. Every day, we announce measures, of course, but also the cost of the measures and the amount of the investments. gabriel ste-marie: In my opinion, Mr.Chair, it will really be too late to do the economic update when things are more stable. bill morneau: Mr.Chair, let me confirm that we will continue to be transparent about the investments; it is very important. As I said, when the situation is a little more stable, we will have the opportunity to explain our situation with an economic update. gabriel ste-marie: Once again, Mr.Chair, when the situation is more stable, it will be too late to do an economic update; instead we will have to table a budget with the recovery in mind. Speaking of the recovery, the Parliamentary Budget Officer is surprised that the government is calling on the private sector for ideas for its recovery plan. Mr.Giroux points out that this government has thousands of public servants with very good ideas, and he adds that the government can also ask for the opposition parties' views. member that it is important to listen to what we are trying to do, and to listen to people's ideas and opinions, not only in Parliament, but also from our society. Of course, with our approach, we will address the economic recovery in a way that will ensure we can maintain our very strong position. gabriel ste-marie: Mr.Chair, we are still surprised that the government has contracted out its recovery plan to the private sector. It would help them to loosen the purse strings and be assured that there will be economic life after the pandemic. bill morneau: Mr.Chair, we feel it is very important to consider what we need to do in each phase of our recovery. At this time, it is necessary to consider the public health situation and the gradual reopening of our economy. Obviously, by gathering more information in Phase3, we will be able to consider more than one approach to recovery. I understand that the exact date for tabling the recovery plan may be difficult to determine at this time. Can the minister tell us whether he currently intends to table the recovery plan in a month ending in ber? If not, will it be before or after that? hon. bill morneau: We continue to work with the provinces on an approach to determine the timing of the recovery, and we are also listening to our colleagues in Parliament, of course. We were shocked to hear that his own Minister of Digital Government used WeChat, a Chinese social media site, to raise funds to sue a Global News reporterfor what? It was for daring to expose China's attempt to hoard PPE during the COVID crisis. Is it the practice of the government to support lawsuits against Canadian reporters who challenge the hostile actions of the regime in China, and will the Prime Minister now condemn the actions of the digital government minister? hon. As many members on all sides of the House know, WeChat is a social media platform used to engage and share information with the Chinese-Canadian community. In this case, the individual who violated the guidelines of the group is no longer a part of that group. Chair, Canadians have no reason to trust the Prime Minister on anything to do with China, especially when it comes to trade policy. Two and a half years ago, the Prime Minister travelled to China to commence free trade negotiations, and the talks ended up in complete failure and embarrassment. Still the Prime Minister continues to cozy up to the Chinese regime, refusing to ban Huawei from our 5G network or to speak out convincingly against China's oppression in Hong Kong. Can the minister tell us whether at any time during the last six months the Prime Minister or anyone else in his government has had discussions with China about a free trade agreement? A simple yes or no will do. Any work that we do on trade and on all matters will always be in the interests of Canadians first. ed fast: I think Canadians will see that the minister didn't even answer a simple yes-or-no question, so I'll ask her a simpler yes-or-no question. Is she or anyone else in her government presently discussing or negotiating a free trade agreement with China, yes or no? hon. Chair, we will always do our work, including any discussions on trade and indeed all of our work, with the interests of Canadians and Canadian businesses as our absolute top priority. Will the minister now assure Canadians that she and the Prime Minister's government will not negotiate a free trade agreement with China, yes or no? hon. mary ng: Any work that we do will always be guided by the best interests of Canadians and Canadian businesses. Will the minister tell us why she thinks negotiating a trade agreement with a hostile country like China is in Canada's best interests? hon. Free trade is a good thing when it takes place between like-minded countries that embrace free market principles and apply the rule of law. In fact, China repeatedly flouts international trade rules, illegally dumps underpriced goods into Canada, and prevents Canadian canola, beef and pork from entering China. Will the minister now assure us that our government will not negotiate any free trade agreements with China, yes or no? hon. mary ng: We are not in discussions with China on a free trade agreement, and as my colleagues, including the Prime Minister and the foreign minister, have said many times in this House and outside of this House, our priority continues to be the immediate release of Canadians detained in China. bruce stanton): This will conclude today's sitting of the special committee on the COVID-19 pandemic"

        "Query": "What were the team's decisions and solutions regarding the remote control's visibility, ease of finding, and prevention of loss during the discussion of technical issues, market interests, and the function of \"glow in the dark\"?",
        "Summary": "The team discussed various options for the remote control design. User Interface suggested a base station next to the TV, but it was deemed technically complicated and costly. Marketing proposed implementing an audio signal, which was ultimately adopted. There were debates about where to place the logo on the remote. Project Manager suggested printing it on a button, but User Interface was concerned about wear and tear. Industrial Designer suggested putting it on the back, but visibility was an issue. User Interface proposed a two-piece remote, but it didn't align with the cover design. Finally, it was agreed to leave a cut-out space on the latex covers to display the logo. The team decided on a beeping feature for when the remote gets lost and a fixed charger to prevent loss. Marketing suggested additional features like beeping or blinking lights when clapping, and a signal when in a dark spot. However, voice and clapping were deemed insufficient, and the team settled on glow-in-the-dark material combined with speech recognition for easy location. This choice was cost-effective and believed to boost market sales.",
        "Article": "bruce stanton (simcoe north, cpc)): Honourable members, I call this meeting to order. Welcome to the 15thmeeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic.  I will remind you that in order to avoid issues with sound, members participating in person should not also be connecting by video conference. In order to ensure that those joining the meeting via video conference can be seen and heard by those in the chamber, two screens have been set up here on either side of the Speaker's chair, and members in the chamber can listen to the floor audio or to interpretation using the earpieces on their desks. For those joining by video conference, I'd like to remind you to leave your microphones on mute when you are not speaking. Also, please note that if you want to speak in English, you need to be on the English channel for interpretation, and if you want to speak French, you should do so on the French channel. Should you wish to alternate between the two languages, please change to the channel for the language that you happen to be using at the time. Should members participating by video conference need to request the floor outside their designated speaking times, they should activate their mic and state that they have a point of order. Please note that today's proceedings will be televised in the same way as a typical sitting of the House. Over the past few days, we've seen horrific reports of police violence against black men and women south of the border, but these are not isolated incidents or elsewhere problems. They are a result of systems that far too often condone, normalize, perpetrate and perpetuate inequality and injustice against people of colour. The calls for justice, for equality and for peace are found echoed in our communities, because anti-black racism is happening here, everywhere in Canada, every single day. I'm also talking about microaggressions, which many of us may not even see. When it comes to being an ally, I have made serious mistakes in the past, mistakes that I deeply regret and continue to learn from. I want to thank my colleagues, community leaders and fellow Canadians for opening my eyes to what is really going on in our communities and for helping me better understand both privilege and power. I'm not perfect, but not being perfect is not a free pass to not do the right thing. It's not an excuse to not step up, stand up for each other, be an ally. I know that for so many people listening right now, the last thing you want to hear is another speech on racism from a white politician. I'm not here today to describe a reality I do not know or to speak to a pain I have not felt.  Since coming to office, our government has taken many concrete steps to fight anti-black racism, systemic discrimination and injustice across the country. We have made significant investments to enable the Public Health Agency of Canada to provide more mental health services to people who have experienced racism or intergenerational trauma. We have also created the anti-racism secretariat, which has an envelope of $4.6million, to address systemic barriers, such as employment, justice and social participation, that perpetuate injustice. While we've made some progress, there is still so much more to do, because here are the facts in Canada: Anti-black racism is real. Chair, every Canadian who has felt the weight of oppression, every student who has the courage to demand a better future, every person who marches and posts and reads and fights, from Vancouver to Montreal to Halifax, expects more than the status quo. We're ready to work with our opposition colleagues, community leaders and Canadians to make our country a more just and fair place. Racism never has a place in this country, and we will do everything we can to eradicate it from coast to coast to coast. Over the past week, we have all been affected by the heartbreaking killing of George Floyd in the United States. No one should ever have to plead for help while a crime is being committed, ignored by other members of law enforcement.  No one should ever feel unsafe because of the colour of their skin, especially around police officers who have a duty and a responsibility to uphold the law for all. Our nation has benefited immensely from great Canadians who overcame prejudices and discrimination to serve their communities and make Canada a better country: Lincoln Alexander, elected as a Conservative in 1968, was the first black member of Parliament and went on to become the first black cabinet minister; John Ware was born into slavery in South Carolina but, following the American Civil War, was a leading figure in bringing the first cattle to Alberta and spearheading the ranching industry that would become the backbone of the province; Josiah Henson escaped slavery to become a thriving businessman in Ontario; and of course, Viola Desmond challenged segregation in Nova Scotia. Black Canadians throughout history have not just built this nation with their contributions; they have also represented Canada with excellence and pride on the world stage, like Harry Jerome, who represented Canada in three Olympic Games and won a bronze medal in 1964. He would go on to become a teacher in British Columbia, once again serving with excellence to try to make a better world for the next generation. Throughout our history, black Canadians have put their lives on the line for their fellow Canadians, bravely serving around the world in our armed forces. While there are many things we can point to in our history with pride, that is not to say that we have a perfect record, nor that we are immune to the threat of racism or that anti-black racism is just an American problem. Canada has had its own dark episodes of racism that cannot be ignoredsadly, not just in our past. No one should be attacked in their community or targeted on the bus because of the colour of their skin. In a peaceful and free country like Canada, there is absolutely no room for intolerance, racism or extremism of any kind. Millions of people are protesting peacefully across the United States and in Canada, and we must always protect the rights of people who are protesting peacefully and within the law for a just cause and separate them from those who exploit tragedies to commit acts of violence. Chair, that is a powerful message about how each one of us can use our democratic rights to effect change. In a peaceful and free country like Canada, there is absolutely no room for intolerance, racism and extremism of any kind. We are all created in the image and likeness of God, and because of that, we are all equal. Canada is a nation of immigrants that stands on the traditional territories of first nations, Inuit and Mtis people. Waves of newcomers have come to Canada for a better life because our country is built on a rock-solid foundation of enduring values, democratic institutions, the rule of law and fundamental and universal human rights. Everyone comes here because Canada is built on solid values, democratic institutions, and respect for the rule of law, as well as for fundamental, universal human rights. There are those who say that diversity is our strength, and that is true, but it doesn't quite capture the full picture. It is the freedom for people to preserve and pass on their cultural traditions and the opportunity to live in peace with those around them; the freedom to live your life with equality under the law, regardless of your race or ethnic background; and the economic freedom that so many governments around the world deny their people. Together, generations of Canadians who trace their roots back to countries around the world have built Canada to truly the greatest country on earth, the true north strong and free. To ensure that our people remain free, we must continue to fight attacks on our freedoms, including racism and all forms of brutality and injustice in Canada and around the world. As John Diefenbaker said, I am a Canadian...free to speak without fear, free to worship...in my own way, free to stand for what I think right, free to oppose what I believe wrong, free to choose those who shall govern my country. yves-franois blanchet (beloeilchambly, bq): Thank you, Mr.Chair. At a time of crisis when outrage is overwhelming the caution and fear of disease among thousands of people who, despite everything, take to the streets to express that outrage, we here in politics will have to be careful, once again, about the words we use. Indeed we are particularly inclined to give other people's words a meaning other than the one they would have liked to give them. Today, our dutyand I would say almost our only dutyis to express our solidarity, our sadness, our indignation and our anger, but above alland in saying this, I'm thinking of all my friends and acquaintances in the wonderful black community in Quebec and the UnitedStatesour friendship. Every time we talk about this, a small part of me surfaces, that of the non-practising but unrepentant anthropologist who wants to remind us that races do not exist. It is the frequency of manifestations of certain genetic traits favoured by geography and history, which in turn shape cultures. Racism expresses itself first and foremost through aggression against what is presumed to be the culture of others, difference. I am concerned when anyone suggests that we are all and collectively inclined to engage in systemic discrimination or when anyone claims to be a bulwark of virtue between us and the victims. I believe that the Canadian government is not racist, that the Quebec government is not racist, and that the governments of our municipalities are not racist either. I believe, however, that there may be traces of horrible things left in our institutions that colour our relationships with people of different origins or with people who were here long before us. It should not denounce individuals, but it should encourage us to reread our rules to get rid of what might still be discriminatory in them. We don't play politics at the funeral doors: we gather our thoughts, and let indignation and sadness be expressed. I'm proposing a very concrete measure, which is to give priority and expedited processing to the files of refugee claimantsespecially Haitian, especially black, but also of other originswho have expressed their desire to be part of the Quebec nation by putting themselves on the front line. He has the power and the duty to do so, and if he needs Parliament, let's do it tomorrow or right now. In the meantime, our duty is to stand up for those who are afraid and against those who frighten them. GeorgeFloyd's murder is a grim reminder that anti-black racism still exists and that it hits hard. Anti-black racism isn't only in the UnitedStates; it's here in Canada, too. Systemic racism against blacks, indigenous people and many other visible minorities is alive and well: racial profiling, economic inequality, social inequality, discriminatory hiring, trivialization of violence, excess incarceration, and so on. When the time comes to act, they don't have the courage, they don't have the will to act.  When people around the world saw the killing of George Floyd, it left all of us shaken to our core. It was chilling, the casual violence of anti-black racism, the callous taking of another human being's life. This is just as much a Canadian problem as well, and something that continues to exist across our country. Indigenous people and black people have suffered violence and have been killed at the hands of police here in Canada. I think about Stewart Kevin Andrews, a young indigenous man killed in an interaction with the police in Winnipeg. The anger and frustration are about this: How many more people need to die before there's action? How many more speeches will be made? How many more protests need to happen before something is done? How many more times will people plead to breathe? How many more times will they plead to live? What we're talking about is basic human dignity. How many more voices have to ask, demand, plead, beg for basic human dignity? People are angry. Why do they need to keep on asking? Why do black people, why do indigenous people need to keep on asking to be treated like humans? Why? You know, people are done with pretty speeches, particularly pretty speeches from people in power who could do something about it right now if they wanted to. I'm standing in a hall of power, the chamber of the Commons, with a Prime Minister who has the power not just to say pretty words but to actually do something about this. The Prime Minister of this country has the power to go beyond pretty words and pretty speeches and do something. We're going to have to come up with those solutions together, but there are certainly some things we do know. Martin Luther King said, True peace is not merely the absence of tension; it is the presence of justice.  Killer Mike extolled that people should plan, plot, strategize, organize and then mobilize. Cardi B put it this way: Another way for the people to take powerI don't want to make everything political but it is what it isis by voting. I call on the Prime Minister, in this hall of power: If the Prime Minister believes that black lives matter, will the Prime Minister commit to ending racial profiling in our country? If the Prime Minister believes that black lives matter, will the Prime Minister commit to ending the over-policing of black bodies? If the Prime Minister believes, truly believes, that black lives matter, will the Prime Minister commit to ending the over-incarceration of black people in this country? If the Prime Minister truly believes that black lives matter, will he commit to ensuring that there are race-based data to make better decisions? Will he commit to ensuring that there's access to education and to health resources? The Prime Minister has the power to do all these things right now. If the Prime Minister truly believes that indigenous lives matter, then similarly the Prime Minister must commit today to ending the racial profiling of indigenous people, the over-policing of indigenous people and the over-incarceration of indigenous people. If the Prime Minister truly believes that indigenous lives matter, the Prime Minister could stop taking indigenous kids to court; the Prime Minister could stop delaying the action on the calls for justice for the murdered and missing indigenous women and girls. If the Prime Minister believes that indigenous lives matter, he could ensure that there's clean drinking water and access to justice and to education and housing right now. People are angry because they're done with pretty speeches from people in power who could do something about it right now. I stand here and want to begin by acknowledging that we are all on the traditional territory of the Algonquin peoples, and again to say meegwetch, on a day like this when we're focusing on something so painful that really is beyond partisanship and that should bind us together as people who say we cannot tolerate racism, not in this country. One is COVID-19 and the other one we've tolerated far too long, which is race-based hatred, hate speech and anti-black racism. I want to do nothing but just chant it in this place until we all stand together and say, Black lives matter. What we are seeing in the murder of George Floyd is exactly as my colleague from the Bloc Qubcois said: George Floyd is not a victim of racism; he is another victim of racism.  The first time a black man was killed when his last words were I can't breathe was in 2014, with Eric Garner. Imagine what she's going through, because George Floyd died on video also saying, I can't breathe, and the people who were stopping him from breathing, his killers, are the police. In George Floyd's murder, at least one killer has been charged, but it doesn't do anything to ease the pain, nor, as my friend from the NDP said, does it quench the thirst for justice, because that's what people are crying out for. I had to look it up because I thought, when was it that the poor young man who was jogging was murdered by the father and son in the pickup truck? He was murdered by a retired policeman and his son in their pickup truck, in February. Breonna Taylor of Louisville was murdered in her own home by cops who thought she might have drugs there. What on earth allows this to keep happening over and over again?  I looked at a site called Just Security and I thought these words from reporter Mia Bloom, who happens to be Canadian, were pretty clear on what puts you at risk of death in the United States of America, but also in Canada: driving while black, jogging while black, reporting while black, bird watching while black, selling lemonade while black can get you killed. I want to go back to the words reporting while black, because this is something else we've seen in the last four days that we've never seen before, which is the deliberate targeting of reporters by police. It seems that, in this place, when we have speeches and pretty words to denounce racism, we do it in a kind of cycle. We talked about the threat to our indigenous brothers and sisters across this country who also face racism on a daily basis. Just within the last day, the report came down on the killing of Dale Culver in Prince George at the hands of the Prince George RCMP. This indigenous young man was 35 years old, and he was pepper-sprayed until he couldn't breathe.  We denounce anti-Semitism when we see anti-Semitic graffiti scrawled on the door of an Ottawa rabbi's home. We denounce it, but can we get to the root of it? As the honourable leader of the Conservative Party mentioned, in recent days we're seeing anti-Asian racism on the increase. We have to acknowledge our privilege and we have to know, as the Prime Minister said, we're not perfect, but it doesn't give us a free pass to ignore that we have to stand up and we have to speak out. I am sitting so close to my friend here, our minister, Ahmed HussenI say your name out loud, but your tweets brought me to tearsthat this fine man faces racism in his own riding, that his three beautiful black boys have people turn away or clutch their purse or they're a little worried when the kids are around. It sounds exactly like what the Prime Minister just called the microaggressions that many of us might not even see. In looking at these things, there is something I want to say, when we look at all these things that are happening and we wonder, what we can do about it. We have to speak out and we have to say that the President of the United States is fomenting hatred and violence and it's shameful and shocking that he would grab a Bible, then use tear gas to clear peaceful protestors on a Washington street so that Donald Trump could pose with a Bible in front of an Episcopal church. The Episcopal Bishop of Washington had this to say, because she is a good ally:     In no way do we support the President's incendiary response to a wounded, grieving nation. In faithfulness to our Saviour who lived a life of non-violence and sacrificial love, we align ourselves with those seeking justice for the death of George Floyd. We must acknowledge and speak up for justice for the missing and murdered indigenous women and girls, the report on which languishes a year later. If we're looking for real action, things we can do in this place, I call on us to have an inquiry and an examination to root out white supremacist groups in Canada and identify them for what they are, a terrorist threat in our midst. We must make sure they're not in our police forces, because if there is one thing scarier than a white supremacist with a gun, it's a white supremacist with a gun in uniform. Please, God, we love each other, take care of each other regardless of the colour of our skin, and pray for the United States of America. It's a country being ripped apart, and the ripping and the tearing is being done by people who should at this very time be consoling and leading and inspiring. Pray for each and every one of our beautiful black baby girls and boys, the indigenous baby girls and boys, the Asian kids. bruce stanton): We will now proceed to presenting petitions for a period not exceeding 15minutes. I'd like to remind honourable members that any petition presented during the meeting of this special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions.  For members participating in person, we ask that they please come and drop the signed certificate off at the table once the petition is presented. It's estimated that 74,000 to 121,000 microplastic particles are ingested per person every year. A recent study shows that each washing cycle 120,000 to 730,000 microfibres are shed from clothes and go directly into waste water. Washing machine discharge filters are currently available on the market and greatly reduce the amount of microfibres being released into waste water and thus the environment. This petition is calling on the government to legislate the requirement for all new washing machines to have discharge filters as of 2021 and to provide incentives to all residents of Canada to install discharge filters on current washing machines. Given what we've seen in assisted living homes in this country and the devastation particularly in Ontario and Quebec, the petitioners are asking for the government to look into assisted living, not assisted dying. Chair, it's an honour to rise to present a petition today from a number of constituents calling for the government to act to uphold the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's calls to action. There is a call to respect the Wet'suwet'en territory and to dismantle RCMP exclusion zones. I am particularly pleased to note that the nation-to-nation talks called for by petitioners between the Wet'suwet'en and the federal and provincial governments have taken place. I would ask members who have presented petitions here in person in the House if they would be so kind as to bring their petitions to the table. patrick weiler (west vancouversunshine coastsea to sky country, lib.): Mr. Chair, I continue to be amazed by how the communities throughout my riding have stepped up to support our most vulnerable at our time of crisis. Dedicated individuals immediately and organically mobilized the Sunshine Coast community task force to coordinate local government, non-profit and business efforts to provide critical services to the community. Social enterprises banded together to form the Sunshine Coast food service response, which provides ready-made meals and donates to food banks. Persephone Brewing and others deliver groceries to at-risk customers both on the coast and on isolated islands. The 101 Brewhouse + Distillery and Bruinwood Distillery quickly retooled their business to supply much-needed hand sanitizer to local hospitals and other front-line workers. COVID-19, like all crises, has highlighted true leadership in our society, and I am grateful for what they and all of our health care workers do every day to get us through this. Chair, the Prime Minister and his cabinet have shown they're unwilling to put the protection and safety of Canadians ahead of political interests. Either purposely or because of ignorance, he left out the fact that doing so is a criminal offence with a five-year prison sentence. The Minister of Public Safety said he wouldn't target hunters, but then he went ahead and banned numerous bolt-action hunting rifles and made owning a shotgun a criminal offence. They have ignored our rampant drug crisis, and they have weakened sentences for serious crimes, all while saying they take these issues very seriously. Today they tell us they are banning a new Liberal-invented type of firearm, a military-style assault rifle. The Liberals would rather make people afraid of hunters, farmers and sport shooters than deal with the real issues like drugs, gangs, illegal smuggling and crime. Chair, it is in our most difficult moments when we truly see stunning displays of human spirit and generosity. On that note, today I wish to recognize the work of the Humber River Hospital in my riding of Humber RiverBlack Creek and to congratulate them on the success of their Humber front-line support fund and PPE drive. Not only have they been on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic keeping our residents safe and healthy, but thanks to the generosity of those both in my riding and beyond, the Humber River Hospital has raised over $1 million and received over 400,000 pieces of personal protective equipment. This will be invaluable to the hospital as they continue to work with us and fight the good fight to keep us all healthy. I thank all those brave workers at the hospital, and I thank those generous individuals who have donated to this important cause. member for AbitibiTmiscamingue, Mr.Lemire, to take the floor. sbastien lemire (abitibitmiscamingue, bq): Thank you, Mr.Chair. For several years, he had been using his fight against cancer, which he led with the help of natural products only, to ensure cancer services and care were improved, particularly in regions far from major centres. Mayor of Preissac, in the RCM of Abitibi, StephanLavoie passed away yesterday. I would like to extend my condolences to his wife, Anabelle, to his entire family and especially to his daughter, Astrid, who is only 20months old. Through his humanism, StephanLavoie was a warrior, a visionary and a great source of inspiration for all of us. My thoughts also go out to the citizens of Preissac, to whom he leaves a dynamic legacy, and to the leaders of the Abitibi community. In our first conversation, he said to me, and I hope the House will echo it forever, that all of our decisions must be made with our children in mind. anthony housefather (mount royal, lib.): It is with great sadness that I rise today to pay tribute to Tristan Roy, after his tragic passing exactly two weeks ago. Born in Saint-Fabien-sur-Mer, Tristan became a pillar of the MontRoyal community in1997 when he bought the old MontRoyal newspaper. When the city's oldest newspaper, the TMR Weekly Post ceased operations, Tristan registered the name and renamed his newspaper the TMR Poste de Mont-Royal. He created a truly bilingual newspaper, ensuring that TMR residents could receive their news in both French and English. I join Mayor Philippe Roy and the members of the town council in offering our sincere condolences to Tristan's wife, Anne-Marie, his daughter, Aril, and his son, Lancelot. We all considered Tristan to be a friend, an example of what a good journalist and editor should be and could be. richard lehoux (beauce, cpc): Mr.Chair, if you didn't already know, people from Beauce are proud. There is Marie-PhilipPoulin of Beauceville, who was named the best female hockey player in the world earlier this year, or AntonyAuclair of Notre-Dame-des-Pins. AntonyAuclair said, in a CBC article, that Beauce had prepared him for his arrival in the NFL. There is also GuillaumeCouture, from Sainte-Marie, who made his mother very proud, and everyone from Beauce indirectly, on the program Les Chefs again last night. It is this same pride that I see throughout the region, with companies like Revtech Systmes, in Saint-Joseph-de-Beauce, or PuriHaze, in Sainte-Marie, which have invented robots to decontaminate spaces. There are also local purchasing initiatives such as the #onlaici campaign by the Nouvelle-Beauce chamber of commerce and industry or Achetons beauceron, by the Saint-Georges chamber of commerce. Chair, our government has shown leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic by ensuring that Canadians remain safe and get the financial assistance they need. The Canada emergency business account and the Canada emergency wage subsidy ensure that the economy is ready to start up post-pandemic. Seniors received top-ups to the OAS and GIS, and families, the child care benefit. All of these measures are helping thousands of seniors and low-income families in my riding of Don Valley East. I want to particularly thank Saravanaa Bhavan and Happy Pops for donating food and frozen treats to our superhero front-line workers at local hospitals. Chair, even though this year's festivities for Italian Heritage Month will be done differently, the same spirit and vitality exists throughout virtual events happening across the country. Virtual events have seen Italian Canadians, through their generosity, raise over $1 million to help Italy during COVID-19. The Italian Canadian story remains one of passion, an adopted homeland filled with hard work, sacrifice and optimism. Chair, as communities begin to ease restrictions, I remain mystified that, according to this government, Parliament is not an essential service. We in the opposition have been long calling for the return of Parliament, which would be possible while still maintaining public health guidelines. While the work we do in our constituencies is incredibly important, it is equally important to bring those voices back to Ottawa to debate, to question and to hold the government to account. The role of the opposition is crucial now more than ever when billions of dollars are being spent with little oversight. Chair, I would like to take a moment to highlight displays of generosity in my riding of Brampton East.  Khalsa Aid has been providing food supplies with the help of Sperenza Banquet Hall, which has graciously provided the space to run a province-wide campaign out of Brampton East. Care4Cause has sent hundreds of prepared meals on a weekly basis to Good Shepherd Ministries to lessen their load. Navraj Brar at Pharmasave has offered free care packages to health care workers and hand sanitizer to the Peel Regional Police. Aujla Salon and Spa has partnered with GlobalMedic to help deliver over 10,000 pounds of food to local food banks. I would also like to point out the heroic efforts of our truck drivers, taxi drivers, grocery store clerks, nurses, doctors, paramedics and countless other front-line heroes. Thank you to everyone in Brampton East who has stepped up for their neighbour in their time of need. You are setting a great example of the kind of progress we can make as Canadians when we come together and support each other. bruce stanton): We'll now go to the honourable member for WellingtonHalton Hills, Mr. They tried to give the PMO the control over this House in motion 6, and yesterday's report confirms that they rigged the leaders debate in their favour in the last election. Parliament sat through two world wars, the October crisis and previous pandemics and it survived the test, but not now. Parliament and this House of Commons with its full powers needs to reopen and it needs to reopen now. Chair, these past few months have been tremendously difficult for so many Canadians: sickness, losing loved ones, job losses, economic hardships, loneliness and isolation. It is in these times of suffering and adversity that we have seen Canadians coming together to support each other and that brings us hope. Mosques, churches, synagogues and gurdwaras have all answered the call to help their communities. Whether it's providing meals to the hungry, clothing for the cold, or technology for those who need it most, these actions are true reflections of the kindness and generosity that Canadians are known for. While there are too many groups to mention them all, I want to thank Vikas Sharma and Care4Cause out of Brampton for the meals that they have been providing their community in that area and across the GTA. This group and thousands of others like it across the country are working tirelessly to ease the suffering of others and help those in need. Chair, I rise today in honour of National Indigenous History Month to speak truth about a history of racism in Canada that was built on the wrongful dispossession of lands from indigenous people and controlled through the use of police-state violence that has resulted in a loss of life, freedom, respect and dignity. Even today we continue to observe this reality in my very own city where we witnessed the killing of three indigenous youth by police in a span of 10 days this past April. Canadians are rising from coast to coast demanding this of all of us and sending a clear message that we must address systemic racism in all of its forms to ensure justice for all. julie vignola (beauportlimoilou, bq): Mr.Chair, Canada Post is literally not delivering the goods. But the postal service is an essential service, and even more so today because everything is done online, even local shopping. The current crisis partly explains the congestion, but it is mainly due to the fact that Canada Post forgot to join the 21stcentury. In the immediate term, Canada Post must deal with the delays, and to do so, it needs the help of the Government of Canada. As I said, the postal service is an essential service, and it's time to give it the importance this status imposes. This is a result of the temporary collapse in demand for our most valuable commodity and the one that contributes the most to our GDP, our balance of trade, and whose taxes support the social programs Canadians enjoy, $108 billion in GDP, $8 billion per year in government revenues, $77 billion in trade surplus. It is a rude blow to hard-working professionals who soldier past negligent government policies that have left a stain on another generation of western Canadians. We're talking about an industry here that directly employs over 200,000, including 11,000 indigenous Canadians. Bad policy cannot permanently erase the work, the hope and the pride of forward thinkers and doers, and their efforts to continue building a great country. Chair, today I want to give a special thank you to the health care workers at Victoria General Hospital, who are serving patients in our community here in Winnipeg South. Every day, doctors, nurses and staff work selflessly to take care of those in our community who need it most. Whether it's by keeping seniors connected with their families by using iPads or making sure that patients go home with a special care package, staff at the Vic are doing extraordinary work to make this difficult time just a little bit easier. I would also like to give a big shout-out to our wonderful small businesses in Winnipeg South that continue to show their appreciation by preparing meals for the hard-working staff at the Vic. Folks in our community continue to show what it means to be exemplary Canadians, and it is a great honour to represent them. andrew scheer: Mr.Chair, the staff of long-term care facilities for seniors are showing exceptional courage and dedication. justin trudeau: Mr.Chair, like all Canadians, I am deeply grateful for the extraordinary work that the Canadian Armed Forces are doing in long-term care facilities in Quebec and Ontario. We will continue to support them, but we know that having military personnel in our long-term care facilities isn't a long-term solution. Chair, now that Bell Canada has decided to partner with Ericsson to deliver its 5G network, the Liberals will undoubtedly ban Huawei, but the Liberal inaction on Huawei is just another example of this government's weak leadership. Instead of deciding for himself a year ago, the Prime Minister is forcing the business community to make the decision for him. Why couldn't the Prime Minister have shown some backbone and banned Huawei a year ago? right hon. Chair, our approach every step of the way has been to listen to experts, to work with allies and to listen to the counsel of our security and intelligence community, which has been looking into this issue. We know we need to make sure that Canadian businesses, Canadians and Canadian infrastructure are protected at the same time as we remain competitive in the world. andrew scheer: The fact of the matter, Mr Chair, is that it hasn't. The former public safety minister, Ralph Goodale, promised in this House over a year ago that an answer on Huawei would be coming. Here we are, it's June 2, 2020, and they still haven't made a decision. Chair, the President of the Treasury Board wrote to cabinet last week and said that transparency is important even in a time of crisis. She's refusing to tell us how much of a bonus she gave to the departing head of the Canada Infrastructure Bank. At a time when Canadians are struggling, it is disgusting that the Liberals are paying out bonuses to someone who accomplished nothing. Will the Prime Minister have a little respect for taxpayers and tell us exactly how much of a bonus the CEO of the Canada Infrastructure Bank received? right hon. Chair, the mandate of the Canada Infrastructure Bank is to find innovative ways to finance some of Canada's biggest infrastructure projects by leveraging private capital. The remuneration range of the former CEO has been in the public domain for more than two years. The bank is moving into its next phase of development, now under the leadership of the new board chair, Michael Sabia, and will play an important role in the recovery when the time comes. Chair, as I said, the remuneration range of this former CEO has been in the public domain for more than two years. In regard to further payments, we do not comment on personal HR and financial information of individuals in government. The Canada Infrastructure Bank was a Liberal scheme designed to protect the investments of private investors and put all the risk onto taxpayers. They might try to claim that it's arm's length and that they can't divulge this information, but we know that Minister Champagne personally intervened in the decision regarding the bonus of the Canada Infrastructure Bank's CEO. Chair, five years ago, when we first got elected, we had to turn around the underinvestment that Stephen Harper's Conservatives had made in infrastructure across the country. Even during the depths of the 2008 recession, the investments they made were for things like doorknobs and signs. yves-franois blanchet: Mr.Chair, well before 1867, in what became Quebec, in New Brunswick, in Acadia, in Ontario and in the west, lay the seeds of what later became the provinces of Canada and Quebec. It can therefore be inferred that Canada is a creature of the provinces and that the provinces are not creatures of Canada. Could the Prime Minister read his answer to this question: who pays for the health transfers to the provinces? right hon. justin trudeau: Mr.Chair, we have a country with a number of levels of government working together to serve Canadians. In times of crisis, but also in good times, Canadians expect that their governments will work together to provide the services and the care that they need. yves-franois blanchet: Let me remind the Prime Minister that all the provinces and Quebec are asking for increased and recurring health transfers that are unconditional and sustainable. Who pays for the all-too-meagre benefits made available to the seniors of Quebec and Canada? right hon. justin trudeau: Mr.Chair, we have worked with Quebec and the other provinces to make sure that we invest in health transfers. We have made transfers of $500million, that's halfabillion dollars, because of the recent COVID-19 crisis. yves-franois blanchet: Mr.Chair, the Conservatives have backtracked on the wage subsidy, and I congratulate them for that. Who pays for the part of the wage subsidy program that will be going into the coffers of the Liberal Party of Canada? right hon. justin trudeau: Mr.Chair, since this crisis began, we have made investments to protect jobs and workers, including accountants, human resources managers and receptionists. We are in the process of ensuring that people with all kinds of jobs in all kinds of organizations will be able to keep those jobs. yves-franois blanchet: Mr.Chair, it is comforting to know that they are a little richer now, but some companies are under threat because the Liberal Party is a little richer. Who is going to pay for the fact that one company has been chosen by a closed call for tender? One company has been awarded a private contract, probably a foreign multinational, probably for 2021, while we are perfectly capable of doing the work in Quebec and in Canada. Who is going to pay for this gift to a private company that will be doing the Government of Canada's work? right hon. We are in the process of helping workers and helping Canadians by means of measures like the Canada emergency response benefit, the Canada emergency wage subsidy and with the assistance to companies, We will continue to do what we must do to help workers all across the country so that we can come out of this crisis together. yves-franois blanchet: Fundamentally, my impression was that, in a crisis, civil society turns to the state to find and implement solutions. I see that, in this case, and in all its operations, the Government of Canada takes money, about 20% of which comes from Quebec, and gives it to a private company, possibly a foreign company, so that it can tell us what will happen, although the first wave will have come and gone for a year already. justin trudeau: Mr.Chair, Canadians expect their government to look after their health and the health of the economy. We are here for workers, we are here for families, we are here for our seniors and for our students. yves-franois blanchet: Mr.Chair, as I see it, the Prime Minister is contracting out his job with taxpayers' money, a part of which is going into his party's bank account for the next election. Is that the only explanation of his role he has for the residents of Quebec, a role that is currently protected by a crisis? right hon. justin trudeau: Mr.Chair, all across the country, including in Quebec, people are worried about their jobs because of the crisis that the pandemic is causing. We are providing a wage subsidy to organizations and to companies to ensure that people will receive their paycheques in order to support their families and pay their rent. The Prime Minister has the power to do something about the anti-black racism that Canada is faced with. Will the Prime Minister end racial profiling in Canada against black people once and for all? right hon. Chair, this government was the first government to recognize anti-black racism, systemic discrimination and unconscious bias and to take concrete actions against them in the context of the UN International Decade for People of African Descent but also in the context of a country that stands up for human rights and protects everyone. We have made significant steps forward, but there is so much to do, and I look forward to working with all members in this House to do just that. Chair, our justice system unfairly targets in many situations racialized Canadians, including indigenous Canadians and black Canadians. We know we need to improve our justice system and rates of incarceration and we will work on it. jagmeet singh: Will the Prime Minister end the over-policing and over-incarceration of black and indigenous people? right hon. Chair, systemic discrimination means that people of colour are at greater risk of being incarcerated than others when facing negative outcomes in the justice system. jagmeet singh: Will the Prime Minister make sure Canada is collecting disaggregated data on the impacts of COVID-19 on racialized people, particularly indigenous and black people? right hon. Chair, not just on COVID-19 but on all ranges of data, we've made investments over the past years to Statistics Canada so that they are better able to collect data in a disaggregated fashion. Disaggregated data will help, and we're working with provinces on the COVID-19 data. Will the Prime Minister commit to ending the over-incarceration, over-policing and racial profiling of indigenous people? right hon. Yes, we need to work to ensure that the rates of incarceration for indigenous people and for racialized Canadians are reduced. There are many measures we're working on to move forward to make our justice system fairer, to reduce systemic discrimination and eventually to eliminate it. I asked the Prime Minister if he will commit to stop taking indigenous kids to court, and if he will stop delaying the response to the murdered and missing indigenous women and girls calls for justice. We have been working over the past year with partners on the ground to formulate the measures and the response that needs to move forward. Many of those partners over the past months have been engaged in keeping their communities safe and working hard on that, and that has delayed the putting out of the report. jagmeet singh: Will the Prime Minister stop taking indigenous kids to court when it comes to indigenous child welfare? right hon. Chair, we agree that we need to compensate kids and indigenous peoples who have suffered harm at the hands of our child and family services over the past decades and we will do that. jagmeet singh: Will the Prime Minister commit to not just pretty words but real action ensuring that all indigenous communities have access to clean drinking water? right hon. Chair, the NDP needs to know that we have eliminated over 80 long-term boil water advisories through our work over the past years, and we are on track to eliminating all of them on time by next spring. They do not have access to clean drinking water, and communities are going off the list only to return back on to the list of boil water advisories. It would be great if the members opposite talked about some good news instead of just highlighting the very real problems that are there. Chair, we continue to manage our fiscal situation in a responsible manner, and we'll continue to do that. pierre poilievre: How much does the Government of Canada owe to the People's Republic of China? hon. If the member would like to send my office questions directly, I'd be happy to provide this information. They still haven't provided answers to the questions, in particular the question regarding who owns Canada's foreign-held debt. How much of that debt is owned by lenders from the People's Republic of China? hon. We'll get to it in order, as we work through this crisis, making sure we focus on Canadians first. Chair, we'd be happy to provide information in this regard should the member wish to send a request directly to my office. Chair, moving along to the impacts of the debt on our people, how much would a 1% increase in the effective interest rate on Canada's national debt cost Canadian taxpayers? hon. I'd be happy to get financial calculations to the member if he'd like to send those directly to my office. Chair, we'll try a different question, then, as we're not getting any answers. Chair, I'd be happy to get this information to the member, but I would acknowledge that as we manage the treasury function for the Government of Canada, we look at the short term, the medium term and the long term. We think we have come up with a responsible approach to managing the ongoing debt that we have as a country. Chair, it turns out, according to Department of Finance officials, that less than 3% of Canada's recently added debt since March is for terms of more than five years. Why has this minister made Canada so susceptible to future interest rate hikes by failing to lock in the $371.5 billion of new debt he's added in the last two and a half months? hon. Chair, we continue to manage the treasury function of the Government of Canada in a responsible way, making sure we consider what debt should be issued in a short term, a medium term and a long term, which we've been doing as the Government of Canada during our entire term and as previous governments have done as well. pierre poilievre: Canadians would be wise not to hire this minister as their mortgage broker if they're looking to get the best rate. How many Canadians would experience bankruptcy in the next 12 months if interest rates were to rise by an effective one percentage point? hon. I would make the observation that what we've been working to do during the course of this pandemic is to support Canadians and support Canadian families by providing them income during a time when they don't have access to income because they're actually at home. We think that has supported them in a very, very positive way that allows us to ensure that we will have a continuing economy when we get through this crisis. pierre poilievre: Unfortunately, we will have a $1-trillion debt when this fiscal year comes to an end. How much will the finance minister try to raise taxes if interest rates on that debt rise by, say, 1%? hon. I think the approach we've taken, with the emergency response benefit and the wage subsidy, has been particularly critical for enabling Canadians to get through a very challenging time. bruce stanton): The floor goes to the honourable member for Beauce, Mr.Lehoux. richard lehoux: Mr.Chair, my question goes to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. Day after day, I speak with those involved in the world of agriculture and with witnesses appearing before the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food. marie-claude bibeau (minister of agriculture and agri-food): Mr.Chair, we have made commitments to producers all across the country. We have also increased our contribution to various other programs, specifically in the meat sector, for pork or beef producers, and food processors. richard lehoux: Mr.Chair, I have been hearing the same answers for several weeks now. We are going to determine where the gaps are and we will identify the sectors that most need our assistance. richard lehoux: Mr.Chair, the government promised to set its share of the business risk management programs at 60%, even if a province or territory does not participate. Through the AgriRecovery program, we have provided $50million for pork producers and $50million for beef producers. richard lehoux: Mr.Chair, when will that transfer be made? Can the minister simply give us a date? That is all we are asking. marie-claude bibeau: Mr.Chair, I would really like to be able to give a date, but the answer depends on each of the provinces. richard lehoux: However, Mr.Chair, the minister has told us that she is ready to transfer the funds, whether or not the provinces add any to the program. How does the Minister of Agriculture intend to make major changes to the various risk management programs by July, when the government has itself pushed back the federal-provincial-territorial meeting of Ministers of Agriculture to October? We have been meeting by Zoom for some time now. marie-claude bibeau: Mr.Chair, I meet with my provincial colleagues every week, either by conference call or by Zoom. As for the AgriRecovery program, once again, the provinces have to implement it and it is their choice to contribute their share of 40% or not, in whole or in part. richard lehoux: Mr.Chair, if I understand correctly, there will be no changes to the various programs before November. The sectors of agriculture under supply management, like eggs and poultry producers in my constituency, who have been promised compensation for a long time, want to know when the money will be transferred to the producers who are working tirelessly to feed our country. Our commitment to them in terms of compensation in response to the three free-trade agreements is still firm. I am thinking, for example, about the advances that many SMEs and farmers in my constituency could implement in their companies. When will I be able to tell my constituents that reliable Internet service will be available in their homes? hon. marie-claude bibeau: I assure you that we recognize the importance of the Internet in rural regions. We are working with our colleagues, the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry and the Minister of Rural Economic Development to speed up the implementation of programs along those lines. anthony rota (nipissingtimiskaming, lib.)): We'll now proceed to Mr. Chair, for the Minister of Public Safety, Minister Blair, how many times has the list of banned firearms changed since May 1? hon. bill blair (minister of public safety and emergency preparedness): My understanding is that an order in council was made on May 1, and we have not made any changes to that order in council. bill blair: I suspect the member may be referring to the work that the RCMP has been doing through the Canadian firearms program in order to apply the order in council that was passed. glen motz: How many .22 calibre rifles, firearms, are on that banned list? hon. The member may be referring to a weapon that the RCMP has identified as using an AR-15 frame, which of course mr. bill blair: That's another bit of mistruth and deception put out by the gun lobby. In fact, there was a weapon called the Blackwater AR-15, which was a real gun that was prohibited, but the toy gun, the airsoft one, was not. Why is the RCMP continuing to add firearms to the prohibited list after the list was published? hon. Chair, it is a very important that the RCMP, as the agency responsible for administering the Canadian firearms program, continues to do its diligence to keep Canadians safe. glen motz: Why has there been no notice given to firearms owners, retailers or the police of the many changes to the banned firearms list? hon. Chair, it is very important that the Canadian firearms program and the RCMP continue to do the important work of ensuring that Canadians are kept safe. glen motz: How many firearms have been transferred between licensed gun owners and/or retailers since May 1? hon. bill blair: Again, I do not have that information and, as the member probably knows, records are not kept by the government or by law enforcement about the transfer of firearms that are not restricted. glen motz: How many firearms have been retroactively changed to prohibited since May 1? Of the firearms that have been transferred, how many now are retroactively prohibited since May 1? hon. Chair, to be very clear, on May 1, by order in council, we prohibited 1,500 somewhat different types of firearms, all based upon a military design. glen motz: Since that time you have added almost 700 more, and none of those meet that category you are trying to establish. If a firearm that was not on the original prohibited list was transferred since May 1 and now that firearm appears on that prohibited list, are those transfers subject to a criminal prosecution? hon. bill blair: Again, the member is asking me a question that is solely the responsibility of the law enforcement agency of jurisdiction, and that is their decision, not ours. glen motz: The minister has said that the issuance of firearm licences and transfers was stopped recently due to a printer failure. bill blair: I have absolutely no knowledge of the allegation the member has just made, Mr. glen motz: Maybe the minister needs to check with his officials and find out who actually did the ordering. What does the minister believe to be the estimated cost of the firearms confiscation plan? hon. We will, however, be bringing legislation forward at the very first opportunity to facilitate a buyback program that will treat Canadians who purchased these firearms fairly. glen motz: You can't buy back something that you never owned in the first place, Mr. If this minister doesn't know the cost, maybe he's as incompetent as our Minister of Finance. I am wondering, Chair, through you, why the law enforcement notes were removed from the firearms reference table? the chair: I want to remind the honourable members that parliamentary language is something we need to respect in the House. I'd just like to advise you and this House that our purpose is to protect the lives of Canadians, and we are taking strong action to strengthen gun control. We are not influenced by the gun lobby or by gun manufacturers, only by our interest in keeping Canadians safe. eric duncan (stormontdundassouth glengarry, cpc): Thank you very much, Mr. I want to start by thanking the government for listening to my proposals a couple of weeks ago regarding the extension of benefits for vulnerable Canadians who may not have been able to file their income tax by this week's deadline. There are millions of relieved seniors with GIS and parents with the child tax benefit and GST who now know they have a bit of time and protection and aren't to be cut off from their benefits. I'm hoping to go two for two here today, so there's no pressure to the Minister of Public Safety. I certainly support, and I think we support in this chamber, the idea of the extension for travel. However, it's now been three months since many spouses have seen each other, and there are Canadian and American children in custody arrangements who have seen their parent only on one side of the border or the other. After stating for months that reunifying families wasn't considered essential travel, I am thankful that he and the Prime Minister have now said that it is. Will the minister agree to the safe and fair proposal we outlined in our letter last week, which would exempt spouses, children and those with medical needs travelling back and forth with accompanying documentation, so that we can get people and their families back together? hon. bill blair: I'd like to thank the member for what I think is a very important question and I want to assure him that I have had similar conversations with members of this House from all parties and representing all parts of the country. Because there is a great deal of concern in our communities and from our provincial and territorial partners about the movement of people across our border, any change has to be discussed and negotiated with our provincial partners. Some of them, you may be aware, have expressed some concern, and we're addressing those concerns because we respect their concerns. At the same time we are working very hard, and I am very hopeful that we'll be able to resolve this challenge to the satisfaction of the many Canadians you and everyone else represents. the chair: I want to remind the honourable members that when they are asking or answering a question, they should speak through the Chair and not directly to the other member. I will just note that the Canadian and American governments have worked with provinces, as we have with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, to repatriate Canadians from around the world. I believe there is a precedent and I believe there is a background there, and I think we can, through an order in council or whatever measure, get people back with their families. Can the minister explain why reunifying families needs to be any different from repatriating Canadians from other countries? hon. bill blair: Again I thank the member, because this is a very important issue and it's important to us as well. We have been working over the past couple of weeks very diligently on trying to find a resolution of this problem, because it is never our intention to separate families and we have all heard some very heart-wrenching concerns that have been raised. At the same time, I think it's important to work very closely, as we have done, with our provincial and territorial partners to ensure that we address the concerns they have raised. We are prepared to move forward and we are working very hard to resolve the concerns that were raised so that we can have a positive answer to those many families, and we the chair: We will go back to Mr. They spend about five months of the year in Texas and five months in Cornwall and would generally travel about two months of the year. However, she couldn't come up to Canada because of the restrictions that have been put in place, and it's certainly putting a strain on them. Can the minister confirm that the three concerns we outlined in our letter are being discussed as part of reaching a solution or a resolution as soon as possible? The three concerns are that spouses and long-term partners can be reunited, that children with child custody arrangements can see both of their parents, and that if somebody needs to travel back or forth over the border for medical appointments, they can do that and can stay with their spouse. bill blair: What I can confirm is that we're working hard to make sure we keep families together. I want to reiterate, because you raise a very important point, that when people cross the border they're still subject to the quarantine orders of public health. If the travel is deemed essential, that is an exception, but if it is not deemed essential, then a person must go into quarantine for 14 days. That's one of the concerns the provinces have raised with us and one of the assurances they have sought. the chair: Before we go to the next line of questioning, I want to remind the honourable members that we have interpreters who are working very hard to translate from one language to the other. I therefore ask you to speak a little more slowly out of consideration for the interpreters, who are doing a really good job. The loss of the Regina International Airport would be devastating, not only to the city of Regina but also to southern Saskatchewan. The Liberal government has made a great show out of allegedly providing $330 million in assistance to airports through lease deferrals, but here is what it's not telling people: Airport lease payments are already tied to revenue and have been for many years, so when an airport's revenue goes down to zero, its lease payments to the federal government go down to zero, pandemic or no pandemic. bill blair: The Minister of Transport has been working very closely with airports, large and small, right across the country. We've been in touch with each of the airports, and we've been working very hard to help them manage through these difficult times. We know that in some circumstances, continued operations at smaller airports have not been possible, but wherever possible we have done our very best to try to accommodate the very real financial challenges these airports are experiencing. Chair, Canada's airports are teetering on the brink of bankruptcy and the Liberal government's response has been to defer their lease payments. government's CARES program is providing $10 billion in grants and low-interest forgivable loans to support American airports. Will the government commit today to saving Canada's airports with a similar program of grants and forgivable loans? hon. Chair, we have worked very hard, and continue to do so, to make sure we provide supports to regional airports right across this country. We know how important air transport is to such a vast country and we know the tremendous work they do. We're going to work very closely with them to make sure we provide the right supports to help them get through this difficult time, because we know how important they will be to the eventual restart of our economy. Airports are vital to Canada's economy, providing over 200,000 jobs nationwide and paying $13 billion in wages and $7 billion in taxes. However, now Canada's airports are on the brink of collapse, and the government has stood idly by as airports have lost over 90% of their revenue. Last month Joyce Carter, chair of the Canadian Airports Council, called on the government for a three-point plan for airport recovery. It includes the permanent elimination of ground leases, substantive loan and bond guarantees and a special plan to support smaller airports that provide vital supplies to rural and remote communities. Could the minister inform the committee if the government has done anything in response to the Canadian Airports Council's request? hon. bill blair: I would make the observation that all of our smaller regional airports are vital to the communities they serve. The Minister of Transport is in regular communication and in ongoing discussions with airport authorities, large and small, right across this country on how we can continue to support them. There have been a number of proposals made by the industry itself and by some of the regional airports on what form that help can take. I believe it is clear that Canadians need our help, and we are there for Canadians to help them get back on their feet when we get through this pandemic. Chair, the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Japan have all started free trade negotiations with the United Kingdom. We, of course, are going to make sure that we will always act in the interests of Canadian businesses, and I want to assure Canadians that CETA continues to apply to our trade with the United Kingdom. I would like to know how many full-time and part-time employees are currently working for the Liberal Party of Canada. pablo rodriguez (leader of the government in the house of commons): On a point of order, Mr.Chair. I am not sure that the number of employees at the Liberal Party, the Bloc Qubcois, or the Conservative Party is relevant to government management. the chair: I am not sure whether that is a point of order, but I will let Mr.Therrien continue. I would like to know how many people work full time and part time for the Liberal Party of Canada. alain therrien: Mr.Chair, I know that they think its funny to pilfer taxpayers money from government coffers. bill morneau: I do not know how many people work for the Liberal Party, but I can say that the emergency wage subsidy is for all sectors of the economy. That is how we can protect employees across the country who are working for businesses facing a reduction in revenue of 30% or more. alain therrien: They have 157MPs and they have known for two weeks that we are working on the wage subsidy. In an article in La Presse on May25, Liberal Party spokesman Braeden Caley said that between 75and 100employees were receiving wages subsidized through this program. bill morneau: I am very focused on our concern, which is to protect Canadians across the country who are working for businesses facing a reduction in revenue of 30% or more. How many employees in the Liberal Party of Canada are threatened by the pandemic? You should know; it's your party. We want to make sure that they have enough money to meet the challenges that they are facing during the pandemic. alain therrien: I would actually say that they want to have enough money for their next election campaign. I would like to know how much taxpayers' money has been taken from the emergency wage subsidy program and will be used as election loot for the Liberal Party of Canada. bill morneau: The emergency wage subsidy program allows us to protect 75% of the income that employees were earning before the crisis, to a maximum of $847. alain therrien: Mr.Chair, since I am not getting an answer, let me share with you the very simple calculation I cobbled together. If we multiply that amount by threethat's three months, since it started on March15we get over $1million. That is the amount they will have put in their pockets, to be used as election loot for the Liberal Party. Given that the Liberals are extending the emergency wage subsidy, will their party continue to help itself to the money? hon. the chair: Mr.Therrien, you can ask a question of no more than 15seconds. alain therrien: They have already taken $1million out of the register, so that is settled. First, are they going to pay back that $1million? Second, I hope they will not be taking another $1million by September. bill morneau: We will continue with our approach to protect employees and businesses needing it during the crisis. During the previous Parliament, our government made significant investments in the CBSA and the RCMP, and provided funds to provinces and territories to invest in programs that combat gun and gang violence and support our communities in providing positive alternatives for youth engagement and activities. This is something that we pledged to do during the last federal election and something that victims' groups, law enforcement and everyday Canadians called on for decades, but we must know that we need to take more action to keep our communities safe. Can the minister tell the House and the constituents of NewmarketAurora what further steps our government will take to keep Canadians safe? hon. Chair, I'd like to begin by thanking the honourable member for NewmarketAurora for his question and for his advocacy on behalf of the safety of his community. Chair, building upon historic investments that we made in the last Parliament in law enforcement dealing with guns and gangs, we took the important next step in our promise to strengthen Canada's gun control by prohibiting weapons that many in the law enforcement community, including the Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police, have said have no place in our communities. We will build on these early steps by strengthening our work and our laws at the border, by taking steps to prevent the theft and criminal diversion of guns and also by making significant investments in kids, families and communities where the conditions give rise to gun violence right across Canada. Even during these challenging times, we have seen restaurants and other businesses step up to deliver meals to front-line workers and make donations to our local food banks. I have heard from many small business owners in Scarborough, from dentists to small manufacturers, who are having trouble paying their commercial rents due to the sharp downturn in business caused by COVID-19. They are interested in how programs like the Canada emergency commercial rent assistance program would help them to stay in business, but they worry that these programs may not be able to help if their landlords don't participate. Could the Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade please explain why it is so important that the landlords participate to help small businesses make it through the pandemic and how we are working to make this program a success, not just here in Scarborough but across Canada? hon. Chair, I want to thank the member of Parliament for her advocacy for the people of Scarborough Centre on this really important question. This is why we have stepped up to provide rent relief to businesses while, at the same time, helping property owners maintain the rental income through this crisis. We are asking property owners to do their part in keeping small businesses and their employees to get through these challenging times, and to take advantage of our forgivable loans in order to help small businesses that are the hardest hit by reducing their rent by 75%. We will continue to do what we can to help protect and help our small businesses across Canada from coast to coast to coast. jenny kwan (vancouver east, ndp): The $4-billion Canada housing benefit agreement was announced in 2017. It's supposed to provide up to $2,500 per year to help families in need with their rent. We know that poverty and inadequate housing are barriers felt even more by black, indigenous and racialized people. We introduced the Canada housing benefit as part of the national housing strategy to help people as a bridge to permanent housing, people who are in core housing need, are homeless or at risk of homelessness. We hope all of them come to the table to sign this really important cost-sharing the chair: We will go back to Ms. Only one province has signed on, and there has been no national consultation on how such a benefit program would even be implemented. With so little federal leadership, the Canadian Alliance of Non-Profit Housing Associations has stepped up and done the work for the government. Will the minister adopt those principles and get on with ensuring vulnerable families get the rental assistance they need? hon. Chair, it is really unfortunate that the honourable member thinks that an investment of $55 billion and the commitment of a 10-year federal plan of leadership in affordable housing and community housing is a lack of leadership. The Canada housing benefit is yet another important segment of the national housing strategy, which will ensure people have access to a safe, affordable place to call home. The fact is that two and a half million families are paying more than 30% of their income on rent, and they have been hit hard by this pandemic. Aside from going forward with a housing benefit program, will the government prioritize affordable housing stimulus spending as a key component of any post-COVID stimulus policy? hon. Chair, joining with provinces and territories and providing real help to members of the community who are experiencing homelessness so they can have a permanent roof over their heads is real action. This is a real benefit that is going to households in core housing need, people who experience a core housing need and who need a permanent place to call home. We bought our first hotel to house the homeless in permanent housing, and the government has yet to provide any funding to them. marco mendicino (minister of immigration, refugees and citizenship): I thank my colleague for the question, and I want to extend our sympathies regarding the temporary worker who passed away from COVID-19. Of course, we continue to support workers by ensuring that they have the accommodations and the spacing necessary to work when they are here providing food security for all Canadians. We put in place the regulations and the rules that are necessary, and we continue to work very closely with our provincial partners as well as leaders in this sector so that we can protect workers and ensure that Canadians have access to safe and affordable food. jenny kwan: No one should have to endure such inhumane housing conditions and risk their lives to support their families. They don't have access to health care and they don't have a pathway to permanent residence. Will the minister do the right thing and grant migrant workers health care coverage and ensure the government follows up on the principle that if you're good enough to work, you're good enough to stay? hon. Of course, that is an opportunity we will continue to offer those who are ensuring that Canadians have access to healthy, safe and affordable food. We will continue to make the investments that are necessary to maintain a high standard of professionalism and workplace safety. Chair, fisheries and oceans stakeholders and coastal communities face unprecedented threats from the COVID-19 crisis, and they deserve the support of all levels of government, including their own MPs. Yesterday the Liberal and NDP MPs banded together to restrict the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans to just four hours of sitting in the summer months. Conservatives are ready to put in the hours to support Canadians, while the Liberals and NDP refuse to do the work. When will the Prime Minister tell his MPs to get back to work for the Canadians who need their support? hon. Chair, we all agree that committees are doing extremely important work, and that's why committees are meeting regularly. I would like to remind my colleague that the committees are masters of their own destiny and make their own decisions, not the government. Chair, it took months for DFO to realize that fish passage on the Fraser River was blocked at Big Bar. Now that contract has tripled from $17.6 million to over $52.5 million without a single communications post from the minister's office. Chair, since we found out about the landslide at Big Bar, our government has been extremely active in making sure that the salmon have a passage through. We know how critically important the salmon are to the Fraser River, as well as to the indigenous communities along the Fraser. So far, we've made significant progress, but we know there's more work that needs to be done. That's why we'll continue to work with indigenous communities and the province to make sure that these mr. Chair, the fisheries minister's mandate letter from November of last year directed her to make new investments in fighting invasive species. Canadians on the front line of prevention wrote the minister, and when they got a response five months later, it was devoid of any help. When will the minister follow her Prime Minister's directive and make new investments in the fight against invasive species? hon. We're working diligently to find the answers to deal with some of the problems we are seeing from invasive species. I am committed to making sure that I meet my commitments within my mandate letter, and I will have more to say on that soon. Chair, the list of hunting and sport shooting firearms banned by Minister Blair's order in council continues to grow. Chair, to be very clear, the weapons we have prohibited are weapons that were not designed for hunting or sport shooting but for soldiers to use in combat. As law enforcement leaders right across the country have said many times, they have no place in our community, and we agree. Chair, I continue to hear from constituents in the North OkanaganShuswap who are unable to access supports under the Canada emergency business account or the emergency commercial rent assistance program. Business owners have also lost employees and can't get them to come back to work because of the lack of flexibility in the emergency response benefit and the emergency student benefit. Chair, we continue to look at the programs we've put out to support Canadians to make sure that they are actually having the desired impact. We've committed to extending the wage subsidy, and of course we're looking at all the measures we've put out so we can ensure that people have the support they need during this crisis. Chair, an April 1 letter confirms that Deloitte Canada has been contracted to help supply PPE. Chair, the honourable member is correct that we have contracted with Deloitte to assist us with our operations on the ground in China in order to have an A-to-Z procurement approach to delivering goods the chair: We will go back to Mr. arnold viersen: Can the minister confirm that this was, indeed, a sole-source contract? hon. Chair, there are a number of goods that need to be procured for Canadian health care professionals to be safe, and that's exactly the chair: We'll go to Mr. Chair, I will take that question back to my department and come back to the member with a further, fuller response. The contracts that we are entering into are made by us the chair: We will go back to Mr. arnold viersen: Many of the suppliers that are in contact with Deloitte of Canada are indigenous contractors. Chair, we are in touch with indigenous suppliers, as we are with many suppliers across Canada and internationally. We are working hard to make sure that we have diverse supply chains across the board, and that means including indigenous suppliers in that mix. arnold viersen: Many of these indigenous suppliers have previously been vetted by the federal government and are certified vendors. Chair, the honourable member appears to have information regarding Deloitte's certification processes, which would not be outside what the government itself is doing. I encourage him to come forward with a question that actually responds to fact before the chair: Go ahead, Mr. arnold viersen: Does the minister think that re-vetting suppliers is a good use of resources? hon. I believe that Canada is in a crisis, and I am making every effort to order PPE as Canadian health care workers require. Chair, we are in touch with indigenous suppliers and will continue to ensure that Canada has a diverse supply chain in terms of manufacturers, in terms of products and in terms of countries. Chair, I would like to say that we are continuing to make sure that our supplier list is confidential, because we are in a crisis and we do not want to jeopardize  The Chair: We go back to Mr. Chair, on Friday the association for indigenous business could not name a single indigenous company that had been contracted. Have any of the contracts signed with the federal government between Deloitte Canada and PPE suppliers been filled? hon. Deloitte is assisting with and sourcing manufacturers, and all contracts are signed by the government with manufacturers. pierre paul-hus (charlesbourghaute-saint-charles, cpc): Mr.Chair, we have difficulty understanding the government's management of the border. The order between Canada and the United States has an exception allowing refugee claimants to submit their claims in Canada if they have family here and we accept them. I find it hard to believe that the minister cannot quickly instruct border services officers to allow spouses to enter the country right now. Chair, I appreciate very much the member's intervention and the long list of people he sent to me. Chair, we're working diligently with our provincial and territorial partners to take the steps necessary to enable people to stay united as they cross the borders and enter into Canada, but to do so safely and not put other Canadians at risk. pierre paul-hus: Mr.Chair, letting a spouse come home will not put Canadians at risk. A survey conducted in Canada reveals that a large majority of Canadians do not trust the Chinese communist regime at all and do not want Huawei in Canada. Now that the government no longer has to worry about BCE and Telus, can they say today that no other company is going to use Huawei and that Huawei will be banned from Canada for 5G? hon. pierre paul-hus: Let me remind the minister that we have been working on this for years and that CSIS has confirmed that Huawei is unreliable as far as Canada's security is concerned. The same regime continues to lie to the world about COVID-19, block our exports, and terrorize the citizens of Hong Kong. When will the Prime Minister confirm that he is going to ban Huawei from developing 5G in Canada? It is a simple question. At the same time, the safety and security of Canada's digital environment will be of paramount consideration. We're doing the work required and we're not basing that agenda on some media report, but instead ensuring that all scientific and security factors are taken into account. We are engaged in robust discussions with our Five Eyes partners, including the United States, and all our security agencies. Chair, we'll do the work necessary to the chair: Mr.Paul-Hus has the floor. pierre paul-hus: The minister does not need a sheet of paper, this matter has been clear for a long time. Bell and Telus had each estimated that removing Huawei from their development would cost $1billion. Did the government decide to pay for this under wraps to get out of it? Having said that, my next question is more about the theft on May27. About 90,000surgical masks bound for the Quebec City UHC were stolen from the Toronto airport. Has the minister called for an investigation? When are we going to find out what happened to those stolen masks that were bound for Quebec? hon. Our procurements have reached 101 million surgical masks at this time, and they're being distributed to provinces, including Quebec. the chair: Mr.Paul-Hus, you have time to ask a 15-second question. The police officer is asking me what to do with the cheques and to whom they should be sent. We understand that in delivering this benefit to a million Canadians to date, we had to put more of our integrity measures at the back, but make no mistake: Canadians who behave fraudulently will be held to account, and we will ensure that the money is either repaid or the cheques not cashed. Chair, there remains a concern across Canada that delays in the criminal courts could result in criminals walking free. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court recently said in an interview that amendments to the Criminal Code could allow this backlog to be addressed. Can the minister outline what work has been done to address the backlog, and when we can expect to see it addressed? hon. I can assure him that we are working closely with our provincial and territorial counterparts, who have the primary responsible for the superior courts of justice and therefore the criminal law in their various jurisdictions for the administration of justice in criminal law. I can also say that we have formed an action committee co-chaired by me and the Chief Justice of Canada, again with a variety of different kinds of representation on that committee, to look at the restart of the justice system the chair: We'll go back to Mr. Chair, weeks ago I raised these concerns with the minister over backlogs in the criminal courts and the risk they present to our justice system. The provinces have significant insight into how this can be addressed, and many provinces have been proactive with their court backlogs. We're working to serve in a coordinating role as a repository of information for best practices so that they can be shared across provinces. rob moore: Many owners of small businesses in my riding, and indeed in all of our ridings, are suffering right now and have received absolutely no help from this government because of technicalities. Two weeks ago, the Prime Minister indicated the government was looking to expand access to the Canada emergency business account to include to those who operate their businesses out of a personal bank account. This is something that we've been calling for over the past several weeks, and businesses cannot wait any longer. Can the minister tell me what we should be telling our constituents about those who are caught up based on a technicality and are not able to access this important measure? hon. I want to assure the small business owners in his community and all across the country just how important they are and how difficult a time this is for them. We are hearing you and we are working as hard and as fast as we can to make sure that those business owners get access to this very important support. I would like to highlight, though, that owners of 650,000 small businesses across the country are getting the loan support. rob moore: The lack of access to high-speed Internet remains a major issue across my home province of New Brunswick. The lack of progress and transparency on rural Internet is frustrating for residents, for municipal leaders and for small business owners who are already suffering due to COVID. When will a new plan for rural Internet be introduced, and how quickly can we expect it to be deployed? hon. To date, we've set aside investments to connect a million households, and there's more work to be done. We will be announcing our next steps to connect more Canadians through the universal broadband funds in the days to come. I look forward to communities across the country benefiting from federal investments and the private investments that our investments will bring. rob moore: On the issue of commercial rent, how is the government going to ensure that business owners whose landlords still refuse to participate in the government's program receive the support that they need to stay open at this time? hon. Chair, as the member knows and would understand, rent between small business owners and landlords is a provincial jurisdiction. That said, we've moved forward to try to ensure that there's a process so that those landlords and the commercial tenants can work together to come up with a solution that will work for both. George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Nicholas Gibbs, Colten Boushie, Tina Fontaine, Alain Magloire and Breonna Taylor were not all born on the same side of the border, but they all lost their lives at the hand of the same cruel enemy: racism. We cannot, here in Canada, think higher of ourselves when we are reading the headlines of our neighbour. The final report from the national inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women and girls stated that indigenous women and girls have faced a Canadian genocide. In 2018 a report revealed that a black person was almost 20 times more likely than a white person to be fatally shot by the Toronto police, and a 2019 report exposed systemic bias among the Montreal police force against black and indigenous people. I am asking the Minister of Diversity and Inclusion and Youth, as per her mandate, what exactly our government intends to do now to fight racism among its institutions. If the anti-racism secretariat has in fact been established, what priorities have been actioned? hon. bardish chagger (minister of diversity and inclusion and youth): I would like to thank the member for that very important question. I will state that it is essential that we all work together, not only during this challenging time but during the times that come out of it. This is a resource not only for Canadians but also for government agencies to better the way in which we do work internally as well, including advancement opportunities. That's exactly why we came out with an open, transparent, merit-based appointment process: so that we can see the country's diversity reflected at the decision-making table. I can assure the member and all Canadians that my eyes are open, my ears are open and I am an ally. I cannot experience what it is to be a black Canadian, but I can tell you that your voices will be represented and they will be heard. Why is it that the 12,500 class members who have been determined eligible still haven't received the payments they are owed? These people deserve justice without any delay, especially in light of COVID-19 and the added pressures facing communities. As you know, because of the exceptional circumstance of COVID-19, the class counsel, with the support of Canada, was seeking direction from the courts to issue partial payments to the class members with a valid claim. Once granted, eligible class members can expect to receive partial payments of $21,000 over the coming weeks. Eighty per cent of people who are diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, will die within two to five years of receiving the diagnosis. The pandemic has made it more difficult than ever for these people to access medical appointments and treatment. The lack of urgency to approve new trials and therapies in Canada directly impacts the life expectancy of people with ALS. Can the Minister of Health commit to taking leadership on this file, removing the barriers to accessing these promising treatments and therapies, and ensuring that the costs of these treatments will be covered? hon. Of course the member opposite has my commitment to work with the community and with manufacturers of drugs that are promising for ALS to expedite approval in a safe way that protects the health of Canadians but also provides treatment in an affordable way for all Canadians. Chair, I can't breathe and I'm tired, and today we've heard a lot of progressive words from the Prime Minister, but he hasn't really said anything. If the Prime Minister will not provide leadership in this House, will anybody from his cabinet here today commit to taking concrete steps to address anti-black racism? hon. The open, transparent, merit-based appointment process is resulting in the decision-making table better reflecting Canadians. Chair, will the member then commit today to make it a legal requirement to collect race-based data across all the ministries? hon. Chair, the recently announced immunity task force is providing disaggregated data to decision-makers, because decisions need to be based on science and evidence. It is also not lost on the black community that the former Toronto chief of police, the architect of this country's largest profiling program under the guise of street checks or carding, was made this country's Minister of Public Safety by this Prime Minister. As the tragic consequence of the unlawful, unconstitutional and racist practices in Toronto, black people are 20 times more likely than non-black people to be murdered by police. Does the Minister of Public Safety now admit that the police practice of street checks and carding is in fact a significant factor in Canada's systemic anti-black and anti-indigenous racism, and will he act to immediately end it today? hon. I know from experience that there is nothing more corrosive to the relationship of trust that must exist between the police and racialized communities than the issue of racism or the biased influences of those decisions. Chair, racial profiling is not only abhorrent and unacceptable, it's in fact unlawful. It's contrary to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and it's contrary to the Canadian Human Rights Act. We are working diligently within all of the federal agencies under my purview to ensure that all officers receive training on culturally competent and bias-free delivery of service. matthew green: Nobody knows better through experience about the corrosive practice of street checks than I do. Will the minister now apologize to the black community for the harm caused under his tenure as chief of police? hon. matthew green: Bill C-51 was introduced by the Conservatives and supported by the Liberals, including this Prime Minister. Each province was mandated to enact anti-terrorism protocols, which became a direction for the local police to engage in the practice of street checks or racial profiling. Given what he has said today in the House, will this Minister of Public Safety work to repeal the changes made under Bill C-51? hon. Chair, I will repeat for the member opposite that racial profiling and bias in the delivery of policing service is not only unacceptable and abhorrent but unlawful. It's contrary to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms; it is contrary to the Canadian Human Rights Act. It cannot ever be tolerated in policing in any place in Canada, but we learned from the lived experience of black and indigenous communities, who tell us that this is still their lived experience, so there is a great deal of work left to do. martin champoux (drummond, bq): Mr.Chair, I will be sharing my time with the honourable member for Joliette. Supplementary unemployment benefits, or SUBs, give employers the opportunity to enhance their employees' employment insurance benefits when they need to temporarily lay them off. A number of companies, including Soprema in Drummond, have done so with the guarantee that the government would maintain the SUB terms when employment insurance is converted to the CERB. However, surprise, surprise, when the employees applied for the CERB in May, they found that they did not meet the criteria because the amount of SUBs they have received exceeded $1,000, the CERB income limit. In addition, they must reimburse the CERB because they found that they were not eligible for it. So, what does the Minister of Finance intend to do to correct his error? the chair: We will pause for a second. I had 10 seconds left by my count on my time before I was cut off, and I would appreciate, given the seriousness of the conversation here today, if the honourable Minister of Public Safety will please answer the question: Will he apologize to the black community for the irreparable harm that was caused by the racist process of street checks and carding? the chair: The way I work it is that if there are 15 seconds or less, we go on to the next one, because it's not really enough time to ask a question and get an answer. Chair, SUB plans that existed prior to March 15 are very much alive and in place for companies, employers and their employees. The CERB allows employers to top up an employee's wages to the maximum of a $1,000. Chair, in order to deliver this important critical benefit to Canadians, we had to go outside of the EI system. Employers can contribute as much as they want, and they were assured that this would be the case with the CERB. Let me put my question to the Minister of Finance again, in the hope that he will be the one to answer it. As we can all appreciate, delivering a benefit of this magnitude as quickly as possible to as many Canadians as possible, both those who were EI eligible and those who were outside of EI, resulted in our having to take some decisions to streamline processes and the system. gabriel ste-marie (joliette, bq): Mr.Chair, I will continue on the subject of supplementary unemployment benefits. The victims are thousands and thousands of workers who have to reimburse the Canada emergency response benefit, as my colleague just explained. I also have the question my colleague from Drummond asked: why is the government not doing the same thing it does with employment insurance and not counting the benefits paid out as part of earned income? It is simple. Chair, as legislated, we needed to set up a straightforward, simple benefit to deliver to as many people as possible. gabriel ste-marie: Mr.Chair, the truth is that the government has forgotten the thousands of workers covered under a supplementary unemployment benefit agreement. Chair, let me clarify that employees who were covered by a SUB plan prior to March 15 are indeed covered by that plan. We're working with employers to make sure that their workers have this benefit, regardless of whether or not the CERB is in place. Those who accessed EI after March 15 have been streamlined into the CERB process, and their employers can help them with up to $1,000 a month. However, the government says that, after the fact, it changed the rules that had previously applied, and it is no longer honouring its agreement. As I understand it, the government does not want to straighten out the situation, and that is unacceptable. Chair, I want to reassure the honourable member that we have moved quickly to deal with the unprecedented volumes at Service Canada. We have set up a 1,500-agent call centre to help people through the CERB, as well as redeploying 3,000 additional staff to make sure that people are helped through the EI process. As of December 31, 2019, the total number of pending veterans' disability benefits applications had already grown to over 46,000. Chair, I thank my honourable colleague for the question and for giving me the opportunity to respond to the Parliament of Canada from my home in Midgell. As I indicated earlier in the House of Commons, I can assure the member that one of my major priorities is to make sure that we deal with the backlog and that the veterans of Canada receive the benefits they truly deserve and need. brad redekopp: Those 46,000 applications from December of 2019 represent over 30,000 individual veterans. As you understand, with this pandemic there are some difficulties, but we are processing the same number of decisions daily. brad redekopp: On March 10, we learned that the average time that a veteran was waiting to have their disability benefit application processed had grown to 32 weeks. Chair, as I indicated, what we're doing is working to make sure that we streamline the process, make sure that some of the applications can be done automatically. Some cannot, because we have to make sure that what's provided to the veteran is adequate for the disability they the chair: We will go back to Mr. On March 10, the deputy minister of Veterans Affairs committed to providing the veterans affairs committee with an updated, written plan on how the department will resolve this backlog. Chair, I can assure my honourable colleague that of course the veterans affairs committee does vitally important work. My department is now working to make sure that the report itself reflects the reality we now face with the situation in the country. Chair, I'm sure that the department had a draft plan prior to COVID-19, so I wonder if Mr. Chair, I can assure my honourable colleague that we are working diligently to make sure that this report is prepared, and prepared properly, for the committee. As I said before, I fully understand the importance of the committee and the great work it does the chair: We'll go back to Mr. brad redekopp: Can the minister give us a timeline of when this report will be given to the committee? hon. I want to make sure that the report itself reflects the reality of the situation to make sure that the committee the chair: We'll go back to Mr. Chair, of course this all ties in to the report that the veterans affairs committee is waiting for and to make sure that we're in place in order to make sure that the automatic approval can work and to make sure that veterans receive the proper the chair: We'll go back to Mr. brad redekopp: If automatic approval is implemented, does the minister know how many applications this measure will remove from the backlog? hon. Chair, it will remove a number from the backlog, because quite simply, if you're skydiving out of a plane, you're going to have knee problems, and if you're a gunner, you're going to have ear problems. To make sure that the veteran receives the appropriate remuneration the chair: Unfortunately, that's all the time we have for today"

        "Query": "Summarize the discussion and opinions on choosing a stylish fruit for remote design.",
        "Summary": "The market research conducted by the Marketing department suggested that the ideal design for the remote should be spongy and resemble a fruit or vegetable. After considering options like banana, apple, and pear, the banana was chosen due to its appealing color and recognizable shape. The Marketing team believed that the current trend of incorporating fruits and vegetables into fashion in Milan and Paris indicated that a remote with a similar style would be both fashionable and technologically innovative. They also considered the pear as a potential shape for the remote, as it is easy to hold and preferred a spongy material for its durability. The Project Manager supported the use of spongy material and prioritized the inclusion of a wheel, as it would set their remote apart from competitors. Additionally, the Project Manager agreed that the banana would be a suitable choice due to its ease of identification.",
        "Article": "I think to sum up the last meeting , would be to say  the requirements that we've  set out . Those are we were going to go for what seemed to be a fairly minimal design based on  a small joystick , L_C_D_ and a couple of other buttons for navigation  with power being I suppose one of the main single purpose buttons .  we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via a small transmitter with any luck , the idea to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design  looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck . So we'll just crack on ,  like to maybe start with the Industrial Designer if it's possible . industrial designer: I'll just project manager: This  meeting is the conceptual design phase and is  Sorry about this . And is to cover things like  what the parts might be made of , can we  outsource these from elsewhere ,  will we have to construct any items ourselves ? industrial designer:  I have a presentation I just saved it in the  the folder .  joystick we'll probably if we're gonna use it ,  could be plastic w or rubber even as well .  can either use a hand dynamo , or the kinetic type ones , you know that they use in watches , or else  a solar powered one . project manager: the kinetic one , we've 'cause that's the ones where like you the movement causes it . project manager:  the bat  the battery for a a watch wouldn't require a lot of power , would be my one query . project manager: Is a kinetic one going to be able to supply enough power ? user interface: There's also a watch moves around a great deal more . project manager: Which I suppose as well would allow us to go off the shelf again , you'd say ? industrial designer:  .  one is a flat one , and then more original ones are single curved one or one with a double curved .  the materials are tha there as you can see , but  you can't have a titanium one for a double curved , project manager: marketing: Titanium , the really strong metal , titanium ? industrial designer:  which would be Yeah , marketing: Is it not also it's expensive ? industrial designer: and light .  , I don't know if you'd be able to off the top of your head or not , the single curved and double curved , would you be able to give an example ? industrial designer:  . project manager:  could you maybe draw something ? I you don't doesn't have to be perfect , it's just 'cause I'm not quite sure if I understand the difference between the two . Well for a curved , well I was thinking to f for to sit in your the palm of your hand . industrial designer:  which obviously it looks better than the single curve , but  you can't have it in titanium , which is  a nice material . industrial designer: and for the buttons ,  it can have the scroll wheel which they use in mouses for com P_C_s .  but  it requires a more expensive chip to use , and if you wanna use L_C_D_ it's even more expensive .  if you want the buttons to be oh yeah , if you have a double curve  control and it's rubber , then you have these rubber buttons as well . But you're gonna ha I reckon you're gonna have to have  key a number keypad anyway for the amount of channels these days . You wouldn't want to just have to scroll through all the channels to get to the one you want .  so you've got a little bit about the the chip that we might require as well ? industrial designer: Yeah . So , depends where gonna spend the money if you want the f fancy L_C_D_ display . project manager: do you have any idea so far , like when we're saying that we'd need an advanced chip for an L_C_D_ , does that in shoot the cost up by a drastic amount ? Or ? marketing: Need an advanced chip for the L_C_D_ . project manager: if you press a button that sends a certain transmission through the infra-red , whereas I think if we're controlling the L_C_D_ we definitely require a much more powerful chip . Yeah ? industrial designer: Yeah i project manager: Okay ,  should I go on , or go back ? industrial designer:  marketing: if we only have twelve Pounds fifty , twelve Euros , not even twelve Pounds . Twelve Euros , what's that , like eight pounds or something like that , nine Pounds ? project manager: Well we'd also be relying on the  the bulk buying in producement and such . If you go to the one before that  so it just says what it does , translate the key press into an infra-red signal and this is received by the T_V_ .  the chip just needs to detect the signal or detect the key press and then  it'll send it to the tr the amplifier . industrial designer: And  then the next slide just shows how the  copper wires  interact with the buttons , the rubber buttons ,  to  get sent to the chip . So in the information that you've been supplied , how feasible would you say that the idea of using an L_C_D_ looks ? industrial designer:  I think we can do it if  we use conventional batteries and not have solar cells or kinetic . project manager:  I'm not sure if there's any cost differences between single and double curved and I'm I don't know about anybody else , but plastic or rubber as a traditional form of casing would seem to be a good way forward ? .  I'm actually gonna be bold and go oo go straight for rubber  for reasons I'll go into  in more detail . Now I'm gonna have to work between the  the slides and the  and the white board project manager: Yeah .   I was given a an H_T_M_L_ file giving  various ideas from  from other previous remote control designs , and pretty much decided to just dump them all . I wasn't very impressed by them and they didn't seem to re  nothing I saw seemed to meet the sorts of design specifications that we're going for today .  so what I ra rather than looking at other remotes ,  ra oomp be better to simply look at the human hand .  and try and f  and try and figure out a way of laying out the elements we've already decided on ,  so that if r a if so that the finger is e each finger or thumb is wherever it needs to be already .  and what we've basically decided on was the the  the joy  the joystick , two function buttons and the L_C_D_ , just keep it paired down to the absolute minimum . I don't actually think we need the  the numeric keypad because if you m because one of the menus that we could have available  v via via the L_C_D_ is one where you scroll through channels , so if there's something f and be bear in mind since this isn't meant to work for  marketing: digital . user interface: f f f for di for digital or  or for or for cable , whatever , industrial designer: Ah , okay . user interface: you're basically looking at four or five terrestrial channels , and then  your V_C_  and then the channel through your V_C_R_ and or D_V_D_ player . You must have two two modes , basic mode , where  the joystick's  left right left right for channels , up down for volume ,  and the   and the menu mode for  further functions .  now the reason I was particularly interested in using rubber for this is that if we're going to have a highly ergonomic design ,  it needs to be ergonomic for left or right handed people . project manager: That would suggest the double curved design's probably going to be most appropriate , then . user interface: basi basically what I basically what the what be having  , I would say , the the whole thing articulated at two points , so that if you if you're handing it from a lef  left or right handed user you can adjust it so that the  the L_C_ the L_C_D_ and the  The joystick would be in the right place . And also this is a rather nicer de  design gimmick that the the  you know the whole thing you know it should have sort of organic feel to it project manager:  . user interface: that it should be , you know , soft to touch and can be moved around all nice . Just to let you know we'll probably be quite tight for time as well , user interface: Okay . project manager: because I think you've probably got a lot you'd like to say , I guess . The  Assuming the hand the hand to be in about sort of this position ,  hol  holding the remote , the  the joystick unit should rest over the  the joint of the f of the  four finger so that it's directly accessible for the thumb .  and it would need t there would need to be a it would need to be articulated just below that so that it could be switched around for  left or right handed users . You then have a grip section that can be more or less the same irrespective of handedness . You just have big two big buttons that cover most of the area so it can in the upper part , one for the four finger , one for the middle finger .  , and that marketing: Is this the joystick ? user interface: Th this part here is the joystick . And you then have , at the  at the bottom , the L_C_D_ , and this would need to be articulated as well . And again , this part could be rotated , so it can So so so that it can be adjusted to either left or right handed user .  So the t  the top function button in basic mode would be the on off switch and menu mode would be the enter button . So I thought th the simplest way around that would be to have  a cable to connect it to the computer some some fair iv fairly fairly simple software on the computer just so that you on your computer just so that you could  pr program it at a rather in a rather more comfortable interface . And you could download programs for it from  for  T_V_s from all sort of main manufacturers .  though you i it would be necessary to have  have a m  have a ha have a mode for programming it without the computer ,  just in case there are there are still people left out there who don't have them yet . We compared  whether people want the remote control to do a lot of stuff or they want it to look cool . And then we we research  fashion trends in Europe , what's what's the new black , project manager: Okay .  we found , in order of importance , people want the remote control to look cool more than they want it to to be cool . As in they want it to do a lot of good s they want it to look like it does a lot , and if it does do a lot that's a bonus , but they don't care so much , you know . People want it to be that , but s still they care more about the way it looks than what it does . And easy to use , it it just so happens that  from the second point to the third point is twice as important  the second point is twice as important as the third point . People want it I is it has to be cooler than easy to use , you know , if it has the newest features , even if it's difficult to use , prefer it to have the newest features . The fashion , now this is seems a bit odd to me , but fruit and veg is the new is the new black for furniture , for clothes , for shoes . project manager: marketing: But I I see I come on to that in the next in the next slide . If it's the type of rubber that you can squeeze , you know , it's spongy , then can I skip the rest ? industrial designer: Oh yeah , I forgot to mention that . marketing: So  so my personal opinion ?  we want something fancy and techni technologically innovative , obviously . But what we what we need is something that looks like it's from the future that looks cool , that's that's different , you know , that's everyone has a white remote control , black remote control , you need something cool .  now the fruit and veg options , either we we go in that direction or we stay totally away from it .   the research did come up with fruit and veg , so maybe it is important for it's the up to the interface guy . So if we stay away from it , s you know stay away from it , but if we're gonna go along with it then it doesn't necessarily have to be like an apple or something like that , or a kiwi fruit . It could be something like , I say potato peeler but I'm sure you guys have a have a much cooler idea than I do . I think maybe they were I don't know , back in the day when they first came up with remote controls , they had a reason for it being project manager: So  if we want something strong and sturdy , I say stay with plastic or titanium , but if we go with spongy , we can stress that you can drop this as many times as you want , it doesn't matter , it's spongy material , it's not gonna break , you know . I just don't know how the L_E_D_ and the lights are gonna fit into a spongy material because it's not gonna be completely squeezable . So how do things fit it ? And if we are gonna use spongy , we can say it's long lasting , you know it's damage resistant and stuff like that , so . So just to summarise , people want stuff that's cool , that's that looks like it's cool , and if it is cool then that's a bonus doesn't have to be  people like fruit and veg . If we're gonna use spongy material we have to think of how practical it is , and how we can further promote that idea . So , things change all the time , every year you know they they always talk about this year , this is the new black . project manager: Well ,  I would say that the most you could probably hope for is gaining a year's lead on most people anyway . You always have to bring out new designs , so if we can get next year then that's possibly a good place to start anyway . project manager: Seems like a a lot of the components could be off the shelf , so I don't exactly what cost would be incurred .  I can see your point about the number keypad , but I've I would say that we can probably incorporate it into the menu system if you need to do traversal of a large number of channels . industrial designer: project manager: My feeling would be that even if at a later date this was to be taking control of  boxes as well  having the use of the L_C_D_ and the joystick would probably allow you to manipulate enough channel numbers for you to be user interface: Yeah , actually if you've got a lot of channels , the number keypad can be quite annoying as well , becau it's you know if you're trying to remember what  , you know , what number's the discovery channel or whatever . user interface: But if you h but but but if you have a me but if you have a menu structure , then you can sub-group them . project manager: So what it looks like to me is we'll use a large number of standard components , say something like  lithium ion battery , the kind that you find in most  small hand held devices now . Though I'd have to say depending on how flexible it is , we might need to have some kind of inner frame . user interface: Yeah , I I would say definitely ,    the the idea of having it sort of articulated i th there would be basically two points of articulation . So project manager: Do you think there's any way we could maybe remove the articulation ? I can see why it looks appealing , but it could be a weak point in  the structure , do you think ? user interface:  . industrial designer: If you're going with the fruit and veg thing , looks like a banana . user interface: I d I don't thi I don't think that it would be a a structural weakness , marketing: . marketing: user interface:  if you have a firm s sub-structure , you can then incorporate articulation into that . If you then have a sort of outer skin of  flexible , spongy rubber then you have something that is you know very much you know organic , and I think would look rather co  mi rather cool .  my drawing there doesn't doesn't do it justice , it makes it makes it look more a little bit more like a vibrator than a than a  than a remote control , project manager: user interface: but  . industrial designer: project manager: However , one interesting point is , I don't know how serious you were there , but we if we take some of the ideas why don't we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the des the colour of the logo ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: It's an certainly a different colour from your average  user interface: Make it harder to lose , as well . project manager: Was there anything in your research marketing: The noise for when you lose the banana ,  f yeah , for when you lose the remote control , it could be like a a monkey noise or something like that , rather than a standard beep beep . industrial designer: project manager: marketing: Y you know , you lose the monkey the banana , industrial designer: monkey . project manager: marketing: y you lose the banana , you press a button , and you hear like monkey screams or something like that to direct you towards the banana . user interface: I th   if it I think that's something that could perhaps be programmable , though maybe have monkey as default . Now I think it'd be cool if you had one remote control that could work with all T_V_s , you know you s you click a button and it finds the frequency that works with your particular television . marketing: But why you'd need to program it like as as a standard feature , I I don't know . user interface: Well basi basically the  for f for   e each manufacturer will have a partic will have a particular command set that  the T_V_ responds to . user interface: So  usually what's done is you have this big booklet full of different possi you'll have all of them sort of programmed in to the  remote , and you'll have this little booklet of codes you then find your  ma  find your manufacturer marketing: marketing: That's because televisions , they don't give the remote control any type of feedback when you send it . user interface: So that's that's quite annoying and we probably would still have to do that . But if we had  some sort of hook-up to your computer as an option , then if you've got a computer you can avoid that rather irritating thing . project manager: An interesting point is that if the person doesn't have the computer , we can still make the process easier because instead of having to look up codes , maybe we can have it that one of the options they have is that they look up the name of the company on the L_C_D_ user interface: Yeah . project manager: Or we have the remote control just go through them until it's like does this do the correct function , and such . marketing: Is it is it actually a book of names to digits , or is it like a few pages ? user interface:  booklet . This person probably need to use this feature like once , you know , when you first buy the remote control , or whenever they buy a new television , so user interface: Yeah . project manager: Doesn't have to be used very often marketing: once every s project manager: that's right , yeah . marketing: and it's user interface: And it's a nuisance very close to the to  to actually purchasing it , so it's something that you're likely to be thinking about . user interface: If you if there's w i if there's one in the shop that's that says it can avoid much of that nuisance , you might be favourably inclined towards it . project manager: Okay , this just to give us a rough idea of what we're meant to be doing for the next stage .  I think we've decided on what , you know , decided on standard items for most of  rubber and such , so we're now looking at the detailed design and what we need to be doing for the next meeting .  So for example ,  I'll just start at the top , you've got yourself and the Industrial Designer gonna be working quite closely at this stage 'cause it'll be hard not to , obviously .  The user interface design , They're kind of it looks they're the idea I've pushed forward so far is maybe more of a physical one there , whereas possibly be more interested in maybe how the L_C_D_'s going to incorporate , do you think ? user interface:  . project manager: Or do you s perceive that most the design design decisions still need to be based on the physical layout ? user interface:  well I I think other than ge getting a sort of more aesthetically pleasing form for it ,  mo most of the sort of layout design decisions are are made , I would say .  but then again , the  the menu structure to to a considerable extent that's gonna vary according to the model of television , and also any customisations that the user might wish to incorporate . So  and one of the nice things about having an L_C_D_ and a menu structure is that there is that flexibility to it . marketing: Yeah , you see I don't some of these things kinda logically follow the others . project manager: I I think we'd be yeah , no , it'd be more a case of how do we envisage us performing the product evaluation once we have a model to test with . project manager:  so it'd be a case of do you think that just bringing users in to have them test it out ,  maybe putting a certain number of products into the field in certain places which I suppose is quite similar . project manager: Or just kind of hitting the streets and you know saying this is a new remote control , what do you think of the look of it ?  marketing: Okay , sure . At this stage we still have no no target audience or project manager: I think the target audience is pretty much anybody under the age of say maybe sixty or something ludicrous . project manager:  the reason I'm saying that is we're just looking at a a replacement remote control , something that's stylish , so maybe you're even just maybe you're narrowing down your target audience simply by saying marketing: And it's stylish . project manager: if they're buying it that often or they're maybe looking to replace something then , they've got a bit of free cash , so that puts them potentially in the younger age bracket . project manager: Although of course  at twenty five Euros , I don't think we're looking at charging the earth for the  device . U_S_B_'s definitely one of the cheapest interfaces out there , but it might push the cost of the overall unit up 'cause it would require not just the connection but the chip for communicating with the rest of the system . project manager: The the idea was that maybe it could connect up for  allowing a software interface on the P_C_ for a larger programming industrial designer: Oh right , okay . project manager: due to the fact that we've gone for such a nice , easy minimal design , normally . marketing: We've w definitely talking some type of industrial designer: But didn't they just say it's just for T_V_ , or are we gonna project manager: It's just for T_V_ , but for marketing: Different . project manager: programming it to use your T_V_ , you might hook it up to the P_C_ . project manager: I'm not sure , but I'm thinking maybe that the additional cost of the U_S_B_ might be prohibitive . user interface: Yeah , marketing: But you're gonna need some type of flash memory or something . marketing: you wouldn't have to redo the whole thing once the batteries are changed , you know , once you turn off the power . The other thing  it  it would need to ha it would need to have  some sort of on board memory anyway . user interface:  f for one for one thing because I do think that the menu system should be    although you know , it's not going to be terribly complicated if it's just controlling one device , the menu system ought to be  o ought to be customisable and  marketing: Different languages ,  different skins and stuff like that . How  how  how you want say the  the the menu structure for flicking through channels if you've got lots of channels . I if it was customisable as in different languages and stuff , that does open it is supposed to be international , right ? So . marketing: It would make sense if you could project manager:  and we'd better be careful about the time as well . project manager: So  user interface: Where is the clay ? marketing: project manager: do I think we've got an idea of where we need to go for the next meeting , would you say ? marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: they're going with the fashion thing , like the design , spongy rubber . I th I think I would largely want to actually steer clear of the whole sort of fruit and veg thing . project manager: We seem to have quite a general consensus that the idea of the the r rubber could be quite marketing: Yeah . user interface: I having it i having it sort of br bright yellow I think that's quite a good idea , though maybe we could have options for colours as well .  we are trying to promote a remote control , but we wanna keep the company brand as well , user interface: project manager: So we always need to remember that somewhere we're meant to be getting the slogan on . Possibly I'm think I'm not sure but I'm seeing a little bit of space around maybe the joystick area which could be used . I was like like I said before I I think we should have the R_R_ on the  on the top function button "

        "Query": "What is the final conclusion on the discussion about the criteria of ease of use, learnability, and intuitiveness when evaluating the product?",
        "Summary": "The Project Manager and Industrial Designer had a discussion about the second layer of the remote, with the Project Manager expressing concerns about its complexity, but the Industrial Designer reassured that users wouldn't need to pay much attention to it. The group unanimously agreed that the scroll wheel was superior to average remotes, giving it a score of two on this criterion. They also agreed that the remote scored highly in terms of locatability, initially assuming it would be intuitive. However, the Industrial Designer mentioned that it might take some time for people to get used to the scroll wheel as it was a new technology. The Marketing team believed that its usage was obvious. As a result, the group decided to give an average score of five for this criterion.",
        "Article": "Therefore, in accordance with Standing Order 17.22, I call for nominations for a temporary Chair, for the duration of the meeting. sian thomas: Any further nominations? I therefore declare that John Griffiths has been appointed temporary Chair, and I invite him to chair for the duration of today's meeting. We will move on then to item 2 on our agenda, the continuation of our inquiry into targeted funding to improve educational outcomes, and evidence session 8. Would you like to introduce yourselves for the record, please? meilyr rowlands: Meilyr Rowlands, chief inspector. If it's okay, we'll move straight into questions\u2014we have quite a number of questions to get through this morning. I just want to start by asking about your perception of how schools are using the pupil development grant funding, and to what extent they are genuinely targeting that funding exclusively towards children eligible for free school meals. Estyn has made several reports regarding the effectiveness of the grant, and, really, going back to before this specific grant, to a similar grant, called RAISE. At the start of this grant, the funding was often spent on tackling underachievement, rather than dealing with the underachievement of children who are eligible for free school meals specifically. That's not to say that the targeting is working perfectly still, and I think that we are seeing examples where the targeting isn't going just to children who receive free school meals. In terms of what schools are doing with the grant, we have given evidence to you of the kinds of things that they are doing. They are tracking progress of pupils, they are trying to improve attendance, they are trying to work with families and the community in general, they're doing work specifically to improve how\u00a0children are doing in exams, in key stage 4, specifically\u2014a lot of funding is being spent on that\u2014improving the confidence of students, taking students on extra-curricular activities, improving literacy and numeracy. llyr gruffydd am: Because the research by Ipsos MORI and the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods has shown that there is some kind of blurring\u2014I think that's the term that they use\u2014in terms of who is eligible. You referred to the fact that it is used, perhaps, to reach a slightly wider cohort than just those who are eligible for free school meals, but you do feel that that balance, from your experience, is acceptable. It was being spent on children who were underachieving, and one of the things that we did notice in the first report was that much more funding was being spent on boys than girls. And, of course, that raised the question immediately that it wasn't being spent then on children who are eligible for free school meals, because those\u00a0numbers are equal. So, I think that schools are perhaps not following that exactly, but within the spirit of the grant, I think I\u2019m fairly comfortable. There is a specific question\u2014I don\u2019t know if you are going to ask this\u2014regarding more able and talented pupils. meilyr rowlands: So, if there is a cohort of pupils who are missing out on this, they are the more able and talented pupils who receive free school meals. One of them is that there\u2019s still some feeling that less able children should be receiving this grant, children who are underachieving. It seems that they are doing okay, but if they were given more support, they would do even better. llyr gruffydd am: So, is it a lack of awareness of the nature of the grant, and that the individual has to be targeted rather than just those who are underachieving? Is that the problem? Or is it the regime that focuses on exam results and the need to draw those pupils who are underachieving up, rather than incentivising those who are achieving\u00a0to achieve better? meilyr rowlands: A bit of both, I'd say. I was in a conference for headteachers last week, where there was new data being discussed, and that data showed the progress of children from a certain point, year 6 tests. I think that kind of data will be very useful, because what that data can do is help secondary schools to identify\u00a0more able children and that they are underachieving. john griffiths am: Mark, did you want to pursue these matters further? mark reckless am: Yes. It was good to read in your report an increased emphasis on this and to see your awareness of its importance in the PDG as well. Can I just ask\u2014? Would you look at one area regarding\u00a0schools' engagement with the Seren network, particularly\u00a0for the more able and talented, and what more Estyn can do through its inspection criteria and otherwise to encourage this from schools? meilyr rowlands: Well, I think Estyn has always been very strongly focused on improving the performance of more able pupils. For example, in last year's annual report I raised it, and a lot of the debate around this now, I think, was generated by some of the things I've said in previous annual reports. Paul Flynn, I think, did the\u2014no, who did the report? Paul Murphy did the report. And on Seren, I'm particularly proud that my alma mater, Jesus College, is a very strong supporter of the Seren work. And we look at the performance of more able pupils in all our inspections.\u00a0It's a particular part\u00a0of our inspection framework\u2014looking at the relative performance of different groups. So, we look at the different performance of boys and girls, free school meals and non-free school meals, ethnic minorities, but we also look at the performance\u00a0of more able pupils in particular, and we question schools about how they provide for the more able pupils, and we've referred to Seren in several of our inspection reports. mark reckless am: And where schools work particularly hard to engage with Seren and take up opportunities from that and push as many pupils as appropriate to work with that, is that something that you would recognise within your inspection reports? And, on the other side, where schools\u00a0don't do that, is that something you would\u00a0pull them up on? meilyr rowlands: Yes, we've done that. claire morgan: Throughout our inspections, we are looking for best practice, because part of our strategy is always to identify where there are weaknesses, but actually to point schools in the direction of where they can find a solution. llyr gruffydd am: Just briefly, you touched earlier on using the measure of those who are eligible for free school meals as a way to identify children from disadvantaged backgrounds so that you can target this funding. Do you have an opinion on whether that's the best way? meilyr rowlands: It certainly is a good way of doing it. There is a strong correlation between children who underachieve and that measure, so it is a strong measure. For example, some people say that if you have received free school meals for a period of time and now you're not receiving them, then perhaps you should still be receiving the\u00a0funding for a period of time, for example. You've reported that the proportion of schools making effective\u00a0use of the PDG remains around two thirds of secondary and primary schools, meaning that a third are still not using that PDG effectively. Why do you think this is? meilyr rowlands: I think that sort of proportion broadly corresponds to the schools that don't have particularly good leadership. I think, ultimately, all of these sorts of initiatives come down to strong leadership and effective leadership\u2014that they know how to organise and use those grants effectively. One of the shortcomings that we often identify is evaluation\u2014that money has been spent on a particular way of using the grant, but it has not been evaluated well. michelle brown am: Are there any patterns by region or type of school in that? meilyr rowlands: I don't think there's any patterns that we've identified in terms of region. What are the most effective uses of PDG, from your point of view? Is there something in particular that you think that schools should be focusing on? meilyr rowlands: I think there's a lot of evidence on what constitutes good practice in this area. There's the Welsh Government guidance, there's our guidance, there's a lot of research\u2014the Sutton Trust toolkit\u2014and they're the sorts of things I mentioned earlier. So, schools do a lot of things\u00a0that they are in control of\u2014the things I mentioned earlier: things like improving attendance, offering extra-curricular activities, literacy and numeracy support, tracking pupils\u2014all those sorts of things. But an important element of this, I think, is engaging with the learners, but also with parents and the community. I think what we've found is that the most effective schools\u2014the ones that really do make a big difference to this cohort of students\u2014are the ones that do that most effectively. claire morgan: I think that there are different situations in different schools, but in the best schools, they evaluate the barriers to learning for their particular children. In Brackla Primary School, in Bridgend, they've got Families at Brackla, and it's a range of activities to engage with families. Families often have had a negative experience of education themselves, and the schools are trying to address some of those concerns. Cefn Hengoed\u00a0in Swansea, which I'm sure many of you know about, have had an extensive strategy for engaging with the community, with the families, and equipping their children to participate in decisions around the curriculum, making them more confident learners. You've made the comment that secondary schools are focusing too much on key stage 4 and not enough on developing pupils' skills in a sustainable way. Can you expand on that and give us a bit more detail on that, please? meilyr rowlands: Yes. The latest guidance on the grant now says that 60 per cent of it should be spent on key stage 3. But what a lot of schools did with this money was precisely that, to target key stage 4\u2014to have catch-up homework clubs, revision clubs, specifically to get children better GCSE results, and getting C grades, in particular. Of course, that is an important part of your armoury of tools to use, but I think there was too much use of that. Part of the problem with that is that it doesn't either develop the long-term transferable skills that those pupils have, or should have, nor does it produce the kinds of skills that the teachers need as well. So, it's kind of a quick win, a quick-fix solution, while what we feel would be more effective in the long term, and more sustainable in the long term\u2014because if this money goes, then those quick fixes won't be possible\u2014what would be more effective in the long term is to improve the curriculum and the pedagogy, the quality of the teaching, the quality of the curriculum, so that children are naturally enthused by what is on offer, that they attend better because they want to be in school, that they want to learn. So, we feel that getting the curriculum right, tailoring the curriculum to the needs of the pupils in that area, and improving teaching, is a more sustainable long-term solution. michelle brown am: Do you think there's anything in particular driving the focus on the key stage 4? meilyr rowlands: Well, again, I think most people would say it is the performance indicators. There was a conference of all the secondary heads in Wales, and that was one of the major discussion points in the conference: how do we get the performance indicators right so that there are no perverse incentives in it? michelle brown am: To what extent are decisions being made in schools concerning the application of the PDG\u00a0actually evidence-based? To what extent are they using research to back up how they're using the PDG or is it effectively just guesswork? meilyr rowlands: I think that, of all the areas of school policy, this is the one that's most evidence-based. I think that, generally, schools can do much more about using evidence and research findings, but this particular area is probably the one that schools are strongest at using research in. That's partly because the guidance strongly suggests that you should do that, but also because there is a lot of easily accessible research evidence available. As I mentioned earlier, the Sutton Trust toolkit is a good example where researchers have really tried very hard to simplify all the evidence that exists in a way that schools can use. So, there are little pound signs to show how costly an intervention is and little stars or something to show how many months of gain pupils get out of this particular intervention. But I think what's missing is that you can't just take that evidence as it is, because you have to implement it in your own school, and that then will affect how effective that particular intervention is. Just because it is evaluated by researchers as being generally very effective doesn't mean that you will necessarily implement it effectively. There's looking at research, but there's also doing your own research and evaluating how effectively\u00a0you have implemented something. hefin david am: Do you think there's an attendance crisis at key stage 4 for those students eligible for free school meals? meilyr rowlands: 'Crisis' is maybe too strong a word, but I think there's been a lot of attention given to attendance, quite rightly. Over a long period of time, I was a member of the\u00a0national behaviour and attendance review board under Ken Reid about 10 years ago.\u00a0So, there's been a lot of attention on attendance, and that's very important because attendance has a very strong correlation with outcomes. hefin david am: Of those students at key stage 4, 35\u00a0per cent of those eligible for free school meals are attending for 95\u00a0per cent of the time, whereas it's 60 per cent for\u00a0their peers.\u00a0Is the PDG making an impact on that? You've mentioned engagement with the curriculum. What more can be done? meilyr rowlands: I think what's happening now is that people are targeting their attention on attendance. It has also improved for these cohorts as well, and at a faster rate than the rest of the cohort. Nevertheless, I agree with you totally that it is a major, major problem, and that is why schools\u00a0do use the PDG specifically to improve attendance. meilyr rowlands: Did I say that? They are using it, and attendance has improved, and the attendance of this cohort has improved more, but there's still a major, major problem. So, I think there needs to be even more attention\u2014 hefin david am: So, what\u2014? I'm looking for\u00a0specifics. What can be done\u00a0with the PDG? meilyr rowlands: I think, as I said earlier, that these are major social issues. So, I think what can be done that hasn't been done currently is to give more attention to the community-focused side of schooling. I think the schools that have done well, that have really improved attendance of this particular group of pupils, are the ones\u00a0that have taken community relationships very, very seriously and worked with parents. hefin david am: Yes, you mentioned working with families when you were answering Llyr.\u00a0How does that happen, though? What does it look like? If I'm a parent, what does it look like? meilyr rowlands: Okay. Cefn Hengoed is a good example of a school\u00a0that has not cracked it but made a lot of progress. claire morgan: Often, in the best schools, the headteachers consider themselves to be community leaders as well as headteachers, and they often set up arrangements where they engage directly with the families of disadvantaged children or children who are underachieving generally. They try to build very strong relationships with the families so that the school is in a position to either\u00a0liaise with different agencies or to bring agencies into the school to address some of the issues that are outside school control. hefin david am: And where does the PDG come into this, and the use of it? claire morgan: This sometimes is used for appointing staff whose role it is to facilitate these arrangements to give one-to-one support to children, to monitor attendance, to visit homes where children are not coming into schools, to try and address what the barriers are in getting them into classrooms. hefin david am: And those lessons you've learned from Cefn Hengoed: how are you going to spread that? How does that get spread? claire morgan: Well, we've done it in a number of ways. We also have conferences as well, where we invite the headteachers from those schools to come and present to other headteachers. But there's also\u2014 hefin david am: This all seems like stuff that's done to teachers. Headteachers tell us that learning about best practice from other headteachers is very, very useful. When we had a conference, and when we looked at leadership and improving schools, Cefn Hengoed, along with a number of other schools, presented, and we had\u00a0very positive feedback from that. So, it is actually schools learning from other schools, and I think the work that the consortia have been doing on school-to-school support as well can contribute to it. hefin david am: We're spreading the PDG very thinly now, if we're talking about attendance, and then we talk about exclusion as well. Is it possible that it can have an impact on reducing the higher exclusion rates for EFSM students? claire morgan: I think it has the potential to. These are often complex issues that schools are grappling with, and they are trying a variety of approaches. Some of the answers that you're giving\u2014they seem to be giving certain examples, but there doesn't seem to be a coherence to it. Where we have very strong strategic leadership in schools, they are more direct in their approach, and they have a very strong strategy. Where there's weaker leadership, sometimes they are trying different things, perhaps in more of a scattergun approach, rather than trying strategies, evaluating and finding out what works. meilyr rowlands: I think it is true to say that it's difficult to distinguish what some of these better schools do with PDG, as opposed to their general money. Schools like Cefn Hengoed will be using more than just the PDG to do this work. hefin david am: And it appears to be a lot about the way things are done, as much as how the money is spent. You've observed that the attainment gap between pupils on free school meals and those who aren't on free school meals hasn't closed significantly at any stage of learning. Is the PDG actually working? meilyr rowlands: Well, I'm in danger of repeating myself now. So, where there have been improvements, it's quite difficult to say, 'Well, that's definitely down to the PDG', and similarly vice versa: if it's not working, it's difficult to say that it's because of PDG not being used properly.\u00a0To come back to something else I said previously, there have been small improvements. Whether you say that that is due to PDG or not is quite difficult, but there have been some improvements. But there hasn't been a major step change in closing that gap, that is true, and I think the conclusion that I draw is that these are major societal challenges and barriers that these young people face. Schools can do a certain amount, and of course they must do a certain amount, but to have a step change you do need to engage with the learners, with the parents and with the community and that's why the more successful schools do actually succeed\u2014it's because they do that. michelle brown am: In most successful schools, how much is the attainment gap being narrowed, in the schools that make the most effective use of PDG? meilyr rowlands: Well, that would vary from school to school. meilyr rowlands: Yes, I could have a list of schools and how much they've closed, perhaps. In 2017, we saw a re-widening of the attainment gap between pupils on free school meals and those not on free school meals. What effect do you think the Welsh Government's changes to performance measures have had in terms of impact? meilyr rowlands: Yes, they definitely had a direct impact on it, and probably there might well be an indirect, longer-term impact as well. But, clearly, changing the performance indicators had a direct, immediate effect, because some of those examinations, qualifications, courses that were typically followed by this cohort of students weren't any longer part of the headline performance indicators. Those sorts of things that many of these pupils used to succeed at, and therefore get the performance indicator for the school, no longer count. So, it's had a direct impact, and it's one of the reasons why it's quite difficult to compare the results of one year and another, because of these changes in performance indicators. Do you think there hasn't been any\u2014? Can we take it from what you've said that there's been a positive improvement, or has it been negative? meilyr rowlands: I think there's a growing realisation that secondary schools,\u00a0key stage 4, is driven overly by performance indicators, and, whatever performance indicator you come up with, there will be unintended consequences. So, it's not, I think, useful to keep changing the performance indicators and think that you will get to a point where you solve the problem. What needs to be done is to have a different approach to accountability that doesn't put so much attention on these performance indicators, because what you're doing is you're just moving the problem around by changing the performance indicators. So, I think the previous performance indicators encouraged schools to enter, for example, whole cohorts to do BTEC science, and that's not a good idea because the GCSE sciences are better\u00a0preparation to go on to A-level science, for example. So, you're cutting out the possibility of progression for those pupils.\u00a0On the other hand, by discouraging\u2014the new performance indicators discourage BTEC and now people are saying, 'We're not offering BTEC at all', and it is suitable for a certain cohort of pupils. So, it's very difficult to get the performance indicators absolutely right if you put so much pressure on schools to actually achieve those performance indicators. darren millar am: I share some of your concern around the unavailability now of BTEC in some schools. It strikes me that the decision to discourage the availability of BTEC, which is what the performance measures do, really is sending a message about vocational qualifications that is not helpful, actually, to many young people for whom vocational qualifications may be perfectly suitable. Is that something with which you concur? meilyr rowlands: I think it's one of the unintended consequences, and what I'm trying to say is that, almost inevitably, there will be unintended consequences. So, you can sympathise with the original decision to change the performance indicators in such a way that it encouraged more pupils to do GCSEs, for example, but it does have that unintended consequence. I wanted to ask you about looked-after children and adopted children, and how effective the PDG has been for those groups of children. So, to begin with, how well do the schools know that the PDG does exist for looked-after children and adopted children? meilyr rowlands: I think what we found\u2014we did a review of looked-after children fairly recently, and we found there was some confusion about where the grant was, who had the grant and how it was spent, and what the priorities of regional consortia were, because I think the grant goes to regional consortia now. So, I think schools aren't quite sure about how it's spent and what the priorities are. But the consortia are now using the grant, and there's some training being offered to schools around emotional behaviour and attachment training. There's some school-to-school work that is now being funded by the grant to share best practice, and there are some individual bursaries to support the work. simon brown: And on other developments, regional consortia, they've have appointed regional LAC co-ordinators, which has been helpful\u2014 julie morgan am: For these particular groups? simon brown: Yes. And, as Claire said\u2014she gave some of the spend that the regional consortia are using, targeted spending. There's an issue about adopted children, I think, because, currently, the pupil-level annual school census data doesn't differentiate whether children are adopted or not. julie morgan am: Could you give some examples of some work that's been done with looked-after children that you feel has been effective? claire morgan: I think we'd probably need to go away and get that from our evidence base. I've mentioned before in this context that this\u00a0previous committee, in the previous Assembly, did an inquiry into adopted children, where we met with a lot of adoptive parents. And one of the big issues that did come out was the fact that there was a great deal of concern about some of the insensitivities in the schools in dealing with adopted children, asking\u00a0for pictures of when the children were born and things like that that didn't show a degree of sensitivity. Do you feel that those sorts of issues are being addressed on a wider basis now, and are they being addressed through this grant, through the PDG grant? meilyr rowlands: We probably do need to come back to you with some more evidence on this. We've got two pieces of work currently that we're doing, which\u00a0will give a little bit more evidence on this. We're doing a piece of work on managed moves and I think that will be helpful\u00a0because a lot of these pupils are subject to managed moves, and that's the sort of thing we'll be looking at in that report: what information is transferred from one organisation and from one school to another. I think that generally hasn't been very\u00a0helpful, and there\u00a0isn't necessarily a good system for exchanging particularly their educational needs\u2014some of the basic things about their date of birth and whatever are transferred, but their educational needs, when children move from one school to\u00a0another. So, we've got a report coming out on that.\u00a0The other piece of work we've been doing is on children who have had adverse experiences in their childhood and how schools deal with those traumatic backgrounds. julie morgan am: That would, of course, be much wider than looked-after and adopted children. But, if you don't mind, we'll try and get you something\u00a0specifically on\u2014 julie morgan am: If you could, because there does generally seem to be a lack of knowledge\u00a0about how effective this\u00a0work is with looked-after and adopted children. You don't have any information about exclusion rates, for example, with\u00a0looked-after children, and the\u00a0way this grant has been used to address those sorts of issues? meilyr rowlands: I think there is some data available. The Welsh Government's statistics on that come with\u00a0a big cautionary note, because that data is subject to a lot of variation\u2014exactly\u00a0what you're talking about, I think: different counties and different\u00a0authorities do things differently. And I think the work we're doing on managed moves is very pertinent to that because managed moves don't count as part of the exclusion. And what about attendance? Anything\u00a0about attendance with looked-after children? Any evidence of\u2014 meilyr rowlands: I'll have to look that up as well I think. julie morgan am: I think, Chair, if we can have some more information on all of this, it would be great. john griffiths am: Okay, yes, we'll look forward to receiving that further information from you. mark reckless am: Could I just ask a follow-up to a response that we had last week when we had the EAS consortium in, amongst others? They told us that the specific grant\u2014the pupil deprivation grant\u2014principally for looked-after children, they were\u00a0responsible for, and that\u00a0certainly the vast bulk of\u00a0that was spent on a specific programme, aimed not at\u00a0LACs specifically, but at all children considered vulnerable at times of transition,\u00a0particularly into year 7. Does that\u00a0strike you as an appropriate use of that grant? meilyr rowlands: I think transition is appropriate\u2014that's quite sensible, but clearly if the grant is for looked-after children, it\u00a0should be spent on looked-after children. mark reckless am: Are there any other comments on that approach? I think, to take up what EAS has said, there were\u00a0difficulties about having\u00a0particular programmes aimed specifically at individual looked-after children, and it was felt that\u00a0they would benefit vulnerable children, who had more transitions between schools\u00a0perhaps than others. Is that a sufficient link to justify how that grant is spent? I think this is\u00a0really in the wider context of how much schools need to make sure this grant goes towards the\u00a0group it's specified for, and to what extent it is acceptable to blur the boundaries of that and\u00a0perhaps this is just an example of a higher degree of blurring than some others. meilyr rowlands: I don't know enough\u00a0about this particular initiative to comment, but I would have thought that looked-after children is a very small group and if you were to blur it that much, then it\u00a0wouldn't be very targeted. I would have thought that if the grant is\u00a0specifically for looked-after children, it\u00a0should be more targeted, but I don't know the details. mark reckless am: Just following up on\u00a0another point, I think you said that the 'PLASS' data\u2014. I apologise that I'm not familiar with the abbreviation, but could you explain if anything was being done to address\u00a0previously looked-after\u00a0children who are now\u00a0adopted and seeking to ensure that they are measured to that data to allow proper tracking. Is that work that's in hand, do you know? Could you just clarify for me the 'PLASS' description and what information system that that refers to? meilyr rowlands: That's the information that schools give formally to Welsh\u00a0Government and every so often, the data that is collected\u00a0formally by Welsh\u00a0Government is improved and expanded. Previously, exclusions weren't collected through PLASC\u2014the pupil level annual school census\u2014and so we\u00a0had no proper data at all on exclusions. Now that's been improved, but I'm afraid I'm not sure exactly what you're referring to here. I think you were saying that previously looked-after children who are now adopted, unlike looked-after children, that wasn't tracked by the PLASC data. Looked-after children are differentiated, but whether they're adopted or not\u2014whether any\u00a0children are adopted\u2014isn't picked up in the data at the moment. mark reckless am: But I think for the grant, it's\u00a0previously looked-after children who\u00a0have since been adopted rather than all\u00a0adopted children, isn't it? john griffiths am: Again,\u00a0perhaps you could clarify that for us\u00a0in the further information that you will provide. meilyr rowlands: Although, you'd probably be better off asking the Welsh Government directly. mark reckless am: Yes, I agree\u2014I think that would be better, but\u00a0just to\u00a0clarify finally from me, Chair: is your point that, if that\u00a0group isn't measured, then it is difficult to target them with this grant,\u00a0and if we want them to be targeted with this grant, we\u00a0should ensure that they're tracked through that data system? meilyr rowlands: Yes, that sounds sensible. Did you\u00a0consider that the Schools Challenge Cymru programme was a success? meilyr rowlands: It was certainly variable. It lasted for a relatively short period of time, so it's quite difficult to be definitive about the evaluation of it, but it was certainly variable. There were improvements overall for the 40 schools over and above the general improvement that there was for all schools in Wales. So, it's quite difficult to say whether it was successful, because that was a fairly limited improvement for quite a lot of money. What strikes one, I think, was the variability in the success of it, and I think that was clear also at an operational level. It was clearly more successful in certain areas where all the various people involved in the work worked together effectively. And, in other cases, they weren't, and there had to be changes in personnel and that sort of thing. mark reckless am: Of the five schools within the programme that Estyn actually inspected in the last year of the programme,\u00a0I think that three of those were in special measures and two required significant improvement. Doesn't that suggest that, as far as Estyn engaged with the programme, your evidence was not to suggest that it was being successful? meilyr rowlands: Not wildly successful, certainly, but many of these schools would have been in those sorts of categories in the past as well. As you say, many of these schools are still struggling schools, so\u00a0it hasn't been a panacea. mark reckless am: Bearing in mind your remarks earlier over the focus on key stage 4, in particular\u00a0the C to D grade\u00a0boundary, what sort of minimum length of time should a programme like this run for if we are to expect success? meilyr rowlands: That's a hugely difficult question to answer, and it is at the core of whether this initiative was successful. There has been research, and people have looked at things like the City Challenge and have suggested that two or three years is too short a period to make a proper evaluation of how successful those particular initiatives were. I don't know of similar evaluations to that particular point in Wales for the Schools Challenge Cymru, but with similar initiatives in England,\u00a0the suggestion has been that you need at least three years to be able to evaluate it properly. mark reckless am: The Schools Challenge Cymru advisers, I understand that Estyn met with those termly through the programme. Can you explain how useful that engagement was, and also perhaps compare or contrast it to the ongoing engagement you\u00a0have with the advisers from the regional consortia? meilyr rowlands: You know, the engagement we had with local authorities, and regional consortia, and with Schools Challenge Cymru advisers\u00a0was not really a problem for us. I think the challenge for Schools Challenge Cymru was that it was introduced at a time when regional consortia were just beginning.\u00a0So, you had a period of time when it wasn't entirely clear what the responsibilities of regional consortia were, compared\u00a0with local authorities. When they were all saying the same thing, having that extra resource, extra money, extra attention, was a positive\u00a0thing; but, clearly, in some cases, that relationship\u00a0didn't always work, and some schools felt that they were being told different\u00a0things by different agencies. mark reckless am: So, is Welsh Government now trying to do, through the regional\u00a0consortia, what it was then trying to do through Schools Challenge Cymru? meilyr rowlands: Well, what you had then was you had all three: you had local authorities\u00a0and regional consortia and Schools Challenge Cymru. I don't think\u00a0what Welsh Government\u00a0are doing now is the same as what they were trying to do in Schools Challenge Cymru, because\u00a0I think what Schools Challenge Cymru did, and did well, I think, was identify that there are a small number of secondary schools that have particular challenges and they need over and above the normal local authority/regional consortia\u00a0support, they need over and above that a certain quantum of support and resource. I think that's specifically what Schools\u00a0Challenge Cymru was trying to do, and that's not quite the same as what the more universal provision of regional consortia is. john griffiths am: Okay, that's all we have time for in this session, I'm afraid. There are some questions that we haven't reached that we'll write to you on to obtain further responses, and there are some matters that you've identified where you need to provide us with further\u00a0information also. May I thank you very much for coming along this morning to give evidence? You will be sent a transcript to check for factual\u00a0accuracy in the usual\u00a0way. Welcome back, for item 3 on our agenda today, scrutiny of Estyn's annual report for 2016-17. We've got a number of areas to cover, but please, Members, feel free to raise whatever issues you think appropriate, because\u00a0the areas that we've identified are a general guide only. Just to start with, what's your opinion about the way the Government has been introducing reforms in this area over this past inspection cycle? In general, what is your opinion about how effective that has been and how much of an impression has it had? meilyr rowlands: Well the seven year cycle encompasses three Governments if truth be told, but there has been a sense of continuity and progress made in the nature of policy work in general, starting with the fundamental things such as literacy and numeracy in the first instance and also behaviour and attendance, as I said earlier this morning. And then they've developed a far more comprehensive scheme that is at the heart of the development of the curriculum and pedagogy specifically. And I think that that general shift from the foundations\u2014of literacy and numeracy\u2014moving towards the curriculum and pedagogy does make sense. And the other trend that we've seen is to promote collaboration and the self-improvement system, as it's called. llyr gruffydd am: So, you think\u2014and I'd agree\u2014that the focus on pedagogy is correct and that this culture that appears to be putting more emphasis on self-improvement, and so on, is a positive\u00a0one. Are there aspects that haven't worked as well in your opinion? meilyr rowlands: Of course, one accepts that one would like to see development and progress happening\u00a0far more quickly, but, even in that instance, we need to balance the need that we all have to see progress with the pressures that are on teachers\u2014there are so many things changing. I think that the most striking aspect in looking back over the past seven years is that all aspects of work in the education system\u2014I'm trying to avoid saying 'schools', because it's more than just schools; it's colleges and the system as a whole\u2014have changed.\u00a0All aspects of that have changed, and I think that we need that\u2014all of those aspects need to be changed and improved\u2014but we need to balance that against the fact that we need to not go so fast, because workload on teachers\u2014. This responsibility of self-improvement means that there is more pressure on teachers and headteachers, ultimately. That's why Estyn was very pleased to collaborate with 15 other bodies to give guidance on workload for teachers, because we have to be very careful to get that right as well. llyr gruffydd am: But is it disappointing, then, in the latest annual report, that you are to all intents and purposes coming to the conclusion that the performance is consistent with how it has been over the past inspection cycle? Would you not expect some kind of progress or something more significant in terms of outcomes? meilyr rowlands: That's one way of looking at it. Another way, as I said earlier, is that all of these things are changing and, under those particular circumstances, that it's a good thing that teachers and the education system have been able to maintain standards and the quality of education. Of course, there is a risk that we are in this situation continuously, and therefore settling for managing to maintain, for me, perhaps wouldn't show enough ambition. Is there a risk that we will find ourselves continually\u2014? As you say, the inspection cycle has seen three Governments. meilyr rowlands: We are in the middle of a period of major change, and you're right that there is more change to come. The new curriculum will reach key stage 4 in around seven years again, so we're genuinely in the middle of this period of change. Perhaps 'revolutionary' is too strong a word, but it is the biggest change that I've seen in my career. Of course, we all wish to see swifter progress being made, but what that means in practice is that you push more changes through, or that you push through the changes that we currently have more quickly. Those are the kinds of practical questions that arise, and you have to remember that, in the classroom, what you will have are individual teachers having to prepare for a new GCSE, a new A-level, and there are new specifications in that regard, and it's a great deal of work. llyr gruffydd am: But you understand the point I was making about the risk of finding ourselves like this continually and therefore to say, if we were to interpret your conclusion in the recent report, that outcomes have been consistent over the inspection cycle doesn't mean that we are pushing enough or that the reforms happen in a way that allows progress in performance terms. meilyr rowlands: I would wish to see that we wouldn't be in this position continuously. I think that\u2014 llyr gruffydd am: But you've just suggested that there are seven years ahead of us yet in terms of introducing these reforms. meilyr rowlands: But I do think that the reforms, in looking at them holistically, are fundamental, as I was saying. Well, I think one of the things, and it's difficult to answer that question, but one of the things that hasn't worked in the past is just doing one aspect of the system. We need to look at transforming the entire education system\u00a0at the same time,\u00a0because if you just tinker with one part then it might have an unintended effect in another place. So, I think we need to look at the system as a whole, and I think that what's happening at the moment is a structural change to the system. What's your assessment, therefore, of how able or how ready schools are to deal with, in moving forward now, all of these changes and reforms? meilyr rowlands: Well, as I said, I think that they have coped with a whole host of changes, and that's something to be praised. We are disappointed the standards haven't improved as much as we would have liked to have seen, but we also need to be congratulating the workforce for getting to grips with so many changes in a relatively short period. So, I am confident in that sense, but we do have to be careful in looking out for the workload, because the culture of promoting is one of giving more responsibilities to teachers, to schools, to colleges and to headteachers. llyr gruffydd am: Would you also share the concern that the reduction in school budgets will worsen those risks that you referred to? meilyr rowlands: Yes. As you'll know, international research evidence shows that it is not the amount of funding that goes into education systems that dictates how effective they are. But it is true to say that, if you have financial cuts, that does cause practical problems for headteachers in having to lay off staff, and so on. mark reckless am: Could I ask the reasons for Professor Donaldson being asked to undertake a review of Estyn's role? meilyr rowlands: Yes. I would say that, wouldn't I, because I'm an inspector, but I think it's important that we practise what we preach. I think it is healthy for anybody to have that sort of external view, and I think in particular we're proud in Estyn that we are a body that is developing and trying new things and evolving continuously. But if you were to ask, 'Why now?', it's because of the extent of the education reform that we're particularly facing. So, I think it's a good thing to do at any given time, but considering the range and speed of change that we're facing in education now, I thought it was particularly important that we ask Graham Donaldson to look at the implications for our work of all this education reform. mark reckless am: What have been the biggest benefits to Wales of having Estyn as an independent body inspecting schools and other institutions in Wales compared to the work that Ofsted has done in England? meilyr rowlands: Well, we have very good relationships with Ofsted and with Education Scotland and the Education Training Inspectorate in Northern Ireland. I wouldn't like to compare\u2014I don't think it would be fair to compare ourselves. So, we're working quite closely with the home countries, but also further afield with Holland and with the Republic of Ireland, for example.\u00a0So, we're always, all of us, learning\u00a0from one another about what we think they do well and what they think we do well. I wouldn't think it's fair for me to say what I think\u2014you know, where we're better than another country. But I think what is fair for me to ask is: perhaps could you highlight one or two areas where you believe that Estyn has a particular\u00a0difference of emphasis and approach from Ofsted? meilyr rowlands: I think one of the things we've done and we've developed over many years\u00a0is the use of the nominee and peer inspectors in particular. So, we've got, I think, a really good tradition of doing that in Wales, and when we do meet other inspectorates, they're always very interested in that part of our work. We inspect a wide range of sectors, as you know, but the bulk of that inspection work is actually\u00a0done now by peer inspectors. So, I think that, and the idea of a nominee, is also of interest to other inspectorates across the world. They're part of all the discussions so they actually understand how we've come to our report, and they can then help the organisation move forward after we've left. mark reckless am: I've clashed with Welsh Ministers on the absence of league tables for schools in Wales, with less accountability for their results than is the case in England. But, from, I think, at some point in 2014, you started in your inspection reports of primary\u00a0schools putting the comparison of how they were doing compared to other schools and local authorities\u00a0and nationally, as well as what you've described as their family of schools, and being more transparent over their key stage 2 results. So, what led you to do that? What difference has that made? And was that decision taken by Estyn on its own account, or was that something\u00a0that was agreed with Welsh Ministers? meilyr rowlands: I did listen to Plenary, so I've heard you raise this issue. I'm sure it's inadvertent\u00a0on your part, but you've confused absolutely\u00a0everyone with this. So, if you want to know about your own school or any other school, you should go onto that website. You can look at it in terms of tables and data and graphs and it shows all that data that you refer to, and that's the right place to have it. Most of it is first-hand evidence that we see in the classroom and see in pupils' work, but we triangulate that with data and with what parents and pupils say and interviews with staff. Pre 2014, it was in the body of the text, and then after 2014 we put it in an appendix. We had a mid-cycle review and people felt it would be better in an appendix than in the body of the text, but it was always there. There's pros and cons on whether it should\u00a0be in the body of the text or in an appendix. mark reckless am: Well, certainly, the data became clear to me in reports after 2014 in a way it wasn't before. Can I just highlight a few of what I felt were either particularly striking statistics\u00a0or comparisons\u00a0or points that were made in your annual\u00a0report of potential concern? You state that headteachers do not understand the principles of good pedagogy or good practice in about three quarters of schools\u2014this relates to the foundation phase. There's a lot of research, and our own evidence shows that, where it is implemented well, pupils benefit a lot from it and they're well prepared to be independent\u00a0thinkers. So, it's a development that we should be proud of in Wales, I think, the foundation phase. There's a whole range of reasons, as I discuss in the annual report, why that might be the case.\u00a0It is quite an innovative idea, and I think it's misunderstood by saying it's learning through play, because that's a bit too simplistic a definition of it. We have written a report recently on good practice in the foundation phase, so that we can try and explain clearly to people what the benefits of it are and how best to implement it. Many of them might not have taught in foundation phase, they might not have that infant background, they might have a junior-school background. There might not have been enough\u2014well, we say there wasn't enough training\u2014or there might be people who missed any training that there was then. So, overall, there is a large number of leaders who don't fully appreciate what the foundation phase could deliver. john griffiths am: Darren\u2014is it on this? darren millar am: Yes, it is on this. , one of the problems that I know you've identified in the past is this lack of good practice being able\u00a0to travel into all parts of Wales, and, of course, we've got local authorities, we've got regional consortia, we've got the Welsh Government\u2014all of which want to see good practice replicated where possible. What opportunities are there, perhaps, to develop some other further opportunities for good practice to be shared and promoted? I know that the Wales Audit Office, for example, has its good practice exchange. Is there something\u00a0similar that schools can engage with to make things happen? meilyr rowlands: It's a good question. , specifically to do with foundation phase, there is a foundation phase\u2014I can't remember what it's called now\u2014excellence network I think, which is being relaunched. There's one for mathematics\u2014a national network for excellence in mathematics\u2014there's one for science and there's one for foundation phase in particular. So, I think it is a challenge that we haven't cracked yet in Wales: how do we make sure that\u00a0good practice does travel?\u00a0I think one specifically for foundation phase is a good idea, because we've got a specific issue with the foundation phase. mark reckless am: When you say that\u2014 john griffiths am: Mark, just before you go on, I think Julie wanted to come in on this point as well. I just wondered if you could give us some examples about how the foundation phase is not being implemented in the true spirit of the foundation phase in the three quarters of schools that you think fall\u2014. meilyr rowlands: Well, what we mean by that is schools not necessarily teaching badly, but in a more traditional way. Some schools actually reverted, after the\u00a0introduction of the new tests, from what was pedagogy that was in line with the foundation phase. And basically, if I understand it correctly, it's more to do with the children making their own choices about what they do. And that is pretty common in nursery and reception classes, but it's less common in year 1 and year 2. claire morgan: I think it is very much, as Meilyr said, the difference between a pupil-led learning experience or a teacher-led learning experience.\u00a0Because of the lack of training and maybe the confidence to pursue that active and experiential learning approach, teachers have tended to resort to what they feel more comfortable with, which is more of an adult-led learning\u2014often still high quality, but it doesn't ensure that the learners become far more independent, far more engaged in their learning. mark reckless am: So, when you say that some teachers are sort of holding children back,\u00a0and in the report that three quarters of schools don't understand the principles of good pedagogy or good practice, what you mean is that teachers are using traditional methods, including whole-class teaching, rather than moving towards a pupil-led learning experience and one that you said was oversimplified as learning through play. May not the issue here therefore be that Estyn is seeking to impose this different approach on teachers who think that they are better able to teach children in the traditional way, which, at least in my experience, would be supported by quite a number of parents? meilyr rowlands: I don't think it's Estyn that's\u00a0imposing it. mark reckless am: Do you support that policy? meilyr rowlands: Well, we do, actually. Our evidence, as I said, is that, when it is implemented properly, pupils do actually gain from it. But we're not imposing it, and what we're saying is that headteachers are not necessarily understanding it. Quite unusually, in this section, we have had to actually explain some of the technical terms, like 'continuous provision'.\u00a0So that's, I think, one of the reasons why people don't understand it fully. That's why we did produce this quite substantial bit of work, trying to unpack what this actually means in practice and giving a lot of good examples of the practice. Given the timing of when it was brought in and where we are now, has that really had time to distil through the system and give compelling evidence that this approach works better than more traditional approaches? meilyr rowlands: I think it has, to be fair. I think this has, because we're talking about a lot of developmental work related to the foundation phase prior to 2010, but it became compulsory for all schools to deliver it from 2010 onwards. So, that gives enough time for children to have been through the whole of the foundation\u00a0phase onto key stage 2, and we can see the effect of it. In the schools where there is good practice in the foundation phase, we can see the effect when we inspect on key stage 2 children. mark reckless am: So, would you be confident about this, in the next few years, feeding through into an improvement in Programme for International Student Assessments, rather than a further deterioration? meilyr rowlands: Yes. I think that if we did what Darren was talking about, getting more schools to share good practice, I think it will expand and more schools will take it on, yes. On the sharing of good practice, you put emphasis in the report on this being an improving area and trend for the future as well, but I think you did raise concerns that it wasn't monitored or evaluated sufficiently well, particularly where one school was supporting another. How should that be done better? meilyr rowlands: Well, I think this has been a theme of many of the issues we've raised: that, whatever the initiative, you can't tell whether it's been successful or not unless you evaluate it properly. I think that, with the development of the\u00a0national academy for educational leadership, I would hope that research skills and evaluative skills would be part of the kind of training that headteachers get that maybe in the past they didn't. So, that becomes more of the day-to-day work of schools\u2014that naturally, whenever you do something,\u00a0you evaluate it afterwards.\u00a0We've evaluated a lot of the school-to-school work. We've published two or three reports on it, and we've identified what we think is good practice and not-so-good practice. john griffiths am: Okay, Mark? If we move on at this stage\u2014I wonder, before other Members come in, if I could ask about community-focused schools. Quite a lot of what we discussed earlier was around the importance of getting families and the community more involved in education, and one way of doing that, I think, is through community-focused schools that are very much accessible to the community, linked well with outside organisations, having an extended school-day offer. We have the\u00a0twenty-first century schools programme, but\u00a0we have a lot of schools existing that haven't been part of that. I just wondered to what extent Estyn might encourage or highlight the need to encourage greater consistency in community-focused schools across Wales, because I think there is a feeling that it is very inconsistent. We see that as, particularly, a solution for that long-standing issue we have in Wales in particular. I think it became thought of as meaning the community just uses the facilities in the evening and, of course, it's a much, much broader concept than that. I think some schools particularly didn't like the community using their facilities in the evening, and that became, I think, possibly part of the reason why community-focused schools didn't become more popular. The way I look at it is, as Claire was explaining earlier about the school offering all kinds of services to people\u2014you know, family learning, those sorts of nurture groups, all those sorts of educationally focused services available from the school, and generally building relationships. john griffiths am: So, if there might be a mechanism that could have community-focused schools working in the way that you've described right across Wales, would Estyn be in favour of such a mechanism? meilyr rowlands: Absolutely, yes. Could I just ask one further question, then, before, as I said, I bring other Members in? There is a particular concern at the moment\u2014and has been for some time\u2014about white working-class children, and perhaps particularly boys, not attaining as they should through our education system. Is that something that Estyn recognises? Has Estyn done much work on that, and if so, what is that work? meilyr rowlands: We've done work on boys and girls, and we've done work on deprived children\u2014you know, identified, as we were discussing this morning, by eligibility for free school meals. We haven't specifically looked at white working-class boys, but a lot of the solutions, and a lot of the good practice that we have identified generally, through the PDG and whatever I think is the way forward for that particular cohort as well. john griffiths am: So, you wouldn't see the need for a particular focus or a particular piece of work\u00a0to identify whether there are aspects of education that might particularly\u00a0benefit that group. meilyr rowlands: I wouldn't object to doing a piece of work on that, in case we have missed something, but I suspect it would be the same schools that do well with that cohort that we've identified already for the same reasons, I suspect. To what extent has the rate of improvement\u00a0differed between the primary and secondary sectors? meilyr rowlands: I'm not sure if there's been a difference in the rate of improvement, but certainly I've raised in this annual report, and indeed in previous annual reports, the difference between primary and secondary. We've got 7 in 10\u2014nearly three quarters\u2014of primary schools doing well and about half of secondary schools. Generally, there is a widening of gaps when you go from primary to secondary, but also it's from foundation phase to key stage 2 to key stage 3 to key stage 4. So, there's actually more excellence in secondary schools according to our inspections than in primary, although the overall proportion of good or better schools is higher in primary than in secondary. I think also, although I've got no evidence for this, it's probably\u00a0more difficult\u00a0for that community focus to work in a larger secondary school than a smaller primary school. The other one,\u00a0of course,\u00a0is the one we were talking about earlier this morning, the pressure on secondary schools to address performance indicators and examinations in particular. Another possible reason is the structure\u00a0of secondary schools is subject-based, departmental-based, so children will get 10 to 12 different teachers. It's easier, therefore, in a primary school for the school to see the child as an individual\u00a0and recognise their problems and their needs as a whole. So, I think there is a whole range of issues that explains or goes part way to explaining\u00a0what you've identified. You touched on this quite\u00a0a bit in your earlier evidence, but you said in the annual report that there's a danger that accountability measures might be having an effect on the advice being given to pupils about subjects they study. Do you have any evidence of that or is that a perception? meilyr rowlands: Well, I think everyone agrees that there's very strong evidence about that. john griffiths am: Okay, Michelle?\u00a0Perhaps we'll move on at this stage\u2014we haven't got a great deal of time left\u2014if that's okay. julie morgan am: I wanted to ask about special schools in terms of your views about the standards in special schools\u2014whether you've got any views on that. meilyr rowlands: Yes, we highlighted special schools as a successful sector in the annual report, as we have over\u00a0many years. The small number of schools that don't do quite as well tend to be the schools that deal with children with emotional and behavioural difficulties. Possibly they don't have an overlap in catchment areas, they're quite geographically\u00a0separate, so they don't feel as if they're in competition with one another. meilyr rowlands: Sorry, I should have said that was mainly to do with the maintained sector. The independent sector tends to focus maybe on those children with emotional and behavioural difficulties, so they have the more difficult task to begin with. We visit them on an annual basis to make sure that they're addressing all our recommendations, and continue to meet the needs of those pupils. And also, I think there's been a trend where more of those independent schools now have\u2014. And what about pupil referral units? How are the standards there? meilyr rowlands: Yes, they're more variable. We've contributed a lot of evidence to the various working groups that have been looking at EOTAS\u2014that's education other than at school. ADEW, which is the\u00a0Association of Directors of Education in Wales, have now set up a national body to share good practice amongst PRUs, so I think that is a very positive step forward, because that sharing, I think, wasn't happening with PRUs. I think what we need to do with PRUs is to get them to be more of a part of the education system as a whole. So, the more we can do to involve them in national events, and also, I think, make their governance more like that of a school so that they become more similar to schools\u2014that makes it easier for them to share practice with schools. The percentage of further education colleges who have reached a\u00a0 good or better standard has increased, of course, over the past inspection cycle. I'd just like to ask what you think is responsible for that, and are there any lessons we can take out of that and transfer to other sectors within education? meilyr rowlands: Thank you for the question, but I'm going to ask Simon to answer. simon brown: As you're aware, the number of colleges\u00a0from 22 to 12, and I think those mergers resulted in establishments that were stronger in terms of their leadership in particular. That leadership, I think\u00a0the characteristics we have seen in the 'good' or 'better'\u2014as you say, 80 per cent leadership good or better\u2014has been a culture of openness, a culture of clarity of purpose about where the college is going. Obviously, if you're merging large colleges as they did in north Wales, keeping staff morale high is quite a skill, and I think\u00a0the leadership have done that very well. They've also supported managers at all levels, and they've encouraged managers to support staff at all levels. I did a training\u00a0session for college governors about a month ago, and what struck me was the breadth of experience of the college governors, from industry, from academia. They are a very\u00a0challenging set of governors, I think, who hold the senior leadership\u00a0to account in the colleges, and that helps to push standards forward. Teaching is 'good' or 'better' in 70 per cent\u00a0of colleges because the\u00a0senior leadership team are encouraging\u00a0teachers in colleges to innovate, encouraging them to engage actively in performance management\u00a0systems, and to become reflective practitioners in the colleges. llyr gruffydd am: And how many of those do you think could effectively be transferred or encouraged in other sectors? simon brown: But I think one sector that\u2014. I think the other post-16 sector, which is work-based learning\u2014 llyr gruffydd am: Well, yes, I was going to ask you. As we said in the\u00a0annual report, standards are 'good' or 'better' in only 50 per cent of work-based learning companies, mainly because the completion rates of learners are not what we'd expect, the progression that learners\u00a0make isn't what we'd expect. And that is mainly\u00a0due to the way in which the leadership teams monitor progress\u2014monitor progress in themselves\u00a0as a provider, but, more importantly, the way they\u00a0manage sub-contractors, because, as you will already know, there's 19 lead providers; there's about 100 training providers. And the companies that are doing better, or the training providers doing better, are those\u00a0that have got a firm grip on their sub-contractors, and, most importantly, they put quality as the top part of any agenda at any meeting. And, of course, if you're challenging your sub-contractors about\u00a0quality, that will impact\u00a0on standards of teaching, and, hopefully, ultimately, on standards of performance on the learners. And I think, to go back\u00a0to your original question, Llyr, the sort of leadership models that FE colleges have, I think\u00a0some of the work-based learning providers would be wise to start to emulate those. It's beginning\u00a0to happen, because\u00a0FE is getting more engaged in the work-based learning world, so I think some of those behaviours will start to rub off on the companies. llyr gruffydd am: So, who would you look to drive some of those changes through then? Is it the sector themselves,\u00a0 or to what extent can Government and others do things? simon brown: Well, as you know, Meilyr alluded\u00a0to the changes across all sectors. We've got PCET\u2014we've got the post-compulsory education and training\u00a0reforms under way. But I think, in the shorter term, some of the work that groups like Colegau Cymru and the National Training Federation Wales\u00a0are doing, sharing best practice, bringing the colleges and the training companies together, is beginning to help. I'm going to the national training federation conference tomorrow in Cardiff, and I notice the attendance there\u2014there's a lot of FE colleges attending, senior staff of FE colleges, as well as from the work-based training companies. john griffiths am: Okay, Llyr? We haven't got very long left, but we've got five minutes or so for some further questions from Hefin David. hefin david am: With regard to local authorities, you found shortcomings in your 2010-14 inspection in 15 of the 22. And one of the things that struck me in the report was where you said that you found ineffective processes for self-evaluating improvement within those authorities, but you've also said that there's been a high turnover of directors and\u00a0new\u00a0directors in place in\u00a0many of them. Has that had a\u00a0positive effect on that self-evaluation process? simon brown: As you're aware, over the past three years, out of the 22 authorities, there have been 40 new directors, over the past three years. So, that's one factor.\u00a0I think the other factor is that the status of education\u00a0directors has changed quite significantly.\u00a0Some local authorities are a member of the corporate team and they are\u00a0directors of\u00a0education and children's services, so they've got very broad portfolios. In other ones, they're being treated more like heads of service, so heads of\u00a0department level. hefin david am: I know that Caerphilly went in the opposite direction\u2014from having a chief\u00a0education officer to then appointing a director, I think. simon brown: I'm sorry? hefin david am: In Caerphilly county borough, they went from having a chief education officer and now have got a\u00a0director again. But, in many cases, they're the same people, aren't they? It's\u00a0just that their roles are changed. I think the other thing that's happened, of course, with the role of\u00a0the\u00a0director of education, is, because of the regional consortia now\u00a0doing the school improvement function, a large chunk of that role has now moved to the consortia. So, I think it's early days to say what the impact of that new cohort of\u00a0directors will be, but, of course, we're starting a new inspection cycle in September. Those\u00a0reports are not yet published, but what I can say is that neither of those\u00a0authorities are in follow-up. hefin david am: But you said, even though it's not in follow-up, it was still showing signs of not being able to reflect effectively on improvement\u2014in\u00a0the report. hefin david am: Right, okay, but some of those not in follow-up were not\u00a0reflecting\u00a0effectively on\u00a0their improvement\u2014is the statement that\u00a0was made in\u00a0the report. simon brown: What we're seeing, and we've seen this before in the previous cycle, is that the performance of some authorities is patchy. I think I said to committee last year those authorities are ones that we held improvement conferences in last year. That was to get the senior leadership\u2014both political and officer-led leadership\u2014and the consortia and\u00a0Welsh Government\u00a0and the Wales\u00a0Audit Office and, as it was, the Care and Social Services Inspectorate Wales,\u00a0around the table to get those senior leadership teams to actually identify what the longer-term issues are, to surface those issues and to put\u00a0together an action plan.\u00a0We're\u00a0revisiting those three authorities very, very shortly. The\u00a0first of the\u00a0revisits is in April to see what progress they've made over the past 12 months or so. And, with things like the curriculum reforms, you've identified the new directors in place, but you've said that, although they're new directors, they're\u00a0actually very\u00a0experienced in education, so therefore you're confident that\u00a0they're going to manage the\u00a0reforms well as they are\u00a0developed in\u00a0the next few years. simon brown: I think one development, and I've raised this in committee before, was\u2014. One of our concerns, apart from the fact that there was a large turnover of directors, was what sort of level of training senior leaders and middle managers were getting in those authorities. One of the things that I'm quite pleased to report is that the Association of Directors of Education in Wales and Welsh Government have\u00a0stepped up to address that issue. Last year, all serving directors attended residential courses run by the Staff College Wales, facilitated by ADEW, and ADEW have just finished the first round of director\u2014. The name of the course is the 'Welsh future leaders in education' course and 26 people have just finished that\u2014aspiring directors. That course, again, is developed by the Staff College Wales, but it has a lot of external input. They're putting in directors and chief executives from Scotland, they're putting in headteachers of very successful schools in England, who've got current grass-roots experience to share with these aspiring directors. So, I think the concerns that we had previously about the professional learning for middle managers and leaders in local authorities are being addressed. The proof will be in the pudding when we start to do the inspection cycle, but at least the issue now is being tackled. hefin david am: Can I just look at, then, consortia?\u00a0One of the criticisms in the report was that national policy wasn't being put in context\u2014I think that was the statement in the report\u2014in certain consortia. Can you elaborate on what you meant by that? simon brown: Yes, when we talked, we said that\u2014. One is that the national model for regional working is being revised at the moment, and that work is ongoing by Welsh Government.\u00a0That is to bring greater consistency to the four consortia, because one of our concerns, which we\u00a0expressed in this report\u00a0and we expressed in previous years, is that, although the national model had a particular approach back in 2012, when Robert Hill did the first review, it had a particular approach to the consortia being fairly similar, over the years, they've gone in four different directions. To be fair, over the past couple of years, the consortia are now collaborating much closer together. They are working together\u2014for example, I mentioned earlier about the regional co-ordinators for LAC. Whereas before they were working more in silos, they are now working much closer together.\u00a0So, I think what we were referring to, and what we were talking about in the report, is the fact that the consortia need to have a more consistent approach across all four regions. And the relationships with local authorities, you said that the sharing of information with the local authorities is not always acted upon by local authorities\u2014from the consortia. Is that a failure of communication, or is that something that sits with\u00a0the local authority to acknowledge? simon brown: I don't think it's a failure of communication. In the cases where some authorities haven't acted sufficiently in intervening in schools or in issuing warning\u00a0letters, the consortia have been quite clear. But, again, I think that is beginning to improve, because the local authorities are quite sensitive to the fact we are now going to be re-inspecting them and looking at them, and that is one of the issues we'll be picking up on. And, in order to do their jobs, the consortia need to be suitably resourced.\u00a0Are they, and are they fit for the challenges ahead? simon brown: It's not for us to comment on whether each consortium is sufficiently funded or not, but what we would say is that, generally,\u00a0in the past, they've spent perhaps too large a proportion of their funds\u00a0on challenge work and not enough funding on support work, but that, again, is moving. We've picked up that GwE, for example,\u00a0is in the process of renaming their challenge advisers 'support advisers',\u00a0because they're moving their culture more over to supporting schools to deal with all the raft of reforms that Meilyr mentioned, and that is,\u00a0it seems to me, an entirely sensible way to go. We have one paper to note, which is a letter from the Chair of the Public Accounts Committee to the Welsh Government regarding the Hwb programme.\u00a0Is committee content to note that paper? Yes.\u00a0Thank you very much. Item 5, then, is a motion under Standing Order 17.42\u00a0to resolve to exclude the public from the remainder of this meeting"

        "Query": "What were the professor's thoughts on latencies, VAD latency, and the breakdown of latency?",
        "Summary": "The professor expressed satisfaction with the improved model, attributing it to lower latencies. He believed that the effort put into developing a good Voice Activity Detection (VAD) was worthwhile. In order to determine the latency added by the VAD, the professor suggested running the process in parallel. Additionally, the professor informed the team that the maximum latency was still unknown. PhD C provided an explanation of the delays caused by various factors, including a 100ms delay from silence probabilities, a 40ms delay from delta at the input, and a 10ms delay from LDA filters. The professor criticized the insistence on using a flawed system and emphasized the need for straightforward solutions. He emphasized the importance of keeping the lag short for the task at hand.",
        "Article": "Actually , I think he he redirected it to everybody also so  the PDA mikes  have a big bunch of energy at at  five hertz  where this came up was that  I was showing off these wave forms that we have on the web and and  I just sort of hadn't noticed this , but that the major , major component in the wave in the second wave form in that pair of wave forms is actually the air conditioner . I I have to be more careful about using that as a as a as a good illustration , in fact it 's not , of  of the effects of room reverberation . And then we had this other discussion about  whether this affects the dynamic range , cuz I know , although we start off with thirty two bits , you end up with  sixteen bits and you know , are we getting hurt there ? But  Dan is pretty confident that we 're not , that that quantization error is not is still not a significant factor there . So there was a question of whether we should change things here , whether we should change a capacitor on the input box for that or whether we should phd b: Yeah , he suggested a smaller capacitor , right ? professor a: Right . But then I had some other  thing discussions with him phd b: For the P D professor a: and the feeling was once we start monk monkeying with that , many other problems could ha happen . professor a: A simple thing to do is he he he has a I forget if it this was in that mail or in the following mail , but he has a a simple filter , a digital filter that he suggested . professor a:  The other thing that I don't know the answer to , but when people are using Feacalc here ,  whether they 're using it with the high - pass filter option or not . So when we 're doing all these things using our software there is  if it 's if it 's based on the RASTA - PLP program , which does both PLP and RASTA - PLP  then  there is an option there which then comes up through to Feacalc which  allows you to do high - pass filtering and in general we like to do that , because of things like this and it 's it 's pretty it 's not a very severe filter . Doesn't affect speech frequencies , even pretty low speech frequencies , at all , but it 's phd b: What 's the cut - off frequency it used ? professor a: Oh . I don't know I wrote this a while ago phd b: Is it like twenty ? professor a: Something like that .  I think there 's some effect above twenty but it 's it 's it 's it 's mild . So ,  it probably there 's probably some effect up to a hundred hertz or something but it 's it 's pretty mild . I don't know in the in the STRUT implementation of the stuff is there a high - pass filter or a pre pre - emphasis or something in the phd f:  . We we we want to go and check that in i for anything that we 're going to use the P D A mike for .  He says that there 's a pretty good roll off in the PZM mikes so we don't need need to worry about them one way or the other but if we do make use of the cheap mikes ,  we want to be sure to do that that filtering before we process it . And then again if it 's  depending on the option that the our our software is being run with , it 's it 's quite possible that 's already being taken care of .  the thing is it was since I was talking about reverberation and showing this thing that was noise , it wasn't a good match , but it certainly was still  an indication of the fact that you get noise with distant mikes .  It 's just not a great example because not only isn't it reverberation but it 's a noise that we definitely know what to do . professor a: So , it doesn't take deep a new bold new methods to get rid of  five hertz noise , so . So it was it was a bad example in that way , but it 's it still is it 's the real thing that we did get out of the microphone at distance , so it wasn't it w it w wasn't wrong it was inappropriate . So  , but  , Yeah , someone noticed it later pointed it out to me , and I went \" oh , man .  So I think we 'll change our our picture on the web , when we 're @ @ . One of the things I was  , I was trying to think about what what 's the best way to show the difference an and I had a couple of thoughts one was , that spectrogram that we show is O K , but the thing is the eyes  and the the brain behind them are so good at picking out patterns from from noise that in first glance you look at them it doesn't seem like it 's that bad  because there 's many features that are still preserved . So one thing to do might be to just take a piece of the spec  of the spectrogram where you can see that something looks different , an and blow it up , and have that be the part that 's just to show as well .  Another , I was thinking of was  taking some spectral slices , like  like we look at with the recognizer , and look at the spectrum or cepstrum that you get out of there , and the the  , the reverberation  does make it does change that . grad c: W w what d what do you mean ? professor a: Well ,   all the recognizers look at frames . professor a: So it 's , yeah , at one point in time or  twenty over twenty milliseconds or something , you have a spectrum or a cepstrum . And if you look at phd b: You could just you could just throw up , you know ,  the  some MFCC feature vectors . You know , one from one , one from the other , and then , you know , you can look and see how different the numbers are . Well , that 's why I saying either Well , either spectrum or cepstrum phd b: I 'm just kidding . professor a: but but I think the thing is you wanna  phd b: I don't mean a graph . Yeah , at first I had a remark why I am wondering why the PDA is always so far . Since the last meeting we 've we 've tried to put together  the clean low - pass  downsampling , upsampling ,  the new filter that 's replacing the LDA filters , and also the  delay issue so that We considered th the the delay issue on the for the on - line normalization . professor a: But it 's not wer worse and it 's better better latency , phd f: It 's not professor a: right ? phd f: Yeah . It seems better when we look at the mismatched case but I think we are like like cheated here by the th this problem that  in some cases when you modify slight slightly modify the initial condition you end up completely somewhere air somewhere else in the in the space , the parameters . For Italian is at seventy - eight percent recognition rate on the mismatch , and this new system has eighty - nine . I don't I don't think it means that the new system is more robust professor a:  - huh . professor a: Well , the test would be if you then tried it on one of the other test sets , if if it was phd f: Y professor a: Right . professor a: So then if you take your changes phd f: It 's similar for other test sets professor a: and then phd f: but  from this se seventy - eight  percent recognition rate system , I could change the transition probabilities for the the first  and it will end up to eighty - nine also . phd f: By using point five instead of point six , point four as in the the HTK script . phd b:  th the only difference is you change the self - loop transition probability by a tenth of a percent phd f: Yeah . From point phd f: Even tenth of a percent ? phd b: I I 'm sorry phd f: Well , we tried we tried point one , phd b: f for point from You change at point one phd f: yeah . professor a: Oh ! phd b: and n not tenth of a percent , one tenth , phd f:  . phd b: alright ?  so from point five so from point six to point five and you get ten percent better . phd b: And it 's I think it 's what you basically hypothesized in the last meeting about  it just being very phd f:   phd b: and I think you mentioned this in your email too it 's just very  phd f: Mmm , yeah . phd b: you know get stuck in some local minimum and this thing throws you out of it I guess . professor a: Well , what 's what are according to the rules what what are we supposed to do about the transition probabilities ? Are they supposed to be point five or point six ? phd b: I think you 're not allowed to Yeah . But changing it to point five I think is which gives you much better results , but that 's not allowed . phd f: Yeah , but even if you use point five , I 'm not sure it will always give you the better results phd b: Yeah . We only tested it on the the medium mismatch , phd f: on the other training set ,  . phd b: right ? You said on the other cases you didn't notice phd f: Yeah . I think the reason is , yeah , I not I it was in my mail I think also , is the fact that the mismatch is trained only on the far microphone . Well , in for the mismatched case everything is  using the far microphone training and testing , whereas for the highly mismatched , training is done on the close microphone so it 's it 's clean speech basically so you don't have this problem of local minima probably and for the well - match , it 's a mix of close microphone and distant microphone and Well . phd b: I did notice  something phd f: So th I think the mismatch is the more difficult for the training part . phd b: Somebody , I think it was Morgan , suggested at the last meeting that I actually count to see how many parameters and how many frames . phd b: And there are  almost one point eight million frames of training data and less than forty thousand parameters in the baseline system . phd b: I did one quick experiment just to make sure I had everything worked out and I just  f for most of the  For for all of the digit models , they end up at three mixtures per state . And so I just did a quick experiment , where I changed it so it went to four and  it it it didn't have a r any significant effect at the  medium mismatch and high mismatch cases and it had it was just barely significant for the well - matched better . And I think also just seeing what we saw  in terms of the expected duration of the silence model ? when we did this tweaking of the self - loop ? The silence model expected duration was really different . phd b: And so in the case where  it had a better score , the silence model expected duration was much longer . I think you know if we make a better silence model I think that will help a lot too  for a lot of these cases so but one one thing I I wanted to check out before I increased the  number of mixtures per state was  in their default training script they do an initial set of three re - estimations and then they built the silence model and then they do seven iterations then the add mixtures and they do another seven then they add mixtures then they do a final set of seven and they quit . Seven seems like a lot to me and it also makes the experiments go take a really long time  to do one turn - around of the well matched case takes like a day . phd b: And so you know in trying to run these experiments I notice , you know , it 's difficult to find machines , you know , compute the run on . And so one of the things I did was I compiled HTK for the Linux machines professor a:   phd b: cuz we have this one from IBM that 's got like five processors in it ? professor a: Right . phd b: and so now I 'm you can run stuff on that and that really helps a lot because now we 've got you know , extra machines that we can use for compute . And if I 'm do running an experiment right now where I 'm changing the number of iterations ? from seven to three ? phd d:   And so if we can get away with just doing three , we can do many more experiments more quickly . And if it 's not a a huge difference from running with seven iterations , you know , we should be able to get a lot more experiments done . But if we can you know , run all of these back - ends f with many fewer iterations and on Linux boxes we should be able to get a lot more experimenting done . So I wanted to experiment with cutting down the number of iterations before I increased the number of Gaussians . professor a: But they 're not making things worse and we have reduced latency , right ? phd f: Yeah . But actually  actually it seems to do a little bit worse for the well - matched case and we just noticed that Yeah , actually the way the final score is computed is quite funny . It 's not a weighted mean of word error rate , it 's a weighted mean of improvements . Which means that actually the weight on the well - matched is Well I well what what What happened is that if you have a small improvement or a small if on the well - matched case it will have  huge influence on the improvement compared to the reference because the reference system is is is quite good for for the well - ma well - matched case also . phd b: So it it weights the improvement on the well - matched case really heavily compared to the improvement on the other cases ? phd f: No , but it 's the weighting of the of the improvement not of the error rate . Yeah , and it 's hard to improve on the on the best case , cuz it 's already so good , right ? phd f: Yeah but what  is that you can have a huge improvement on the H HMK 's ,  like five percent  absolute , and this will not affect the final score almost  this will almost not affect the final score because this improvement because the improvement  relative to the the baseline is small professor a: So they do improvement in terms of  accuracy ? rather than word error rate ? phd f:  .  improvement ? professor a: So phd f: No , it 's compared to the word er it 's improvement on the word error rate , professor a: OK . professor a: So if you have  ten percent error and you get five percent absolute  improvement then that 's fifty percent . So what you 're saying then is that if it 's something that has a small word error rate , then  a even a relatively small improvement on it , in absolute terms , will show up as quite quite large in this . Sure , but when we think about the weighting , which is point five , point three , point two , it 's on absolute on on relative figures , professor a: Yeah . That 's why I 've been saying we should be looking at word error rate  and and not not at at accuracies . phd b: it 's not it 's not that different , right ?  , just subtract the accuracy . professor a: Yeah but you 're but when you look at the numbers , your sense of the relative size of things is quite different . professor a: If you had ninety percent  correct and five percent , five over ninety doesn't look like it 's a big difference , but five over ten is is big . professor a: So just when we were looking at a lot of numbers and getting sense of what was important . professor a: What 's a little bit ? Like phd f: Like , it 's difficult to say because again  I 'm not sure I have the  phd b: Hey Morgan ? Do you remember that Signif program that we used to use for testing signi ? Is that still valid ? I I 've been using that . I just use my old one from ninety - two or whatever professor a: Yeah , I 'm sure it 's not that different but but he he  he was a little more rigorous , as I recall . s phd f:  well we start from ninety - four point sixty - four , and we go to ninety - four point O four . For Finnish , we start to ninety - three point eight - four and we go to ninety - three point seventy - four . And for Spanish we are we were at ninety - five point O five and we go to ninety - three - s point sixty one . professor a: And is that wh what do you know what piece you 've done several changes here . Because nnn , well  we don't have complete result , but the filter So the filter with the shorter delay hurts on Italian well - matched , which And , yeah . And the other things , like  downsampling , upsampling , don't seem to hurt and the new on - line normalization , neither . If we saw that making a small change like , you know , a tenth , to the self - loop had a huge effect , can we really make any conclusions about differences in this stuff ? phd f:   phd f: I think we can be completely fooled by this thing , but I don't know . There is first this thing , and then the yeah , I computed the  like , the confidence level on the different test sets . professor a: But OK , so you these these degradations you were talking about were on the well - matched case phd f: So . Do the does the new filter make things  better or worse for the other cases ? phd f: Yeah . OK , so  I guess the argument one might make is that , \" Yeah , if you looked at one of these cases and you jiggle something and it changes then  you 're not quite sure what to make of it . But when you look across a bunch of these and there 's some some pattern , so eh h here 's all the if if in all these different cases it never gets better , and there 's significant number of cases where it gets worse , then you 're probably hurting things , I would say . So   at the very least that would be a reasonably prediction of what would happen with with a different test set , that you 're not jiggling things with . What I was asking , though , is  are what 's what 's the level of communication with  the O G I gang now , about this and phd f: Well , we are exchanging mail as soon as we we have significant results . We are working on our side on other things like  also trying a sup spectral subtraction but of of our own , another spectral substraction . It 's going professor a: Is there any further discussion about this this idea of of having some sort of source code control ? phd f: Yeah . As soon as we have something that 's significant and that 's better than than what was submitted , we will fix fix the system and But we 've not discussed it it it this yet , yeah . Sounds like a great idea but but I think that that  he 's saying people are sort of scrambling for a Eurospeech deadline . Anybo - anybody in the in this group do doing anything for Eurospeech ? phd f: S professor a: Or , is that what is that phd f: Yeah we are We are trying to to do something with the Meeting Recorder digits , professor a: Right . phd f: and , well , some people from OGI are working on a paper for this , but there is also the  special session about th Aurora which is  which has an extended deadline . professor a: So the deadline When 's the deadline ? When 's the deadline ? phd f:  ? I think it 's the thirteenth of May . So , I I think that you could certainly start looking at at the issue  but but  I think it 's probably , on s from what Stephane is saying , it 's it 's unlikely to get sort of active participation from the two sides until after they 've phd b: Well I could at least Well , I 'm going to be out next week but I could try to look into like this  CVS over the web . That seems to be a very popular way of people distributing changes and over , you know , multiple sites and things professor a:   phd b: so maybe if I can figure out how do that easily and then pass the information on to everybody so that it 's you know , as easy to do as possible and and people don't it won't interfere with their regular work , then maybe that would be good . And if you 're interested in using CVS , I 've set it up here , phd b: Oh great . grad c:  j phd b: I used it a long time ago but it 's been a while so maybe I can ask you some questions . Maybe you and I can talk a little bit at some point about coming up with a better  demonstration of the effects of reverberation for our web page , cuz  the    , actually the the  It made a good good audio demonstration because when we could play that clip the the the really obvious difference is that you can hear two voices and in the second one and only hear phd b: Maybe we could just like , talk into a cup . professor a: No , it sound it sounds pretty reverberant , but  you can't when you play it back in a room with a you know a big room , nobody can hear that difference really . professor a: They hear that it 's lower amplitude and they hear there 's a second voice , grad c:  - huh . professor a:  but  that actually that makes for a perfectly good demo because that 's a real obvious thing , that you hear two voices . But for the the visual , just , you know , I 'd like to have   , you know , the spectrogram again , grad c: Yeah . professor a: because you 're you 're you 're visual  abilities as a human being are so good you can pick out you know , you you look at the good one , you look at the cru the screwed up one , and and you can see the features in it without trying to @ @ phd b: I noticed that in the pictures . phd b: I thought \" hey , you know th \" I My initial thought was \" this is not too bad ! \" professor a: Right . But you have to you know , if you look at it closely , you see \" well , here 's a place where this one has a big formant   formant maj major formants here are are moving quite a bit . professor a: So  you could that 's why I was thinking , in a section like that , you could take a look look at just that part of the spectrogram and you could say \" Oh yeah . The main thing that struck me in looking at those two spectrograms was the difference in the high frequencies . It looked like for the one that was farther away , you know , it really everything was attenuated professor a: Right . Since you 're getting all this indirect energy , then a lot of it does have have  reduced high frequencies . But  the other thing is the temporal courses of things really are changed , and and  we want to show that , in some obvious way . \" but I I just  After after  they were put in there I didn't really look at them anymore , cuz I just they were different . So maybe we can just substitute one of these wave forms and  then do some kind of zoom in on the spectrogram on an interesting area . professor a: The other thing that we had in there that I didn't like was that  the most obvious characteristic of the difference  when you listen to it is that there 's a second voice , and the the the the the  cuts that we have there actually don't correspond to the full wave form . It 's just the first I think there was something where he was having some trouble getting so much in , or . But it it 's  it 's the first six seconds or something of it and it 's in the seventh or eighth second or something where @ @ the second voice comes in . So we we would like to actually see the voice coming in , too , I think , since that 's the most obvious thing when you listen to it . phd f: So the thing that we did is just to add spectral subtraction before this , the Wall  process , which contains LDA on - line normalization . phd f: And so we started to look at at  things like this , which is , well , it 's Yeah . And the sentence contain only one word , which is \" Due \" And it can't clearly be seen . phd f: Where is the word ? phd b: This is this is , grad e:  . phd f: This is a plot of C - zero ,  when we don't use spectral substraction , and when there is no on - line normalization . phd f:  then when we apply mean normalization it looks like the second figure , though it is not . phd f: and And then the third figure is what happens when we apply mean normalization and variance normalization . What we can clearly see is that on the speech portion the two channel come becomes very close , but also what happens on the noisy portion is that the variance of the noise is professor a:   phd b: Can I ask  what does variance normalization do ? w What is the effect of that ? professor a: Normalizes the variance . phd f: So it phd b: No , I understand that , phd f: You you get an estimate of the standard deviation . phd f:  phd b: No , I understand what it is , but  , what does it what 's what is phd f: Yeah but . professor a: Well , because everything  If you have a system based on Gaussians , everything is based on means and variances . professor a: So if there 's an overall reason You know , it 's like  if you were doing  image processing and in some of the pictures you were looking at ,  there was a lot of light  and and in some , there was low light , phd b:   professor a: And the variance is just sort of like the next moment , you know ? So  what if  one set of pictures was taken  so that throughout the course it was went through daylight and night    ten times , another time it went thr  i is , you know , how how much how much vari phd b: Oh , OK . I guess a better example would be how much of the light was coming in from outside rather than artificial light . So if it was a lot if more was coming from outside , then there 'd be the bigger effect of the of the of the change in the So every mean every all all of the the parameters that you have , especially the variances , are going to be affected by the overall variance . professor a: And so , in principle , you if you remove that source , then , you know , you can phd b: I see . So would the major effect is that you 're gonna get is by normalizing the means , professor a: That 's the first order but thing , phd b: but it may help First - order effects . professor a: but then the second order is is the variances phd b: And it may help to do the variance . professor a: because , again , if you if you 're trying to distinguish between E and B phd b: OK . professor a: if it just so happens that the E 's were a more you know , were recorded when when the energy was was was larger or something , phd b:    professor a: or the variation in it was larger ,  than with the B 's , then this will be give you some some bias . phd b:  professor a: So the it 's removing these sources of variability in the data that have nothing to do with the linguistic component . And it and this professor a: i is if If you have a good voice activity detector , isn't isn't it gonna pull that out ? phd f: Yeah . Well what it it shows is that , yeah , perhaps a good voice activity detector is is good before on - line normalization and that 's what  we 've already observed . phd b: I don't know , it seems like this would be a lot easier than this signal to work with . What I notice is that , while I prefer to look at the second figure than at the third one , well , because you clearly see where speech is . phd f: But the problem is that on the speech portion , channel zero and channel one are more different than when you use variance normalization where channel zero and channel one become closer . phd b: But for the purposes of finding the speech phd f: And Yeah , but here phd b: You 're more interested in the difference between the speech and the nonspeech , phd f: Yeah . For I th I think that it perhaps it shows that  the parameters that the voice activity detector should use  have to use should be different than the parameter that have to be used for speech recognition . phd f: Well , y professor a: So you can do that by doing the voi voice activity detection . You also could do it by spect  spectral subtraction before the variance normalization , right ? phd f: Yeah , but it 's not clear , yeah . phd f: the the number that at that are here are recognition experiments on Italian HM and  with these two kinds of parameters . phd b: Where 's th phd f: But the fact is that the voice activity detector doesn't work on channel one . phd b: Where at what stage is the voice activity detector applied ? Is it applied here or a after the variance normalization ? phd f:  ? professor a: Spectral subtraction , I guess . Is it applied all the way back here ? phd f: It 's applied the  on , yeah , something like this , phd b: Maybe that 's why it doesn't work for channel one . professor a: Can I phd f: So we could perhaps do just mean normalization before VAD . Can I ask a ,  a sort of top - level question , which is  \" if if most of what the OGI folk are working with is trying to integrate this other other  spectral subtraction , why are we worrying about it ? \" phd f:   phd f: It 's just  Well it 's another They are trying to u to use the  the Ericsson and we 're trying to use something something else . When we do spectral subtraction , actually , I think that this is the the two last figures . phd b: Speech is more what ? phd f: Well , the difference between the energy of the speech and the energy of the n spectral subtrac subtracted noise portion is is larger . phd f: Well , if you compare the first figure to this one Actually the scale is not the same , but if you look at the the numbers  you clearly see that the difference between the C - zero of the speech and C - zero of the noise portion is larger .  but what happens is that after spectral subtraction , you also increase the variance of this of C - zero . And what they did at OGI is just  they don't use on - line normalization , for the moment , on spectral subtraction and I think Yeah . So yeah , we 're working on the same thing but I think  with different different system and professor a: Right .  , i the Intellectually it 's interesting to work on things th  one way or the other phd f:   professor a: but I 'm I 'm just wondering if  on the list of things that there are to do , if there are things that we won't do because we 've got two groups doing the same thing . phd b: if  you know , if if if you work on something else and and you 're waiting for them to give you spectral subtraction  it 's hard to know whether the effects that you get from the other experiments you do will carry over once you then bring in their spectral subtraction module . I don't know if that 's true or not , but I could see how phd f: Mmm .  , we still evidently have a latency reduction plan which which isn't quite what you 'd like it to be . And then  weren't issues of of having a a second stream or something ? That was Was it There was this business that , you know , we we could use up the full forty - eight hundred bits , and phd f: Yeah . And they are t I think they want to work on the second stream also , but more with some kind of multi - band or , well , what they call TRAP or generalized TRAP . Do you remember when the next meeting is supposed to be ? the next  phd f: It 's  in June . Yeah , the other thing is that you saw that that mail about  the VAD V A Ds performing quite differently ? That that  So  . This there was this experiment of  \" what if we just take the baseline ? \" phd f: Mmm . professor a: set  of features , just mel cepstra , and you inc incorporate the different V A And it looks like the the French VAD is actually  better significantly better . If the use the small VAD I th I think it 's on I think it 's easy to do better because it doesn't work at all . He Actually , I think that he say with the good VAD of from OGI and with the Alcatel VAD . phd f: Yeah but I it 's  I think you were talking about the other mail that used VAD on the reference features . professor a:  it was enough better that that it would  account for a fair amount of the difference between our performance , actually . phd f: And perhaps we can easily improve if if we put like mean normalization before the before the VAD . professor a: H Hynek will be back in town  the week after next , back back in the country . phd d: Also is Stephane was thinking that maybe it was useful to f to think about  voiced - unvoiced phd f:   phd f: Yeah , my feeling is that  actually when we look at all the proposals , ev everybody is still using some kind of spectral envelope professor a: Right . phd f: Yeah , well , not pitch , but to look at the  fine at the at the high re high resolution spectrum . We don't necessarily want to find the the pitch of the of the sound but  Cuz I have a feeling that when we look when we look at the just at the envelope there is no way you can tell if it 's voiced and unvoiced , if there is some It 's it 's easy in clean speech because voiced sound are more low frequency and . phd f:  there is the first formant , which is the larger and then voiced sound are more high frequencies cuz it 's frication and professor a: Right . When you have noise there is no  if if you have a low frequency noise it could be taken for for voiced speech and . professor a: but but phd b: Isn't there some other phd f: S phd b:  d phd f: So I think that it it would be good Yeah , yeah , well , go go on . phd b: I was just gonna say isn't there aren't aren't there lots of ideas for doing voice activity , or speech - nonspeech rather ,  by looking at  , you know ,  I guess harmonics or looking across time professor a: Well , I think he was talking about the voiced - unvoiced , though , phd f: Mmm . phd b:  w ah you know ,  even with the voiced - non voiced - unvoiced phd f: Mmm . phd f:  yeah , so yeah , I think if we try to develop a second stream well , there would be one stream that is the envelope and the second , it could be interesting to have that 's something that 's more related to the fine structure of the spectrum . We were thinking about like using ideas from from Larry Saul , have a good voice detector , have a good , well , voiced - speech detector , that 's working on on the FFT and  professor a: U phd f: Larry Saul could be an idea . We were are thinking about just kind of  taking the spectrum and computing the variance of of the high resolution spectrum and things like this .  we had a guy here some years ago who did some work on  making use of voicing information  to help in reducing the noise . phd f: Yeah ? professor a: So what he was doing is basically y you you do estimate the pitch . professor a: And  you from that you you estimate or you estimate fine harmonic structure , whichev ei either way , it 's more or less the same . But  the thing is that  you then can get rid of things that are not i if there is strong harmonic structure , you can throw away stuff that 's that 's non - harmonic . professor a: And that that is another way of getting rid of part of the noise phd f: Yeah . It was kind of like RASTA was taking care of convolutional stuff phd f: Mmm . We 've actually back when Chuck was here we did some voiced - unvoiced  classification using a bunch of these , phd f: But professor a: and and  works OK . professor a: But the thing is that you can't given the constraints of this task , we can't , in a very nice way , feed forward to the recognizer the information the probabilistic information that you might get about whether it 's voiced or unvoiced , where w we can't you know affect the the  distributions or anything . phd b: Didn't the head dude send around that message ? Yeah , I think you sent us all a copy of the message , where he was saying that I I 'm not sure , exactly , what the gist of what he was saying , but something having to do with the voice activity detector and that it will that people shouldn't put their own in or something . professor a: I guess what you could do , maybe this would be w useful , if if you have if you view the second stream , yeah , before you before you do KLT 's and so forth , if you do view it as probabilities , and if it 's an independent So , if it 's if it 's  not so much envelope - based by fine - structure - based ,  looking at harmonicity or something like that ,  if you get a probability from that information and then multiply it by you know , multiply by all the voiced outputs and all the unvoiced outputs , you know , then use that as the phd f:   professor a:  take the log of that or  pre pre  pre - nonlinearity , phd f: Yeah . i if professor a:  and do the KLT on the on on that , phd f: Yeah . And then that would be phd f: Yeah , well , I was not thinking this yeah , this could be an yeah So you mean have some kind of probability for the v the voicing professor a: R Right . If you have a tandem system and then you have some kind of it can be pretty small net phd f:   professor a: and the and and you use the thing is to use information primarily that 's different as you say , it 's more fine - structure - based than than envelope - based phd f:   professor a:  so then it you you you can pretty much guarantee it 's stuff that you 're not looking at very well with the other one , and  then you only use for this one distinction . professor a: And and so now you 've got a probability of the cases , and you 've got  the probability of the finer  categories on the other side . professor a: if they really are from independent information sources then they should have different kinds of errors phd f:   professor a: and roughly independent errors , and it 's a good choice for phd f:   Because , yeah , well , spectral subtraction is good and we could u we could use the fine structure to to have a better estimate of the noise but still there is this issue with spectral subtraction that it seems to increase the variance of of of professor a: Yeah . phd f:  Well it 's this musical noise which is annoying if you d you do some kind of on - line normalization after . Spectral subtraction and on - line normalization don't seem to to go together very well . I professor a: Or if you do a spectral subtraction do some spectral subtraction first and then do some on - line normalization then do some more spectral subtraction  , maybe maybe you can do it layers or something so it doesn't doesn't hurt too much or something . professor a: But it but  , anyway I think I was sort of arguing against myself there by giving that example phd f: Yeah . professor a:   cuz I was already sort of suggesting that we should be careful about not spending too much time on exactly what they 're doing In fact if you get if you go into  a  harmonics - related thing it 's definitely going to be different than what they 're doing and   phd f:   I know that when have people have done  sort of the obvious thing of taking  your feature vector and adding in some variables which are pitch related or  that it hasn't my impression it hasn't particularly helped . professor a: But I think  that 's that 's a question for this  you know extending the feature vector versus having different streams . Was it nois noisy condition ? the example that you you just professor a: And and it may not have been noisy conditions . I I don't remember the example but it was it was on some DARPA data and some years ago and so it probably wasn't , actually phd f:   But we were thinking , we discussed with Barry about this , and perhaps thinking we were thinking about some kind of sheet cheating experiment where we would use TIMIT professor a:  - huh . phd f: and see if giving the d  , this voicing bit would help in in terms of  frame classification . professor a: Why don't you why don't you just do it with Aurora ? phd f: Mmm . professor a: Just any i in in each in each frame phd f: Yeah , but but B but we cannot do the cheating , this cheating thing . Cuz we don't have Well , for Italian perhaps we have , but we don't have this labeling for Aurora . professor a: But you could  you can you can align so that It 's not perfect , but if you if you know what was said and phd b: But the problem is that their models are all word level models . phd b: You So you could find out where the word boundaries are but that 's about it . grad e: S But we could use  the the noisy version that TIMIT , which you know , is similar to the the noises found in the TI - digits  portion of Aurora . phd f: Well , I guess I guess we can we can say that it will help , but I don't know . If this voicing bit doesn't help , I think we don't have to to work more about this because professor a:  . professor a: and different ta it was probably Resource Management or something , I think you were getting something like still eight or nine percent error on the voicing , as I recall . professor a: what that said is that , sort of , left to its own devices , like without the a strong language model and so forth , that you would you would make significant number of errors just with your  probabilistic machinery in deciding phd b: It also professor a: one oh phd b: Yeah , the though I think  there was one problem with that in that , you know , we used canonical mapping so our truth may not have really been true to the acoustics . Well back twenty years ago when I did this voiced - unvoiced stuff , we were getting more like ninety - seven or ninety - eight percent correct in voicing . professor a: And we did this complex feature selection thing where we looked at all the different possible features one could have for voicing and and and  and exhaustively searched all size subsets and and  for for that particular speaker and you 'd find you know the five or six features which really did well on them . professor a: And then doing doing all of that we could get down to two or three percent error . professor a: So I would I would believe that  it was quite likely that  looking at envelope only , that we 'd be significantly worse than that . phd f: And the all the the SpeechCorders ? what 's the idea behind ? Cuz they they have to Oh , they don't even have to detect voiced spe speech ? professor a: The modern ones don't do a a simple switch . phd f: They just work on the code book professor a: They work on the code book excitation . They try they they try every every possible excitation they have in their code book and find the one that matches best . One of the ideas that we had come up with last week for things to try to improve the system  . Actually I I s we didn't I guess I wrote this in after the meeting b but the thought I had was  looking at the language model that 's used in the HTK recognizer , which is basically just a big loop , grad e:   phd b: and then that can be either go to silence or go to another digit , which That model would allow for the production of infinitely long sequences of digits , right ? professor a: Right . I thought \" well I 'm gonna just look at the what actual digit strings do occur in the training data . phd b: And the interesting thing was it turns out that there are no sequences of two - long or three - long digit strings in any of the Aurora training data . So it 's either one , four , five , six ,  up to eleven , and then it skips and then there 's some at sixteen . So I I just for the heck of it , I made a little grammar which  , you know , had it 's separate path for each length digit string you could get . So there was a one - long path and there was a four - long and a five - long professor a:   phd b: So it was you know , I I didn't have any weights of these paths or I didn't have anything like that . phd b: And I played with tweaking the word transition penalties a bunch , but I couldn't go anywhere . I thought \" well if I only allow \" Yeah , I guess I should have looked at to see how often there was a mistake where a two - long or a three - long path was actually put out as a hypothesis . phd b: So to do that right you 'd probably want to have allow for them all but then have weightings and things "

        "Summary": "The user interface designer proposed incorporating speech recognition and gesture recognition technologies into the controller for convenience and to differentiate it from traditional controllers. However, the project manager raised concerns about the reliability of these features and the potential increase in cost. The designer suggested collaborating with a research institute to address these issues, as the vocabulary would be limited and language adaptations could be made for international users. Despite these solutions, there were still unresolved problems with the necessary microphone and camera for the technologies.",
        "Article": "project manager: and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . So I will first  marketing: No y you do the minutes first , or ? project manager: What ? marketing: No ? project manager: I I think I will let  our User Interface Designer speak first , Mister David Jordan . The second concept is a fancy controller ,  so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive ,  they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g  industrial designer:  . industrial designer: marketing: user interface: Yeah , it's very , you know project manager: It's very big , user interface: if you're project manager: yeah . marketing: user interface: It's hard f i it's easy for you to remember it . user interface: so maybe we should  use   technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and  gesture recognition . project manager: I just have one question , because for the intelligent controller , you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition , user interface: Yeah . project manager: but as the  expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels . Do you think they will be able to use gestures ? user interface: Yeah , so project manager: Because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ? user interface: Y marketing: industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , I think they will be bored after a while . You don't think so ? user interface:  I think some time it's very  convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button . user interface: For example , if you cannot find your  controller , you can just  just just  speak something such as , yeah , one two . project manager: I industrial designer: Oh yeah , that's a good that's a good point , so . industrial designer: marketing: Yeah but how how is how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition ? project manager: Broken arm ? user interface: For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very marketing: Okay . project manager: Yeah , but suppose you have a family watching T_V_ , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you think it will work ? Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: If you have one brother and one sister marketing: Yeah project manager: and they want to watch their favourite  T_V_ programme , marketing: Yeah , but the project manager: so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time , industrial designer: Yeah but Yeah user interface: Yeah , it's very interesting . industrial designer: but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , marketing: I don't think it project manager: but you have the remote control , so maybe you can keep it f with you . marketing: Oh , okay , okay , you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff . Even you h you have the controller , I can I can say channel three , industrial designer: It's it's marketing: No . user interface: so it's c come to channel three , marketing: No , but this is disadvant disadvantage . user interface: I don't have to project manager: Yeah , I think it's a disadvantage . industrial designer: And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to project manager: Yeah , but one other question . marketing:  if you if if you use the basic user interface: No no we just  have some cooperation with some research institute , we don't have to do some basic research on this field . project manager: So you think it won't cost an Not a lot for us ? Or ? user interface: Yeah , I think it's  because  this technology is   for limited wor or limited wor  lexical recognition , it's very project manager: Yeah , but   user interface: it's  yeah . It's marketing: But it's it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built . industrial designer: Well y y you have also the language problem , user interface: No it's  Even for the f  because the the vocabulary the industrial designer: you know when you project manager: project manager: Yeah , but there is one problem that  Baba talked about is the international industrial designer: Yeah . If you want to go to England , it will be able to understand English , user interface: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , the key , the key  the key of our the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some some  adaptation marketing: Yeah , this could be downloaded by the web maybe , or industrial designer: Yeah but you know . It's It's it means when you when you sell this controller in China it's can recognise Chinese . industrial designer: It's a very smart , it's a very smart controller maybe project manager: okay . user interface: Yeah , project manager: And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ? user interface: it's industrial designer: Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah . project manager: Yeah , but how will you user interface: So industrial designer: Yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one . industrial designer: because  the for example for Se user interface: Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to industrial designer: Oh really ? That's project manager: Oh . marketing: but then w Yeah , industrial designer: Comple user interface: No , it's not so complex . marketing: we have to take care of the twelve Euros project manager: And what about voice recognition , do we have microphones ? marketing: problem . project manager: And where will be they ? Do you think if we're far from television it will work ? user interface: No no no it's not I think that's n that's not a problem because you you don't have to wear a microphone . industrial designer: project manager: Yeah , but we're marketing: No , but then it's it's like this  project manager: here it's  an object . project manager: Yeah , but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object . user interface: Yeah yeah just you just put the controller here , then you industrial designer: I if you say one , he switch to channel , user interface: you use your command project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: yeah . user interface: No no it's n y if you lose it industrial designer: So well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the T_V_ to switch to channel one . project manager: Okay you so you can build a kind of black box industrial designer: Devic project manager: and put it on T_V_ and just to recognize gestures and voice . Or is it do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ? Or you you still have the possibility to use buttons ? user interface: think it we should give the  flexibility to the user and we think marketing: Okay , so you project manager: Yeah , user interface: yeah . user interface: No , project manager: And maybe it will be quite user interface: that's quite inter quite attractive . industrial designer: But I think that , you know , switching from one country to to another will be a problem , so although y y user interface: Well , if you do language adaptation , there should be no problem . marketing: What ? project manager: Which kind of controller would you prefer to use , you as a remote control user ? marketing: If if  ,  I'm sure if the user pays the same price , he's happy to have recognition . industrial designer: Yeah , but marketing: But if if if it like doubles  industrial designer: I think he need a control that is very reliable , marketing: no one would would be interested . project manager: So I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller . user interface: project manager: Just want to have something controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy . You think it's possible ? user interface: Yeah but if if you stick to  stick to the first two parts . So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ? There's no k features of our controller , so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ? industrial designer: Yeah . No , user interface: Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that marketing:  industrial designer: It's not really the we marketing: Y industrial designer: we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet , so or something like that . But  I think a user need user interface: Yeah , you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller , that's a function of T_V_ . You can replace your T_V_ with a new T_V_ with internet browsing function , marketing: No , user interface: but marketing: but you need you need new remote controller then . Because if you wanna browse internet or , I don't know , if you wanna type something , industrial designer: Don't have a the the Yeah user interface: Okay . user interface: But it's not the only the problem only the issue of controller , it's it's also the issue of the T_V_ . industrial designer: Because the p the problem I can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example if marketing: Cause for example yeah . user interface: Yeah , but we do we do we we we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller , marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , but  we want so user interface: but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , but you when you choose a new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition . user interface: the feature is not one hundred percent reliable , but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our from other products . project manager: Yeah , but w we we want something th that works all the time , every day , every hour , for everyone . industrial designer: And for all the person of the family maybe , user interface: Yeah ,  project manager: You don't need to tune it . user interface: Yeah , if if if if you're if you ar if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable , would you replace it with another one ? project manager: Yeah , why not ? If it's marketing: for example the goo y industrial designer: Because you have new marketing: you say we would we would to have a Google-like controller . marketing: I don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like Google . marketing: so I I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it's already a lot . marketing:  thi this  , the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition user interface: The then nn marketing: or user interface: no . marketing: if he has something that works fine and is really fancy , looks nice and it's easy easy to use , easy to use . user interface: But the there's there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller . marketing: See user interface: That's the same marketing: That's the problem , user interface: yeah .  , I I know it's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever . marketing: But you have to think , the user is the one who gonna buy the product user interface: Yeah . project manager: Two ? industrial designer: Yeah , participant two  project manager: Working ? industrial designer: Yeah , working design , user interface: industrial designer: so . marketing: industrial designer: So I think project manager: I can industrial designer: Can you go to the next one ? I  it's not this one . industrial designer: It's  oth the oth so I marketing: industrial designer: It's the working design . project manager: It's okay industrial designer: So this yeah so this is the described use project manager: industrial designer: What ? Are you inst project manager:  I think there's something wrong with your user interface: It did didn't r receive it . project manager: It seems that we have a problem with the marketing: I dunno if you remember what you had to say or industrial designer: I can say it to you without . project manager: Yeah , so user interface: Yeah , maybe we can first come to project manager: No , I think it will be more interesting to start with  user interface:  to Frahan . With Frahan , then you can prepare your slides , marketing: I think it's more interesting what he says , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: exac marketing: project manager: You will had s some more information in industrial designer: Okay . industrial designer: I s because i in my presentation I don't have here with user interface: project manager: Okay , never mind . industrial designer: so It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r user interface: Okay . So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside user interface: Okay . So I in fact the the f something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use , project manager: industrial designer: so will it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one . industrial designer: so it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like L_C_D_ where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night , project manager: industrial designer: And the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be for example  d  solar energy alimentation user interface: -huh . And I think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have  both of them , so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities  for example in some place in in S Senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come user interface: industrial designer: and so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con It can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example . project manager: Yeah , I think it's an added value to the remote control industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers industrial designer: Ecologists , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . project manager: and but about the the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more , industrial designer: project manager: no ? industrial designer: Alrigh In fact , having them both will if we want to have battery , regular battery and and the solar energy battery it could be it'll it will add a little bit of the price , project manager: So . project manager: And what tha what about the  materials ? industrial designer: And the materials , it depends for example you if you have a wooden material it can be more the plastic material is more common project manager: Impersonal , industrial designer: it's very resistant but , you know , something wooden will be like , I don't know high cl so a special high class , project manager: Yeah . marketing: Special for industrial designer: or you know , you can have some project manager: Yeah , and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood . industrial designer: Yeah , even if it is not completely wood , but just a part of the , you know , will be wooden , in wood user interface: industrial designer: And so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , it depends , but I think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module . project manager: Yeah , we want something easy to use and so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough . project manager: And you think that we will be industrial designer: Yeah , I think it will fit on the price we want , twel twelve Euros , project manager: Okay . industrial designer: project manager: And what about the buttons ? industrial designer: I think the buttons I pr I prefer , you know , the L_C_D_ you know lighted buttons because , you know , it's I don't know  yeah , in the dark , it's fashion project manager: No it's fashion , yeah . industrial designer: and it's related to how beautiful it is or  if you want to watch T_V_ in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness it's very easy so , right . industrial designer: I think a touch screen will be t as expensive as the L_C_D_ buttons so .  , I think so , just Yeah , so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of  have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , so next . project manager: marketing: So again , it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting . Like the one you've shown , David , with all the buttons and  i i it sounds good technically user interface:  . marketing: but it's it's not what they want and  So , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on . Wha what we really see this year is that  everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables , industrial designer: Ah yes . marketing: okay , so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing . And then  if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance . marketing: So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , and then if we combine this with the fashion  from Milan and Paris industrial designer: And fruit and vegetables yeah . And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch , industrial designer: Spongy 'Kay . industrial designer: Yeah , but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ? marketing: Yeah thi this is this would be like  industrial designer: Pla S marketing: plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like  industrial designer: Very stuff Okay , rubber rubber desi okay , yeah . marketing: Okay , tha tha that was the main point , I think , from the trend in fashion . So , as you say you want something technologically innovative , maybe using solar energy and with battery would be something interesting , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager:  cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be  enough to have something working well . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: industrial designer: No wood but Plastic ? marketing: Maybe not no wood , but  ma maybe not the part you touching you know . industrial designer: Would some user interface: Pla project manager: Maybe you industrial designer: I think we can have wood for example in the bottom and , you know . marketing: But still y project manager: Th The feeling is natural , industrial designer: Yeah , it's natural marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: And it can be correlated to energy , solar energy , so for the marketing aspect , you know , saying that it's ecol marketing: Yeah ,  it's not exactly right for the spongy point of view . marketing: But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons , industrial designer: Okay . project manager:  and what about the user interface concept ? industrial designer: Google and project manager: Google and fancy ? industrial designer: and fancy , f how about the the voice ? And project manager: Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this . industrial designer:  maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested user interface:  yes . industrial designer: But and the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the T_V_ , so speak directly to the T_V_ and you don't need a remote control actually , project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: so . industrial designer: But it will be embedded on the T_V_ and not on the remote control , so . project manager: So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller , marketing: I dunno . project manager: maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood . project manager: Yeah , I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add . And pf what can we think a supplement to marketing: What interface ? project manager: Yeah , for the interface something added value . It is just , you know , it is not the most important , but it can be a part of project manager: With a module ? You mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . So the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes so we'll you will all have to work in in your direction . So you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the  simple vocal commands recognition . project manager:  you will have to work more , Baba , on the  spongy way to to add spongy  touch to the buttons industrial designer: expensive buttons Yeah , to make some new project manager: and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control . project manager: And remember as as I said last meeting , we really have to build a fashion remote control and  the colour of the  the society will be really it will be seen in the remote control . project manager: So you will have Baba and David Jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us  modelling a cl a clay remote control , user interface: Yeah . Yep project manager: And I think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach "

I've also made notes of the previous meeting and  I was about to send them you but then  I had to go to this  meeting so you will get them too  marketing: project manager: Then I hope you all have  worked out some some  some some presentations about  about well you the the task given to you in the previous meeting .  then I will  bring in some some some new requirements I I got  from the  account manager , I try to work them out , they were quite abstract , and we can have maybe have com some discussion about it . project manager: and Well in this meeting we should really try to reach a decision about the target group and the functionality of the marketing:  . industrial designer: You mean the social target group who we wants to target ? project manager: Yes  well yes w who are we going to  to well to sell this , marketing:  . So And then  we will close this meeting  user interface: project manager: and after this meeting we'll  we'll have a lunch . Maybe  why  Anna can you c do you have a presentations ? marketing: No , I don't . project manager:  you want a table to to  marketing: I c I can talk about it but I have no slides or anything . project manager: Yes yes maybe maybe you can  can just talk about it or maybe you can use the whiteboard if necessary  . Well I've just been  presented with some research we've done in a small focus group so , a hundred people , just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in a remote control . It's probably can't email this to you , I've just got a web page with some data on it .  seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot , so they use their remote control quite frequently while they're watching television . Fifty percent of users say that they only use ten percent of the buttons , so they've got a remote control with a lot of functionality but really most of the time they only use a small part of that . project manager: Do you Do you have this  information on the web page you said ? marketing: I have an a web page yes . So basically  there's a breakdown of how much they use the different functions on a rem remote control .  , channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times  and then there's things like channel settings , audio settings , which are only used very infrequently . Teletext is used  fourteen times in the hour , so it is used but not nearly as much as the channel selection is used . marketing: An interesting thing that this report has brought up is that  fifty fifty percent of users report that the remote control gets lost a lot of the time in the room , so some way of some way of locating the remote control would be very useful to a lot of users . industrial designer: marketing: Thirty four percent said it takes too long to learn to use a remote control , they want something that's easier to use straight away , more intuitive perhaps . industrial designer: It's it's easy to learn or how do you say it's marketing: Thirty four percent said it took too much time to learn to use a new one . industrial designer: Not enough marketing: I don't know how we'd go about combating that . What do you mean there ? marketing: For R_S_I_ ? Respet Repetitive strain injury . project manager: But it's it's the opinion of the  of the users huh ? marketing: Yeah . marketing:  and then it's got a demographic breakdown on industrial designer: Maybe y y you cannot put this webpage online on the marketing:  I should be able to actually , if I email it to you now . user interface: You can disconnect it there project manager: You can maybe just just user interface: no ? marketing: Oh no , yeah . industrial designer: Ah it's it okay it's a webpage on the C_ it's a file marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: So these are important numbers that Matthew and I need to take into account for our functional  user interface: Oh yeah . It's probably easier if you put it on yours and then I'll just email it to you . industrial designer: Yeah these numbers have have to be have to be taken into account for the  both yeah user interface and functional design . marketing: One thing it goes on to talk about , which is interesting , is the hang on a minute . industrial designer: Because if there are many numbers and we need to select to to constraint  our design based on what is more important . industrial designer: Speech recognition in marketing: And who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful . industrial designer: So that we don't Do we not need any button on the remote control marketing: Well potentially yeah ,  project manager: user interface: industrial designer: it would be all based on speech . project manager: Well it would it would be a solution for  when your remote control is lost , marketing: project manager:  when it has speech recognition then  i then it doesn't matter where it is , my well it's we should be in range , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: I'm not sure whether we will we can make this for for twelve Euro fi and fifty cents . industrial designer: And we don't know where the state of the art of speech recognition is , maybe you know ? user interface: Oh . Well , it depends you know like there is  it's a very small vocabulary that you want to do the operations like you want to say on , off , one , two , twenty three , project manager:  . project manager: Yes , user interface: It's it's going to be li project manager: that that that that's  . user interface: it's not going to be s so easy but u usually it's going to be more of an isolated case project manager: Do you have some more important facts user interface: but it's but I don't know with twenty fi marketing:  project manager: or can we go to the next presentation ? industrial designer: Okay . So marketing: Well industrial designer: you had to to to summarise maybe the marketing: This is now talking about  who would pay for speech recognition in a remote control , who would pay more for it ,  . Ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more , it goes down from there , seventy six percent for twenty five to thirty five , thirty five percent for thirty five to forty five ,  twenty two percent for forty five to fifty five and then eight percent for fifty five to sixty five . marketing: Yeah , it really depends where we're gonna be targeting this product , user interface: project manager:  . industrial designer: I thi You us marketing: It'll be in a different window , yep . marketing: Another thing it's talking about there is the L_C_D_ screen but there's no figures apparently on that .  I okay project manager: Oh , industrial designer: I stay project manager: this is user interface: Now you can move I think yeah . user interface: It's a channel selection , a module , this and this function , marketing: Sorry ? Oh .  I'd like first to give a quick a very simple introduction , how does it work , so that everybody knows even if you don't have a very  technical background  what is it because I think in the product it is important . industrial designer: So basically  the basic function of a remote control is to send  messages to another system that is fixed . industrial designer: And so an energy source feeds an integrated circuit , the chip , that can compose messages , usually  through a  infrared bit marketing: So my method for  designing the yeah the work design  yeah first the the main point is that I would wish to to make a really functional product . I would prefer to have very functional  capabilities rather than fancy stuff that in fact is not used and doesn't work . industrial designer: So for that yeah as it's important to take into account the user requirements from the Marketing  Expert  Anna marketing: industrial designer: and  w to to we should agree on what are the technical functions  for this remote control and I show you the the working design .  we want an on off button , it can be  it's simple but it's it's important , and also  the to both channels as well as other buttons that come after , marketing:  . So the components I quickly draw here , is that in this part you have the remote control the the sender and on the other part the receiver so that's my method is  will be to well my aim would be to  design the and choose the chips and the infrared  components to build the remote control marketing: This is very quick  design ,  you stop me or interrupt me if  you don't agree on it on that . industrial designer: And  so what I have found and after a lot of work actually I I draw this I draw for you this  schema marketing: Well . industrial designer: that can be maybe too technical for you but is very important for me marketing: You drew it a long time ago ? industrial designer: you know . industrial designer: And  that's it so I won't go into details about that project manager: overwhelming . So project manager: are they cheap , or are they  reliable ? What were your industrial designer: found and yeah th you have always a compromise with  reliability and  i if it's expensive , project manager:  . industrial designer: but  this one was not this one also really  reliable  so yeah that's it for the working design ,  I hope you get clearer view on  what what a remote control is  in terms of  technical components project manager: Yes . industrial designer: but maybe yeah project manager: So user interface: But is it  can you just buy it on the market and f plug it in or you want to ma industrial designer: No no no no we we will  This is a preference but we can always change  project manager: What I w what I was thinking about  the the the schema  about  the sender and the receiver ,  can you can you get back to it ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yeah  , the receiver is of course already in the television and we are not  able to change it . We will use  infrared protocol  using yeah infrared and  and of course we need to adapt to that protocol that already exists project manager: industrial designer: and but we what we can do is   adapting the the chips inside  to the best  chips and  infrared bubbles . Of course yeah user interface: But you should be careful , industrial designer: in the chip you have it yeah . user interface: people are sometime becoming problem , like a guy has recently designed a remote    which could switch off any other T_V_s , so basically through all the things . user interface: So maybe we should think of marketing: industrial designer: Of course yeah we should take that into account marketing: That's handy . project manager: Yeah yes marketing: So if the b T_V_ in the next apartment's really loud , you can just turn it off . industrial designer: in the  user interface: Yeah so you can just go on the street and then switch off everyone's T_V_ and you can just walk away industrial designer: user interface: You don't have to be near the T_V_ at all . project manager: I I feel I I I think M Mael will will consider this  th these things . So  I'm going to talk a little bit about the technical function so wha what actually it's about what is the user going to do , I think my last presented what is going inside , marketing: user interface: so what's the user is going to see from the outside and how he is going to use it . So well the approach is that  basically the idea is to send a message to the T_V_ set , as Mael has pointed , and it will be decoded by the T_V_ and usually we it is easier to have  keys or buttons with which people can  press and then  changing a button will basically  change the message which is being sent to the T_V_ and   industrial designer: So p as  Anna has said that this ki people are interested in things which are you don't need to k press the keys , people are can have a speech recognition but this is  s a question which will we have to see later . user interface: But in the present scenario is that you have certain keys and you press it like your mobile phone , and it sends a message to the T_V_ . user interface: And  so generally  I don't have some figures sorry but  so there are two kinds of  remote if you popularly in the household , actually so you have a standard T_V_ remote where you have just a on , off button and play ,  volume change and  keys for the number and more than one digit option . And if you see for example righ right now   even the one  on more than one digit option is for two digit channel which is like ninety nine , but tomorrow you might have one fifty channels you know to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows , but   . Then there is  this is the standard one with without any fancy thing you know like i it doesn't have teletext option , it can without any , it's a very simple thing ,  which which you can vouch . And then you have  what's the v video remote file which is like usually it has almost all the keys over there and , but it then it has other options like stop  and then you play the movie or  or fo fast forward the movie or something like that so i it has those marketing: And then well personal preferences I would  basically think of having a kind of aim for the next generation thing where the we could have both the  the f a T_V_ and the remote video remote control because  some of the keys in the video's remote control and the T_V_ they could be integrated together so that  we could  aim for the like in the f coming future  that type of  applications with marketing: Okay . How would that work ? So you've got say maybe a V_C_R_ and a T_V_ which are separate , user interface: marketing: so you on my one at home I've got a V_C_R_ remote which then changes the channel on the V_C_R_ and doesn't do anything on the T_V_ , user interface: Yeah . marketing: so is it gonna be like a switch on the remote that says t use the T_V_ or use the V_C_R_ ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: or does it know which one you want to use ? user interface:  actually  you could you could think of  having s a y you can have a key which could tell y it could go to the video thing marketing: user interface: but   yo you you you still can't  in that case when it you use that the function should be able to take up the V_C_R_ option marketing: user interface: and you could play it or You can also think about having like  I in a few days you will be ha in in few ye coming years you might even have a system where you have a separate  sitting setup box marketing: user interface: and  you have   something like   you do you do you suppose you are not able to watch some programme and actually it downloading all the time for you marketing: user interface: and  you can just you know  when you come back you could just switch on that thing and  watch a program . user interface: In that case you want to browse faster , browse slow , you want to have those kind of functionalities . user interface: It's the next generation thing , project manager:  yes , user interface: but it is going to come in couple of years . project manager: but I think it's i i it's already there , user interface: It's goi project manager:  the hard disk  recorders  I I've seen them in the shop . user interface: it's going to record your things and you and you you need basically the functionalities what you need in both   video as well as in the standard T_V_ thing . That's , user interface: No no we are not making a universal remote , marketing: yeah . user interface: we are just looking at  giving a scenario , I have a T_V_ and tomorrow I am going to have set up box marketing:  . user interface: which is going to sit there and  it's going to do that job for me . Because y project manager: W w w w we need to decide on on on on in how far we go to in this . project manager: Mean , you can go pretty far I f I think with with with functions and possible  future p  prospects marketing:  . So we can always discuss about it for example  the presently the video market actually  this demand , video over-demand or what we call it as , it's presently booming up actually industrial designer: user interface: so it i like people are providing like  things like   movies , you can select actually so you want to watch a movie and  your p your provider gives a list of movies , and then you select those list . user interface: and then when you come you want to loo watch it on your T_V_ . industrial designer: Or even you don't need to download it , it's streamed  online  yeah . user interface: Yeah it can be streamed online for you and you can say what time I want to watch the movie marketing:  . project manager: I have  received some some some some well points of of thinking over of my account manager and  I would like to share them with you . project manager: first thing is  teletext is a well known feature of televisions marketing: Do we include it , and do we give it a prominent  prominent  place on on on the on well huh on the remote mot control itself . project manager:  as  a in any case it's it's not used , well very much , but it's it is still used . project manager: further yes we must think ,  do we stay  to to television only , the television as we as we all know it with with broadcasting signals and you can't go back  huh , or do we   go further as Matthew indicated by supporting   recording  devices ? user interface: marketing: So D_V_D_s and V_C_R_s ? project manager:  indeed indeed .  , furthermore , w we need really need to interest  y younger customers and then with younger customers  people  below the age of forty , marketing: project manager: So industrial designer: So project manager: that's to that's  there's a market but  they will grow older older marketing: project manager: and you'll al always need to have the the future with younger people . project manager:  therefore , younger people like trendy trendy designs , so that's w we should make our our our R_C_ as trendy as possible but it should also be  have a reliable image , so when it looks too too spacey or too fancy people will think well does it work at all . user interface: Yeah it's  well you you can follow the ideas how you want to keep the keys , you know right now if you take it you have like zero , one , two , three like a keys separately , marketing: user interface: but suppose if you take the the present trend of mobile phones there are like big thick keys marketing:  . user interface: you press on the top , it takes one number , you press on the bottom it takes another number , and  basically   so the space covered so that you don't see two separate keys there actually industrial designer: But I think taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting , especially if we're going after a younger market , user interface: Yeah so . Yes yes marketing: that's the the the  the new and the funky things , project manager: mo industrial designer: Because they are already used to that , you know , product . marketing: that's , project manager: Yes it's recognisable industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: yeah , there's lot there's lots of pretty mobile phones , not too many pretty remote controls . So , for example you have  presently  keys like one , two , three like this , actually , and   four five six like that and  you can have keys like this in form like  keys like that project manager: Mael can you hand me over this  ? industrial designer: Yes . How much longer have we got for the meeting by the way ? project manager:  well marketing: 'Cause we haven't talked about demographic at all project manager: I think fi five min user interface: Forty minutes ? marketing: and it's a very important issue . too sorry , so we basically don't change the  original order of them industrial designer: user interface: but then the keys are more spacious , marketing: user interface: they don't look  so there there is a very sligh thing , so if you press on the top it takes the one , it takes the three ,  four , sorry four here  five and six , marketing:  . user interface: so the keys can be it looks you know not very much cluttered but it looks nice industrial designer: user interface: but you can have a lot of options t if you press on the to project manager: Okay . industrial designer: marketing: basically we're trying to get people to buy a remote control user interface: Yeah . marketing: wouldn't they already have a remote control with their television when they buy one ? user interface: project manager: Of course they have already one . marketing: 'cause it's only a low market , it's a cheap-end remote control , we can't beat modern functionality , we might we'll be able to beat them on th the look of it , th the design of it but that's not a big seller , if they're not just going to buy a new remote control just 'cause it looks pretty , they have to actually need it as well . I well I think many people said  in your in in your research    the appearance of the  R_C_ is is important when they are buying one marketing:  . I've got friends who've got so many things they need a universal remote , otherwise they're using five different remotes for their all their things . marketing: In that case they wouldn't buy our product , because it doesn't give them what they need in terms of functionality . project manager: So your you think we should go for a more u universal high-performance marketing: Well , we can't , with the price range . project manager: What do What do you think about What componen industrial designer: Yeah we have yeah twelve point five Euros  per  per R_ s R_C_ marketing:  . industrial designer: and I think  with this now you know that chips are very  cheaps marketing: If we're getting into universal remote territory , we're getting to L_C_D_ screens and things like that industrial designer: that's marketing: which would drive the cost up a lot . industrial designer: Ye project manager: Is the L_C_D_ screen marketing: For universal remotes industrial designer: I don't think L_C_D_ is not necessary well , th for long term . project manager: I think thi this could be this could be a market because  universal remote controls  tend to be  quite expensive . marketing: And quite complicated to use , project manager: S so we can try to go in between , marketing: yes . project manager: but but still but still people have the idea this is more functional than a normal   R_C_ industrial designer: Universal . project manager: marketing: But if we're going for the say fifteen to twenty five age group then not many of them would actually own T_V_s to use a remote control on . project manager:  yes but w we're targeting I think on more on the on the twenty to forty group . Who just have or already have a job and have the money but may not want to spend that much money on a on a universal universal control . Are we gonna be at the very bottom of the price range , or are we kind of middle to bottom ? I don't know . project manager: I think  when we think it over I thi I think we are trying to offer the a kind of universal control for for less money . project manager: So d Do you agree ? user interface: Well Well I it's fine with me like the price as long as it is  not too expensive . industrial designer: Yeah user interface:  and it d  Our provin industrial designer: because we have to take into account that we are gonna b we are gonna sell  four aro around four million so when we speak about these numbers  the price of a chip is  price of a chip is very cheap . industrial designer: So I'm okay for designing  a ne  less yeah a a kind of universal  R_C_ yeah . And  basically you can look to the standards of other industrial designer: Yeah that's needed , yeah . So I guess what I'd like from a universal remote is maybe choosing between three devices , being able to switch between them , there may be stereo , V_C_R_ and T_V_ . marketing: And just be able to s use them all from the same remote , but not at the same time . user interface: Yeah you can also browse through all the standards you know , where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them . project manager: So given we are going for this   universal type  m maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need and y you will try to get more specific  user interface content industrial designer: Yes . project manager: and  maybe you can look on on what trends are in this  in this type of market . user interface: and we'll I'm sure we'll up something good marketing: project manager: W yes , user interface: for the project manager: we  we can have lunch now . project manager: So  Then th th the next meeting will  user interface: Yeah so we meet in well what are our project manager: after lunch you have  we have  thirty minutes of work and then we have the next meeting "

        "Query": "Summarize the main points discussed in Marketing's presentation during the last meeting and the group's feedback on it.",
        "Summary": "The remote control should not only be small, easy to use, and eye-catching, but also have buttons with a soft feel and a trendy design, possibly incorporating fruit and vegetable elements. Marketing suggested incorporating one or two star features, such as speech recognition, to build the campaign around. The energy source for the remote should be a battery, and it was emphasized that the remote should be brought to the market before the competition. Marketing emphasized the importance of adopting the latest trends and fashion updates for the remote control, particularly for the targeted young users. This includes features like an LCD screen, vivid colors, and a cool shape. However, it was noted that the decisions made regarding the interface did not align with the desired look and feel. The team discussed the possibility of incorporating Bluetooth functionality, but ultimately decided against it. They also explored the idea of using squeezable rubber as an energy generator. Easy usability was another key point raised by Marketing, who suggested incorporating fruit-shaped buttons to align with the upcoming fashion trend. The Project Manager proposed marketing the control in different colors for different groups of people, similar to the iPod. During the evaluation process, Marketing expressed dissent regarding the financial aspects of the design, highlighting the need for further adjustments during budget control. The lack of information about prices led to unrealistic discussions about costly functions like recognition. Marketing believed that users would be interested in a speech recognizer to simplify program selection and reduce the number of buttons. The remote control should also be small and affordable. The team briefly considered lighting adapting options but ultimately left the decision to the Industrial Designer and User Interface designer. The team also discussed potential user-friendly features, including tracking devices to recognize personal preferences and a voice activator to help locate the remote. However, due to budget constraints, these ideas were set aside. The Industrial Designer mentioned the importance of considering repetitive strain injury (RSI) in the ergonomic design process and suggested using touch buttons instead of press buttons to mitigate this issue.",
        "Article": " hopefully this meeting I'll be doing a little bit less talking than I did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually .  I'll try and do that for the next meeting as well so if you check in there , there's a shared project documents folder . project manager: Is it best if I send you an email maybe , to let you know it's there ? user interface: Yes , I think so .  I'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through , and then I'll send them to you after the meeting . The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time , so we'll go through each of you one by one . I just sent user interface: Yeah , the last minute , yeah , project manager: at the last minute , I'm sorry about that , user interface: yeah . project manager:  and then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control that's the the main goal is to come up with those two things , target group and functions of the remote control . So I would say industrial designer: You said  targ target groups , project manager: yeah ? industrial designer: what does that mean ? project manager: As  who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to , user interface:  industrial designer:  okay , 'kay . industrial designer: So are project manager: So we need to yeah , we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on industrial designer: Okay .  so f from the project manager: Just before you start , to make it easier , would you three mind emailing me your presentations ? Once we you don't have to do it now but when once you go back , user interface: Okay , yeah , afterwards , yeah , okay . So n  with  with regard to the  working design of this   remote control  I've identified  a few basic  components of the remote and  se  from the design , functional design perspective  w I c we can now  know wha what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other .  the identification of the components ,  and  since since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects , I would need feedback from the marketing person  and  from the user interface person . industrial designer: and  basically update and come up with a new design , so it's a cyclical process .  so basically  the as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it  and what are the different processes  and how the parts  communicate with each other .  okay , so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated , so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control .  also  the remote control should be used only for television , because incorporating other features  makes it more comp complex . How however , our our remote control would only be dealing  with the the use for television , in order to keep things simple .  also the management wants that  our design should be unique  it so it should incorporate  colour and the slogan  that our company  has it as its standard . The user interf interface communicates with the chip , so I'll basic go over to the Okay . So if  if this is our energy source and this is a cell ,  it communicates  it feeds energy into the into the chip , which basically finds out h  how how to do everything . So whe when the user presses a button , it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal ,  which then so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code , which is then communicated to the remote site , which h has an infrared receiver .  so these are the essent so a all the functionality of the remote control , whatever new functions that we need to do ,  make the chip more complicated  and bigger , basically .  so i in my personal preferences  I'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible . And  also if we can incorporate  the latest features in our chip design , so that our   remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with mot most  televisions . project manager: Do you have any  i idea about costs at this point ? industrial designer: No , I don't have any idea about what each component costs . 'Cause that's something to consider , I guess , if we're if we're using more advanced technology , it might increase the price . industrial designer: but  unfortunately I I do not have any data , so  I just identified the functional components for that . Are there any more questions , or shall we just skip straight to the next one and then we can discuss all of them together at the end ? user interface: I think we need like some general discussion at the end probably . Yeah , I think since since we were discussing some  design issues then I I I would like to continue project manager: Yes , shall shall we pull this up ? user interface: okay , yeah . project manager: Yeah , I thought those last minute things , they're gonna hit you the worst . project manager: It ta takes a little Oh , and have you user interface: There's just nothing . project manager: you need to then also press on yours , function F_ eight , user interface: Oh right , right , right ,  project manager: so the blue function key at the bottom and F_ eight . project manager: Now it's coming , industrial designer: It'll come up , it   no signal . user interface: No signal ? Why ? project manager: Maybe again ? industrial designer: Yeah yeah , it says something now , user interface: Oh . project manager: Oh , if you press if you press function and that again user interface: This is the problem , but project manager: there's there's usually three modes , one where it's only here , one where it's only there , and one where it's both . So I'm going to speak about technical functions design  just like some some first issues that came up .  'kay , so the method I was  adopting at this point , it's not  for the for the whole  period of the  all the project but it's just at th at this very moment . user interface:   my method was  to look at  other  remote controls ,  so mostly just by searching on the web and to see what  functionality they used . And then  after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web  just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what  what the user might desire as additional  functionalities . user interface:  so the findings  were  that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set , so this quite straightforward . And  w some of the main functions would be switching on , switching off ,  then the user would like to switch the channel  for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels , or then   the other possibility would be that  she might just want to choose one particular channel , so we would need the numbers .   I als industrial designer: Sorry , cou could you go back for a second ? user interface: okay .   among the findings I found that m m most of the curr  presently available remote controls also include other  functionalities  in their design , like operating a V_C_R_ , but they don't seem to be able to deal with D_V_D_ players , but then there are surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them , but according to the last minute update  actually  we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design . industrial designer: user interface: So my personal preferences would be  to keep the  the whole remote control small  just like the physical size . And then it must be easy to use , so it must follow some conventions  like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something .  then yeah , the must-have buttons would be on off and then the channel numbers and then  the one that allows us to go to the next or the previous channel , and then volume has to be there . But then  other functionalities  could be just  there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then ,  for example brightness and  similar functions could be just  done through the menu . And yeah , the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate n  more functionalities , the answer was already no because of the last minute update . user interface: If you have questions project manager: If  that was the the directive that came through from management , but if we had a a decent case for that we really think it's important to include video and D_V_D_ , I could get back to them and see . user interface: Yeah , and also it's it's  other question is  because there are so many different And there are so many different things that could possibly be included marketing: project manager: user interface: because besides video and D_V_D_ there are the   video C_D_s and whatever , so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things . industrial designer: project manager: Are there any questions for clarification of Maarika before we go on to the next one ? industrial designer: So in the u user interface requirements    we we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want .  but  so so at this stage ,  how we go about implementing those button we will not identify or  in we can completely do away with buttons and  have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that . But  is is there any   any thoughts on that ? user interface:  well , I think the buttons are still  kind of the most  easy for the user to use , industrial designer: Right . user interface:   what other options would you have ? A little screen or something , but this would be really kind of I think a lot of learning for the user industrial designer: Yeah , and it'll make the costs yeah . user interface: and and  the user just wants to get  get a result  quickly , not to spend time in like  giving several orders  I dunno . user interface: I think I th I would I would think the put the buttons , but if if you have other  proposals  . industrial designer:  I think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them . industrial designer:  i if the if the costs allow , we can have like an L_C_D_ display user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: try to press project manager: Is it plugged in prop industrial designer: oh , okay , marketing: It's working . marketing: So what I have , wh where I've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab  observed remote control use with  a hundred subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire .  so it was all about , you know , how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control , you know . What's the most annoying things about remote controls and  the possibility of speech recognition and L_C_D_ screens in remote control . Not that they actually gave me any answers on the L_C_D_ screens , so I should have taken that bit out , but anyway . What they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are , so you know , definitely you should be looking at something quite different . project manager: marketing:  current remote controls , they don't match the user behaviour well , as you'll see on the next slide .  I dunno what zapping is , but project manager: It's  switching between channels , sort of randomly going through .  okay , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons , project manager: industrial designer:  . marketing: so that's going back to what , you know , we were saying earlier about , you know , do you need all the buttons on the remote control , industrial designer: Right .  but project manager: I liked the , I liked the litt marketing: ooh where's it go ? project manager: ooh come back . marketing:  okay , so like what it shows is how much things are used relatively and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection . marketing: What you can't see is volume selection , it's a little bit higher than all the others . project manager: - , that's the next one along , yeah ? marketing: Yeah , so what the graph shows is that , you know , power , channel selection and volume selection are important , and the rest of them , you know , nobody really uses and so that's the the numbers along the top represent their like  their importance , you know , project manager: marketing: and , you know , channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential , and the power , well it's not quite so essential , apparently , although I don't understand how it couldn't be , industrial designer: marketing:  and everything else , I think , you know , you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control , 'cause they're just not needed , and they're not used . marketing: This is the bit that the email messed up for me and that's what I was fiddling about with at the beginning of the thing .  that they get lost , that the  you know , they're not intuitive and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury . marketing: I think if you're watching enough T_V_ to get repetitive strain injury from  you know , watching T_V_ , then that's the least of your problems , project manager: The remote control . Okay , so   the the R_S_I_ thing would be that , like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your wrists up would be something that encourages industrial designer: Right . marketing: you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote control and you know , not straining your wrists watching T_V_ . Right ,  sorry this is pink because I was copying and pasting the table , and I didn't have time to white it out again . So you can see from that that , you know , younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more f well quite are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software , whereas as people get older , they're a bit more sceptical about it and they're less willing to to try it .  so clearly voice recognition is something to think about , but  you know I d I do wonder how well that would work given that a T_V_ , you know , tends to be people talking and  , you know , how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching T_V_ . So you have sleek , stylish , sophisticated , you know , so something that's , you know , a bit cool .  there's a there's an important thing that , you know , people use when , you know , when you're filling up your home , you know , a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap , basically , you know , and you've got all this stuff , and you're just like , what the hell is that , who is ever gonna use it ? You know , so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both , so I think we need to aim for both . marketing:  okay , then a long battery life , like you were talking about earlier and  , you know , I was thinking that solar power would be quite cool because , you know , your remote control just sits there , and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit . industrial designer: marketing:  and then like a locator , so you know , kind of like you have for a mobile phone or industrial designer:  . marketing: not a mobile phone industrial designer: Some kind of a ring , project manager: Keys and things like that , industrial designer: some marketing: Yeah , that's it , you know . My flatmate and I were talking about this on the way into uni this morning and I was like I need to get one for everything . industrial designer: project manager: marketing: So yeah , so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps , something a kind of sound that you don't often hear on the T_V_ , you know , industrial designer: Right . marketing: 'cause you don't want your remote control beeping every five minutes , project manager: marketing: 'cause you you'd then deliberately lose it by throwing it out the window or something . I think one of the very interesting things that came up in   Ka Kate Cat Cat's  presentation was   this this issue of   like voice recognition being more popular with  younger people . industrial designer: So if we need to have a target group  then  I think as far as the m motto of our company is concerned , if we want to have something sleek and  you know , good looking  we are better off targeting a younger audience then  you know , people who are comparatively elderly . marketing: Yeah ,  that's the thing is that it didn't say in the survey , you know , whether , you know , these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control , industrial designer: Right . Bu but but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: so if you want to put in something stylish , then  th it'll certainly be more popular with this i ye with the younger people as compared to older people , project manager: project manager: Then again I guess the th where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket industrial designer: Right , and project manager: and the I don't know how often they're buying televisions . marketing: Well , that's when you go to uni , isn't it ? So , you know project manager: Yeah , but you don't have much money , generally . Yeah , project manager: I would've thought it's it's more that twenty five to thirty five , when people are really moving out and they've got their first job and they want their nice toys and user interface: you share a television or something that yeah . industrial designer: But  still , if if you can go back to that slide and  , how popular was it ? project manager: O oh it's on marketing: Oh , I've unplugged it . marketing: Do you want me to project manager: Here , let me industrial designer: That's alright , if you can just look it up on your computer , wh   people between twenty five to thirty five ,  how popular was marketing: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , I kn  I know what you're saying about the fifteen to twenty five year olds , project manager: Yeah . marketing: but  it has been proven that that people of that age group have a higher disposable income because they don't have like  , you know , if you're at university , you're paying your rent , project manager: Yeah , they've got no commitments and marketing: but you don't have a mortgage , you don't have a life insurance policy , industrial designer: Alright . marketing: you don't normally have a car , project manager: usually not a car and all of those things . industrial designer: So you're more likely to b marketing: so that just costs more than a car , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , and if we're if we're talking twenty five Euros as a price , that's not unaffordable , even for young people . marketing: No ,  that's what , that's like fifteen Pounds ? You know , I think project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah this this is not unaffordable , project manager: user interface: but the problem is whether people need it , whether they do have a T_V_ to use its full project manager: Yeah . We didn't have a T_V_ last year , project manager: But do they user interface: Yeah . project manager: But the T_V_s are often kind of someone's old T_V_ that's blah blah user interface: Common , the students yeah , yeah . user interface: yeah , and the remote control might not yeah , industrial designer:  user interface: it might not even function with the old T_V_ . marketing: industrial designer: Bu but even even in the case of twenty five to thirty five it's quite popular , right ? project manager: marketing: Yeah , I d well we've we've got quite a d decent T_V_ . user interface: Or w maybe we can just kind of   marketing: I think I think the fact that , you know , ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes , I would pay more for a voice recognition remote control , does say quite a lot really . marketing: You know , so  that and the disposable income and I don't think it's something to ignore , you know . user interface: Yeah , but at the same time I think maybe we can we can just decide to to have both of these groups as our target , project manager: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer:  project manager: Is that gonna have a an implication for the technical specs ? industrial designer: I was having a a general outlook on  m most like sophisticated features , but voice recognition itself I'm not very sure about , because one of the p  things that Cat pointed out was   how do we go about implementing it ?  and  project manager: marketing: You do have it in your mobile phone though , don't you ? Because you have like  every mobile phone now has like call this person and it calls them . With  but with a T_V_ remote it's gonna be quite limited if we're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five , user interface: An industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: So like when you say change , except that's being said quite a lot on T_V_ , project manager:  . marketing: Although I only watch Charmed , so really I wouldn't know industrial designer: project manager: marketing: but like so you'd just say remote five , you know , remote ten , remote one two nine . industrial designer: Okay , so it seems like a feasible thing to implement  for for a limited user interface: Yeah . project manager: so if we go for the the fifteen to thirty five age group and then of course we're going to get th anyone who's older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money , user interface: Yeah but   Yeah , yeah sure , yeah , yeah . user interface: Yeah , w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons , but I think this is not really the right moment yet , because people are just so used to buttons project manager: Yeah , user interface: and  , yeah it's it's kind of safer , so we we need both , industrial designer:  . industrial designer: What  user interface: so the voice recognition would be just an extra , it wouldn't really reduce the size of the remote . industrial designer: What wh  what I was thinking is that there is this  separation between what the channels are on T_V_ and how they are numbered on the remote control . If we can do with away with that , our product can be really popular  in the sense that  a person can say , I want to watch  I_T_V_ one instead of saying that I want to go onto channel number forty five . industrial designer: Yeah , so if  if something like that can be incorporated , marketing: Yeah , that would be another way to do it . industrial designer: some kind of marketing: Yeah , but then the code word would be even more important , because  Sky advertise on every channel , don't they , you know , project manager: Yeah . marketing: so then it would be you'd be watching Charmed , and then the Sky advert would come on and it would change to Sky . marketing: Yeah , yeah , industrial designer: Yeah , that's marketing: and that would be really annoying . user interface: Yeah but m but on the other hand , remote control isn't as close to you you probably might just just  speak into it project manager: Yeah . user interface: and and the T_V_ would be already further away , so it might not pick up the other things coming from there . Do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on a remote control though ? project manager: So that you can yell at it , industrial designer: marketing: Yeah , you know , so you have to have the remote control . marketing: It's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime , you can yell at it and it'll just change it , you can look for it later , yeah . user interface: Yeah , but then the remote control I think   the idea is kind of it's it's not that it's sitting there on on top of the television , because then you could already yell at the television and you wouldn't you you wouldn't need the remote control , so the remote control is still something you keep n near yourself . marketing: Yeah , yeah , I suppose nearer to you but a b like if you have surround sound then industrial designer:  yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control project manager:  . user interface: No , but I I I was just defending the the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us , a and  not to yell at it from the distance . So  wh another thing  that can be used is that  there can be a beeper button on the T_V_ , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: so you can go and press that button and  and the remote control , wherever it is , it'll beep , project manager: project manager: but y you could have something , but i if it was something that you could like stick onto the T_V_ or something , user interface: Oh yeah , yeah . project manager: some like a two p if you bought it in a two part pack , so one part attaches to the T_V_ . marketing: Yeah , 'cause it's it's quite important that you don't lose the the bit to locate the remote control . But if we go away with that that kind of general  specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds , we want it to look simple , but still have the buttons so it's easy to use , but only those key buttons , the major buttons and then one sort of menu one , and then voice recognition included as an option user interface: The major ones , yeah . project manager:  but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning  . project manager: What we have to do now is to go back to our little places , complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation , which y you'll get immediately by email . Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes , and then we've got a lunch break industrial designer: project manager: and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work . project manager:  I'll put the minutes in that project documents folder , but I'll send you an email when I do it , so that you know . industrial designer: So where exactly is this i project manager: It should be on your desktop , so on the industrial designer: Ah , okay . project manager: So I'll put it I'll put them there as soon as I've written them . user interface: Did you find it ? industrial designer: Yeah , yeah in that one , user interface: It's just yeah , yeah . marketing: Oh , so y you want our  PowerPoint presentations in there , hey ? project manager: Yeah , that would be great . user interface: Oh so so we'll just put them i there , project manager: Oh yeah , put them in there . project manager: So , if you put them in there , we'll all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to . project manager:  as to where we're going from here , you're going to look at the components concept . marketing: project manager: You'll be looking you'll be looking at the user interface concept , user interface:  something conceptual , yeah . project manager: on something conceptual and you're watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognition'll fall off the map or something that marketing: project manager:  we'll keep keep our options op  ? industrial designer: Wha what was it again that I was supposed to look into ? Con components , oh . user interface: Sorry , but  the next meeting  are we going to have it  right after lunch or shall we prepare our project manager: No , we have we have after lunch we have thirty minutes to ourselves to prepare , user interface: To prepare , okay , yeah , that's good . project manager: so that's fine , w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary . project manager: Okay , so you can I guess we'll see you for lunch in a sec ? marketing: user interface: Okay , see you ."

        "Query": "What were Barry Hughes' thoughts on the legal framework, infrastructure of out-of-court disposals, targets for performance measures, and the registration of grandparents in relation to the childcare offer?",
        "Summary": "Barry Hughes believed that implementing a clear legal framework would provide clarity for parents and professionals, but there was confusion and ambiguity when it came to prosecution, leading to some cases falling into grey areas. He also suggested that the infrastructure for out-of-court disposals could be developed by the Welsh Government, the police, and crime commissioners. Barry clarified that they did not have specific targets for prosecution, but only pursued cases with reasonable prospects. Similarly, the police no longer had targets, except for certain individuals. Huw Irranca-Davies emphasized the focus on registered licensed providers for the childcare offer, aiming for higher quality and a broader range of services compared to individual childcare. However, it was noted that some grandparents who were registered, licensed, and inspected also cared for their grandchildren and other children in small groups.",
        "Article": "Item 2 this afternoon is our eleventh evidence session on the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. I'm very pleased to welcome Barry Hughes, who is Chief Crown Prosecutor for Wales; Kwame Biney, who is senior policy advisor, CPS; and Iwan Jenkins, who is head of the complex casework unit, Crown Prosecution Service Cymru Wales. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions from Members, and the first ones are from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian. I would like to start just by looking in general at how the law currently stands, and how do you think the law as it currently stands today, and specifically in terms of reasonable punishment\u2014how does that protect children. barry hughes: Sorry, can I just be clear? How does the law as it presently stands protect children? sian gwenllian am: Yes. barry hughes: We have a range of offences created by the criminal law, going back to the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 in the middle of the century before last, which provide for offences of assault against a variety of people, including, in particular, Acts such as the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, which provides for offences that are specific to children. But the more general criminal legislation, such as the Offences Against the Person Act, does provide specifically for adults and children alike not to be subject to physical assault. In respect of children in particular, you'll be aware that we have section 58 of the Children Act 2004, which does make it a defence for a person accused of assaulting a child to argue that it was a case where they were acting only so as to impose reasonable punishment upon the child. sian gwenllian am: Well, a review was undertaken by the Government back in 2007 that stated that retaining the law in its current form\u2014that that would be the best thing to do because there's no evidence that it's not working satisfactorily. You are suggesting perhaps towards the end of your answer that there could be some change that's happened since 2007. barry hughes: I think the law should reflect contemporary society and the law is evolutionary in nature, and should be evolutionary in nature. And just as if we go back 50 years there are types of behaviour that we might all have contemplated back then as being socially acceptable, many of those types of behaviour are not now, and the law has changed to reflect that. We don't need to go back a very long way to find, for example, that there was no such offence as raping one's married wife, and the law has changed to reflect the fact that that is simply not acceptable. And from what I've seen of the research, and I think back to the 2007 review, to which you've just referred, there is evidence within that review already that opinions are changing. And I've seen research more current than that that suggests that young people find it less acceptable to use reasonable punishment in chastising a child than do people of an older generation. Of course, as we move forward in time, the people who are young now are going to be the older adults of the future. We have heard evidence as a committee that this proposed law would provide a much clearer legal framework\u2014that is, to take out this reasonable punishment defence, that then would make things much clearer for parents and professionals. Does the CPS have a view on that? barry hughes: I think it will make things clearer. I'm not sure it will make them much clearer, because if we get into some of the\u2014. And when it comes to prosecuting, it's often the case that things aren't just black and white; there are multiple shades of grey in between. We know that the Children Act did introduce a degree of clarity, in that it removed the defence of reasonable chastisement for offences of causing actual bodily harm, causing grievous bodily harm, causing grievous bodily harm with intent, and various incidents of child cruelty under the Children and Young Persons Act. There were a series of Court of Appeal cases that sought to clarify the law, but that was at a time, at the end of the 1990s, the start of the 2000s, when we had the European convention on human rights and we had a quickly developing body of case law. A decision was clearly made back then in the early 2000s not to include common assault in the same category as actual bodily harm, grievous bodily harm et cetera. As we wind forward some 15 years, I have seen the research that suggests that some people see that the present legislation, and the way in which section 58 applies to reasonable chastisement for common assault of children\u2014some people have interpreted that as saying that smacking is acceptable. I don't think that it is what it says, but there is a degree of confusion around that. And the reason why I say it's not as simple as that is, going back to my words a couple of minutes ago, it's rarely a case of being black and white; there are these degrees of grey. sian gwenllian am: What are the areas of grey that you refer to? Can you give a few examples? barry hughes: If you take an example\u2014so, one of the examples that I've heard discussed has been a child\u2014a young child; let's say a five-year-old child by the side of a road\u2014who darts to go out in the path of moving traffic. Now, technically, taking hold of the child at that point is an assault, because it's an unwanted imposition of physical force. But no-one's going to say that's anything like an assault that should come to the criminal courts. At that point, the parent then seeks to admonish the child, tells them off and smacks the child on the legs. But so much depends upon the circumstances, whether this is something that happens frequently with the child, the size of the child, the parent, the force of the slap, the way in which it's imposed. As we move towards the other end of the spectrum, we might have repeated smacking, shouting, maybe hitting the child over the head as well. There'll be a point at which it crosses the threshold from something that needs to be reported to the police, and the police would take some form of action, and then, as we move through the tiers, it'll reach a stage where the police think this is a case that should be prosecuted and they would bring it to the Crown Prosecution Service for a charging decision. And the absolute other end of the spectrum here is one where we decide it's an offence that we think is so serious that it should be charged and brought before a criminal court. That would be very much towards the serious end of the spectrum of the type of behaviour that I've just described to you. Does that help to illustrate that, at one end, it's relatively white and the other end it's relatively black, but in the middle we have the shades of grey? sian gwenllian am: But that would mean that there could be more prosecutions at the softer end. So, you are probably aware, but forgive me if I just explain quickly anyway, when we approach a file of material evidence submitted by the police we apply the code for Crown prosecutors, which has a two-stage test. The first stage is whether there's sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction, and the second stage is\u2014. If there isn't enough evidence, we don't go on to consider whether it's in the public interest, because we wouldn't put an offence before the courts if we didn't think there was a realistic prospect of conviction. So, to return to the point, if we have an offence where, let's say, there is a light smack at the time, the police apply the same code before they bring a case to us. We don't always agree with the police; generally we do, but we don't always agree. So, if a police officer takes witness statements in relation to that case\u2014the light smacking on the leg\u2014at present it's unlikely that would come to the CPS, because they would look at it and say, 'Reasonable chastisement provides for a defence.' If that defence is removed, then obviously there is a greater possibility that it would be referred to the CPS. I would like to think\u2014and I think this is what will probably happen in practice\u2014that the police would take a view that the evidential test may have been satisfied because the defence had been removed, but it wouldn't be in the public interest to prosecute. It may be that the police decide that it is\u2014it may have been two smacks, three smacks, so it moves towards the end of the spectrum that would suggest that matters are becoming rather more serious. We would then apply independently the same test, and we would probably conclude that the evidential stage was met in that instance because the defence no longer exists, which takes us on to considering the public interest. In the circumstances that I've described, every case is going to be unique on its own facts, but in the circumstances that I've described, if it is just a light smack and it's a one-off and there's no history of this, it would probably be the sort of offence we'd decide it wouldn't be in the public interest to prosecute. sian gwenllian am: But isn't it creating a new grey area in terms of the police now having to decide whether repeated smacking is in the public interest to at least refer it to you to decide about that? Do you know what I'm saying? barry hughes: If this Bill goes through, then it will remove a defence, which will make it likely that the police will give this more consideration for referral to the CPS than beforehand, but it doesn't necessarily mean they will refer it, because it will depend on the facts of each individual case. lynne neagle am: We've got some questions now on the divergence between the law in England and Wales from Dawn Bowden. The Assembly doesn't have any legislative competence to impose duties on the CPS, as you know, in the absence of the Secretary of State's consent. What are the implications for implementing the Bill in Wales for that? barry hughes: Can I give you two examples? One of the implications is this\u2014and it's fairly obvious but it's still worth stressing\u2014that the removal of the defence would mean that there would be more cases that would pass the evidential stage in Wales than there would be in England, because the defence would still apply there. That, therefore, raises issues in particular in terms of awareness of criminal offending for people from England who travel to Wales, because it's fairly evident that there would be a defence available in England that is not available in Wales. One of the examples that we talked about was if you consider a family on its way from England into Wales, travelling to Barry Island for a holiday, and troublesome children in the back of the car, harsh words and a small smack on the leg delivered while they're on the M4 going past Bristol would be subject to a defence. By the time we come over to this side of the water, there would be no such defence for the same journey, for the same act. The second example that I'll give you is that we already have within the United Kingdom a certain degree of divergence of laws, and the example I'll give to you is this: drink driving. In England and Wales, the limit for having micrograms of alcohol in your breath is 35 \u00b5g in 100 ml of breath. As you drive into Scotland, you're probably okay to drive if you've got 34 \u00b5g; by the time you get into Scotland, you won't be. And the consequences for you are significant, because of course it's an offence in Scotland, and not an offence in England, but the punishment, namely disqualification, applies everywhere in the United Kingdom. So, we already have a degree of divergence of law, and the CPS recognises this. In our code, we have a specific provision that takes account of the potential divergence of Welsh law. So, would you see the necessity for a memorandum of understanding, for instance, or it being useful in these circumstances, or are you quite satisfied that the current guidance code would cover that? barry hughes: Well, it's yet to move from a Bill into an Act, so we'd need to make sure that happened. We know there would be a period of time, perhaps as much as two years, or maybe a little more, while that takes place. In terms of how we'd approach it within the Crown Prosecution Service in Cymru-Wales, my approach would be along the lines of working with Kwame and his colleagues to make sure that the guidance that we issue nationally suits both England and Wales. And when it comes to the practical application of the legislation in Wales, we would almost certainly work on the basis that the number of offences\u2014and we might want to get into the number of potential offences, but my take on it is the number of offences is likely to be very small and we would probably have two or three specialists trained in this so that any case that comes through goes to people who've got a close network and can talk with each other\u2014 dawn bowden am: And that would be primarily around the public interest issue. So you're obviously a key stakeholder in terms of this legislation and you're clearly very au fait with it and all its implications. What's actually been your involvement with the Government as they've been developing this legislation? barry hughes: My own personal involvement? dawn bowden am: Or the service's. I met with a Minister and a Deputy Minister\u2014I met with Huw Irranca-Davies a little while ago, and I met with Julie Morgan a few months ago\u2014to discuss the overall implications, and then officials on both sides have been engaging with each other. It hasn't been a very close-knit involvement, but we have had enough involvement so that we've felt we've been able to offer views on how we would deal with the legislation. I don't feel that it's been too much, nor do I feel we've been left on the side at all. Now, we've just talked about the divergence of criminal law, and this is probably the first time that there's been an obvious divergence between English and Welsh law, and so we were then talking about the guidance, weren't we, and whether that needs amending to reflect it. But I think you were saying that you felt, within the existing guidance, it could be dealt with, so you don't see a need to update or amend the guidance. barry hughes: I think we would need to update the guidance, and it goes back to the application of the evidential stage, before the public interest stage. On the evidential stage, I doubt that we'll need to do much, other than to make people aware that the defence is not available in Wales in the same way that it is in England, and we might have some light-touch guidance around that. When it comes to the public interest stage, that's a little more specialist and I think we would need to develop more with respect to that. dawn bowden am: And are you satisfied that your staff in Wales\u2014well, and in England, actually, across the border\u2014will be sufficiently aware of the divergence in this area of law? barry hughes: Not as of the present day. [Laughter.] dawn bowden am: But you would expect that to be something you would\u2014 barry hughes: Yes, I have no doubt. To an extent, actually, I think I would say that staff in Wales are aware of this already, because in my role as chief Crown prosecutor, I publish a monthly blog and we talk about the things we're doing, so staff are aware. I've discussed with staff and they've seen my blog and we've put it on our website: there have been engagements with the Welsh Government that this is a piece of work in which we're interested and that is under way. I think most staff would probably be aware that we are involved in this and that it is something that, at present, may well happen. And does that mean that there would also be a similar need for the CPS in England to be aware of the changes? barry hughes: They would need to be aware, but not to the same extent. So, in my office in Cardiff, for example, because we work digitally, I have about 30 to 35 prosecutors who work for the CPS in London, and they work exclusively on London cases. But there are times when some of those prosecutors will prosecute at courts in Wales, and then there may be an interchange; they'll come to work for us on secondment, or they'll come to work for us permanently. We'd need to make sure that those people were brought up to speed on the fact that there are some aspects of Welsh law that diverge from English law. My final question, Chair, is just whether you think there are any other significant cross-border issues that arise from this potential legislation. It boils down to the fact that there's a defence in England for assaults upon children that isn't available in Wales if this Bill goes through, and then it's dealing with the consequences of that. Oh no, that's right\u2014obviously, this Act is on a particular trajectory at the moment, and it's due to be introduced before the end of this Assembly. Do you think it would be better for us as scrutinisers\u00a0of this Act if we could see the draft changes to CPS guidance on the public interest test before we make our final decision? barry hughes: I honestly don't think that would necessarily be helpful. What we would envisage is that we would simply want to take the present public interest factors, which are set out, in my view, very clearly in the code for Crown prosecutors, and we would provide a degree of detail around those that relates more specifically to the issues that we're discussing here. And we'd need to work that up as we go along, and I think you'd run a risk of putting the cart before the horse, if I may put it like that. suzy davies am: It's just that, personally, I think the public interest test is critical in all this, and it would really help us to understand what it could look like before we commit to a particular course of action in supporting or not supporting the Bill, that was all. sian gwenllian am: My point is about the criminal law in Wales and England diverging in this particular instance, and we've been told that this is probably the first time it's happened. Can you think of any other examples where that divergence has happened and does it actually set some kind of precedent in motion? barry hughes: There are other offences in Wales that don't exist in England, but they don't crop up very often. So, to give you examples, there is an offence of putting an electronic collar on your pet\u2014let's not stretch that into children. But putting an electronic collar on your pet that administers a shock is an offence in Wales; it's not an offence in England. There are also offences around the picking of cockles in west Wales, which is not an offence\u2014. So, you can see there are some, but I would argue that the fact that you drive across the border into Scotland and commit an offence that you won't commit in England is possibly more significant for the general public. Of course, the topic we're discussing here is of real relevance for the general public, and you have heard evidence, I know, already, that comes from people who are quite strongly in favour and people quite strongly against it. One of the ways in which I've approached this is looking at it from the perspective of what the law is there for, which is to set out, in essence, what is acceptable, what is not acceptable. It doesn't necessarily mean we need to use the law for that, but it signifies how society views a certain behaviour. I like to look at it from the perspective of the person who is being affected by this, namely the child, and the change in the law here would afford children a degree of protection that they don't presently have, but which they do have when they attain the age of 16.FootnoteLink So, I looked at this\u2014. I've had considerable dealings over the years with offences against residents in care homes, and you'll have seen Winterbourne View, you'll have seen recently up in Durham, where we have adults who need to be looked after because of issues with their mental capacity, and sometimes, the carers become frustrated with them and they admonish them. In much the same way as children are vulnerable and are looked after and can be sometimes quite annoying\u2014but there is a level of protection for an adult striking a child lightly under the present law that is not available to the same adult for striking that child when they turn 16. sian gwenllian am: Do you think that what we're doing in Wales will be emulated in England at some point? barry hughes: Well, it's certainly going through in parallel in Scotland, and there are a great many other countries around the world that already have this, including a large number of European countries. Who knows? Trying to get any legislation through Westminster at the moment\u2014who knows? Not tomorrow, I'd say. Can I just begin by asking you to help the committee out here in understanding how the burden of proof is going to work if this defence is removed? Because the issue of whether something is punishment or not is going to disappear, providing that it's clear that contact with a child has happened. Is that going to work on the presumption that that's an unlawful contact? Is that something the prosecution will still have to prove, or will it be for an accused parent to say, to use your example, 'I was just dragging them out of the traffic or stopping them putting their hands in the fire'? barry hughes: I understand your point. So, if we remove the defence of reasonable chastisement, in a sense that alters some things but it doesn't alter the basic responsibility of the prosecution, which is to establish its case beyond a reasonable doubt. And if the defence raise an argument and say, 'Well, look, that was a lawful act; I was only doing what I thought was reasonable in the circumstances', it's for the Crown to disprove that. barry hughes: And we've got to disprove that to the criminal standard, which is beyond a reasonable doubt. I can see the potential for individuals who feel strongly about this to look to contest the matter, to not admit any wrongdoing at all and to take the matter to trial, and it would be our responsibility to disprove that. Obviously, when we're talking about CPS guidelines and all the rest, we've already come some distance down the process, haven't we? Have you got any views on what might be done to prevent cases even coming as far as arrest? Because one of the things that we have to consider is that once you're arrested, that is recorded somewhere and will appear in things like DBS checks in the future, even if it goes no further. Do you have any views on how intervention might work better earlier on, even at the point of the knock at the door? barry hughes: From the perspective of the CPS, I'm not sure I can help you there. Unlike in many other jurisdictions, we have no power whatsoever to direct the police, so if the police decide not to investigate\u2014. I routinely get letters from members of the public outraged that the police have decided not to investigate their particular neighbour dispute or something, and they want us to do something about it and we can't. suzy davies am: Thank you for that, because I thought that was important to get on the record as well. We're looking at a period of a couple of years after this Act passes\u2014if it does\u2014for implementation. Is there anything at the moment that you think perhaps you still need to do as an organisation towards being in a position to practically implement this law? barry hughes: I think we need to maintain the type of dialogue that we've built up with the Welsh Government and colleagues there. We have other members of my staff who are involved in the other work streams that feed through to that, and I believe that that involvement will ensure that we are sufficiently interconnected; that we can liaise, in turn, with Kwame and his colleagues in the headquarters to respond to things as they develop. So, I think we've got a network of contacts built up here that is adequate for the purpose\u2014at least, 'adequate' might sound a little\u2014 suzy davies am: Sufficient. suzy davies am: So, you're confident, by 2022, then, that you'll have changes to the CPS guidelines that are good to go, if you like. Bear with me a second\u2014thank you very much\u2014in your written evidence, you did welcome the indication from the Welsh Government that this reasonable period after Royal Assent would be necessary. Apart from the CPS guideline changes, which you'll be working through, is there anything else you think you might be needing to do apart from just keeping in touch? I'm just thinking: are there any practical and possibly financial implications for your workforce in this? barry hughes: If this legislation goes through, there will be minor financial consequences for us and I don't see any significant financial consequences in the period between now and the Bill becoming law other than the time of ourselves in discussing this today. And what about afterwards, then? Because one of the pieces of thinking behind this Act is to collect data to see whether this change in the law actually works. Do you want to talk us through a little bit about how that might affect you? I don't know who to ask on this. Well, I think that we are going to need to maintain a clear record of any cases that are referred to the CPS from the police and that will\u2014. Normally, we do this through our case management system, which is England-and-Wales wide, and you'd put a flag on. So, for example, domestic abuse, there's a flag for that, and assault on a child, there's a flag for that. Trying to get that through on a system that covers all of England and Wales\u2014it's quite expensive, unbelievably; it wouldn't happen. My take on it: I've seen and spoken with Matt Jukes about this, from South Wales Police; I have seen the justice impact assessment; I've seen the research that's been fed through from New Zealand; and I've seen our own response to a freedom of information request and the papers that the CPS put into the review that you mentioned earlier in 2007. I would be very surprised if we were to prosecute anything other than low single figures a year, if that much. We may have more referrals from the police, but I doubt it would be double the figure we prosecute, even. There are out-of-court disposals and there are all sorts of diversions that you will have discussed, and I know you've discussed, with the police and the police and crime commissioner. So, the numbers will be very small, which means we would be able to keep a clear track on those and, obviously, we would wish to keep the situation under review, and we'd reach a period of time after whatever\u201412, 18 months, maybe 24 months\u2014where we'd look back to see how we are doing. And I'd like to think that we will be doing that in consultation with interested parties and stakeholders. So, for offences such as racially aggravated offending, whether it's criminal damage or offence against the person, we will bring together interested parties, by which  people from outside the CPS, quite often third sector agencies that represent vulnerable groups. That, in turn, helps us shape and improve the way that we prosecute these cases and I can foresee that, after this legislation came in, we might get 18 months, two years down the road, and I can see us sitting in a room with some of the cases we've prosecuted, maybe cases we've decided not to prosecute, with the police and interested parties from both sides, to have a discussion about how we're doing with it all. suzy davies am: That's really helpful to know because, of course, one of the difficulties of dealing with the culture change, which is what the Minister's effectively after here, is that we are still talking about it in the context of criminal legislation. And what I'm hearing from you is that the chances of somebody who's currently protected by the defence and is not part of a bigger case where there's serial smacking or other difficulties in a family, for example\u2014the chances of them getting to you in the first place are pretty low, and then the chances of them passing even the current public interest tests are pretty low. In which case, my question is: why are we bothering with this law rather than concentrating on a new piece of law, possibly through the civil system, which would achieve the culture change better? Maybe that's not a question you feel that you can answer, but you can see why I'm asking the question. In other words, there is a greater degree of protection for children, and I think the value that would derive from this legislation is the message that it sends out. I go back to what I was saying to you right at the start, about the evolution of the law, and the way we've seen many other countries around the world adopt a very similar approach to that being proposed by the Welsh Government is, in my view, an evolution of the law. So, yes, there may not be many more prosecutions, but there won't be fewer than there are presently, because there's a greater degree of protection for children. lynne neagle am: Before we move on, can I just ask\u2014? The Children Act 2004 applies to a child up to the age of 18\u2014 barry hughes: Sixteen. barry hughes: I'm reasonably confident that it's 16.FootnoteLink lynne neagle am: Okay. Is there anything else you'd like to put on record about the factors that the CPS would be taking into consideration when applying the public interest test in respect of this Bill? barry hughes: Can I give you an example, which might illustrate the way in which things could be different? This is one, which\u2014I give credit to Iwan for this, because he thought of it. If we take an adult with a small child\u2014say, a four-year-old\u2014in a supermarket, and the child is pulling cans off the shelves, it's quite annoying, and they keep doing it and keep doing it. The parent remonstrates, and the parent ends up finding that verbal admonishment is inadequate, and smacks the child lightly on the legs, which does the trick and the child stops. Presently, if someone in that supermarket were to report that to the police, I think the police would probably conclude that that is covered by the defence of reasonable chastisement. In other words, the evidential stage wouldn't be passed; you don't get on to consider the public interest. But if we have that same parent in there the following week, and you have the same happen again, presently, the defence would apply. If that defence didn't apply at all, and we had a sequence of three offences, the public interest test would kick in, if I may put it like that, pretty quickly, because it would be repeated behaviour. So, that would be the distinction between how things are now and how they would be in the future, because the defence would not be available, so the public interest test would then come to the fore that much more quickly. So, when we apply the public interest test, the essence of it is about proportionality, and trying to come up with an approach that is proportionate to the offending. We look at the age of the offender, the age of the victim, we look at the circumstances, we look at the impact upon the victim, we look at the impact that's likely in relation to the suspect, and there is, within the code, a long list of matters that we take into account. If someone's got previous convictions for doing something wrong, it's more likely they're going to be prosecuted the next time. Mostly, it's reasonably obvious; the more serious an offence, the more likely you are to be prosecuted. vikki howells am: Thank you, that's really useful, and\u2014 lynne neagle am: Just before you move on, can I ask you a question? This morning the committee was meeting with groups of parents who are opposed to the Bill and groups of parents who are for the Bill, and one of the parents this morning was querying where the interests of the child would come into the public interest test. Can you just clarify for the record how the best interests of the child would be taken into account in considering whether to go forward with a prosecution? barry hughes: Normally, if there were an assault by someone else upon a child, outside the family, we would tend to take views from the parents of that child. In circumstances where both parents, arguably, are the suspects, we probably wouldn't be asking them. We would find another way, and we would talk with the police to ensure that we are informed about how the child feels about what has happened. I can foresee real difficulties in circumstances where we have parents who are separating where the children are being used, effectively, in divorce proceedings, for example, where we might have one parent saying there was a really bad impact upon the child and the other parent saying there wasn't. We'd want to find a way to cut through that to work out really from the police how does the child feel about that. So, we would tailor it to the circumstances of the particular incident to assess how the child feels about it. It's not determinative, nor is it determinative in cases where we prosecute for adult defendants inflicting some form of assault upon adult victims. In the same session this morning I thought this was an interesting question raised by a parent, on the rights of the child side of things, where if a parent offers a child two forms of punishment because that child has done something that they know they shouldn't have, and they're given the option of, 'You can have a quick smack and a cwtch, or you're going to your bedroom for quarter of an hour', and the child is allowed to choose and the child chooses the smack, what happens then? I'm not offering any views on the fact that this choice has been given, but it was put to us today about how would that fall in the law once it were changed. There is a body of law that\u2014 suzy davies am: A child can't consent to assault. barry hughes: Yes, you can't consent to a serious assault, apart from in certain\u2014. So, for example, tattooing is a serious assault on one level, but you can consent to a tattoo. I can think of one case where a man branded his initials on a woman's buttocks, but she consented to it and the Court of Appeal held that they could consent to that. I can also think of a series of cases, which I won't get into here, that involve sadomasochistic behaviour between adults, some of which was really serious, and involved people willingly applying themselves to things that no sane person would do. And the Court of Appeal in that case, a case called Brown, said, 'No, that's going too far\u2014you can't consent to that.' Then, you may have seen there was a case from the midlands recently where a gentleman operating a tattoo parlour was also involved in body surgery\u2014splitting people's tongues. So, there is again\u2014I referred before to the spectrum of offending, and there is a clear spectrum of offending that you can realistically consent to and then you get to offending you can't consent to. When it comes to much lesser assaults, the law is more unclear as to what you can consent to. I've got one further series of questions around out-of-court disposals, which you've already mentioned briefly. In your written evidence, you say there's ongoing work exploring diversion rather than prosecution in respect of this Bill. Firstly, could you tell us a bit more about the work that is being done to explore this as an option? barry hughes: We've been working with the National Police Chiefs' Council. She is responsible for developing the police approach to out-of-court disposals and simplifying the range of out-of-court disposals. There is quite a range, and life would be simpler and clearer to have fewer types of disposal with more clarity about what each one of them involved. I must say, this is primarily a matter for the police, because there are a great many offences or reports of crime that do not reach the CPS because they are dealt with by way of an out-of-court disposal. There's a document called the director's guidance on charging, which is issued by the director of public prosecutions, which sets out offences the police may charge and offences the CPS may charge. Offences that the police refer to us for a charging decision will generally be offences where they feel that there should be a prosecution rather than an out-of-court disposal. There may be cases where it's genuinely very difficult to assess what's the best approach, in which case we will have a conversation with them, a meaningful conversation, about what's the best way to approach that particular case. There will also be cases, and we see these not that rarely, where the police will bring a case to us for a prosecution on the basis that satisfies the evidential stage and satisfies the public interest stage, and we take a different view on the public interest stage. So, we might say\u2014for example, it involves a 15-year-old youth\u2014we\u00a0 think that diversion from the criminal justice system is a better disposal and we decide not to prosecute. We aren't responsible for administering\u00a0the out-of-court disposal or indeed monitoring compliance with that disposal, if, for example, it has conditions attached, such as repayment of the damage caused to a window or a front gate. That's not our responsibility\u2014that will fall to the police\u2014but we can decide that an out-of-court disposal is a more appropriate disposal than a prosecution. One final question on that then: creating a body of out-of-court disposals that are specific to this Bill\u2014how would that actually work in practice do you think, given the fact that the Assembly's legislative competence to make provision on the face of the Bill is limited? barry hughes: The way I might see it is that, clearly, policing's not devolved, the CPS is not devolved\u2014the way I might see this is that, within Wales, you could build an infrastructure that provides for a range of out-of-court disposals. You can't direct the police or the CPS to point people towards that, but, if you build a good infrastructure, it's more likely that people will be pointed in that direction. vikki howells am: And who would build that infrastructure, in your opinion? barry hughes: Somewhere within Wales\u2014Welsh Government, local authorities, the police working in partnership. If I could just ask about awareness raising, then: you mentioned the Bill in Scotland, but that Bill includes a duty on the Government to raise awareness of the change. Do you think that's right or should this committee be saying that there should be a similar duty imposed in Wales? barry hughes: I'm not sure it's for me to say whether there should be a duty or not. I can, however, say that I think the greater the level of awareness, the more likely it is that the Act, if passed, will achieve its intentions. And, in your written evidence, you mentioned the fact that there's no indication of any plans for awareness raising in England and that if a person from England is being prosecuted in Wales as a result of this change, a question could arise about the lack of knowledge about the different provisions that apply in Wales. Can I ask what approach the CPS currently takes in Wales if a law is unintentionally broken by someone who's come from outside the UK, for example? barry hughes: It's straightforward: if someone comes to this country and commits an offence here\u2014by this country, I'd say England or Wales; I'd treat them as one for these purposes\u2014if someone comes from abroad and commits an offence that isn't an offence in their country, but is an offence here, then I'm afraid that ignorance of the law is no defence. So, raising awareness is important, and I saw, and I was pleased to see, that the media publicity surrounding this proposed legislation, which is now going through, reached as far afield as New York and had widespread media coverage across England and Wales, and I think the Government would be well placed here to take advantage of that willingness of the media to explore something, which is potentially divisive, and I think you've probably seen some of that. Anything like that is a good story, and a good story gets out there, which means you're more likely to make people aware of it. sian gwenllian am: Yes, we've discussed some of these already, but, for example, under the new law, or the proposed law, would one unintended consequence be that, if someone living in Wales who can't use the reasonable punishment defence\u2014would their life prospects be different compared to those people in England, who will be able to use that defence? I think you've mentioned that in your written evidence. A simple answer: if somebody in Wales is convicted\u2014so, if it goes towards the end of the spectrum that is serious, which results in a prosecution\u2014. It may be\u2014the sort of circumstance I can see happening here is somebody who takes a principled stand and declines any form of out-of-court disposal and says, 'Prosecute me'. So, let's say it comes to court and let's say they end up being convicted of assaulting their child\u2014in circumstances that would not have happened in England\u2014then they would have a criminal conviction they wouldn't have in England, and that, inevitably, has an impact upon their life prospects. And do you think that that would be an isolated incident? barry hughes: Yes, truly, I believe, an isolated incident. I've said before that I would be very surprised if we even had referrals that reached double figures on these cases. When the CPS was asked to conduct a survey across all of England and Wales\u2014this was the review in 2007\u2014it spanned just over a two-year period, and there were 12 cases that were brought up at that stage. Now, I have to say, I don't think that's entirely reliable, but it is indicative. We had a Freedom of Information Act request at one stage, which threw up something like three cases in a year. So, if you think about that as being all of England and Wales\u2014and we make up about 5 per cent of the volume of criminal prosecutions nationally\u2014you can see why I might say the numbers are likely to be small, for the reasons we've explored about getting past the evidential stage into the public interest. In terms of thinking about another kind of unintended consequence, in terms of managing performance and all of the targets that the police need to reach, are we perhaps going to see some people going through the criminal justice system in an inappropriate way and contrary to the interests of the child, because we need to reach some target in terms of performance measures? barry hughes: I have to say I think that extremely unlikely. Clearly, we prosecute if we think that there's a reasonable prospect, a realistic prospect, of conviction and it's in the public interest, but we have no targets. And I would also say, because the numbers here are likely to be so small, any assertion of looking to meet targets\u2014it's a tiny, tiny fragment of a drop in the ocean. sian gwenllian am: What about\u2014? There is a target for unsolved crimes, or unsolved offences. What if they fall into that category? Is that an unintended consequence? barry hughes: I'm talking about something I don't have great knowledge of here. There was, at one stage, a series of targets for the police that bore down upon cases that secure what was called a sanction detection, which counted for Home Office figures. Some individual constabularies may still have targets, but, as far as I'm aware, we don't have a suite of national measures. And, in my experience, the police are much more sensible these days than they may have been 20 years ago, in terms of trying to get cases charged in order to meet some notional target. We've mentioned this, namely the risk of malicious reporting against parents involved in private family law cases. Is that going to increase if we change the law? barry hughes: There is greater potential for it to increase. I think the numbers, again, will be tiny, and dwarfed by the number of cases where we have to deal with the fallout between a relationship breakdown between partners\u2014whether they be living within the same house or living in different houses. Getting into the subtleties of the father, say, smacking the child in a way that was reasonable chastisement or was not reasonable chastisement is probably part of a much bigger piece here. It's not something that would cause me concern, simply because we already have a well-developed approach to dealing with the way in which we evaluate the evidence from parties who may well have a particular position that they want to reinforce, sometimes through exaggeration of basic facts and sometimes through fabrication. sian gwenllian am: Are there any other unintended consequences that come to your mind if we introduce this law? barry hughes: No, I think we've had a pretty helpful canter through most of the circumstances here that might happen. sian gwenllian am: Finally from me, therefore\u2014another issue, in a way\u2014the European convention on human rights. Would not introducing the new law mean, at some point, that Wales could get itself into difficulty because there is a breach of the human rights convention? And therefore England as well, at some point. How to approach that one? In the 2007 review to which we've referred already, the Government, the then Government, set out its position that it believes that section 58, in the way that it was drafted, is compliant with the European convention. If Wales implements this legislation and it becomes part of the law, then, arguably, Wales would be more in compliance with ECHR than not, and England would be less so. But nonetheless, at present, I haven't seen any demurral from the position that was expressed in 2007, which is that they consider that the position that's been adopted with section 58 is compliant with the legislation. It may well be tested by case law; that's the way it's likely to happen. Some of the changes in this arena were driven by case law\u2014so, that case I referred to, Regina v H, which was heard back in 2001 in the Court of Appeal, was significant in helping shape the direction of travel towards section 58. sian gwenllian am: And that case law not necessarily would have to happen within the UK\u2014that case law could come from other countries within the European Union. barry hughes: It could, but I would be a foolish man if I were to say what impact European jurisprudence might have upon us. [Laughter.] suzy davies am: [Inaudible.]\u2014like common law jurisdictions would be. Suzy's touched on this mildly, but, in written evidence, you say that you do not consider that the costs of prosecuting cases made possible by the Bill will be of great significance to the Crown Prosecution Service, and you're basing that, from your evidence here today, on the low numbers of prosecutions. So, we've been asked by individuals, and we've had consultation responses from individuals, who've argued that there is no point creating legislation if people are not prosecuted for breaching it. What's your answer to that? barry hughes: There is a huge body of legislation out there that outlaws certain offences, and I think probably about\u2014. From memory\u2014please never hold me to this\u2014but, from memory, there are something like 10,000 criminal offences; we probably prosecute 5 per cent of those in any given year. I've been prosecuting for 32 years now; there are some offences that I've never come near and probably never will. But, nonetheless, the fact those offences exist sets out in terms what is acceptable and what is not acceptable. Well, they're not something that we do, but it sets out what's tolerant\u2014what's tolerable, sorry, and what isn't. So, the fact that we might not have many prosecutions is, for me, not a reason not to say that we shouldn't signify that certain behaviour is or is not acceptable. Clearly, we don't wish to criminalise everything\u2014that would be a nonsense\u2014or to attempt to set the boundaries by almost micromanaging what individuals do and don't do. And then the explanatory memorandum says there is a shortage of registered intermediaries who assist child witnesses during police interview and when giving evidence in court. Is this a potential barrier to implementing this proposed law, and are there any other potential barriers you want to raise? barry hughes: No. There was a shortage of registered intermediaries in Wales, and I know that the Ministry of Justice have taken action to deal with that, and we have had a number of people who are now in a position to act as intermediaries. Now, of course, if they were to decide not to do that anymore, we may have a problem, but, in turn, we would be looking to recruit more people into those positions. So, yes, it has the potential to serve as a barrier, but in practice, I don't think it would be a barrier. I think, particularly given the very low numbers we're talking about, we would be able to manage it. Can I thank you for attending, the three of you, and for your answers, which have been fascinating and very clear and most helpful to the committee? You will be sent a transcript following the meeting to check for accuracy. Paper to note 1 is a letter from me to the Business Committee requesting an extension on the deadline for the Bill, which has now been agreed. Paper to note 2 is a letter from myself to the Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services requesting some further information from CAFCASS Cymru on the Bill. Paper to note 3 is a letter from myself to the Minister for Education regarding Diamond reform implementation ahead of our scrutiny session on 4 July. Can I propose in accordance with Standing Order 17.42 that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you."

        "Query": "What were the Project Manager's thoughts on the conceptual design, symbol and colour, special button design for game players, shape, appearance, and buttons of the new remote control during the discussion?",
        "Summary": "The group discussed pricing the remote control at 25 euros, which was considered relatively high compared to existing options. To avoid losing potential consumers, the Project Manager decided to position the product as a universal remote control with unique features to attract more consumers and meet profit expectations. User Interface suggested designing symbols and colors for the remote, but the Project Manager emphasized the need to incorporate their own logo and color scheme. Marketing proposed self-intuitive buttons for game players, with Industrial Designer preferring a game control keypad over separate buttons. The Project Manager agreed, as keypads were common and user-friendly, allowing for easier navigation and joystick functionality. The shape of the remote was debated, with Marketing and User Interface suggesting an iPod square or a more innovative round shape. The Project Manager opted for a round shape with rounded corners to promote innovation. The idea of a multifunctional remote control was met with concerns about size and complexity. To address this, a touch screen remote control was proposed as a feasible solution.",

And , as a sort of team-building moment , I , I'd like us to , try out the whiteboard by expressing our favourite animal and the charac characteristics of that animal . industrial designer: marketing: user interface: project manager: why that , why that should be your favourite animal . project manager: 'Kay , what's my favourite animal ? industrial designer: project manager: Do come up . Oh , project manager: This is a team-building time industrial designer: are we all doing it individually ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: where , industrial designer: Okay , let's stand up and support you project manager: okay cool ,  industrial designer: project manager: My favourite animal , which changes all the time , okay , industrial designer: user interface: project manager: right now it is an elk . user interface: An elk ? marketing: project manager: alright , so user interface: A vicious project manager: And it goes like Yeah it's got like big antlers , user interface: project manager: yeah . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: industrial designer: Do you have elk where you come from ? project manager: Yes . user interface: I'm quite project manager: This is my user interface: marketing: Oh , very shapely . project manager: That's a sketching of my my elk , and it , it is my favourite animal right now , 'cause it is a large beautiful majestic creature , user interface: project manager: that  , that  user interface: project manager: In a way it looks kind of awkward , because it's on spindly legs and it  user interface: project manager: But it can really overcome harsh terrain , and although it's gorgeous it's also very dangerous , because it has  strong antlers , and  it can really combat its enemies , even like it it's a it's an herbivore but , it can really defend itself . industrial designer: project manager: Right , I'm gonna take minutes while , you guys express your favourite animals . like all sorts of animals , but for the moment I'm gonna draw a cat , in memory of my poor cat that died recently . user interface: industrial designer: user interface: industrial designer: Not as artistic as Heather's drawing . project manager: industrial designer: But I like cats because they're so independent , and they always seem to be doing what they want to be doing .  , but that doesn't mean they're completely not sociable , 'cause they enjoy interacting with humans as well , and they seem to enjoy the good things like sunshine and , running around outside as well as being inside , and enjoying their food , and generally just , they just seemed so cool and they just know what they're doing . I think my favourite animal would be a dog , but I'm not really sure how to draw one . I'm tempted to draw a snail 'cause I draw them sometimes and they're really easy to draw . user interface: right it's gonna be a really funny dog , 'cause I'm not sure how to draw a dog . industrial designer: Well there are loads of different types of dogs , so I'm sure it'll represent one kind of dog . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: A s I don't ev Oh , oh well . user interface: How do you draw a dog ? I suppose it has a lon Oh my god .  , I like dogs because , they're so good to humans , like they can be trained to be police dogs and seeing-eye dogs , and they're just such friendly animals . project manager: marketing: user interface: But they're just so friendly and warm and nice animals , project manager: user interface: that don't look like that . I'm going to draw a butterfly , because I saw a butterfly yesterday , that seemed to be like the symbol of Spring arriving . And it was actually the prettiest butterfly I've ever seen out in the wild , and I though that was pretty cool in Scotland . And then it kinda there was a green , I think it was a green ring , and there was like red going out like this . user interface: marketing: Yeah , it kinda was actually , 'cause it was This part of the body was really dull , and then it was the most colourful exotic butterfly ever , and I'm like , wow this is the middle of Scotland in like March . So that's gonna be my favourite animal because after all the snow it seemed to say that like Spring is finally here . project manager: Do you hear the eraser buzzing while you do that ? marketing: Yes I do . marketing: project manager: So , now that we know how to use the whiteboard , industrial designer: Okay . project manager: the next , thing we need to address is our financial department , to meet our our budget ,  or not meet our budget but more , like what kind of , selling range we'll be looking at , wanna make this  selling price of twenty five Euros . And so we have to , come up with a way to , to create a , a  remote control , where  we can like the price to create it will be significantly less .  , one thing we'd have to think about internationally is in the design of , like different kinds of , V_C_R_s .  , industrial designer: project manager: so now that , that is underway ,  industrial designer: project manager: it is discussion time . So this is time for us to bring our initial ideas , any  suggestions that you may have so far , a  your personal experiences with remote controls , and  , areas you see that , could be improved in your experience with them . Does anyone have any initial thoughts ? marketing: I find that in the dark it's often hard to know what button you're pushing . So what's something we could , do to remedy that ? industrial designer: marketing: industrial designer: Okay . project manager: industrial designer: It's always , where is the remote control ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: So maybe if you could have some kind of tracking device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was . user interface: Do yous not find that , like , there's a lot of , buttons on your remote control , and you don't know what half of them do . There's some remote controls where there's kind of a hidden panel , so all those buttons that you don't really use unless you're programming or something . marketing: So you just have like the number buttons , power button , T_V_ video button . Maybe it could be , instead of like a standard rectangular shape , it could be , something more interesting like marketing: project manager: Any ideas will do that you have at this point . Like , I've seen phones like a project manager: Well if it's a trendy original , aspect we're going for . project manager: you're the designers , you c , you can  decide what kind of , direction you wanna go in , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: but at this point in the , in the first meeting it can be any ideas that we just throw out there . I suppose , if we're he heading to have it , like make a huge profit out of this , it needs to be quite a universally accepted thing . Like , a novelty thing might only sell a few things rather than , like , a general kind of more acceptable user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: But we don't wanna go towards boring , 'cause that wouldn't sell either . project manager: U_I_D_ the technical functions design will , will be worked on the next thirty minutes .  , maybe how this can be achieved , and , we need the user requirements from the manag Marketing Expert "

        "Query": "What were the reasons for Marketing's disagreement with the Project Manager and Industrial Design regarding the technical functions, advanced techniques, and touch screen of the new remote control, considering the budget limitations?",
        "Summary": "The Project Manager recognized the importance of targeting customers below the age of forty, as they have specific needs that should be addressed. However, Marketing disagreed and suggested that the project should cater to a larger group of people, rather than just those under forty. The Industrial Design team proposed incorporating advanced techniques, such as a touchscreen, to make the remote control more unique. Despite the advantages of a touchscreen, such as making the remote control smaller and easier to use, Marketing rejected the idea due to budget constraints. In order to balance cost and functionality, the Project Manager suggested giving up voice recognition and keeping the touchscreen. However, Marketing's research showed that interviewees had a strong preference for voice recognition, even when they were not informed about the touchscreen. Therefore, Marketing insisted on keeping voice recognition to cater to popular demand. The Industrial Designer believed that it was impossible to create a universal remote control that could accommodate different TV brands, as each brand has its own remote control. However, Marketing believed that this issue could be solved by developing a universal remote control with a code.",
        "Article": "I've done more PowerPoints in this particular experiment than I've ever done in my life before this experiment industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: So  here we have our detailed design meeting where we will  look at the prototype and  right so  , I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my that my coach was sending to me . Otherwise it's just saying I'm the secretary marketing: project manager: and I'm therefore I'm taking the minutes , s so just to go  just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting , I will open them slowly , no ? Wait for it , wait for it . user interface: project manager: This is , this is very high-powered stuff here , double-clicking , there we go . So  basically the moral of the story from our last minute  last meeting was that  we that we had meetings from  we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer ,  or from Nathan , and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here  and what sort of limitations we're operating with   excuse me what limitations we're operating under , what kind of risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with  voice recognition , I_E_ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape  because you didn't really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice . That would include some mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users .  , and  the   the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at . What's to be said about it ?  , we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting ,  . Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen which you can see project manager: This is going to be the on off button project manager: industrial designer: and we have these buttons to go through the channels  and then two volume buttons down here , d  we decided those were the most important  buttons . And then , for the more advanced  functions there is a slide out panel here  and you can see that there are lots of other things going on . But this actually can slide back in and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away ,  . As far as the  whole visible light thing , we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out , user interface: marketing: Ah . user interface: industrial designer: Of course , if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off . user interface: No it's important to we talked a quite a bit about  you know the the interchangeable  faces and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here marketing:  . user interface: of course that's  interchangeable industrial designer: user interface: and  I think it would be desirable for the  for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued marketing:  'kay . user interface:  and as you can see on the television there  we have the  voice detector device  on the top there .  , what other things do we see here , well ,  if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel , project manager: user interface: so I think that will work well with regards to our market .  and  let's see , well clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available .   do you have anything else to add to that ? industrial designer:  I worried about the materials , it is  the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating so it's very durable  , it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped .  , and of course as you can see and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel . user interface: It's actually important to note that the television ,  you know if there's an earthquake or anything like that , that i it actually is edible inside . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: marketing: industrial designer: Fact , I dunno if you noticed , but I wrote the  the company's name on the telephone screen , project manager: Oh well done yeah , yeah oh ok industrial designer: I thought that was kinda nice . marketing: project manager: industrial designer: This user interface: marketing: Do we need to worry about  rot factors ? project manager: user interface:  it's encased in a new  type of  marketing: Oh okay , there's preservatives involved , project manager: industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: we don't need to worry , industrial designer: We got a bit ahead of ourselves , user interface: It's fine . industrial designer: I know we're not talking about making televisions at this point or anything like that , but user interface:  . user interface: but I think that's I think that sums up the main features of our of the remote , project manager: Brilliant . user interface:  I dunno if you guys have any questions or f whether that  whether we need to worry about any  other marketing areas or anything of that nature . This cost well to put this into  production , we're looking at about what was our goal ? It was twelve fifty Euro  and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine . industrial designer: One thing that we didn't do  obviously we had a choice with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons , but we just went for a classic rubber button and  since we did that marketing:  . industrial designer: we didn't have to use as many microchips which was quite nice and that's what helped keep the cost down . industrial designer: So even though it has a lot of modern technology ,  for example the voice recognition , marketing:  . industrial designer: in a lot of ways it's just a simple remote and  I think if we shopped around for other manufacturers  we might be able to get even cheaper . Did we talk about the voice recognition  option ? industrial designer: And Oh no , we haven't talked about that yet have we ? user interface: So  so  yeah on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition   console project manager: marketing: Okay . user interface: but basically the voice recognition  incorporates  the latest designs that our research team has been able to cufw  come up with . industrial designer: Any questions ? project manager: No , no marketing: Do we have  other , for lack of a better word , skins ? Covers ? project manager: I think that's user interface: marketing: In play now or are those ones gonna be developed later once we see how the couple we have g go or ? industrial designer: do you wanna answer this one marketing: Do we know where we stand on that yet ? industrial designer: or do you want me to answer it ? user interface: Well we didn't quite have enough material  . user interface: Oh I see , marketing: I just didn't know if you guys had any in mind yet . industrial designer: well as you can see this is just a most superficial layer and  it'd be very easy to put another layer of something else like marketing: Okay . marketing: And the whole thing project manager: marketing: Okay user interface: So  there are I marketing: Right user interface: we definitely priced out a spongy even spongier non-natural look  materials marketing: Yeah . We also continued on with the ideas that f following  Apple's colour schemes with the kind of the  light orange and the green . industrial designer: It's not it's not quite a a face plate , it's more like a pseudo-face plate because it's simple enough marketing: Okay . industrial designer: that in the factory it could we could very easily put a different one on it , it locks into place such that , you know , it's pretty permanent but at the same time , if we wanna go the other way it's just a matter of a couple of adjustments and we could go the face plate way marketing: Okay .  , what we need to discuss now is the finance of it ,  I got me you've got you provided a number that actually sounds quite nice . project manager: I'm just gonna clear this out real quickly , but it looks like So we'll just if we can just itemize what's in here , we've got this it's a solar cell thing right ? industrial designer: Right project manager: With a back-up battery ? industrial designer:  we didn't really touch on that but it it's in there , project manager: With the ba okay .  so I guess that would mean we've got a bit of a  It's a s a speaker and a sensor at the same time isn't it ? industrial designer: Yeah , yeah .  and the case , it's more of a single-curved case , I guess would be that be the general industrial designer: Yeah , one big curve I guess you could say . Push button interface  with this other drop-down so maybe we've got two push button interfaces don't we ? industrial designer: Yeah , And  a special I guess it's  we've got a sort of a wood materi a rubbery type material that throughout , industrial designer: Yeah , special . industrial designer: And s I guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well , don't you ? 'Cause it i it is very unconventional , project manager: Yeah , it's it's quite unique . project manager: I like it , yeah it's So it looks like marketing: M come in at sixteen ? project manager: a bit over budget ,  . Huh , doesn't match up does it ? user interface: marketing: project manager: So what we could do perhaps , a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells  or take out the back-up battery .  industrial designer: How do you feel about that ? user interface:  I think that  if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features , being environmental and without the batteries and what not , although it does still have a battery so I'm not sure that you know what the sell is on that . industrial designer:  we could take we could take the battery out of it you see and it'd probably work ninety nine per cent of the time but you're gonna have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time when people are calling and saying oh look my remote isn't working user interface: project manager: industrial designer: it's hard to scrap the whole cell battery idea 'cause that's so integral to the theme that we have . What's difficult , we have all these things integral to the  to the design of it that we just can't back out of now , marketing: Nah . project manager: it would have to be seems like we'd have to go back to square one in a way .  if we were gonna try to undo one bit we'd probably have to undo most of it ,  user interface: industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Although we don't wanna get rid of the whole environmental  obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we're marketing this as like a natural , new thing , but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget if I've done my math correctly . user interface:  you might be able to sway me on the idea that we our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing marketing:  user interface:  that's what sets us apart marketing: Which , it's user interface: right ? marketing: yeah that's what setting us into this young market ,  that's where we started from , so I don't know , and  you know perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game but it looks like at this point that may be out of our league . user interface: And the reality is you know , for me from an ideological stand point , I'd like to stick with the  the solar cell , but I h kind of have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here marketing: Right . user interface: and  you know I think I think that I think that we need to come to a compromise here project manager: It's either or . industrial designer: It's the only way we're gonna get below our  goal isn't it ? Of twelve fifty . project manager: 'Cause we can't remove the push buttons 'cause they're industrial designer: Yeah , . marketing: It kind of project manager:  and we can't get rid of the   removing the user interface: Savings . project manager: changing the case wouldn't be so much of a - , nor would changing the case materials .  , so I guess now we just go to the project evaluation which I will allow Sarah to take over . project manager: That'd be great industrial designer: user interface: marketing: I didn't even do that one on purpose either , user interface: marketing: damn . Okay , basically I was just evaluating  from what we know of how our product's working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of these are the things we needed to do , these are the things that look like we feel they're important .  so I was looking at basic design things , does it fulfil its functions as a remote ? Is the design what we wanted it to do ? I are technologies up to where we hoped they would be and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for ?  . Basic questions like , you know , does it turn on ? Does it respond to voice recognition ? And overall , in general , it looks like it's coming up to par . marketing: the only thing is with with the pull-out panel , that is , can it take some adjusting because it's a new sort of interface ,  that looked like it was coming up rough , but then , once you get used to it , it does make a lot of sense . It looks like it's going over well , so user interface: And the paging function works well , industrial designer: Six ? user interface: that's good to hear , marketing: we're we're good yeah . It's I think eventually if we do  branch out with this product maybe we do have a higher budget options and if it goes over with this model we can look into  wider range voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and stuff , but for now , what we've got is working in the range we need it for , so it's all good . industrial designer: I am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel marketing: That's everything from me . marketing: Yeah , it is a set-back , but industrial designer: marketing: Okay , do you need the cord back ? project manager:  yeah , user interface: W we might have  we might have lost that granola market again project manager: I was just go on . user interface: that we're project manager: Well they don't own tellys anyway do they ? industrial designer: True .  so I guess we are going to discuss  our project process  marketing: industrial designer: user interface: project manager: and that is gonna go into my report . So I guess this is the point where we go   out of role it looks like and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth and how that all worked , I guess ,  . industrial designer: Right so it's just kind of a open mic kind of thing or marketing: Okay . marketing: It is now , industrial designer: user interface: marketing: you're in charge there you go . so user interface: project manager: But I trust that she would jump in if I was so okay fair enough . project manager:  right ,  so any thoughts ? industrial designer: Are we considering these points here ? marketing:  . project manager: What do you guys feel about the process ? industrial designer: marketing: you know I think in general , for a day's worth of work we actually were relatively productive , project manager: and the technology has definitely been a help , it's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff . We could now if that'd make up for it user interface: And marketing: but really industrial designer: marketing: and I feel like if you guys had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed but because of room constraints , doesn't really matter . user interface: also had I not been intrigued about the pen , I don't think I woulda used it at all , I didn't write barely anything . marketing: Yeah I think I was taking notes more often than usual industrial designer: Yeah , it's true . project manager: marketing: Yeah , but I didn't get a response industrial designer: What if you get a response two or three months from now ? user interface: marketing: so project manager: marketing: we'll see . industrial designer: marketing: Well user interface: industrial designer: marketing: what kind of coaching is that really ? What if I really needed something . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: I so n I think there was a lot of room for creativity , I don't we could do whatever basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us ,  . And even then we did get a decent product turned out although it's not everything we wanted it to be . industrial designer: user interface: project manager: That's the brilliance of they had a p they had a peeler in here . industrial designer: user interface: project manager: marketing: And highly resourceful team mates might I add industrial designer: project manager: industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: And to prove that we weren't wasteful we didn't waste a single bit of Play-Doh , we used every bit . industrial designer: Yeah , user interface: industrial designer: I guess user interface: industrial designer: My one my one criticism is that we didn't have enough colours to work with , project manager: user interface: marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: I think it was pretty clever 'cause we were never able to get too far off track because the information came in at the right time and kind of filled in the gaps enough . industrial designer: At the same time you had enough room to kind of just make things up , project manager: marketing: Do your own . marketing: Though I did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day . marketing:  maybe it's just me but I didn't actually get any information for the last presentation at all . marketing: Nothing , I didn't even get an email , user interface: marketing: like industrial designer: marketing: that was it . So , yeah , I feel like that was slightly lacking but then you know , fill in the blanks on your own , level of creativity upped . user interface: Well I think that was I think that was an issue I kept finding with regard to marketing: Whatever . user interface: well no but also yeah when I was reporting about what each of us was doing I was often confused as to what you were doing industrial designer:  . industrial designer: You know user interface:  and then I also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was marketing:  . user interface: but and then in the end I think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more , industrial designer: Yeah . I think the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the the PowerPoint slides already put together for you user interface: which was fine . industrial designer: 'cause if we didn't have that there's no way we could have got all that done in time . project manager: She said I I I she actually made a comment off boy you're getting into this and I really I think it's true I did get I I felt like I got way too into it . That's kind of a good thing though , project manager: I felt like I slipped into it a lot . user interface: An so is that the first time you've taken on that kind of role ? project manager: The first time I've ever done anything like yeah project project management . project manager: it's one thing to do , you know set up a party with your friends , user interface: project manager: you know ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: But you guys felt that you could keep the , yeah , suspension of disbelief kind of like like the role and the okay ? marketing: Yeah . user interface: marketing: and I knew we were all lying through our teeth , industrial designer: user interface: I had to admit , as soon as w we started  as soon as we got the Play-Doh , th you know the whole concept of really trying to stick with reality went out the window . industrial designer: project manager: Maybe in in Legos you know ? Be fun with Legos too , user interface: Possibly . project manager: like make a remote control or spaceship , we used to have spaceship Legos did you guys ever used to build spaceships with Legos user interface: Oh yeah , marketing: Yeah . project manager:  you guys felt like there was enough teamwork in all ? industrial designer: Yeah ? marketing: I think so . user interface: project manager: No I , no I dunno , I d I I dunno , industrial designer: You don't . project manager: I don't I I was just I marketing: Though we didn't actually  other than minor discussion at meetings there wasn't except for the actual building , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: It's true huh ? marketing: but I feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming , use the board well and this would have been six months' worth of work , not like three hours' worth of meetings . user interface: I think had the issue been more serious we probably woulda brainstormed more during our meetings as a team . Course I'm I'm conscious of the idea of the Project Manager asking if you guys feel like there's a team you know it's like , kind of like , like  . industrial designer: project manager: It d marketing: Yeah that is kind of project manager: But yeah . It's kind of fascinating wasn't it ?  the whole process of industrial designer: Wonder why is there anything about the way that we got so much inform what was it that kept us from going to the the board ? project manager: I don't know . I I don't know if there was a ri I th marketing: Mine was the mics . I didn't feel like getting up and down and dealing with all these wires , industrial designer: Yeah , that's it marketing: I was afraid I was gonna break something actually . industrial designer: 'cause the mics are loose and each time you get up it's s a possibility of tripping over something or getting tangled or . True , but it didn't even occur to me as an option , project manager: Nor I . marketing:  I don't know that I would have but I know that I consciously didn't . user interface:  it's just like the paper I don't know what I really needed the paper for . project manager: I wanna see wh wh what my my handwriting looks like digitized marketing: I know . industrial designer: Yeah , project manager: just to see what it looks like in P_D_F_ format or something . Usually I would do a lot more doodling too but I didn't because user interface: marketing: I know , I felt like I needed to be professional so I didn't like draw all over my paper and stuff . project manager: industrial designer: marketing: Okay , well not entirely , but still , I doodled less than I usually do . industrial designer: user interface: project manager: T I I'm curious about what the de-briefing is gonna be like . user interface: So is this all we need to get through ? project manager: I dunno , I'm not sure what the new ideas found i is about . user interface: Is it marketing: It did it just say in an email that we need to discuss that ? project manager: Well , that's the thing I got i in the email I got this PowerPoint file but this slide was just there , marketing: That slide was like that ? project manager: user interface: Any new ideas with regard to remote control concepts ? project manager: W I kinda like th industrial designer: No , none . user interface: project manager: Yeah you can't industrial designer: I think they're fine actually . marketing: I am thinking outside the little square box though , with literally in like form project manager: Yeah . project manager: Does kinda make you wonder , how much can you do with a remote control ? It's like inventing a new car . Yeah yeah , you can marketing: It's still gotta be technically car shaped or it won't fit on the road , project manager: Yeah . user interface: What is that ? Our limited ability to think outside the box ? project manager: So this was other costs . I think this is marketing: Oh , how long was our meeting supposed to be ? project manager: forty ish marketing: How much time do we have left ? project manager: I I I  we should go on a bit yeah about the project eval ,  . project manager: you know what is marketing: Yeah , at the beginning it started out and I felt actually like under pressure like the first couple were taking a lot of work project manager: Yep . marketing: and I was like had like all this brainstorming I was doing industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: and then suddenly I was like well it's just another two minute presentation that you guys don't really care about anyway user interface: Why ? project manager: Hey . marketing: like we all sort of knew where we were headed with it so it didn't feel like it mattered anymore . industrial designer: Definitely when when I first filled out the questionnaire I was marking it probably higher in terms of how much I had to how much I stressed over it user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and then by the time I got to the last one I was like , you know , not very much . user interface: Think it was also realisation of you basically just copy and paste what's given to you into your presentation industrial designer: Yeah . I di user interface: Oh I added like five slides too , marketing: See project manager: Oh . industrial designer: I just got blank ones project manager: What ? Really ? industrial designer: and marketing: My slides were all blank , they'd have a title maybe user interface: Yeah , mine too . project manager: yeah they didn't come like this ? Like with this was what it looks like . This is what that looked like , marketing: Like with those words already on it ? project manager: literally , just like that . user interface: I added many slides every time marketing: Hey industrial designer: marketing: with the whole new background being innovative , yeah that was class . project manager: industrial designer: I think it would fail , I think marketing: I can't just leave it there . project manager: user interface: industrial designer: it'd be a huge disaster , especially if it looks like that . marketing: I think it would take extensive marketing , okay , an apple with a red button on top , even I am sceptical . user interface: Actually that looked a lot more like a tongue from previous to  fr some other design  modifications . user interface: I hope you appreciate the  incorporation of some tin foil from a  random Kit-Kat bar project manager: marketing: I I noticed that . industrial designer: Yeah , it's  user interface: So again I reiterate my question of how different we are comp compared to the other groups , especially between culture groups and what not . You know from the the the basics to the conce industrial designer: I wanna see a marketing: I Yeah . project manager: although the whole concepts thing , the whole concepts phase , I don't think I really understood like the concept . project manager: yeah  i it's not like I have a concept of a mug's material , it's just it is what it is . project manager: maybe i rather than concepts i it should be th thought of we sh I I thought of I thought of rather than in terms of concepts I thought of it in terms of proposed idea . industrial designer: So we have more slides or ? marketing: project manager: No just this closing one . No we've established that the costs weren't really within budget , but we could s you know do it marketing: We got it to be . project manager: We did the project evaluation based on  Sarah's evaluation of on off switches marketing: Like cutting corners . Kind of , project manager: and marketing: though it was really technically an evaluation of the product , not the project in general . marketing: Which I'm not sure is the same thing , at the time that just i made more sense , but I could see if they were really asking about us . project manager: I'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end so I'll put all that into the final report as well , or as much as seems like maybe not like the articles and stuff , like because and if and so forth , but I'll put most of it in the reports . marketing: I've done transcription before and it's really ridiculous how many words people say like just in the middle of their sentences like that project manager: Oh yeah . project manager: There's a whole branch of psychology that looks into that , psycholinguistics . user interface: What the uhs and the marketing: There's a guy studying it here , yeah , he's studying ums and ahs or something . industrial designer: Filler words or ? project manager: Yep , they're called  disfluencies . industrial designer: I find myself hitting the send and receive button on the email a lot , just out of boredom , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: project manager: Well to be fair we're we're hooked we're all hooked on the internet , so  I do the marketing: Yeah , we are addicts . user interface: Well just around that eight or or nine people that are project manager: I know , imagine we went the first ten y fifteen years of our lives without the internet . It's only in the last ten that we're like where's the internet ? marketing: Yeah . project manager: you know , it just in the past five we've gone from twenty eight eight modems to broadband all the time . project manager: No we have but I not in the sense that it's so un you know  ubiquitous marketing: I yeah . marketing: But it's not regular  my grandparents had it in the eighties and I got it in ninety four , but still . user interface: In the eighties ? marketing: My  grammy does computer science back in the States and so they had  an E_D_U_ and gov network . marketing: There's basically the fundamental structures , but it wasn't  household to household yet user interface: Right . marketing: because it hadn't been user interface: Yeah , it was to the like seven universities or something . project manager: 'Kay I guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part . marketing: industrial designer: project manager: Where do you find that ? marketing: I have no idea . user interface: industrial designer: Is that the only song you have ? user interface: There is another one . project manager: Is this one of those media player ? industrial designer: marketing: user interface: Huh ? project manager: W oh . project manager: That's one that seems to be shipping with it  shipped with for a while , maybe this is the new version . marketing: So is that a close ? project manager: Yeah , I guess we'll call that a a doner "

        "Query": "What was the final decision regarding the chip, feasibility of letting the user program the keys, and fulfilling user requirements?",
        "Summary": "The group made a decision to use a regular-style chip without an LCD display for the controller, opting for simple push buttons with the exception of a more advanced button for the interior lighting system. Concerns were raised by the industrial designer regarding the usability of the function, as it went against the product requirements. The user interface designer suggested that the usability would depend on the user's effort, leading to the decision to produce two versions of the controller - one with full user freedom and the other with some constraints. In order to meet the requirements of being fashionable and spongy, the group agreed to use wood and rubber for the controller. The buttons, which would be the part touched by users, would be made of rubber, while the rest of the controller would be made of wood to provide a natural feel.",
        "Article": "So we have forty minutes to discuss and  finalise and close the product and project and to move further , okay , so Okay , let's talk about  maybe first  for the prototype . project manager: So I handle to user interface: I've done a presentation , but it pretty much covers work that we've both done , so if I'm missing anything , Christine can just correct me . user interface: It's not the biggest PowerPoint presentation in the world , but industrial designer: marketing: project manager: So in two or three or industrial designer: user interface: Three . industrial designer: marketing: user interface:  okay , can I have the mouse ? project manager: Yes . Alright , so from when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting , we decided that we wanted an ergonomic shape , the material that we chose was wood , and  the colour would be customisable , 'cause you can stain the wood whatever colour .  , so in terms of function , you have to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off , volume and channel control , menu control , voice recognition control , and we've incorporated the L_C_D_ screen on the flip panel as part of the design , if we figure out it's too expensive , well then you just take it off . marketing: user interface: So if you lift up the panel , you can see the lovely yellow L_C_D_ display . The yellow button you have is the on off button , so it's really big , hard to miss . And then you have the numeric pad in the dark blue at the bottom , and on the right-hand side you have the access to the menu on the T_V_ , and on the left-hand side you have the the the ability to turn off the voice recognition . industrial designer: Yeah the d user interface: Additional feature on the back is that you can have your own customised backing and I suppose you could do the same thing on the flip case on the front . That depends on the  s design of the circuit board inside and  what room is left  user interface: Yeah . project manager: I think the microphone is on on the top ,  on the middle , the under the flip . project manager: So that will be the safe , so p any the chip it's not on the chip because you need to have microphone to industrial designer: No ,  it depends on the design of the circuit board . user interface: But it shouldn't be under the flip either , because you can have the remote control closed , but you still might want to activate it by voice . project manager:  it's it's Yeah , but   my opinion I think it's better under the flip because whenever you want to  the talk , okay , so then you can speak then you can close it . But if you put it on the on the flip , okay , then  technical I don't think it's  feasible , 'cause most of the time you speak then it will be recognised . user interface: But if you've already got the remote control in your hand you need to open the flip to use the voice , why use the voice , why not just use your hand ?  the whole point of the voice is that if the remote control is sitting there and I'm too lazy to reach over and pick it up , I can just use my voice . industrial designer: Maybe I've got my hand in the popcorn bowl and I'm holding my cup of Coca-Cola in the other hand . user interface:  it doesn't have to be on the flip , it can be on the side somewhere . user interface: marketing: No , because y you can easily put a microphone on the side that would have no problem would haven't been not be damaged or anything , and it'd be accessible all the time to voice . S I'm fine , I'm satisfi user interface: And maybe the shape of the buttons , project manager: I'm satisfied . user interface: the little egg shapes aren't the most economical , but industrial designer: We're glad you're satisfied . project manager: Of course it's it's it's looks more heo heavy , but I think when it's completely maybe it's a less weight . But And part of the thing is m a lot of people say that they don't like something that's too light , because they don't feel like they have enough control over it . user interface: So  maybe this is excessively heavy , but I think it needs to have some weight , project manager: Yep . marketing: project manager: So any comments or  marketing: Well , the prototype is is very well within the design and ideas that we've we've talked about on the previous meetings . marketing: Now it goes into this next phase as the financial  marketing  project manager: Yes , that  So I'll come back to the So evaluation criteria , I think  that will be good , so then let's come to the finance  , I have some  calculations which I made  as for  the budget .  it's optional , somewhat optional and Ed wants the chip on print , that's what  we were talking about that . industrial designer: project manager: So then we have sample sensor and sample speaker , then  we have the wood material , then special colour and push button . So it's  actually , our budget was  twelve point five Euro , but  it's coming to nine point nine five Euro , so we are under  below the budget , okay , so still we are saving some money . marketing: Well we haven't come to mine yet , so industrial designer: Oh , okay user interface: industrial designer: . It's gonna cost a long way to c you know , cost a lot of money to market it , is it ? marketing: we're gonna have a bit of difference of opinion , yes . project manager: So maybe it's for some money we can utilise for our  marketing , for the sales , okay , and  marketing: Well , it just depends on if we're gonna add a o on this pr provisionary cost analysis , we do not have a L_C_ display . L_C_ display is gonna be very expensive , user interface: No we do , but it's not filled in . marketing: We don't have the price up there , user interface: Oh , yeah , yeah , project manager: Yeah . marketing: okay , so if we add approximately two to three Euro per remote , now we're up around about twelve , twelve and a half as to what  the company had initially  requested .  industrial designer: So that means we can put the  the L_C_D_ in , yeah . But as far as production  I'm putting up a question because we're talking about profit also , and in mine you'll see  the problem with  our survey , the p the possibility that how many units can be sold , what percentage of the market , etcetera etcetera because that has to be taken in into consideration . project manager: marketing:  this is just production cost , it is not  advertising cost , it's not transportation cost  project manager: Yes , so still  we have twelve point five Euro . marketing: And that will inflate quite a bit the cost of the  the cost of the unit for the company . marketing: So to come up with what the company wants is a fifty million Pound profit , we're gonna have to go a long ways . This we are talking about one unit , okay , so when it go into the quantity , okay , and the cost will come down . industrial designer: Although customisation , because this is being done , you know , the on on-order basis , it might be  the the quantity won't m won't  marketing: Slightly . industrial designer: the circuit board will b you're right , would be in producing quantity , but the cost of the case would  be fixed at the  you got some pretty cheap labour that can do this case for one Euro . industrial designer: That's really that's the cost of the material and lab wow , that's really outstanding . But anyhow , still we are under control , okay , so what  I will do is I will try to negotiate with the vendors , okay , to get  the production cost less , okay , so then we can save some money , okay , to put into th our marketing or  you know the promotions , whatever , okay , so that  I will look after . project manager: You're in four ? marketing: Yep The four gives me it's gotta be  TrendWatch . marketing: It shouldn't be user interface: That's no , I think it's the same one . marketing: Although since  we need to have some type of idea on a market  we had independent study that says it this this market has an availability to absorb eight mi eight million units per year . Okay ? Our internal company evaluation puts it between eight to nine million which is approximately the same as the independent study . Which means that  if we have a target of two million would the company has to take twenty five percent of the market in the first year , project manager: marketing: So , if we put an inflated price of fifty Euro at a production cost that cannot exceed twenty-five Euro , okay , we're already in that that price , okay , project manager: Yes . marketing: with transport , promotion , labour , because we hav gi included the promotion in the cost , transport for the material to the stores or whatever how however we're gonna break this down between our our retailers . At two million units , we have to have a profit of twenty-five Euro per unit to get to the fifty million unit Eu Euro profit . marketing: Okay ? So , obviously we w w I just did a run down the evaluation of the form , the fan  the fancy stylishness of the of the unit , the ease of use , speech recognition , cost , we've gone through these . Now , the company must evaluate the feasibility of being able to take enough of the market to justify in production . Or we project this over two years , but being that the market changes very very quickly , maybe there's no more interest in buying this thing in eighteen months from now . marketing: Can it sell it for fifty Euros ? industrial designer: Could could I go to findings ? project manager: Yep . industrial designer:    I would  like to explore the possibility of using  alternative  delivery and sales channel which would be  to use the internet for promotion and ordering project manager: Yes . industrial designer: That way you have no storage , you have no  you do have transportation , still have the labour cost , user interface: user interface: That actually makes more sense if we're gonna make it so highly customisable , 'cause on the web people can look at the different options they have , see maybe what other people have done , what the range of possibility as , industrial designer:  . user interface: whereas if you're in a store , you can't unless you're a highly imaginative person , you may not really know what it is you want , industrial designer:  . user interface: whereas on the web , if you have a bunch of pictures , it can sort of trigger ideas and industrial designer: And you can even have an a movie that you can rotate the object and look at the di the only thing that you're missing really is the weight . It's not quite like trying on a shoe , but people are getting used to buying things online that they can't touch before buying . You can customise a watch , you can see how it is at the f at the end of the production , industrial designer: -huh . marketing: you can change it  There's a lot of online that's that is doing this now . marketing: And when you're rotating , you'll look behind and look this way  it's possible to do with this , maybe there's a possibility of selling more than two million units in one year , which could you know , feasibili feasibility  lower the price of the unit . project manager: I don't think that's  not possible , it's  okay then , l  let's wait for the production , okay , then  you can evaluate the product , so how it looks like technically and  how it look like  the real . user interface: What turnaround time do we have ? project manager: T user interface: 'Cause  production evaluation can be very very quick or very very long . industrial designer: In  We probably should do some market tests  once we have the prototypes and do some orders and things like that and test-market it . marketing:  that'd have to be thrown out on the market for people to get an idea , project manager: So you can take a minimum two weeks to a maximum four weeks . Think minimum two weeks if we're gonna develop prototypes and then try to take them to different places and see how people use project manager: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , because we we are not going to do it in  our factory , okay , so we can give it a product evalua user interface: No no . industrial designer: project manager: So we'll do it in the other place , and I don't think it's take more than four weeks time . Or  Okay , so then the real production we will start once we product evaluation , okay , then  it's approve from  the technical team and  your team , okay ,  from the management , then we can launch in the market . Hm ? industrial designer: Any outstanding ? project manager: S Any any other  questions or  comments to be discuss ? industrial designer: No , I'm user interface: What ab industrial designer: go ahead . project manager: Okay , so then  industrial designer: Did you have something ? user interface: Well I was just wondering about if we're gonna do a product evaluation then what about time for redesign if the users come back and tell us no this is bad , this is bad , we want this done differently . industrial designer: project manager: So no more changes will be made , okay , in this the basic design . Okay ? So we will introduce m this model and  let's introduce in the market and let's take the feedback from the customers , then we can  go for the industrial designer: Second generation . industrial designer: user interface: The problem is there might not be a second generation if the first generation flops for some silly reason that we haven't thought of . Well , every customer , okay , they have their own ideas , they have their own test , okay , so there's no end , there's no limit . user interface: No , but there's a difference between releasing a product that has been minimally tested and fine-tuned to suit a general range of requirements versus releasing a product that we think will work but we don't really have anything to back it up . project manager: Yeah , so that's the reason you are here for  the design , okay , I hope you made a good design . We have our own motivations in mind , we have our own ideas in mind , but that doesn't mean that that's what's gonna sell . project manager: Yeah , but  see , we ought to take a few considerations , okay , one is the price consideration , one is future consideration , okay , like  you can eat  you can all eat more chi I can eat more chilli , okay , so i it's a depends on the individual taste , you know , industrial designer: project manager: so we have we have to balance somewhere . I'm just trying to point out that I think that your evaluation and redesign turnaround time is too short well you have no redesign not you personally , but in the project we have no redesign time and project manager: Yes . industrial designer: Ed , d do you know what season of the year or time of the year is the most important for T_V_ remote control sales ? marketing:  . marketing: they need those things that they have their hands g occupied and they need to be able to talk to the con remote control . industrial designer: maybe what user interface: industrial designer: So I think what we need to do is perhaps to synchronise the final the the launch of a user-tested device with some special event . industrial designer: so that gives us a little more time perhaps then we anticipated , because I don't know when the World Cup is , but I'm sure there's gonna be one . industrial designer: but , so , I'm just ig  pointing out a  a strategy to  do some additional user testing project manager: Research . industrial designer: or  perhaps to  also user interface: That's actually good place to advertise it too . industrial designer: There might be some motion pictures that are coming out  that are coming out on D_V_D_ that  they need to have a m special remote control to work with it , so we could maybe work out a campaign with  with Sony Pictures for example . user interface: It's just something to to keep in mind , 'cause it's really really important . user interface: A lot of products have gone out there without being properly user-tested and completely flopped , when in fact it gets re-released a few years down the line with proper testing and it takes off like crazy . user interface: Really ? industrial designer: Yes , it is one of the first consumer products that was launched about thirty years that was a disposable consumer product , user interface: That I didn't know . industrial designer: and  people the market hadn't really gotten on to the concept that you could use something and then throw it away , 'cause it wasn't  user interface: industrial designer: but then when they re-launched them thirty years later , they were virtually the same design , project manager: . industrial designer: but people had gotten the throw-away , you know , paper cups and napki y all kinds of things that they hadn't  so , you're right , timing is very important , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: You look very relaxed , considering h you know , the  the weight on your shoulders , yeah . user interface: project manager: Okay , so then  let's come to the closing and  are the costs within the budget marketing: Celebration . Okay for  but our time being , so thanks for all your efforts and great work and  great design and  let's leave it to the Ed for later for once production is over and the meantime let's celebrate . user interface: Thanks industrial designer: user interface: project manager: And see you in the evening for drinks "

        "Summary": "The group reached a consensus on the features of the new remote control, including the use of normal batteries, a scroll wheel with rubber buttons and backlights, a round shape, and speech recognition with an advanced chip. They decided to forgo an LCD display due to cost constraints. Marketing initially suggested developing a multi-functional remote control that could control various appliances, but ultimately decided to design it solely for television use. The Industrial Designer emphasized the importance of a modern remote control being able to control a diverse range of equipment, which was agreed upon by the User Interface team. The group evaluated the remote control design based on user requirements and received a satisfactory average score of two. Marketing raised concerns about the ease of finding all the buttons, particularly the options button, while the Industrial Designer believed all the buttons were easier to find than a regular remote control. The team discussed the inclusion of a standard wheel, despite its higher cost, and debated whether to include a motion-activated light or continuous light.",
        "Article": "user interface: industrial designer: marketing: project manager: And this  design , detailed design meeting  we will discuss  the look-and-feel of the design , the usability interface design , and we will do the product evaluation . If you hold it and you press another button ,  the help goes to the L_C_D_ screen . marketing: is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality ? user interface: So Yeah . marketing: when you're in teletext there usually are buttons where you just you just press it and you g go to the next teletext page . user interface: that's just  the normal  as th as the normal  remote controls  So  You put it  you  came in  page  one hundred . user interface: Oh yeah ? project manager: But  I think these are altogether quite a quite a few buttons . user interface: industrial designer: I think if you look at most controls , they've got more buttons than this . industrial designer: because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does . If you just make a control for just the T_V_ there's just not much to gain here . So we had somebody about th interfa Something about the design of the buttons there ? industrial designer: Yeah , they're project manager: Just n normal plain buttons . user interface: it industrial designer: But they're supposed to be equal sized , round , with a with a little logo on it for the for the volume , the the triangle and stuff . Then because we only have thirty minutes left , I will move on to the finance part , which is pretty exciting , to see if it's all possible what we wanna do . And I can tell you that we're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half Euros . project manager: If we see I don't know if I've filled in correctly , so just correct me if you see  something wrong . project manager: I don't know , but I think the single curved is good for design , and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control . project manager: Because you have to we will have to get the twelve and a half Euros at the end . project manager: I think we can  discard the help and the mute button  by pressing down volume long , or pressing down a a number long . project manager: And this is marketing: d I assume you'd count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each , right ? project manager: No those are one , I think . Where did  marketing: Well , think actually there're two buttons , user interface: it's just one button . project manager: So maybe we can we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one , by pressing marketing: Well I was thinking , maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button . user interface: So  , project manager: Yeah w user interface: we've still got four buttons , but just  So project manager: Yeah th I think they count  the materials . user interface: You got  not not a butt button itself , but  on the  project manager: Yeah on the chip there . Maybe it is , but then it seems to me that it's impossible to get the twelve and a half Euros . Also the L_C_ display , I think it's , I think it's too expensive for the display we use . project manager: I think they  try t industrial designer: If we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip . project manager: That's right , but what's the big advantage of our remote then ? marketing: Only the docking station , I guess . industrial designer: Which isn't the the docking station isn't even in this c s schematic . Don't you think we can , if we can count this as v as one button , and integrate th  these buttons in three , then we save a lot of money as well . industrial designer: So user interface: Are we gonna buy a  a remote control  when you can  use it ? marketing:  user interface: So  Yeah . marketing: Well , since the market research indicated that older people spend their money easier , more easy , maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little . So project manager: I think it's  difficult as well , marketing: Or b project manager: but marketing: Basically becoming a choice between like either a good remote and a higher production cost , or just any other remote control . project manager: Or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers . marketing: But how does scroll-wheel work here ? project manager: Then you will Or maybe you can  scroll . So if you scroll to a number and then you wait a half second , then it g turns to that channel . And the regular chip is not possible ? It has to be advanced ? industrial designer: If you want to use an L_C_D_ screen you you need an advanced chip , yes . project manager: Yeah but I think that's That is a big advantage , user interface: So Yeah project manager: if we're user interface: Yeah it's a big advantage . project manager: But user interface: But  , it's project manager: Can we use can't we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button ? user interface: yeah . project manager: If you push it three times ? marketing: Well , think it's pretty much the teletext subtitles are user interface: Yeah . marketing: right now you just push the teletext button , go to page eight eight eight , project manager: Yeah . user interface: But if you push the teletext button twice industrial designer: What if you have to scroll to page eighty eight ? Eight hundred eighty eight . marketing: I think that's the case on most user interface: It's  One m  one b  , a few buttons . project manager: Ah that's not really that marketing: Well , that could be just  like the scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click . marketing: But then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people , industrial designer: No . marketing: Holding a remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero . project manager: I think if you make a good advertisement  on television and in the in the guide , you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel . industrial designer: If we leave out all those buttons , perhaps you can go with the flat flat case . industrial designer: So if you put the the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on-off button , the screen right behi under that , than the scroll button project manager:  yeah . user interface: But  , you can make a f quite a big  remote remote control for  just the same price as a small one . It's  it's more the moulds in which they are being made , I think .  , what does everybody think about a flat or a single curved design ? Freek , what do you think ? marketing: Well , I still think we should go for the single curve design . Yeah I'm ag marketing: I'd rather just go to the board and get us to spend eighteen dollars a a remote . project manager: So people will use it more , and especially for the help functions , user interface: Yeah . project manager: No , but I think marketing: So we're gonna have to do a lotta convincing them . project manager: I think the most user interface: But they know the scroll-buttons from  old radios . project manager: We can let l user interface: So maybe it's  project manager: We can stick it out , a bit . If they see this design they think oh , there are only five buttons , and  But we will see . marketing: Five more minutes ? project manager: No we've got fifteen minutes but marketing: Okay . What ? marketing: 'Kay so I did some literature study study , and analysis of the requirements we set up earlier . Innovative ? What new functions are there ?  , easy to use ?  , learnability is a very important factor here .  , is it functional ? Are there not too many functions  among the functions ? And are the those functions that are there , are they useful ? And the cost . If our company is If it is easily recognisable that our company made it ? And So we're supposed to evaluate it right now . Oh I have to say this was a little hard , because the minutes of our last meeting were not here . marketing: Is the design fancy , on a scale of one to seven ? project manager: I think it's fancy . Sh marketing: I think so , with our L_C_D_ screen , docking station , scroll-buttons . project manager: So we've got twenty cents for our docking station , huh ? industrial designer: user interface: marketing: Should be do-able . project manager: Is it functional ? industrial designer: marketing: Is the design functional ?  , do we have all functions that we want to include ? project manager: Yes . Oh , and do we  take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control ? Like it getting lost and R_S_I_ influences ? user interface:  m industrial designer: we haven't thought of that one . marketing: Are the production costs within the preset limits ? industrial designer: marketing: Well they are now . project manager: No I think with our new radio button , I think it's  I think it's better . marketing: I think project manager: I think it marketing: I think a radio button is not exactly what older people expect to have a remote control . I was also supposed to calculate the score , but thought we would have another private thingy after this . marketing: Is this Like after this , are we done ? Or project manager: N We've gonna We're going to evaluate it . project manager: What is it ? marketing: Guess I'll just type that in on the bottom here . industrial designer: Yeah , there w there was enough room , but the finance  marketing: Yeah , true . Was it clear what everybody had to do  according to their roles and functions ? Yeah ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: Teamwork ? Did it work out ? Working together ? Also , you two of you with the  last phase ? user interface: So industrial designer: Yes , was okay . industrial designer: The tasks are very structured , so you can just do step by step and it's very easy . Were the means sufficient for the tasks  we had to do ? Or were they too much ? user interface:  . industrial designer: Well , the smart-board , the d d drawing is just a pain in the ass , but The digital the digital pen is very nice . industrial designer: A flip-over or a more precise  digit user interface: A flipper's  easier , so Yeah . user interface: But if you want to share  of  when you make  a picture like this  on the presentation , it's easier to  share it with  other people . user interface: you can sh save it  and  put it on the internet , or   in shared f  folder or  sh  shared directory . marketing: Yeah , user interface: So So marketing: I tried to open the file on my laptop , user interface: Yeah ? No ? industrial designer: No . project manager: But I think you can user interface: T can  can you export it  like a Yeah . Have we found new ideas for having this kind of meetings ? Or user interface: yeah maybe   when we n  just  give the numbers of of    o one of  out of s  sev project manager: Yeah . user interface:  it's  easier to  to do the th things that are like that on a computer . project manager: But maybe because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher ? marketing: Yeah . project manager: So I think that shouldn't be the biggest problem , because it's very cheap to make as well . project manager: Do we think we gonna get the twelve and a half million ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , still I think  if we're n gonna make a scroll-button anyway it'd be more for the younger people than for the older people . project manager: So you can also try to  reach the younger people by  putting fancy covers on on the market . marketing: Yeah , I think then it would be way more  popular with younger people than it is , than would be with older people . I didn't get a message from the from ending of the user interface: I believe y  project manager: Oh I think I have one now . industrial designer: project manager: user interface: marketing: project manager: Export as picture , I think . So  project manager: Yeah , I'll just put it in My Documents marketing: Yeah , it probably will . marketing: Oh yeah , you're supposed to make a final project manager: And then I will be back in about ten minutes to show you the final presentation . marketing: Are we supposed to go into our own rooms again ? user interface:  maybe we have to fill  another questionnaire "

        "Query": "Summarize the discussion about electronics, the segment, the results from the experiments, and the topic of intentionality.",
        "Summary": "The team discussed the best approach for incorporating the recording infrastructure in the room, considering options such as placing tapes in the lip of the table and using LEDs to indicate when the channel is live. Power issues were also a topic of discussion. In terms of representing the Bayes-net, an alternative approach was proposed that depicts context features as classes and their dependencies as relations. This model allows for instantiations of classes, which aligns better with the research objectives compared to the extended belief-net. Recent experiments revealed that adding more languages had a detrimental effect on model performance. However, it was noted that any form of normalization had a positive impact, while MSG had no effect. A demonstration was given on the structure and function of a toy version of the belief-net for the intentionality task. The feature nodes included prosody, discourse, verb choice, the \"landmark-iness\" of a building, time of day, and whether the admission fee was discussed.",
        "Article": "But  we 're gonna try to make this an abbreviated meeting cuz the the next next occupants were pushing for it , so . Agenda is according to this , is transcription status , DARPA demos XML tools , disks , backups , et cetera and grad h: Does anyone have anything to add to the agenda ? professor b: OK . grad h:  phd d: I g grad h: as a somewhat segue into the next topic ,  could I get a hold of  the data even if it 's not really corrected yet just so I can get the data formats and make sure the information retrieval stuff is working ? postdoc a: Certainly . So I 'll I 'll probably just make some copies of those rather than use the ones that are there . grad h:  and then just we 'll have to remember to delete them once the corrections are made . professor b: OK , wh phd d: I also got anot a short remark to the transcription . I 've  just processed the first five EDU meetings and they are chunked up so they would they probably can be sent to IBM whenever they want them . phd d: but the other ones phd f: That 's the one that we 're waiting to hear from them on . postdoc a: These are separate from the ones that phd f: As soon as postdoc a: these are phd f: They 're the IBM set . And so as soon as we hear from Brian that this one is OK grad h: Is my mike on ? Yeah . phd f: and we get the transcript back and we find out that hopefully there are no problems matching up the transcript with what we gave them , then  we 'll be ready to go and we 'll just send them the next four as a big batch , postdoc a: Excellent . grad h: And so we 're doing those as disjoint from the ones we 're transcribing here ? phd f: Yes , exactly . phd f: We 're sort of doing things in parallel , that way we can get as much done a at once . grad h: Yeah , I think that 's the right way to do it , phd f: Yeah . grad h: Right , which  So I 've been working on using the THISL tools to do information retrieval on meeting data and the THISL tools are there 're two sets , there 's a back - end and a front - end , so the front - end is the user interface and the back - end is the indexing tool and the querying tool . So at least on the one meeting that I had the transcript for  conveniently you can now do information retrieval on it , do type in a a string and get back a list of start - end times for the meeting , phd f: What what kind of  what does that look like ? The string that you type in . phd f: What are you are you are they keywords , or are they ? grad h: Keywords . grad h: Right ? And so and then it munges it to pass it to the THISL IR which uses an SGML - like format for everything . professor b: And then does it play something back or that 's something you 're having to program ? grad h: right now , I have a tool that will do that on a command line using our standard tools , professor b: Yeah . grad h: but my intention is to do a prettier user interface based either So so that 's the other thing I wanted to discuss , is well what should we do for the user interface ? We have two tools that have already been written . grad h:  the other option is Dan did the Tcl - TK THISL GUI front - end for Broadcast News professor b: Yeah . postdoc a: I Can I ask a question ? So  as it stands within the the Channeltrans interface , it 's possible to do a find and a play . So e Are you So you 're adding like  , I don't know ,  are they fuzzy matches or are they  ? grad h: It 's a sort of standard , text - retrieval - based So it 's  term frequency , inverse document frequency scoring . grad h:  and then there are all sorts of metrics for spacing how far apart they have to be and things like that . So it it 's postdoc a: It 's a lot more sophisticated than the  the basically Windows - based grad h: i it 's like doing a Google query or anyth anything else like that . grad h: So i it uses So it pr produces an index ahead of time so you don't you 're not doing a linear search through all the documents . Cuz you can imagine if with if we have the sixty hours ' worth you do wouldn't wanna do a search . grad h:  you have to do preindexing and so that these tools do all that . And so the work to get the front - end to work would be porting it well  to get it to work on the UNIX systems , our side is just rewriting them and modifying them to work for meetings . grad h: So that it understands that they 're different speakers and that it 's one big audio file instead of a bunch of little ones and just sorta things like that . phd f: So what does the user see as the result of the query ? grad h: On which tool ? phd f: THISL . grad h: The THISL GUI tool which is the one that Dan wrote , Tcl - TK phd f: Yeah . grad h:  you type in a query and then you get back a list of hits and you can type on them and listen to them . professor b: Mmm phd f: So if you typed in \" small heads \" or something you could grad h: Right , you 'd get phd f: get back a   something that would let you click and listen to some audio where that phrase had occurred grad h: something You you 'd get to listen to \" beep \" . It 's too bad that that couldn't come into the grad h: You couldn't get a video . phd g: Guess who I practice on ? postdoc a: At some point we 're gonna have to say what that private joke is , that keeps coming up . Yeah , it loo it my my recollection of it is it 's it 's a pretty reasonable  demo sort of format . grad h: And so I think there 'd be minimal effort to get it to work , minimally phd f: That sounds really neat . grad h: and then we 'd wanna add things like query by speaker and by meeting and all that sort of stuff .  Dave Gelbart expressed some interest in working on that so I 'll work with him on it . And it it 's looking pretty good , you know , the fact that I got the query system working . grad h: If we wanna get it to Windows it 's gonna be a little more work because the THISL IR , the information retrieval tool 's  , I had difficulty just compiling them on Solaris . phd f: But you were saying that that the  that there 's that set of tools , Cygnus tools , that grad h: So . grad h: But what those they what those do is provide sort of a BSD compatibility layer , professor b:   phd f: And you have to have all the o grad h: But the problem is that that the THISL tools didn't use anything like Autoconf and so you have the normal porting problems of different header files and th some things are defined and some things aren't and  different compiler work - arounds and so on . So the fact that  it took me a day to get it c to compile under Solaris means it 's probably gonna take me s significantly more than that to get it to compile under Windows . professor b: How about having it run under free BSD ? phd e: Well what you need grad h: Free BSD would probably be easier . phd e: All you need to do is say to Dan \" gee it would be nice if this worked under Autoconf \" and it 'll be done in a day . phd d:  phd e: Right ? grad h: Actually you know I should check because he did port it to SPRACHcore phd e: Right . professor b: So grad h: I 'll check at that professor b: But it would what would serve would serve both purposes , is if you contact him and ask him if he 's already done it . phd e: What I phd f: How does it play ? grad h: Yeah , right . professor b: If he has then you learn , if he hasn't then he 'll do it . So , and I 've been corresponding with Dan and also with   , SoftSound guy ,  postdoc a: It 's amazing . professor b: Tony Robinson ? phd f: Tony Robinson ? grad h: Do  Tony ? I guess I do . grad h: Which one do  ? phd e: Steve Renals is not SoftSound , is he ? professor b: No . grad h: so that 's all going pretty well , professor b: Assuming we 're phd e: Right . phd f: What about issues of playing sound files @ @ between the two platforms ? grad h: I think we 'll be OK with that . phd e: Why don't you try and merge Transcriber and THISL IR ? They 're both Tcl interfaces . grad h: Well this is one of the reasons This is the one of the reasons that I 'm gonna have  Dave Gelbart Gelbart Having him volunteer to work on it is a really good thing because he 's worked on the Transcriber stuff phd e: Right . But the point is that the Transcriber uses Snack and then you can but you can use a a lot of the same functionality and it 's grad h: Yeah , yeah , I I think THISL THISL GUI probably uses Snack . Well my thought was is that it would be nice it would be nice to have the running transcripts  eh you know , from speaker to speaker . grad h: And if it doesn't phd e: Right ? Do you have you have , you know , a speaker mark here and a speaker mark here ? grad h: Right , we 'll have to figure out a user interface for that , so . It might be fairly difficult to get that to work in the little short segments we 'd be talking about and having the search tools and so on . grad h: but professor b: The thing I was asking about with , free BSD is that it might be easier to get PowerPoint shows running in free BSD than to get this other package running in grad h: Yeah ,  we have to I have to sit down and try it before I make too many judgments , professor b: Yeah . grad h: so   My experience with the Gnu compatibility library is really it 's just as hard and just as easy to port to any system . grad h: It 's just , you know , just like all of them , the \" include \" files are a little different and the function calls are a little different . grad h: So I it might be a little easier but it 's not gonna be a lot easier . So there was that demo , which was one of the main ones , then we talked about  some other stuff which would basically be  showing off the the Transcriber interface itself and as you say , maybe we could even merge those in some sense , but but  ,  and part of that was showing off what the speech - non  nonspeech stuff that Thilo has done s looks like . postdoc a: Can I ask one more thing about THISL ? So with the IR stuff then you end up with a somewhat prioritized  ? grad h:   phd g: So another idea I w t had just now actually for the demo was whether it might be of interest to sh to show some of the prosody  work that Don 's been doing . phd g:  actually show some of the features and then show for instance a task like finding sentence boundaries or finding turn boundaries . professor b: Well I think at at the very least we 're gonna want something illustrative with that phd g: I don't know if that would be of interest or not . professor b: cuz I 'm gonna want to talk about it and so i if there 's something that shows it graphically it 's much better than me just having a bullet point phd g: Yeah . professor b: pointing at something I don't know much about , phd g: you 're looking at this now professor b: so . phd g: Are you looking at Waves or Matlab ? grad c:  yeah I 'm starting to and  Yeah we can probably find some examples of different type of prosodic events going on . phd g: Yeah def professor b: S so when we here were having this demo meeting , what we 're sort of coming up with is that we wanna have all these pieces together , to first order , by the end of the month phd g: I professor b: and then that 'll give us a week or so . The end of phd g: Oh , the end of this month or next month ? Oh , you mean like today ? grad h: This month . professor b:  that 'll that 'll give us that 'll give us a week or so to  to port things over to my laptop and make sure that works , phd e: Exactly . phd g: Yeah if d if Don can sort of talk to whoever 's professor b: Yeah . phd g: cuz we 're doing this anyway as part of our you know , the research , visualizing what these features are doing professor b: Yeah . professor b: so  , you know , to let s the goal is to let them know what it is we 're doing . professor b: So that 's phd g: I don't think anyone has done this on meeting data so it might be neat , you know . So I 've been doing a bunch of XML tools where you we 're sort of moving to XML as the general format for everything and I think that 's definitely the right way to go because there are a lot of tools that let you do extraction and reformatting of XML tools . So yet again we should probably meet to talk about transcription formats in XML because I 'm not particularly happy with what we have now .  it works with Transcriber but it it 's a pain to use it in other tools  because it doesn't mark start and end .  , but I 've installed XML tools of various sorts in various languages and so if people are interested in doing extracting any information from any of these files , either  information on users because the user database is that way I 'm converting the Key files to XML so that you can extract m  various inf  sorted information on individual meetings grad c: Cool . And so l just let me know there it 's mostly Java and Perl but we can get other languages too if if that 's desirable . Is do we have the the seat information ? In in the Key files now ? postdoc a:   grad h: The seat information is on the Key files for the ones which postdoc a: Ah . phd g: Oh in For the new one grad h: it 's been recorded , phd g: OK . phd g: I 'm just trying to figure out , you know , when Morgan 's voice appears on someone 's microphone are they next to him or are they across from him ? professor b: Yeah . phd f: how how w eh where is it in the Key file ? grad h: Right . phd g: Cuz  I haven't been putting it in and in by grad h: You haven't been putting it in . postdoc a: Isn't it always on the digits ? professor b: Some of these are missing . phd g: And professor b: Aren't they ? postdoc a: Isn't it always on the digits forms ? professor b: Some fall out of phd g: Well it grad h: Yeah so we can go back and fill them in for the ones we have . phd g:  they 're on th right , these , but I just hadn't ever been putting it in the Key files . phd f: Yeah I I never phd g: And I don't think Chuck was either phd f: I never knew we were supposed to put it in the Key file . phd g: cuz grad h: I had told you guys about it phd f: Oh really ? phd g: Oh , so we 're both sorry . grad h: but phd g: So grad h:  this is why I wanna use a g a tool to do it rather than the plain text phd g: OK . grad h: I think it 's Edit - key , command Did I show you guys that ? phd d: Yep . phd f: You mentioned it , grad h: I did show it to you , phd f: yeah . grad h: but I think you both said \" no , you 'll just use text file \" . grad h: Yeah , and so if you don't fill it in , you 're not gonna get it in the meetings . grad c: u grad h: Yeah and then the other thing also that Thilo noticed is , on the microphone , on channel zero it says hand - held mike or Crown mike , phd g: Yeah . phd g: maybe I forgot to d phd f: Takes me no time at all to edit these . grad h: Yeah that 's cuz you kn phd f: I 'm not doing anything . phd g: And I was I was looking at Chuck 's , like , \" oh what did Chuck do , OK I 'll do that \" . grad h: And then  also in a couple of places instead of filling the participants under \" participants \" they were filled in under \" description \" . Oh  also I 'm working on another version of this tool , the the one that shows up here , that will flash yellow if the mike isn't connected . And it 's not quite ready to go yet because  it 's hard to tell whether the mike 's connected or not because the best quality ones , the Crown ones , are about the same level if they 're off and no one 's o off or if they 're on and no one 's talking . So I 'm working on that and it it sorta works and so eventually we will change to that and then you 'll be able to see graphically if your mike is dropping in or out . grad c: Will that also include like batteries dying ? Just a any time the mike 's putting out zeros basically . phd f: But with the screensaver kicking in , it phd d: But grad h: Now phd d: y yeah . grad h:  the other thing is as I 've said before , it is actually on the thing . postdoc a: It would be nice if if these had little light indicators , little L E Ds for grad h:  buzzer . grad h: \" Bamp , bamp ! \" professor b: Small shocks postdoc a: Yeah . Oh grad h: OK , disk backup , et cetera ?  I spoke with Dave Johnson about putting all the Meeting Recorder stuff on non - backed - up disk to save the overhead of backup and he pretty much said \" yeah , you could do that if you want \" but he thought it was a bad idea . In fact what he said is doing the manual one , doing  NW archive to copy it is a good idea and we should do that and have it backed up . grad h: And so if a mistake is made and we lose the backup we should have the archive and if then a mistake is made and we lose the archive we should have the backup . professor b: Well I guess it is true that even with something that 's backed up it 's not gonna if it 's stationary it 's not going to go through the increment it 's not gonna burden things in the incremental backups . But he said that that we sh shouldn't worry too much about that , that we 're getting a new backup system and we 're far enough away from saturation on full backups that it 's w probably OK . professor b: Really ? grad h: And  , so the only issue here is the timing between getting more disks and  recording meetings . professor b: So I guess the idea is that we would be reserving the non - backed - up space for things that took less than twenty - four hours to recreate or something like that , right ? grad h: Things that are recreatable easily and also Yeah , basically things that are recreatable . professor b: Well I was allowing someone else to come up with something related that they had  phd e: I thought you guys were gonna burn C Ds ? grad h:  unfortunately we could burn C Ds but first of all it 's a pain . grad h: Because you have to copy it down to the PC and then burn it and that 's a multi - step procedure . And second of all the the write - once burners as opposed to a professional press don't last . grad h: So I think burning them for distribution is fine but burning them for backup is not a good idea . Can I add one top topic ? We have time ? I wanted to ask , I know that  that Thilo you were , bringing the Channeltrans interface onto the Windows machine ? And I wanted to know is th phd d: Yeah it 's it Basically it 's done , postdoc a: It 's all done ? That 's g wonderful . grad h: Yes , since Tcl - TK runs on it , basically things 'll just work . phd d: Yeah it Yeah , it was just a problem with the Snack version and the Transcriber version but it 's solved . Does this mean that the that this could be por  ported to a Think - Pad note or some other type of  phd d: Yeah , basically  I did install it on my laptop and yeah postdoc a: Wonderful . CrossPads ? CrossPads ? grad h:  got an email from  James Landay who basically said \" if you 're not using them , could you return them ? \" So he said he doesn't need them , he just periodically w at the end of each term sends out email to everyone who was recorded as having them and asks them if they 're still using them . professor b: Once ? grad h: We we used them a couple times , postdoc a:   phd f: Them ? There 's more than one ? grad h: but postdoc a: Yeah . professor b: But grad h: My opinion on it is , first , I never take notes anyway so I 'm not gonna use it ,  and second , it 's another level of infrastructure that we have to deal with . postdoc a: And I have  so my my feeling on it is that I think in principle it 's a really nice idea , and you have the time tags which makes it better tha than just taking ra raw notes . On the other hand , I the down side for me was that I think the pen is really noisy . And I and I don't know if it 's audible on the but I I sort of thought that was a disadvantage . I do take notes , I could be taking notes on these things and I guess the plus with the CrossPads would be the time markings but I don't know . phd d: what is a CrossPad ? professor b: So it 's it 's  it 's a regular pad , just a regular pad of paper but there 's this pen which indicates position . grad h: And then you can download it and they have OCR and searching and all sorts of things . grad h: But I don't take notes , professor b: And one of the reasons that it was brought up originally was because  we were interested in in higher - level things , grad h: so . professor b: not just the , you know , microphone stuff but also summarization and so forth and the question is if you were going to go to some gold standard of what wa what was it that happened in the meeting you know , where would it come from ? And  I think that was one of the things , phd d: Yeah . We 'll have a you know , have a scribe , have somebody  take good notes and then that 's part of the record of the meeting . And then we did it once or twice and we sort of grad h: Yep , and then just sort of died out . professor b: probably chose the wrong scribe but it was It 's  phd g:  grad h: Yeah that 's right . postdoc a: u but I guess the the other thing I 'm thinking is if we wanted that kind of thing I wonder if we 'd lose that much by having someone be a scribe by listening to the tape , to the recording afterwards and taking notes in some other interface . phd f:  we 're transcribing it anyways , why do we need notes ? postdoc a: Oh it 's la it 's useful , grad h: Because that 's summary . phd g: I think there 's also there 's this use that phd f: Summarize it from the transcription . phd g: the Well , what if you 're sitting there and you just wanna make an X and you don't wanna take notes and you 're you just wanna phd f: Doodle . phd g: get the summary of the transcript from this time location like you know , and and then while you 're bored you don't do anything and once in a while , maybe there 's a joke and you put a X and But in in other words you can use that just to highlight times in a very simple way . Also with I was thinking and I know Morgan disagrees with me on this but suppose you have a group in here and you wanna let them note whenever they think there might be something later that they might not wanna distribute in terms of content , they could just sort of make an X near that point or a question mark that sort of alerts them that when they get the transcript back they c could get some red flags in that transcript region and they can then look at it . I know we haven't been using it but I w I can imagine it being useful just for sort of marking time periods grad h: Right . professor b: I guess so , you know , what what makes one think i is maybe we should actually schedule some periods where people go over something later phd g: so . professor b: and and and put some kind of summary or something  you know , some there 'd be some scribe who would actually listen , w who 'd agreed to actually listen to the whole thing , not transcribe it , but just sort of write down things that struck them as important . But then you don't you don't have the time reference  that you 'd have if you had it live . And you don't have a lot of other cues that might be useful , professor b: Yeah . phd f: How do you synchronize the time in the CrossPad and the time of the recording ? phd g: so . grad h:  that was one of the issues we talked about originally and that that 's w part of the difficulty is that we need an infrastructure for using the time the CrossPads and so that means synchronizing the time phd g:  postdoc a:   grad h: You know you want it pretty close and there 's a fair amount of skew because it 's a hand - held unit with a battery postdoc a: Well when when I d grad h: and so you postdoc a: OK . grad h: so you have to synchronize at the beginning of each meeting all the pads that are being used , so that it 's synchronized with the time on that and then you have to download to an application , and then you have to figure out what the data formats are and convert it over if you wanna do anything with this information . phd e: Why grad h: And so there 's a lot of infrastructure which postdoc a: There is an alternative . grad h: unless someone postdoc a: There is an alternative , it 's still , there 's  you know , your point stands about there be needing to be an infrastructure , but it doesn't have to be synchronized with the little clock 's timer on it . You c  , I when I when I did it I synchronized it by voice , by whispering \" one , two , three , four \" onto the microphone grad h:  . grad h: Well , but then there 's the infrastructure at the other end phd e: Right . grad h: which someone has to listen to that and find that point , postdoc a: Yeah , it 's transcribed . phd g: Well , could we keep one of these things for another year ? Would h  is there a big cau grad h: We can keep all both of them for the whole whole year . phd g: just just in case we grad h: it 's just phd g: even maybe some of the transcribers who might be wanting to annotate  f just there 's a bunch of things that might be neat to do but I it might not be the case that we can actually synchronize them and then do all the infrastructure but we could at least try it out . professor b: Well one thing that we might try  is on some set of meetings , some collection of meetings , maybe EDU is the right one or maybe something else , we we get somebody to buy into the idea of doing this as part of the task . professor b:  part of the reason I think part of the reason that Adam was so interested in  the SpeechCorder sort of f idea from the beginning is he said from the beginning he hated taking notes and grad h: Yep . professor b: and so forth so and and Jane is more into it but eh  you know I don't know if you wanna really do do this all the time so I think the thing is to to get someone to actually buy into it and have at least some series of meetings where we do it . The p the the problem with the the more extended view , all these other you know with  quibbling about particular applications of it is that it looks like it 's hard to get people to   routinely use it ,  it just hasn't happened anyway . But maybe if we can get a person to phd g: Yeah I don't think it has to be part of a what everybody does in a meeting but it might be a useful , neat part of the project that we can , you know , show off as a mechanism for synchronizing events in time that happen that you just wanna make a note of , like what Jane was talking about with some later browsing , just just as a convenience , even if it 's not a full - blown note taking substitute . phd e: Well if you wanted to do that maybe the right architecture for it is to get a PDA with a wireless card . And and that way you can synchronize very easily with the the the meeting because you 'll be synchroni you can synchronize with the the Linux server and  phd g: So what kind of input would you be ? phd e: so so , if you 're not worried about grad h: Buttons . phd g: You 'd just be pressing like a a phd e: Well well you have a PDA and may and you could have the same sort of X interface or whatever , you 'd have to do a little eh a little bit of coding to do it . phd e: if if all you really wanted was you didn't want this secondary note - taking channel but just sort of being able to use m markers of some sort , a PDA with a l a wireless card would be the probably the right way to go . grad h:  for what what you 've been describing buttons would be even more convenient than anything else , phd g: M right . grad h: right ? You have the phd g: I don't have , you know , grandiose ideas in mind but I 'm just sort of thinking well we 've we 're getting into the next year now and we have a lot of these things worked out at in terms of the speech maybe somebody will be interested in this and postdoc a: I like this PDA idea . professor b: where like one one button was \"  - oh \" and then another button was \" that 's great \" and another button \" that 's f \" phd g: Or like this is my \" I 'm supposed to do this \" kind of button , postdoc a: Yeah . phd g: Yeah something like that or postdoc a: And then grad h:  I think the CrossPad idea is a good one . grad h: It 's just a question of getting people to use it and getting the infrastructure set up in such a way that it 's not a lot of extra work .  that 's part of the reason why it hasn't happened is that it 's been a lot of extra work for me phd g: Yeah . grad h: and postdoc a: But it 's also , it has this problem of having to go from an analog to a d a digital record too , phd g: W postdoc a: doesn't it ?  grad h: Well it 's digital but it 's in a format that is not particularly standard . postdoc a: But  , say , if i if if you 're writing if you 're writing notes in it does it it can't do handwriting recognition , right ? professor b: No , no , but it 's just it 's just storing the pixel informa position information , postdoc a: OK . postdoc a: I I guess what I 'm thinking is that the PDA solution you h you have it already without needing to go from the pixelization to a to a  professor b: Right . You don't have to phd e: The transfer function is less errorful , postdoc a: Oh , nicely put . phd g: Well it also it 's maybe realistic cuz people are supposed to be bringing their P D As to the meeting eventually , right ? That 's why we have this little I don't know what I don't wanna cause more work for anyone but I can imagine some interesting things that you could do with it and so if we don't have to return it and we can keep it for a year I don't know . grad h: Well w we don't we certainly don't have to return it , as I said . All all he said is that if you 're not using it could you return it , if you are using it feel free to keep it . The point is that we haven't used it at all and are we going to ? professor b: So we have no but  by I I would suggest you return one . phd g: We c professor b: We have some aspirations of using them phd g: One would probably be fine . professor b: and phd g: Maybe we could do like a student project , you know , maybe someone who wants to do this as their main like s project for something would be cool .  if we had them out and sitting on the table people might use them a little more professor b: Maybe Jeremy could sit in some meetings and press a button when there when when somebody laughed . grad h: although there is a little phd g: Well , I 'm yeah , that 's not a bad professor b: Yeah , yeah . phd g: Jeremy 's gonna be an he 's a new student starting on modeling brea breath and laughter , actually , which sounds funny but I think it should be cool , professor b: Yeah . phd g: You 're you 're gonna tease me ? grad h: Oh , equipment . grad h: And then at the same time I 'll probably rewire the room as per Jane 's suggestion so that  the first N channels are wireless , eh are the m the close - talking and the next N are far - field . professor b: You know what he means but isn't that funny sounding ? \" We ordered more wireless . \" It 's like wires are the things so you 're wiring you 're you 're you we 're we ordered more absence of the thing . phd g: I just it 's sort of a anachronism ,  it 's like It 's great . professor b:  there 's there 's all this stuff going on  between  Andreas and and and Dave and Chuck and others with various kinds of runs   recognition runs , trying to figure things out about the features but it 's it 's all sort of in process , so there 's not much to say right now . grad h: So just the transcript number and then the then the phd e: This is Yes , this is number two for me today . professor b: See all you have to do is go away to move way up in the phd e: Oh . grad h: Should we do simultaneous ? phd g: Well , I 'm just thinking , are you gonna try to save the data before this next group comes in ? professor b: Yeah . phd g: You have to plug your ears , by the way  Eric , grad h: Well I have to , phd d: You don't have to "

        "Query": "Summarize the discussion on trend watching, appearance design, and product components, as well as the project manager's opinions towards product appearance.",
        "Summary": "The marketing team highlighted three important trends: the desire for fancy and identifiable products, the need for technological innovation, and the importance of ease of use. Additionally, they noted that fruit and vegetable themes were popular, and the idea of a spongy texture was well-received. The group agreed that the remote control should resemble fruit and vegetables in shape and color, but the specific design was not yet determined. The industrial designer proposed two options: a titanium material with a fruity scent or a spongy and fruity-like material. However, the project manager stated that they couldn't have both options and suggested painting the controller to mimic titanium instead. The final decision was not made. The user interface designer suggested a red and yellow color scheme and two basic shapes, a circle and a triangle, referred to as the mushroom design. However, the marketing team disagreed with the mushroom design and decided to change it to a pineapple shape. The group decided to produce a mid-sized remote control with various components such as a printed circuit board, chip, transistor, scroll wheel, power cradle, locator, radio transmitter, antenna, speaker, double curves, LEDs, and buttons. The casing material would be a combination of rubber and plastic. Based on previous experiments and questionnaires, the marketing team found that most users considered remote controls to be ugly. Therefore, the group aimed to create a fancy-looking product to justify a higher price. However, determining what constitutes \"fancy\" was challenging due to differing opinions. The project manager agreed that the product should be visually appealing but cautioned against using too many colors to avoid increasing costs. Additionally, the project manager suggested incorporating an image that represents society on the remote control for easy recognition.",
        "Article": " we'll just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are and what you're doing , what your what your role is  . I am Corinne Whiting and I will be the Marketing Expert and in each of the three phases I will have a different role . In the function design phase I will be talking about user requirement specification , and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , and I'll be doing research to figure this out . In the conceptual design phase I will be dealing with trend watching and I'll be doing marketing research on the web . And then finally in the  detailed design phase I will be doing product evaluation and so I will be collecting the requirements and ranking all the requirements to see how we did . And the detailed design  sort of like the user interface design , what they might be looking for ,  things like fashions , what makes wha how we're gonna make it special . In the functional design phase I'm I'll be dealing mostly with the requirements ,  we'll discuss what the prog what functions the the product has to fulfil and so and so on . industrial designer: And  the detailed design in the detailed design I'll be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself ,  so we're pretty much working together obviously on the design front here .  so we've got our opening , our our agenda is the opening ,  acquaintance which we've kinda done .  of course we're a not only a electronics company but a fashion  conscious electronics company , so we want it to be trendy  and we want it to be easy to use .  we've got the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design  which basically is is the three of you  .  do we have  any ideas of of maybe d let's just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have , and then we can go into how we're gonna design it and and how we're gonna do the detailing on it . project manager: So we want it to be  a T_V_ remote or I  do we want it to to do other things besides just be a a television remote ? user interface: Oh right . But , you know , they all sorta have the same role changing channels , volumes and then programming . user interface: I think they all work on the same prin principle as well sorta like I don't actually know . But is it just infra-red ? Is that standard ? project manager: I I think yeah , yeah , r universal remote . user interface: So if there's a g a way of finding it quite easily , I thought that'd be quite good quite a good feature . Ch project manager: So we should we should set our remote control up to where it has a  marketing: Like a tracking device ? project manager: like a tracking device or or like a a user interface: Oh you can get those key well you could whistle or make a noise project manager: It makes a noise , user interface: and it'd beep . project manager: there's a button on the T_V_ that you press industrial designer:  . industrial designer: So user interface: Generally , all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance . user interface: I thought maybe , because people always tend to throw a remote control about the place to one another if it was in a ball , project manager: 'Kay . industrial designer: Well there are of course certain restrictions , you can't have it be any form and fulfil all functions at the same time , user interface: Yeah .  however  one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be , that refers to the material , pretty much  . industrial designer: How sturdy is it gonna be ? Do we want it to last longer or rather have people whatever , have to buy one every half a year ? project manager: Okay so yeah , so we want it to be sturdy , user interface: Yeah . project manager: we want it to to hold up to somebody's child , you know , throwing it across the room or , as you said , people kinda throw it , so ball-shaped ,  you know , if it were ball-shaped maybe , user interface: Yeah . project manager: then it user interface: It could be cased on the outside and t everything could be inside .  What else it what else do we want it to to do ? So we want it to be universal . It's something that we're supposed to sell for about twenty five Euros  and you know , goals for profits are I think somewhere around  fifty million Euros , what they wanna make on it , so . Also since we're partners of the International Remote Control Association , maybe we wanna make it something that would globally appeal . project manager: So marketing , you know , how maybe  marketing , you could s find out what is the most universally  appealing remote control out there . industrial designer: marketing: And maybe as far as design goes , maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences , project manager: 'Kay . project manager:  Do you guys have any ideas for what it should look like ? Maybe we could draw it up on the on the board over there . Some ideas ? We want it to be a b a ball , user interface: I'd I could draw sorta the ball idea . project manager: you know , we'll draw up we'll draw up the ball and maybe th  where the buttons are located . user interface: My original idea was just simply sort of a sphere , where maybe you this is where it's connected together , and then when you open it out , it could fol it could be maybe flip , like a flip phone , and then when you fold it out the middle Maybe a hinge that'll have to be the strongest part of it . If that if we did use a hinge , or if it was just two parts , industrial designer: user interface: and then you'd have just sorta you you you know , your buttons . Thing is inside I think , sometimes remotes have too many buttons , so maybe as simple as possible ,  as few buttons inside as possible . Just something maybe if you ha if it had like if some kind of like light or something or lights around it . It's looking a bit like something out of Star Wars at the moment though , to be fair . industrial designer: user interface: That was that was a sorta simple idea I had project manager: -huh . One problem you'd get with this design is  the ball is a nice idea because of it's stability really , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: but of course , since it's a ball , it'll roll , so we'd have to have it flat on one side at least , down here somewhere , user interface: Yeah . The idea it didn't have to necessarily be f a hinge , industrial designer: That's that's interesting of course , user interface: that was just one idea though . marketing: project manager: How would we go about  making you know getting rid of our weak points ? What  would we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball ? user interface: marketing: project manager: Not to put you on the spot , industrial designer: E No no , project manager: but industrial designer:   . project manager: What did you say your title was again ? industrial designer: N n marketing: project manager: You're the the Industrial Designer . industrial designer: I'm your Industrial Designer , marketing: industrial designer: so i b well , project manager: industrial designer: the point is that well maybe I dunno . industrial designer: As as stable as it is , there must be a compromise between  stability and design here , so . I can't think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote , project manager: Yeah . user interface: maybe small , sort of fatter ones , but there's nothing being done sort of out of left field , yeah . project manager: It's not new , it's not innovative , it's you know , everybody does long remote because it's easy , user interface: Yeah . marketing: My idea was just to have it be kind of like a keyboard type shape , you know , like video games user interface: Yeah . user interface:  maybe design something , that's sort of like suppose not everybody's everybody's hand's the same , but something that would maybe fit in the hand easier . Because even I suppose even with the ball user interface: It still might be hard to project manager: it's user interface: it still not the ho easiest thing to hold , yeah . project manager: But then again , people like to use one hand to flip and one hand to hold their soda , so maybe maybe we user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Well with the one-handed design you also have the the problem of the size w 'cause you know from cell phones , they can be too small . industrial designer: if it's small it probably looks better , but may not be th as functional . So for that there's project manager: Okay , so industrial designer: So project manager: unfortunately we've got about five minutes here to come up with our  remote control idea and start rolling with it . What if we had what if we had not only  say we went with the ball the ball function  , but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side s  to make it easier to hold on to . But if we're gonna make it flat on the bottom , then that eliminates our ball anyways . So if it were flat on the bottom and then had the sorta grips on the side here I guess ,  and then flat  And then we have the problem with the hinge . So if we're flat on the bottom , it's not gonna roll away , it'll stay where we want . industrial designer: The question is also , I dunno , d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it ? project manager: that's true . industrial designer: It's probably going to lie around opened all the time anyway , so I don't know if a lid is a good idea . From stabil stability point of view  it certainly is , but also you have to face it and take into account the more of these things break by accident ,  the more we sell . We just have a ball user interface: But then maybe to go back to the to th s something along those things then . What if we flipped it around here , so that it were  Sorry , that doesn't look anything like what you had there . project manager: Course then it's it's like the rectangular again , only with a couple of jutting out points . industrial designer: Question is what makes those game pads functional ? W I think that's pretty much the form for full hand . project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: You know , all project manager: because it doesn't have a cord , like joysticks do . industrial designer: that dif batteries right , and Batteries go weak as well , so  after a while you have to point it towards the  towards the equipment you wanna control with it , right ? So , have to m show which is the front , which is the back . project manager: Is it possible to have it to where it would work with a like a sensor on either side ? So that either way you're pointing it it would work .  industrial designer:  of course it'll be evident after a while or if you look at it , it'll it'll be evident which way around to point it , since you have the the numbers and the and the the buttons and stuff , project manager: True . industrial designer: but  it's rather about an instinctual thing , user interface: Put it industrial designer: like you just grab it , you don't have to s look at it , you know , which way around to point it . user interface: Even if you designed it in some in a way that you know , isn't a rectangle , but still pointed in a direction that had definite points . user interface: and there's your s you kn you know which way you're gonna pointing it . project manager: Okay , well , just to finish up , should we s go with this plan , start making some Are good ideas , what are not . user interface: Does it say what does it say for n industrial designer: Obviously user interface: it says on there what we need to do for the next meeting , I think "

        "Query": "What were the group's thoughts on the safety design, kinetic battery idea, wood case, and shape of the remote control during their discussion on the design and concept decisions?",
        "Summary": "The team reached a consensus that the remote control should have a waterproof design and be baby-proof to prevent any accidents. It was also agreed that the remote should have voice control functionality for children who may not be tall enough to operate it manually. Additionally, a child lock feature was deemed necessary. The group acknowledged the benefits of using a kinetic battery, but cost and reliability were concerns compared to a regular battery. They suggested using a cheaper chip to balance out the cost of the kinetic battery technology. The User Interface team expressed difficulty in keeping the remote small with a wood case, as the Industrial Designer believed it would be prone to breakage. The Project Manager proposed using rubber or plastic instead, considering practicality and ease of cleaning. The idea of creating fruit or vegetable-shaped remotes was discussed, with the understanding that only the exterior shape would change while the PCB remained the same. The team also considered offering customers customizable skins.",
        "Article": "industrial designer: 'S to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your stuff is , marketing: Yeah . project manager: Okay , well marketing: It kinda does make sense , doesn't it , because when we get into the end of meeting we're kind of talking about action and design as opposed to background . project manager: Well how  on the in this meeting then if we  I'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting . project manager: and we decided that it was gonna be non-rechargeable battery-powered , that we're gonna group our audio-visual and other functions into into those categories ,  . And I told you guys about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext , ignoring everything except the T_V_ , and trying to incorporate the the  corporate colour and slogan .  so if we have the three presentations , and then if you have anything to kind of that you know you're gonna want to discuss , maybe just make a note of it , and we'll have all the discussion at the end . project manager: And so if we start off  with Andrew and then Craig and then David , marketing: Okay .  what did  how did we leave it with speech recognition now ? We did we say we were gonna try maybe incorporate it but we hadn't made a definite decision on that ? industrial designer: Oh I should also point out that  the you know the kind of final objective of this meeting is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product .  basically what I wanna do here , before we get into it  too far , is I want to show you all the background information I have that I think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful . marketing: And  and then sorta g go through some of the way that I've dealt with that information , and then sort of bring us all together into it to see sorta see how this fits in with the overall vision .  so I've tried to take a whole lot of market research and summarise it for us , and then ide identify  trends that are are sort of in sync and are important to our our  p project plan that we have so far , and then  initiate a kind of discussion on design options so that it sorta helps us to to narrow in on on aspects that will inform other  other elements of the of the project . marketing: I thought that that will impact on the rest of what we do , so that's why I suggested we get in this . marketing: Okay so out of  different  figures and ratings ob  of people in general ,  consumers in general , the number one thing that was found was that  the br t television remote control , a fancy look and feel , okay , and not , it specified , not a functional look or or feel ,  b f f fancy . marketing:  however , this is where we kinda have to be very , I think , creative about it . Okay so that tells me that we have to find a way to be innovative without a adding just unnecessary  sort of functional bits to it .  and third priority  for ease of use , so again that kind of gives us a general picture of how it has to be ,  quite user friendly while still having technology . So it I'll just say right away as a bit of a foreshadowing into how we proceed with this in terms of m marketing , is that I think  what we should think about is how the  about how the innovation  contributes to the look and feel , and not so much to the functionality of it . marketing: For example like when you pick it up and push it like it all lights up or something , you know what  , like , or it's got something else to it that just seems innovative project manager: -huh . So how do you make innovation make something more more easy to use ? Well that's I guess where we're gonna go with this . marketing: Okay then there's the other aspect of the back the the market  research I have here is on fashion style , okay , which as we've agreed is a priority .  top European fashion trend  that I read about says there's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables , okay , industrial designer: project manager: marketing: especially in clothes and furniture . And when I first saw that I thought  , well do we want to actually try and think about this trend and how we add something to it , or we get right into it , or we completely steer away from it , project manager: Okay okay . marketing: do you know what  ? So my my feeling is that we w do want to observe this trend , but we want to think also about the fact that it sort of has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics .  'cause I think what we're in what we're in is partly sort of home decor , partly something like a computer ,  so I think we might wanna be careful about how you know how quickly we create like a remote control in the shape of an apple or something , project manager: marketing: I think that would be pushing it . industrial designer: marketing: And then in terms of m material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and sort of , you might say ergonomic or or friendly to handle , which is which also in indicated that last year this was this was not the case . So  probably a lot of the competition on the market will be still in last year's mode , so if we try and really capitalise on that , I think that'll be in our favour .  innovative design technology's also a must in that it's seen it'd be seen to be  cutting edge ,  but ease of use t has to be insured throughout . And then at the end there are vibrant natural colours  that's the way I interpreted it anyway , softness in materials , shape , and function , and so I've written at written at the bottom to give us sort of a context of discussion , Mac iPods , project manager: marketing: something which is , I'd have to say very high-tech , ten gigabytes , whatever , but when you hold it in your hand there's like no buttons . marketing: You know what a Mac iPod is ? I'm thinking however Mac iPod is sort of last year's because it's very hard and sort of glassy and glossy , so I'm thinking if we imagine that we're taking some of the features of a Mac iPod and we're then making it s more of like a more of like a comfortable type of or more of like a maybe more vibrant to friendly thing to have .  and then so this is w with all that information what I'm what I'm suggesting in this slide here is that we we take these ideas , and as we get into more the more  techni like sort of production side of things , that we think about shape , materials , and themes or series that go throughout . Sort of like a I dunno like  we think of some kind of a thin theme that unifies it all , that we agree on ,  sorta like a marketing identity . So so like I threw out a few ideas there just to kinda get us thinking along those lines like lemon , lime , I dunno , green colours , pe whatever , it's just an idea , 'cause I'm thinking that some of these ideas will seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their what people associate this them with in terms of texture , shape , colours , things like that . marketing: Like  the ones the ones which I'm most fond of in terms of giving like a theme to it would be like  like lemon or something like that , you know something which is , like you see a lot in in other areas . Like I see lots of websites and things that seem to associate with like lemon and lime and project manager: Okay . marketing: I'm thinking maybe we could incorporate some of these features into a fairly  into something which is which seems to have something to it which is almost gimmicky because like  like something to do with like lighting within it . Like you know just within the simple sense , when you pick up a phone and touch a button it  lights up , q usually the buttons light up . marketing: How can we build on that ? Maybe like it could light up in different colours or something or or people could buy the buy the control and then it comes with different like covers or something so . marketing: but  hopefully we can we can revisit those ideas when we get into project manager: -huh .  there's a wee bit of discussion about the other existing ones there ,  so I've taken the  suggestions from them and tried to incorporate them into this  So then this we're looking for  suggestions on size th  size of control and the buttons ,  the shape of the control , and whereabout the buttons should be located on the control . user interface:  what I found from the research is that most the current controls are just basically big bricks with loads of buttons all over them .  they're not very attractive to look at , and they're not very comfortable to hold , they're I just hold 'em like big bricks , and they're very easily lost .  they tend to be very dark colours , so if there are shadowy places down the side of couches you can't really see them .  I'm not sure if there's any other examples of that , but something to look out for .  there's a problem that I've I've got couple of preferences for the the end control  I get 'em with the the red colour button for stand-by and s the other examples of that  The buttons should be large .  one of the examples given on the homepage was  there's an up and down volume button but both of them have a V_ on them , project manager: user interface: so the up volume button looks like it should be a down volume button , that's kinda confusing .  if the the corporate colour scheme allows it we should have a very bright colour so that it can be easily identified anywhere . user interface:  obviously trying trying to avoid being tacky there , but it could  tie-in very easily with your your lime and lemon idea . Okay , do we have a corporate colour scheme ? project manager: I think it's yellow marketing: I didn't know . project manager: because like the website is yellow and there's a band at the bottom is yellow , marketing: Okay . user interface: any extra features we add beyond the basic ones should be m hidden , they shouldn't be on the  shouldn't be visible without something be opened or some sort of special extra effort . user interface:  if we did decide to go for voice activation there sh should always be a button as alternative , possibly hidden in the the opened up section  making that something is wrong with it or with somebody's voice , maybe they got a cold or  we should definitely avoid the big square block look . user interface: And  we got an email  from I think it's the the research department , and they've said th the voice control  can now talk back if you ask it a question . user interface: So it sh it could be good to have them  confirm any action you take project manager: Aye that's a good idea , yeah .  you say you wanted the the corporate colours , but they don't say you know if we can use any other colours at all or marketing:  . marketing: It's a shame the cable wasn't just in the middle of the table , project manager: I know it'd be handy , wouldn't it . project manager: Do y do you wanna sit in the the line of sight of this  industrial designer: Yeah okay . project manager: marketing: It takes a second , doesn't it ? industrial designer: 'Kay , that should be it . marketing: industrial designer: So just so you guys have some idea of what's involved in my process ,  and then you can just work through it marketing: industrial designer: and we 'll either modify it or start from scratch  depending on what your needs are . industrial designer:  I think , like what you guys said ,  the most input that's needed is basically in the user interface .  like you said time to market was a problem ,  and how many components are physically in there in cost .  and the lower components , the power , the logic , the transmitter , and the infrared ,  they affect you in terms of the size of your device ,  and that would have some inte impact on how y I think more how you hold rather than  the actual use using the the remote control because  like we've said we've defined , like we only want the basic things that to be visible , and the rest of them we try to hide .  these are the options that are available to you ,  I'm not very sure about the voice thing 'cause I got another email and it was in fact quite sketchy on what n the voice options are . industrial designer:  it said it could talk to you , but it never said anything about being able to listen . industrial designer: well I could see the other email that they sent you ,  'cause they got back to me with like different requirements , or different offerings of what components availa Okay so your basic components are buttons , user interface: Right . industrial designer: okay and you have a wheel available , like a mouse scroll wheel , project manager:  . industrial designer: okay there's an L_C_D_ display , marketing: industrial designer:  I think these are quite standard things . marketing: They're standard , aren't they ? industrial designer: No  they're well in the sense that these are all the options available for you . It can actually be flat or it can be curved ,  and then the different types of materials that you can use ,  I don't think you can use them in a combination ,  but  project manager: industrial designer: I could check back for you , but I don't think you can actually use them in a combination . project manager: We you couldn't have like plastic and rubber ? industrial designer:  I think plastic and rubber would be fine , but plastic , rubber , and wood , I wasn't I'm not very sure about the titanium . industrial designer:  the rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source you could use , project manager:  'kay . industrial designer: but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the thing , project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so I think that there is some restriction on  I think you could probably group plastic and rubber together , wood and titanium , project manager: industrial designer: but you know it might be easier from a cost perspective and a complexity just to use one . industrial designer:  and the other components are logic chips ,  again I'll I'll go back to the component chips . The com how complex or how easy the logic is , it depends on how many functions you have on the on the unit  and that impacts cost .  I don't think the logic chip has a issue about size 'cause they should be about the same size . Okay the second one I think is more of a gimmick then actually a useable thing , it's a wind-up you know , a crank . industrial designer: Yeah but that that might be something I think that's more of a look and feel decision because I don't think you can have one power source if you're using the alternative power sources . I think whatever it is you still need a battery 'cause I don't think anybody wants to keep doing one thing . industrial designer: which may not be a great idea in Europe or any country that has seasons 'cause half the year you'd be dead . user interface: industrial designer: So like what I said , you probably need like a battery and something else . industrial designer:  and the kinetic one I guess for me is the most interesting one project manager: industrial designer: because it's movement and people like to fiddle with their and it's a nice sales gimmick I think . industrial designer: From a marketing gimmick it it's a technology thing , marketing: industrial designer: it's a shake it it doesn't work , shake it , knock it or something . industrial designer: you have you had those balls , you know those stress balls where you bounce the ball and it and it lights up and it goes , project manager:  yeah yeah , I see . project manager: marketing: industrial designer: you know that might be a gimmick combined with rubber . industrial designer: You know just to if you get frustrated wi remote control you can throw it , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: my from my role , I don't think that personal preferences but role preferences , I think  something comfortable to hold ,  small and slim marketing: industrial designer: I guess that's more in the sense of small and slim in terms of comfortable not so small you can't , you know like a phone or something , too small phone . industrial designer:  and the other thing is from a production point of view  the less components we use and the simpler the components means you reduce your cost and you increase your profit . industrial designer:  The user interface restrictions basically means that if you use more complicated features , like the buttons are standard okay , the L_C_D_ panel and the scroll wheel you need more complicated logic . industrial designer: Okay with the titanium case , let me just check that  , marketing: industrial designer: titanium case can't be curved , it has to be square . industrial designer: Okay  there's no restriction on the plastic , and marketing: It can't be curved . industrial designer: So that's again , I don't think you can use them in a combination ,  especially the titanium project manager: Okay . Right can I marketing:  question on can I ask a question ? project manager: Yeah well yeah it's just I'm quite keen to get the discussion going with the time we've left so but yeah you c ask away . Can we  power a light in this ? Can we get a strong enough battery to power a light ? industrial designer:  I think we could because the L_C_D_ panel requires power , and the L_C_D_ is a form of a light project manager:  . industrial designer: so that marketing: So maybe one of the things we can just try and include is a really good battery . project manager: Why what kind of light do you want are you thinking of ? marketing: Well  I'm thinking it might be That for  this to be a high-tech thing it's gonna have to have something high-tech about it project manager: -huh . marketing: and that's gonna take battery power , and to make that to make that a realistic goal I think one of the issues that will come up later is , can the battery power it ? industrial designer: Are you thinking are you thinking of of a light in the sense of  a light light , or a light in the sense of it glows kind of you know Frankenstein , it's alive . Well m I'm thinking along the lines of you're you're in the dark watching a D_V_D_ and you  you find the thing in the dark and you go like this , industrial designer: Okay . marketing: and  y you just touch it , or you just pick it up , and it lights up or something . marketing: We're gonna need to put in a really good battery so people don't have to charge their r remote control every few days . industrial designer:  that's why I think the option of the the kinetic thing which basically means as long as you shake it like a watch , like an automatic watch project manager:  . marketing: But are people gonna wanna shake their movie controller ? industrial designer:  it's probably sensitive enough when you fiddle it . industrial designer: like I said the bouncing ball thing , or you could trigger that to use that to power the light project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so when they pick it up , right , and then that that sorta triggers the marketing: Right . project manager: let's just go right back to the marketing ideas for a start , and just giving an id idea on the time , we've got about fifteen minutes to play with at most . So  yeah so just t to bear in mind that the ultimate goal of this meeting is to reach an decision on the the the concepts of the product . project manager: So back to your idea about  incorporating the idea of like fruit and veg , and the corporate colour , and things like that . project manager: Does anybody have any ideas of about how we can fit all that in together ?  that's kind of the user interface type of thing , what are your thoughts on that ? user interface:  I think we could go for like  maybe not a p a fruit shape but a very sort of curvy type shape . project manager: So maybe do y are we thinking something that like s could sit in your hand comfortably , or do you th you'd hold onto comfortably or user interface:  probably something that s sits in your hand comfortably , sort of feels right in your hand . Colour-wise  you made a re  was it you or  I can't remember who made the point about how if you've a nice bright colour you'll not lose it , was that industrial designer: I think he made that . project manager: Whose user interface: marketing: What's that ? project manager: about how if you have a bright colour you'll not lose it so much . project manager:  and when the corporate colour is yellow ,  maybe we could think about about the colour of the whole product being yellow I don't know . project manager: And then obviously the  the materials when it has anybody got like an overall picture in their mind about what what might work ? That's all . marketing: Well  I'm thinking that what we need to do is have something that kind of unifies a lot of the different concepts , project manager: marketing: and if we think that what we are w our number one marketing motive is  the look and feel . marketing: So for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and bits and pieces of of concept and technology or or whatever or fashion , then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all sorta can visualize .  maybe what we could do is t th think about a concept which touches b back to the on the  the colour , project manager:  if we think of something , like I was saying also lime and lemon you know , project manager: marketing: what can we come up with something where we we try and associate it with with like the series . We just come up with something like that we kind of use it as a theme to inspire the project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Is there a particular shape that you're interested in ? Like does marketing have any research on does it need to be long ? marketing: industrial designer: Does it need with a square thing wha project manager: Oh you know like in circular in shape or industrial designer: Yeah 'cause that will n help narrow down the choice of marketing: Yeah . project manager: 'Cause I I I was kinda thinking about as well you know how you get these shock resistant mobile phones , user interface: See I'm project manager: and they're plastic but then also have like rubber on the outside , and it kinda feels it feels kind of warmer to the touch . And then then we could have curved shapes , 'cause wood or titanium , yeah , it's gonna have to be boxy and rectangular and I think we might be moving away from that you know so  Well I'm do we really want it in like the shape of a lemon or marketing: No no no not at all . marketing: It's more more just that we we think about like what it is we're trying to achieve , so and then we have one one sorta theme that we stick with . project manager: Okay right well  marketing: Do you know what  ? project manager: so thoughts about the actual shape of the thing . project manager: A snowman shape ? user interface:  so a p sort of larger bit sits in your hand , and then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need . That's quite a distinctive shape , marketing: Right , project manager: that would be good marketing: sure . project manager: so yeah should we go with that ? marketing:  can we yeah like to and wha like do you have a project manager: Do you wanna draw it on the board ? user interface: marketing: Can you like yeah just t we can visualize it . user interface:  something like that  you got two groups there  maybe it could fold up and you get a third group inside project manager: Ooh that'd be good .  and  colour-wise what does everybody think ? I think it is quite important to get yellow in there somewhere . user interface: So I reckon it'd look quite nice if we just had  this here , had a sorta background yellow , marketing: project manager: -huh .  and also  how are we going to incorporate the slogan in ? The fact that it talks to you ,  it might be quite cool if when you first start using it it says , what is it , putting fashion into electronics or something , I dunno . Or when you like or if you turn it off or something if it can speak if it could actually say the slogan it might be a bit more powerful than just having it written on it somewhere . project manager: I d I d any thoughts on that at all ? user interface: I think that'd probably scare me .  unless an a  if you also would that work if we wanted to incorporate  an L_C_D_ display , where would we put that ? Would we put that on the inside or industrial designer: Do we need an L_C_D_ display ? user interface:  industrial designer: What what's the functionality of that ? project manager: It's bound to increase the cost of it a lot , I would've thought . industrial designer: Yeah but the question is what are we using it marketing: What would it achieve ? industrial designer: what would we what would we achieve from it ? Putting in lights is cheap but putting in an L_C_D_ panel just to make it glow is a bit of a marketing: Well L_C_ well I'd when you used to mention the L_C_D_ I'd think I wonder what that would be about . And the th the thing I could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with  listings . marketing: So as you scroll through , 'cause we said we might have a jog dial , so as you scroll through your stations you can y it actually tells you what it is . I think that will be a problem because we don't have an input device to get the listings into it , marketing: Right , okay . industrial designer:  I I'm not saying there's no need for an L_C_D_ display , but  it's what's what what would it tell the user , project manager: I think that would make it very complex . industrial designer: 'cause the L_C_D_ tends to be an output as  as opposed to an input so  does the remote control need to talk back to the user ? project manager: Yeah . marketing:  not real industrial designer: We have the option of the speaker as well the sa the same thing goes for the speaker , is there a need for the remote control to to talk back ? marketing: project manager: I don't know if there is really , marketing: project manager: no  industrial designer:  project manager: I would say no need for a talk-back . project manager: so you're gonna have the three different sets of of functionalities ,   do you wanna group them into s head of the snowman , body of the snowman , inside of the snowman , is that what you're thinking ? user interface:  well I think the advanced ones the the ones you don't usually use could be hid inside . user interface: B  I think the we had were fairly basic ones , they'd have to go on the the front somewhere . project manager: Okay right  what else do you need to talk about ? marketing: Well i I was just industrial designer: Where would you physically position the buttons ?  I think that that has some impact on on on many things . project manager: So I'm just gonna  pop this in here 'cause I have a slide about decision making which I'd forgotten about .  energy what do you think that's suggesting we're how we're powering the thing ? I really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the back-up of the battery , but have have kinetic power , marketing: Yeah , sure . project manager:  what does anybody think about that ? marketing:  I've had kinetic things before , and the the the one issue we need to keep in mind with them is that you're committing the user to moving it , industrial designer: No , like I said we have a h hybrid kind of thing , so it's not gonna charge the battery , it's just marketing: and watches yeah Sure , okay , right , okay . marketing:  just it's just worth pointing out because like I've I've known I've known people to have kinetic watches that they wear all the time , project manager: marketing: and it's just like magic because it's always powered and there's no battery . I've also known people to have things like like a jewellery watch they wear from time to time , and they eventually just say it's just too much of a nuisance because I don't wear it all the time . marketing: Like remote control is similar , you're away on vacation , I dunno whatever , you something , and it just starts to get worn down . Well I suppose that if you're if you're away and you're not using it , then you're not using any power either . marketing: So we should think about project manager: So you'd have the battery as the kind of to keep it ticking over idea marketing: Yeah . project manager: I'm really sorry we're gonna have to wrap up quite quickly , we don't have as much time as I thought . project manager: Chip on print , is that that's an industrial design thing , is it David ? industrial designer: Yes yes . project manager: Okay  as for the case , kind of discussed that marketing: And this size here , I'd suggest this be small , like quite small . marketing:  just a a lot of the   one of the things running through my mind right now , I realise we're being efficient to wrap up the meeting and have lots of decisions made , project manager: marketing:  but we are leaning quite a bit to the side of being low-tech , rubber buttons plastic frame , it's almost like we're reproducing the same old remote control that's out there . marketing: Should we think about how we are actually getting this high-tech user friendly   theme like what is it that we're u we're using to to achieve those goals ? project manager: Could have things like backlighting the buttons and stuff like that .  you know a a glowing a a glowing yellow type case where the yellow is showable , marketing: Yeah clear , project manager: Aye that would be a good idea . project manager: S so like cur slightly transparent case , so it's yellow , like tinted yellow , but you can maybe see through it . project manager: Is that what you mean ? industrial designer: You know you have cordless mice and they don't eat that much power right . industrial designer: but because the case is transparent so it gives it a little bit of a glow , doesn't make it freaky .  and then the other thing that we we're s we've committed ourselves to achieving is simplicity , and so I'm thinking maybe should we try and think about having something like  some kind of an innovative concept about how the  the volume and the channels are controlled , 'cause that's the main thing people will f wanna do . marketing: Could we use like a jog dial , like a nice just sort of round , somewhere on it where you just roll it ? industrial designer: The question is when you're rolling it , how do you wanna roll it ? marketing: Or industrial designer: Do you want 'em to roll it like that ? Do you want 'em to roll it like that ? 'Cause in a mouse your hand's in a position to roll it , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: whereas the other thing about having it jog dial this way , it tends to get moved accidentally . project manager: Yeah if you are holding it in your hand you could you could do that , couldn't you ? marketing: Well why don't we do it like a mouse then ? project manager: If you're holding it in your hand you could industrial designer: That's a very unnatural motion to project manager: Do you think ? industrial designer: yeah .  it might work for volume , and maybe some of the brightness controls and stuff like that , marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: If you have a Telewest box you've got like , you don't have to buy all the channels , marketing: project manager: okay okay industrial designer:  and I don't think having that you know too quick too slow kin it's confusing to the marketing: Yeah , sure . project manager:  user interface: Well , but then for  for skipping a large amount of channels you do have to  to skip the channel button , the number part . industrial designer: and once they lose out on the user experience they're like Because that's becomes the most accessible thing in front of project manager: Okay . marketing: But that's not a bad thing is it ? project manager: Just marketing: Because when you think about it , the alternative is to go push the button . project manager: we do need to make a decision on whether we want to incorporate a jog dial in nice and quickly .  I'm all for them actually , I think they're quite you know th very quick to m to use . project manager: So does anybody oppose the idea of of incorporating one into the design at all ? No . And the other thing was  can we think of any way of getting the slogan into this thing ? marketing: Yeah like  if we if if we keep coming back to this board here , project manager: -huh . marketing: I wouldn't be surprised if we could take this idea , imagine that , I dunno , that it's within the shape of the hand , it's quite small project manager: -huh ooh okay , we really gotta wrap up marketing: I dunno . It's small , and that we've got like the the l slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side , project manager: Okay well if we can do that , great . marketing: well  isn't that what we just h said said we s just have to decide now ? project manager: Yeah let's let's try and get the slogan on there  , and marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: So you wanna expand the shape of the marketing: And then like a jo And then like a jog dial somewhere that fits in with the shape of it like I dunno like here , in with the industrial designer: That that might have one problem in terms of  in terms of whether you're left handed or you're right handed you might be locking yourself in . industrial designer: Could I just could I just jump in and suggest something quickly ? project manager: Okay . Right I'm gonna have to user interface: marketing: A jog di project manager: I'm really gonna have to hurry you on here 'cause we're we're actually over time . It's kind of yeah project manager: Just for in closing just the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes , and so you can see in the screen here what each of you are gonna hopefully be doing ,  I know that the designers are gonna be working with Play-doh on that . Anything at all you think we haven't discussed that we need to ? Is everybody kind of happy about what they're gonna be doing ? marketing:  industrial designer:  I think one thing would be the jog dial 'cause that's gonna have quite a big impact on the thing  marketing: Yeah I think the jog dial , you know it just after you drew that , what if it was flat and you just spun it , industrial designer: Yeah that's what I was thinking the marketing: that'd be great . industrial designer: There's lots of space for it  project manager: That's kind of a design thing that you guys can can discuss , yeah . industrial designer: Yeah but it's also a a marketing and a function user interface: marketing: Sure , yeah , project manager: Okay . marketing: yeah and materials we sorta said we'd do plastic and rubber , didn't we , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: and I think maybe we should try and stay away from just the big protruding rubber buttons , 'cause that'd just be so standard . project manager: To make something flush with the case ? marketing: Something a bit more flush , yeah , project manager: Okay right . marketing: so that it has and also t plastic I've seen can get really textured , so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand . user interface: marketing: They feel kind of like  , you get pens now and then that you'd think that they were rubber but they're not , industrial designer: No like Yeah yeah . marketing: they're actually just plastic that's textured , industrial designer: Yeah yeah kinda like that yeah . marketing: kind of a little bit like project manager: Okay I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to call this to a close 'cause we're way over time . So  that's really good , like we've s had much to talk about that  pretty much run out of time to do so . marketing: industrial designer: Okay , can I just swipe your power cable , I don't think it matters . Okay lemme okay , I'm gonna pull everybody out first and then put in whoever needs to be left . I'm gonna take the microphones , 'cause it's too lazy t take them off again "

        "Query": "What are the current thoughts on using XML tools and the status of transcription?",
        "Summary": "Summary:\nGrad H mentioned that they were working on standardizing data in XML format, but expressed dissatisfaction with the current format. They were also developing tools to extract information from XML files using Java and Perl. The transcriber pool has been meeting expectations in terms of work completed within the allocated time. Grad D explained the importance of combining different experts in the network to adapt to various situations, suggesting dividing the network into parts and allowing it to determine which experts to trust in each situation. The transcriber pool is making good progress and may be utilized for other coding tasks in the future, such as analyzing speaker overlap. They are also coding non-speech gestures like breaths and laughter to improve recognition results. The group reviewed transcription checking procedures and discussed coordinating data channelization and presegmentation with tighter time bins.",
        "Article": "But  we 're gonna try to make this an abbreviated meeting cuz the the next next occupants were pushing for it , so . Agenda is according to this , is transcription status , DARPA demos XML tools , disks , backups , et cetera and grad h: Does anyone have anything to add to the agenda ? professor b: OK . grad h:  phd d: I g grad h: as a somewhat segue into the next topic ,  could I get a hold of  the data even if it 's not really corrected yet just so I can get the data formats and make sure the information retrieval stuff is working ? postdoc a: Certainly . So I 'll I 'll probably just make some copies of those rather than use the ones that are there . grad h:  and then just we 'll have to remember to delete them once the corrections are made . professor b: OK , wh phd d: I also got anot a short remark to the transcription . I 've  just processed the first five EDU meetings and they are chunked up so they would they probably can be sent to IBM whenever they want them . phd d: but the other ones phd f: That 's the one that we 're waiting to hear from them on . postdoc a: These are separate from the ones that phd f: As soon as postdoc a: these are phd f: They 're the IBM set . And so as soon as we hear from Brian that this one is OK grad h: Is my mike on ? Yeah . phd f: and we get the transcript back and we find out that hopefully there are no problems matching up the transcript with what we gave them , then  we 'll be ready to go and we 'll just send them the next four as a big batch , postdoc a: Excellent . grad h: And so we 're doing those as disjoint from the ones we 're transcribing here ? phd f: Yes , exactly . phd f: We 're sort of doing things in parallel , that way we can get as much done a at once . grad h: Yeah , I think that 's the right way to do it , phd f: Yeah . grad h: Right , which  So I 've been working on using the THISL tools to do information retrieval on meeting data and the THISL tools are there 're two sets , there 's a back - end and a front - end , so the front - end is the user interface and the back - end is the indexing tool and the querying tool . So at least on the one meeting that I had the transcript for  conveniently you can now do information retrieval on it , do type in a a string and get back a list of start - end times for the meeting , phd f: What what kind of  what does that look like ? The string that you type in . phd f: What are you are you are they keywords , or are they ? grad h: Keywords . grad h: Right ? And so and then it munges it to pass it to the THISL IR which uses an SGML - like format for everything . professor b: And then does it play something back or that 's something you 're having to program ? grad h: right now , I have a tool that will do that on a command line using our standard tools , professor b: Yeah . grad h: but my intention is to do a prettier user interface based either So so that 's the other thing I wanted to discuss , is well what should we do for the user interface ? We have two tools that have already been written . grad h:  the other option is Dan did the Tcl - TK THISL GUI front - end for Broadcast News professor b: Yeah . postdoc a: I Can I ask a question ? So  as it stands within the the Channeltrans interface , it 's possible to do a find and a play . So e Are you So you 're adding like  , I don't know ,  are they fuzzy matches or are they  ? grad h: It 's a sort of standard , text - retrieval - based So it 's  term frequency , inverse document frequency scoring . grad h:  and then there are all sorts of metrics for spacing how far apart they have to be and things like that . So it it 's postdoc a: It 's a lot more sophisticated than the  the basically Windows - based grad h: i it 's like doing a Google query or anyth anything else like that . grad h: So i it uses So it pr produces an index ahead of time so you don't you 're not doing a linear search through all the documents . Cuz you can imagine if with if we have the sixty hours ' worth you do wouldn't wanna do a search . grad h:  you have to do preindexing and so that these tools do all that . And so the work to get the front - end to work would be porting it well  to get it to work on the UNIX systems , our side is just rewriting them and modifying them to work for meetings . grad h: So that it understands that they 're different speakers and that it 's one big audio file instead of a bunch of little ones and just sorta things like that . phd f: So what does the user see as the result of the query ? grad h: On which tool ? phd f: THISL . grad h: The THISL GUI tool which is the one that Dan wrote , Tcl - TK phd f: Yeah . grad h:  you type in a query and then you get back a list of hits and you can type on them and listen to them . professor b: Mmm phd f: So if you typed in \" small heads \" or something you could grad h: Right , you 'd get phd f: get back a   something that would let you click and listen to some audio where that phrase had occurred grad h: something You you 'd get to listen to \" beep \" . It 's too bad that that couldn't come into the grad h: You couldn't get a video . phd g: Guess who I practice on ? postdoc a: At some point we 're gonna have to say what that private joke is , that keeps coming up . Yeah , it loo it my my recollection of it is it 's it 's a pretty reasonable  demo sort of format . grad h: And so I think there 'd be minimal effort to get it to work , minimally phd f: That sounds really neat . grad h: and then we 'd wanna add things like query by speaker and by meeting and all that sort of stuff .  Dave Gelbart expressed some interest in working on that so I 'll work with him on it . And it it 's looking pretty good , you know , the fact that I got the query system working . grad h: If we wanna get it to Windows it 's gonna be a little more work because the THISL IR , the information retrieval tool 's  , I had difficulty just compiling them on Solaris . phd f: But you were saying that that the  that there 's that set of tools , Cygnus tools , that grad h: So . grad h: But what those they what those do is provide sort of a BSD compatibility layer , professor b:   phd f: And you have to have all the o grad h: But the problem is that that the THISL tools didn't use anything like Autoconf and so you have the normal porting problems of different header files and th some things are defined and some things aren't and  different compiler work - arounds and so on . So the fact that  it took me a day to get it c to compile under Solaris means it 's probably gonna take me s significantly more than that to get it to compile under Windows . professor b: How about having it run under free BSD ? phd e: Well what you need grad h: Free BSD would probably be easier . phd e: All you need to do is say to Dan \" gee it would be nice if this worked under Autoconf \" and it 'll be done in a day . phd d:  phd e: Right ? grad h: Actually you know I should check because he did port it to SPRACHcore phd e: Right . professor b: So grad h: I 'll check at that professor b: But it would what would serve would serve both purposes , is if you contact him and ask him if he 's already done it . phd e: What I phd f: How does it play ? grad h: Yeah , right . professor b: If he has then you learn , if he hasn't then he 'll do it . So , and I 've been corresponding with Dan and also with   , SoftSound guy ,  postdoc a: It 's amazing . professor b: Tony Robinson ? phd f: Tony Robinson ? grad h: Do  Tony ? I guess I do . grad h: Which one do  ? phd e: Steve Renals is not SoftSound , is he ? professor b: No . grad h: so that 's all going pretty well , professor b: Assuming we 're phd e: Right . phd f: What about issues of playing sound files @ @ between the two platforms ? grad h: I think we 'll be OK with that . phd e: Why don't you try and merge Transcriber and THISL IR ? They 're both Tcl interfaces . grad h: Well this is one of the reasons This is the one of the reasons that I 'm gonna have  Dave Gelbart Gelbart Having him volunteer to work on it is a really good thing because he 's worked on the Transcriber stuff phd e: Right . But the point is that the Transcriber uses Snack and then you can but you can use a a lot of the same functionality and it 's grad h: Yeah , yeah , I I think THISL THISL GUI probably uses Snack . Well my thought was is that it would be nice it would be nice to have the running transcripts  eh you know , from speaker to speaker . grad h: And if it doesn't phd e: Right ? Do you have you have , you know , a speaker mark here and a speaker mark here ? grad h: Right , we 'll have to figure out a user interface for that , so . It might be fairly difficult to get that to work in the little short segments we 'd be talking about and having the search tools and so on . grad h: but professor b: The thing I was asking about with , free BSD is that it might be easier to get PowerPoint shows running in free BSD than to get this other package running in grad h: Yeah ,  we have to I have to sit down and try it before I make too many judgments , professor b: Yeah . grad h: so   My experience with the Gnu compatibility library is really it 's just as hard and just as easy to port to any system . grad h: It 's just , you know , just like all of them , the \" include \" files are a little different and the function calls are a little different . grad h: So I it might be a little easier but it 's not gonna be a lot easier . So there was that demo , which was one of the main ones , then we talked about  some other stuff which would basically be  showing off the the Transcriber interface itself and as you say , maybe we could even merge those in some sense , but but  ,  and part of that was showing off what the speech - non  nonspeech stuff that Thilo has done s looks like . postdoc a: Can I ask one more thing about THISL ? So with the IR stuff then you end up with a somewhat prioritized  ? grad h:   phd g: So another idea I w t had just now actually for the demo was whether it might be of interest to sh to show some of the prosody  work that Don 's been doing . phd g:  actually show some of the features and then show for instance a task like finding sentence boundaries or finding turn boundaries . professor b: Well I think at at the very least we 're gonna want something illustrative with that phd g: I don't know if that would be of interest or not . professor b: cuz I 'm gonna want to talk about it and so i if there 's something that shows it graphically it 's much better than me just having a bullet point phd g: Yeah . professor b: pointing at something I don't know much about , phd g: you 're looking at this now professor b: so . phd g: Are you looking at Waves or Matlab ? grad c:  yeah I 'm starting to and  Yeah we can probably find some examples of different type of prosodic events going on . phd g: Yeah def professor b: S so when we here were having this demo meeting , what we 're sort of coming up with is that we wanna have all these pieces together , to first order , by the end of the month phd g: I professor b: and then that 'll give us a week or so . The end of phd g: Oh , the end of this month or next month ? Oh , you mean like today ? grad h: This month . professor b:  that 'll that 'll give us that 'll give us a week or so to  to port things over to my laptop and make sure that works , phd e: Exactly . phd g: Yeah if d if Don can sort of talk to whoever 's professor b: Yeah . phd g: cuz we 're doing this anyway as part of our you know , the research , visualizing what these features are doing professor b: Yeah . professor b: so  , you know , to let s the goal is to let them know what it is we 're doing . professor b: So that 's phd g: I don't think anyone has done this on meeting data so it might be neat , you know . So I 've been doing a bunch of XML tools where you we 're sort of moving to XML as the general format for everything and I think that 's definitely the right way to go because there are a lot of tools that let you do extraction and reformatting of XML tools . So yet again we should probably meet to talk about transcription formats in XML because I 'm not particularly happy with what we have now .  it works with Transcriber but it it 's a pain to use it in other tools  because it doesn't mark start and end .  , but I 've installed XML tools of various sorts in various languages and so if people are interested in doing extracting any information from any of these files , either  information on users because the user database is that way I 'm converting the Key files to XML so that you can extract m  various inf  sorted information on individual meetings grad c: Cool . And so l just let me know there it 's mostly Java and Perl but we can get other languages too if if that 's desirable . Is do we have the the seat information ? In in the Key files now ? postdoc a:   grad h: The seat information is on the Key files for the ones which postdoc a: Ah . phd g: Oh in For the new one grad h: it 's been recorded , phd g: OK . phd g: I 'm just trying to figure out , you know , when Morgan 's voice appears on someone 's microphone are they next to him or are they across from him ? professor b: Yeah . phd f: how how w eh where is it in the Key file ? grad h: Right . phd g: Cuz  I haven't been putting it in and in by grad h: You haven't been putting it in . postdoc a: Isn't it always on the digits ? professor b: Some of these are missing . phd g: And professor b: Aren't they ? postdoc a: Isn't it always on the digits forms ? professor b: Some fall out of phd g: Well it grad h: Yeah so we can go back and fill them in for the ones we have . phd g:  they 're on th right , these , but I just hadn't ever been putting it in the Key files . phd f: Yeah I I never phd g: And I don't think Chuck was either phd f: I never knew we were supposed to put it in the Key file . phd g: cuz grad h: I had told you guys about it phd f: Oh really ? phd g: Oh , so we 're both sorry . grad h: but phd g: So grad h:  this is why I wanna use a g a tool to do it rather than the plain text phd g: OK . grad h: I think it 's Edit - key , command Did I show you guys that ? phd d: Yep . phd f: You mentioned it , grad h: I did show it to you , phd f: yeah . grad h: but I think you both said \" no , you 'll just use text file \" . grad h: Yeah , and so if you don't fill it in , you 're not gonna get it in the meetings . grad c: u grad h: Yeah and then the other thing also that Thilo noticed is , on the microphone , on channel zero it says hand - held mike or Crown mike , phd g: Yeah . phd g: maybe I forgot to d phd f: Takes me no time at all to edit these . grad h: Yeah that 's cuz you kn phd f: I 'm not doing anything . phd g: And I was I was looking at Chuck 's , like , \" oh what did Chuck do , OK I 'll do that \" . grad h: And then  also in a couple of places instead of filling the participants under \" participants \" they were filled in under \" description \" . Oh  also I 'm working on another version of this tool , the the one that shows up here , that will flash yellow if the mike isn't connected . And it 's not quite ready to go yet because  it 's hard to tell whether the mike 's connected or not because the best quality ones , the Crown ones , are about the same level if they 're off and no one 's o off or if they 're on and no one 's talking . So I 'm working on that and it it sorta works and so eventually we will change to that and then you 'll be able to see graphically if your mike is dropping in or out . grad c: Will that also include like batteries dying ? Just a any time the mike 's putting out zeros basically . phd f: But with the screensaver kicking in , it phd d: But grad h: Now phd d: y yeah . grad h:  the other thing is as I 've said before , it is actually on the thing . postdoc a: It would be nice if if these had little light indicators , little L E Ds for grad h:  buzzer . grad h: \" Bamp , bamp ! \" professor b: Small shocks postdoc a: Yeah . Oh grad h: OK , disk backup , et cetera ?  I spoke with Dave Johnson about putting all the Meeting Recorder stuff on non - backed - up disk to save the overhead of backup and he pretty much said \" yeah , you could do that if you want \" but he thought it was a bad idea . In fact what he said is doing the manual one , doing  NW archive to copy it is a good idea and we should do that and have it backed up . grad h: And so if a mistake is made and we lose the backup we should have the archive and if then a mistake is made and we lose the archive we should have the backup . professor b: Well I guess it is true that even with something that 's backed up it 's not gonna if it 's stationary it 's not going to go through the increment it 's not gonna burden things in the incremental backups . But he said that that we sh shouldn't worry too much about that , that we 're getting a new backup system and we 're far enough away from saturation on full backups that it 's w probably OK . professor b: Really ? grad h: And  , so the only issue here is the timing between getting more disks and  recording meetings . professor b: So I guess the idea is that we would be reserving the non - backed - up space for things that took less than twenty - four hours to recreate or something like that , right ? grad h: Things that are recreatable easily and also Yeah , basically things that are recreatable . professor b: Well I was allowing someone else to come up with something related that they had  phd e: I thought you guys were gonna burn C Ds ? grad h:  unfortunately we could burn C Ds but first of all it 's a pain . grad h: Because you have to copy it down to the PC and then burn it and that 's a multi - step procedure . And second of all the the write - once burners as opposed to a professional press don't last . grad h: So I think burning them for distribution is fine but burning them for backup is not a good idea . Can I add one top topic ? We have time ? I wanted to ask , I know that  that Thilo you were , bringing the Channeltrans interface onto the Windows machine ? And I wanted to know is th phd d: Yeah it 's it Basically it 's done , postdoc a: It 's all done ? That 's g wonderful . grad h: Yes , since Tcl - TK runs on it , basically things 'll just work . phd d: Yeah it Yeah , it was just a problem with the Snack version and the Transcriber version but it 's solved . Does this mean that the that this could be por  ported to a Think - Pad note or some other type of  phd d: Yeah , basically  I did install it on my laptop and yeah postdoc a: Wonderful . CrossPads ? CrossPads ? grad h:  got an email from  James Landay who basically said \" if you 're not using them , could you return them ? \" So he said he doesn't need them , he just periodically w at the end of each term sends out email to everyone who was recorded as having them and asks them if they 're still using them . professor b: Once ? grad h: We we used them a couple times , postdoc a:   phd f: Them ? There 's more than one ? grad h: but postdoc a: Yeah . professor b: But grad h: My opinion on it is , first , I never take notes anyway so I 'm not gonna use it ,  and second , it 's another level of infrastructure that we have to deal with . postdoc a: And I have  so my my feeling on it is that I think in principle it 's a really nice idea , and you have the time tags which makes it better tha than just taking ra raw notes . On the other hand , I the down side for me was that I think the pen is really noisy . And I and I don't know if it 's audible on the but I I sort of thought that was a disadvantage . I do take notes , I could be taking notes on these things and I guess the plus with the CrossPads would be the time markings but I don't know . phd d: what is a CrossPad ? professor b: So it 's it 's  it 's a regular pad , just a regular pad of paper but there 's this pen which indicates position . grad h: And then you can download it and they have OCR and searching and all sorts of things . grad h: But I don't take notes , professor b: And one of the reasons that it was brought up originally was because  we were interested in in higher - level things , grad h: so . professor b: not just the , you know , microphone stuff but also summarization and so forth and the question is if you were going to go to some gold standard of what wa what was it that happened in the meeting you know , where would it come from ? And  I think that was one of the things , phd d: Yeah . We 'll have a you know , have a scribe , have somebody  take good notes and then that 's part of the record of the meeting . And then we did it once or twice and we sort of grad h: Yep , and then just sort of died out . professor b: probably chose the wrong scribe but it was It 's  phd g:  grad h: Yeah that 's right . postdoc a: u but I guess the the other thing I 'm thinking is if we wanted that kind of thing I wonder if we 'd lose that much by having someone be a scribe by listening to the tape , to the recording afterwards and taking notes in some other interface . phd f:  we 're transcribing it anyways , why do we need notes ? postdoc a: Oh it 's la it 's useful , grad h: Because that 's summary . phd g: I think there 's also there 's this use that phd f: Summarize it from the transcription . phd g: the Well , what if you 're sitting there and you just wanna make an X and you don't wanna take notes and you 're you just wanna phd f: Doodle . phd g: get the summary of the transcript from this time location like you know , and and then while you 're bored you don't do anything and once in a while , maybe there 's a joke and you put a X and But in in other words you can use that just to highlight times in a very simple way . Also with I was thinking and I know Morgan disagrees with me on this but suppose you have a group in here and you wanna let them note whenever they think there might be something later that they might not wanna distribute in terms of content , they could just sort of make an X near that point or a question mark that sort of alerts them that when they get the transcript back they c could get some red flags in that transcript region and they can then look at it . I know we haven't been using it but I w I can imagine it being useful just for sort of marking time periods grad h: Right . professor b: I guess so , you know , what what makes one think i is maybe we should actually schedule some periods where people go over something later phd g: so . professor b: and and and put some kind of summary or something  you know , some there 'd be some scribe who would actually listen , w who 'd agreed to actually listen to the whole thing , not transcribe it , but just sort of write down things that struck them as important . But then you don't you don't have the time reference  that you 'd have if you had it live . And you don't have a lot of other cues that might be useful , professor b: Yeah . phd f: How do you synchronize the time in the CrossPad and the time of the recording ? phd g: so . grad h:  that was one of the issues we talked about originally and that that 's w part of the difficulty is that we need an infrastructure for using the time the CrossPads and so that means synchronizing the time phd g:  postdoc a:   grad h: You know you want it pretty close and there 's a fair amount of skew because it 's a hand - held unit with a battery postdoc a: Well when when I d grad h: and so you postdoc a: OK . grad h: so you have to synchronize at the beginning of each meeting all the pads that are being used , so that it 's synchronized with the time on that and then you have to download to an application , and then you have to figure out what the data formats are and convert it over if you wanna do anything with this information . phd e: Why grad h: And so there 's a lot of infrastructure which postdoc a: There is an alternative . grad h: unless someone postdoc a: There is an alternative , it 's still , there 's  you know , your point stands about there be needing to be an infrastructure , but it doesn't have to be synchronized with the little clock 's timer on it . You c  , I when I when I did it I synchronized it by voice , by whispering \" one , two , three , four \" onto the microphone grad h:  . grad h: Well , but then there 's the infrastructure at the other end phd e: Right . grad h: which someone has to listen to that and find that point , postdoc a: Yeah , it 's transcribed . phd g: Well , could we keep one of these things for another year ? Would h  is there a big cau grad h: We can keep all both of them for the whole whole year . phd g: just just in case we grad h: it 's just phd g: even maybe some of the transcribers who might be wanting to annotate  f just there 's a bunch of things that might be neat to do but I it might not be the case that we can actually synchronize them and then do all the infrastructure but we could at least try it out . professor b: Well one thing that we might try  is on some set of meetings , some collection of meetings , maybe EDU is the right one or maybe something else , we we get somebody to buy into the idea of doing this as part of the task . professor b:  part of the reason I think part of the reason that Adam was so interested in  the SpeechCorder sort of f idea from the beginning is he said from the beginning he hated taking notes and grad h: Yep . professor b: and so forth so and and Jane is more into it but eh  you know I don't know if you wanna really do do this all the time so I think the thing is to to get someone to actually buy into it and have at least some series of meetings where we do it . The p the the problem with the the more extended view , all these other you know with  quibbling about particular applications of it is that it looks like it 's hard to get people to   routinely use it ,  it just hasn't happened anyway . But maybe if we can get a person to phd g: Yeah I don't think it has to be part of a what everybody does in a meeting but it might be a useful , neat part of the project that we can , you know , show off as a mechanism for synchronizing events in time that happen that you just wanna make a note of , like what Jane was talking about with some later browsing , just just as a convenience , even if it 's not a full - blown note taking substitute . phd e: Well if you wanted to do that maybe the right architecture for it is to get a PDA with a wireless card . And and that way you can synchronize very easily with the the the meeting because you 'll be synchroni you can synchronize with the the Linux server and  phd g: So what kind of input would you be ? phd e: so so , if you 're not worried about grad h: Buttons . phd g: You 'd just be pressing like a a phd e: Well well you have a PDA and may and you could have the same sort of X interface or whatever , you 'd have to do a little eh a little bit of coding to do it . phd e: if if all you really wanted was you didn't want this secondary note - taking channel but just sort of being able to use m markers of some sort , a PDA with a l a wireless card would be the probably the right way to go . grad h:  for what what you 've been describing buttons would be even more convenient than anything else , phd g: M right . grad h: right ? You have the phd g: I don't have , you know , grandiose ideas in mind but I 'm just sort of thinking well we 've we 're getting into the next year now and we have a lot of these things worked out at in terms of the speech maybe somebody will be interested in this and postdoc a: I like this PDA idea . professor b: where like one one button was \"  - oh \" and then another button was \" that 's great \" and another button \" that 's f \" phd g: Or like this is my \" I 'm supposed to do this \" kind of button , postdoc a: Yeah . phd g: Yeah something like that or postdoc a: And then grad h:  I think the CrossPad idea is a good one . grad h: It 's just a question of getting people to use it and getting the infrastructure set up in such a way that it 's not a lot of extra work .  that 's part of the reason why it hasn't happened is that it 's been a lot of extra work for me phd g: Yeah . grad h: and postdoc a: But it 's also , it has this problem of having to go from an analog to a d a digital record too , phd g: W postdoc a: doesn't it ?  grad h: Well it 's digital but it 's in a format that is not particularly standard . postdoc a: But  , say , if i if if you 're writing if you 're writing notes in it does it it can't do handwriting recognition , right ? professor b: No , no , but it 's just it 's just storing the pixel informa position information , postdoc a: OK . postdoc a: I I guess what I 'm thinking is that the PDA solution you h you have it already without needing to go from the pixelization to a to a  professor b: Right . You don't have to phd e: The transfer function is less errorful , postdoc a: Oh , nicely put . phd g: Well it also it 's maybe realistic cuz people are supposed to be bringing their P D As to the meeting eventually , right ? That 's why we have this little I don't know what I don't wanna cause more work for anyone but I can imagine some interesting things that you could do with it and so if we don't have to return it and we can keep it for a year I don't know . grad h: Well w we don't we certainly don't have to return it , as I said . All all he said is that if you 're not using it could you return it , if you are using it feel free to keep it . The point is that we haven't used it at all and are we going to ? professor b: So we have no but  by I I would suggest you return one . phd g: We c professor b: We have some aspirations of using them phd g: One would probably be fine . professor b: and phd g: Maybe we could do like a student project , you know , maybe someone who wants to do this as their main like s project for something would be cool .  if we had them out and sitting on the table people might use them a little more professor b: Maybe Jeremy could sit in some meetings and press a button when there when when somebody laughed . grad h: although there is a little phd g: Well , I 'm yeah , that 's not a bad professor b: Yeah , yeah . phd g: Jeremy 's gonna be an he 's a new student starting on modeling brea breath and laughter , actually , which sounds funny but I think it should be cool , professor b: Yeah . phd g: You 're you 're gonna tease me ? grad h: Oh , equipment . grad h: And then at the same time I 'll probably rewire the room as per Jane 's suggestion so that  the first N channels are wireless , eh are the m the close - talking and the next N are far - field . professor b: You know what he means but isn't that funny sounding ? \" We ordered more wireless . \" It 's like wires are the things so you 're wiring you 're you 're you we 're we ordered more absence of the thing . phd g: I just it 's sort of a anachronism ,  it 's like It 's great . professor b:  there 's there 's all this stuff going on  between  Andreas and and and Dave and Chuck and others with various kinds of runs   recognition runs , trying to figure things out about the features but it 's it 's all sort of in process , so there 's not much to say right now . grad h: So just the transcript number and then the then the phd e: This is Yes , this is number two for me today . professor b: See all you have to do is go away to move way up in the phd e: Oh . grad h: Should we do simultaneous ? phd g: Well , I 'm just thinking , are you gonna try to save the data before this next group comes in ? professor b: Yeah . phd g: You have to plug your ears , by the way  Eric , grad h: Well I have to , phd d: You don't have to "

        "Summary": "To ensure accuracy, a small percentage of transcripts will be modified to correct any misread or uncorrected digits. In order to establish consistent links between speakers and their corresponding identification tags, a speaker database will be compiled. The initial test set of digits has been completed, consisting of 4,000 lines with each line containing 1-10 digits. To explore different prosodic groupings of numbers, new digit forms were distributed. The group also discussed new naming conventions to facilitate the sorting process. In order to standardize file names, existing files will be modified to have equal lengths. Similar changes will be made to speaker identification tags. Additionally, files will include information specifying the channel, microphone, and broadcaster details. PhD F suggested recording different meetings with the same group to aid in tasks like summarization, while Professor D advocated for random meeting participants to ensure diversity for acoustical research purposes.",
        "Article": "But  we 're gonna try to make this an abbreviated meeting cuz the the next next occupants were pushing for it , so . Agenda is according to this , is transcription status , DARPA demos XML tools , disks , backups , et cetera and grad h: Does anyone have anything to add to the agenda ? professor b: OK . grad h:  phd d: I g grad h: as a somewhat segue into the next topic ,  could I get a hold of  the data even if it 's not really corrected yet just so I can get the data formats and make sure the information retrieval stuff is working ? postdoc a: Certainly . So I 'll I 'll probably just make some copies of those rather than use the ones that are there . grad h:  and then just we 'll have to remember to delete them once the corrections are made . professor b: OK , wh phd d: I also got anot a short remark to the transcription . I 've  just processed the first five EDU meetings and they are chunked up so they would they probably can be sent to IBM whenever they want them . phd d: but the other ones phd f: That 's the one that we 're waiting to hear from them on . postdoc a: These are separate from the ones that phd f: As soon as postdoc a: these are phd f: They 're the IBM set . And so as soon as we hear from Brian that this one is OK grad h: Is my mike on ? Yeah . phd f: and we get the transcript back and we find out that hopefully there are no problems matching up the transcript with what we gave them , then  we 'll be ready to go and we 'll just send them the next four as a big batch , postdoc a: Excellent . grad h: And so we 're doing those as disjoint from the ones we 're transcribing here ? phd f: Yes , exactly . phd f: We 're sort of doing things in parallel , that way we can get as much done a at once . grad h: Yeah , I think that 's the right way to do it , phd f: Yeah . grad h: Right , which  So I 've been working on using the THISL tools to do information retrieval on meeting data and the THISL tools are there 're two sets , there 's a back - end and a front - end , so the front - end is the user interface and the back - end is the indexing tool and the querying tool . So at least on the one meeting that I had the transcript for  conveniently you can now do information retrieval on it , do type in a a string and get back a list of start - end times for the meeting , phd f: What what kind of  what does that look like ? The string that you type in . phd f: What are you are you are they keywords , or are they ? grad h: Keywords . grad h: Right ? And so and then it munges it to pass it to the THISL IR which uses an SGML - like format for everything . professor b: And then does it play something back or that 's something you 're having to program ? grad h: right now , I have a tool that will do that on a command line using our standard tools , professor b: Yeah . grad h: but my intention is to do a prettier user interface based either So so that 's the other thing I wanted to discuss , is well what should we do for the user interface ? We have two tools that have already been written . grad h:  the other option is Dan did the Tcl - TK THISL GUI front - end for Broadcast News professor b: Yeah . postdoc a: I Can I ask a question ? So  as it stands within the the Channeltrans interface , it 's possible to do a find and a play . So e Are you So you 're adding like  , I don't know ,  are they fuzzy matches or are they  ? grad h: It 's a sort of standard , text - retrieval - based So it 's  term frequency , inverse document frequency scoring . grad h:  and then there are all sorts of metrics for spacing how far apart they have to be and things like that . So it it 's postdoc a: It 's a lot more sophisticated than the  the basically Windows - based grad h: i it 's like doing a Google query or anyth anything else like that . grad h: So i it uses So it pr produces an index ahead of time so you don't you 're not doing a linear search through all the documents . Cuz you can imagine if with if we have the sixty hours ' worth you do wouldn't wanna do a search . grad h:  you have to do preindexing and so that these tools do all that . And so the work to get the front - end to work would be porting it well  to get it to work on the UNIX systems , our side is just rewriting them and modifying them to work for meetings . grad h: So that it understands that they 're different speakers and that it 's one big audio file instead of a bunch of little ones and just sorta things like that . phd f: So what does the user see as the result of the query ? grad h: On which tool ? phd f: THISL . grad h: The THISL GUI tool which is the one that Dan wrote , Tcl - TK phd f: Yeah . grad h:  you type in a query and then you get back a list of hits and you can type on them and listen to them . professor b: Mmm phd f: So if you typed in \" small heads \" or something you could grad h: Right , you 'd get phd f: get back a   something that would let you click and listen to some audio where that phrase had occurred grad h: something You you 'd get to listen to \" beep \" . It 's too bad that that couldn't come into the grad h: You couldn't get a video . phd g: Guess who I practice on ? postdoc a: At some point we 're gonna have to say what that private joke is , that keeps coming up . Yeah , it loo it my my recollection of it is it 's it 's a pretty reasonable  demo sort of format . grad h: And so I think there 'd be minimal effort to get it to work , minimally phd f: That sounds really neat . grad h: and then we 'd wanna add things like query by speaker and by meeting and all that sort of stuff .  Dave Gelbart expressed some interest in working on that so I 'll work with him on it . And it it 's looking pretty good , you know , the fact that I got the query system working . grad h: If we wanna get it to Windows it 's gonna be a little more work because the THISL IR , the information retrieval tool 's  , I had difficulty just compiling them on Solaris . phd f: But you were saying that that the  that there 's that set of tools , Cygnus tools , that grad h: So . grad h: But what those they what those do is provide sort of a BSD compatibility layer , professor b:   phd f: And you have to have all the o grad h: But the problem is that that the THISL tools didn't use anything like Autoconf and so you have the normal porting problems of different header files and th some things are defined and some things aren't and  different compiler work - arounds and so on . So the fact that  it took me a day to get it c to compile under Solaris means it 's probably gonna take me s significantly more than that to get it to compile under Windows . professor b: How about having it run under free BSD ? phd e: Well what you need grad h: Free BSD would probably be easier . phd e: All you need to do is say to Dan \" gee it would be nice if this worked under Autoconf \" and it 'll be done in a day . phd d:  phd e: Right ? grad h: Actually you know I should check because he did port it to SPRACHcore phd e: Right . professor b: So grad h: I 'll check at that professor b: But it would what would serve would serve both purposes , is if you contact him and ask him if he 's already done it . phd e: What I phd f: How does it play ? grad h: Yeah , right . professor b: If he has then you learn , if he hasn't then he 'll do it . So , and I 've been corresponding with Dan and also with   , SoftSound guy ,  postdoc a: It 's amazing . professor b: Tony Robinson ? phd f: Tony Robinson ? grad h: Do  Tony ? I guess I do . grad h: Which one do  ? phd e: Steve Renals is not SoftSound , is he ? professor b: No . grad h: so that 's all going pretty well , professor b: Assuming we 're phd e: Right . phd f: What about issues of playing sound files @ @ between the two platforms ? grad h: I think we 'll be OK with that . phd e: Why don't you try and merge Transcriber and THISL IR ? They 're both Tcl interfaces . grad h: Well this is one of the reasons This is the one of the reasons that I 'm gonna have  Dave Gelbart Gelbart Having him volunteer to work on it is a really good thing because he 's worked on the Transcriber stuff phd e: Right . But the point is that the Transcriber uses Snack and then you can but you can use a a lot of the same functionality and it 's grad h: Yeah , yeah , I I think THISL THISL GUI probably uses Snack . Well my thought was is that it would be nice it would be nice to have the running transcripts  eh you know , from speaker to speaker . grad h: And if it doesn't phd e: Right ? Do you have you have , you know , a speaker mark here and a speaker mark here ? grad h: Right , we 'll have to figure out a user interface for that , so . It might be fairly difficult to get that to work in the little short segments we 'd be talking about and having the search tools and so on . grad h: but professor b: The thing I was asking about with , free BSD is that it might be easier to get PowerPoint shows running in free BSD than to get this other package running in grad h: Yeah ,  we have to I have to sit down and try it before I make too many judgments , professor b: Yeah . grad h: so   My experience with the Gnu compatibility library is really it 's just as hard and just as easy to port to any system . grad h: It 's just , you know , just like all of them , the \" include \" files are a little different and the function calls are a little different . grad h: So I it might be a little easier but it 's not gonna be a lot easier . So there was that demo , which was one of the main ones , then we talked about  some other stuff which would basically be  showing off the the Transcriber interface itself and as you say , maybe we could even merge those in some sense , but but  ,  and part of that was showing off what the speech - non  nonspeech stuff that Thilo has done s looks like . postdoc a: Can I ask one more thing about THISL ? So with the IR stuff then you end up with a somewhat prioritized  ? grad h:   phd g: So another idea I w t had just now actually for the demo was whether it might be of interest to sh to show some of the prosody  work that Don 's been doing . phd g:  actually show some of the features and then show for instance a task like finding sentence boundaries or finding turn boundaries . professor b: Well I think at at the very least we 're gonna want something illustrative with that phd g: I don't know if that would be of interest or not . professor b: cuz I 'm gonna want to talk about it and so i if there 's something that shows it graphically it 's much better than me just having a bullet point phd g: Yeah . professor b: pointing at something I don't know much about , phd g: you 're looking at this now professor b: so . phd g: Are you looking at Waves or Matlab ? grad c:  yeah I 'm starting to and  Yeah we can probably find some examples of different type of prosodic events going on . phd g: Yeah def professor b: S so when we here were having this demo meeting , what we 're sort of coming up with is that we wanna have all these pieces together , to first order , by the end of the month phd g: I professor b: and then that 'll give us a week or so . The end of phd g: Oh , the end of this month or next month ? Oh , you mean like today ? grad h: This month . professor b:  that 'll that 'll give us that 'll give us a week or so to  to port things over to my laptop and make sure that works , phd e: Exactly . phd g: Yeah if d if Don can sort of talk to whoever 's professor b: Yeah . phd g: cuz we 're doing this anyway as part of our you know , the research , visualizing what these features are doing professor b: Yeah . professor b: so  , you know , to let s the goal is to let them know what it is we 're doing . professor b: So that 's phd g: I don't think anyone has done this on meeting data so it might be neat , you know . So I 've been doing a bunch of XML tools where you we 're sort of moving to XML as the general format for everything and I think that 's definitely the right way to go because there are a lot of tools that let you do extraction and reformatting of XML tools . So yet again we should probably meet to talk about transcription formats in XML because I 'm not particularly happy with what we have now .  it works with Transcriber but it it 's a pain to use it in other tools  because it doesn't mark start and end .  , but I 've installed XML tools of various sorts in various languages and so if people are interested in doing extracting any information from any of these files , either  information on users because the user database is that way I 'm converting the Key files to XML so that you can extract m  various inf  sorted information on individual meetings grad c: Cool . And so l just let me know there it 's mostly Java and Perl but we can get other languages too if if that 's desirable . Is do we have the the seat information ? In in the Key files now ? postdoc a:   grad h: The seat information is on the Key files for the ones which postdoc a: Ah . phd g: Oh in For the new one grad h: it 's been recorded , phd g: OK . phd g: I 'm just trying to figure out , you know , when Morgan 's voice appears on someone 's microphone are they next to him or are they across from him ? professor b: Yeah . phd f: how how w eh where is it in the Key file ? grad h: Right . phd g: Cuz  I haven't been putting it in and in by grad h: You haven't been putting it in . postdoc a: Isn't it always on the digits ? professor b: Some of these are missing . phd g: And professor b: Aren't they ? postdoc a: Isn't it always on the digits forms ? professor b: Some fall out of phd g: Well it grad h: Yeah so we can go back and fill them in for the ones we have . phd g:  they 're on th right , these , but I just hadn't ever been putting it in the Key files . phd f: Yeah I I never phd g: And I don't think Chuck was either phd f: I never knew we were supposed to put it in the Key file . phd g: cuz grad h: I had told you guys about it phd f: Oh really ? phd g: Oh , so we 're both sorry . grad h: but phd g: So grad h:  this is why I wanna use a g a tool to do it rather than the plain text phd g: OK . grad h: I think it 's Edit - key , command Did I show you guys that ? phd d: Yep . phd f: You mentioned it , grad h: I did show it to you , phd f: yeah . grad h: but I think you both said \" no , you 'll just use text file \" . grad h: Yeah , and so if you don't fill it in , you 're not gonna get it in the meetings . grad c: u grad h: Yeah and then the other thing also that Thilo noticed is , on the microphone , on channel zero it says hand - held mike or Crown mike , phd g: Yeah . phd g: maybe I forgot to d phd f: Takes me no time at all to edit these . grad h: Yeah that 's cuz you kn phd f: I 'm not doing anything . phd g: And I was I was looking at Chuck 's , like , \" oh what did Chuck do , OK I 'll do that \" . grad h: And then  also in a couple of places instead of filling the participants under \" participants \" they were filled in under \" description \" . Oh  also I 'm working on another version of this tool , the the one that shows up here , that will flash yellow if the mike isn't connected . And it 's not quite ready to go yet because  it 's hard to tell whether the mike 's connected or not because the best quality ones , the Crown ones , are about the same level if they 're off and no one 's o off or if they 're on and no one 's talking . So I 'm working on that and it it sorta works and so eventually we will change to that and then you 'll be able to see graphically if your mike is dropping in or out . grad c: Will that also include like batteries dying ? Just a any time the mike 's putting out zeros basically . phd f: But with the screensaver kicking in , it phd d: But grad h: Now phd d: y yeah . grad h:  the other thing is as I 've said before , it is actually on the thing . postdoc a: It would be nice if if these had little light indicators , little L E Ds for grad h:  buzzer . grad h: \" Bamp , bamp ! \" professor b: Small shocks postdoc a: Yeah . Oh grad h: OK , disk backup , et cetera ?  I spoke with Dave Johnson about putting all the Meeting Recorder stuff on non - backed - up disk to save the overhead of backup and he pretty much said \" yeah , you could do that if you want \" but he thought it was a bad idea . In fact what he said is doing the manual one , doing  NW archive to copy it is a good idea and we should do that and have it backed up . grad h: And so if a mistake is made and we lose the backup we should have the archive and if then a mistake is made and we lose the archive we should have the backup . professor b: Well I guess it is true that even with something that 's backed up it 's not gonna if it 's stationary it 's not going to go through the increment it 's not gonna burden things in the incremental backups . But he said that that we sh shouldn't worry too much about that , that we 're getting a new backup system and we 're far enough away from saturation on full backups that it 's w probably OK . professor b: Really ? grad h: And  , so the only issue here is the timing between getting more disks and  recording meetings . professor b: So I guess the idea is that we would be reserving the non - backed - up space for things that took less than twenty - four hours to recreate or something like that , right ? grad h: Things that are recreatable easily and also Yeah , basically things that are recreatable . professor b: Well I was allowing someone else to come up with something related that they had  phd e: I thought you guys were gonna burn C Ds ? grad h:  unfortunately we could burn C Ds but first of all it 's a pain . grad h: Because you have to copy it down to the PC and then burn it and that 's a multi - step procedure . And second of all the the write - once burners as opposed to a professional press don't last . grad h: So I think burning them for distribution is fine but burning them for backup is not a good idea . Can I add one top topic ? We have time ? I wanted to ask , I know that  that Thilo you were , bringing the Channeltrans interface onto the Windows machine ? And I wanted to know is th phd d: Yeah it 's it Basically it 's done , postdoc a: It 's all done ? That 's g wonderful . grad h: Yes , since Tcl - TK runs on it , basically things 'll just work . phd d: Yeah it Yeah , it was just a problem with the Snack version and the Transcriber version but it 's solved . Does this mean that the that this could be por  ported to a Think - Pad note or some other type of  phd d: Yeah , basically  I did install it on my laptop and yeah postdoc a: Wonderful . CrossPads ? CrossPads ? grad h:  got an email from  James Landay who basically said \" if you 're not using them , could you return them ? \" So he said he doesn't need them , he just periodically w at the end of each term sends out email to everyone who was recorded as having them and asks them if they 're still using them . professor b: Once ? grad h: We we used them a couple times , postdoc a:   phd f: Them ? There 's more than one ? grad h: but postdoc a: Yeah . professor b: But grad h: My opinion on it is , first , I never take notes anyway so I 'm not gonna use it ,  and second , it 's another level of infrastructure that we have to deal with . postdoc a: And I have  so my my feeling on it is that I think in principle it 's a really nice idea , and you have the time tags which makes it better tha than just taking ra raw notes . On the other hand , I the down side for me was that I think the pen is really noisy . And I and I don't know if it 's audible on the but I I sort of thought that was a disadvantage . I do take notes , I could be taking notes on these things and I guess the plus with the CrossPads would be the time markings but I don't know . phd d: what is a CrossPad ? professor b: So it 's it 's  it 's a regular pad , just a regular pad of paper but there 's this pen which indicates position . grad h: And then you can download it and they have OCR and searching and all sorts of things . grad h: But I don't take notes , professor b: And one of the reasons that it was brought up originally was because  we were interested in in higher - level things , grad h: so . professor b: not just the , you know , microphone stuff but also summarization and so forth and the question is if you were going to go to some gold standard of what wa what was it that happened in the meeting you know , where would it come from ? And  I think that was one of the things , phd d: Yeah . We 'll have a you know , have a scribe , have somebody  take good notes and then that 's part of the record of the meeting . And then we did it once or twice and we sort of grad h: Yep , and then just sort of died out . professor b: probably chose the wrong scribe but it was It 's  phd g:  grad h: Yeah that 's right . postdoc a: u but I guess the the other thing I 'm thinking is if we wanted that kind of thing I wonder if we 'd lose that much by having someone be a scribe by listening to the tape , to the recording afterwards and taking notes in some other interface . phd f:  we 're transcribing it anyways , why do we need notes ? postdoc a: Oh it 's la it 's useful , grad h: Because that 's summary . phd g: I think there 's also there 's this use that phd f: Summarize it from the transcription . phd g: the Well , what if you 're sitting there and you just wanna make an X and you don't wanna take notes and you 're you just wanna phd f: Doodle . phd g: get the summary of the transcript from this time location like you know , and and then while you 're bored you don't do anything and once in a while , maybe there 's a joke and you put a X and But in in other words you can use that just to highlight times in a very simple way . Also with I was thinking and I know Morgan disagrees with me on this but suppose you have a group in here and you wanna let them note whenever they think there might be something later that they might not wanna distribute in terms of content , they could just sort of make an X near that point or a question mark that sort of alerts them that when they get the transcript back they c could get some red flags in that transcript region and they can then look at it . I know we haven't been using it but I w I can imagine it being useful just for sort of marking time periods grad h: Right . professor b: I guess so , you know , what what makes one think i is maybe we should actually schedule some periods where people go over something later phd g: so . professor b: and and and put some kind of summary or something  you know , some there 'd be some scribe who would actually listen , w who 'd agreed to actually listen to the whole thing , not transcribe it , but just sort of write down things that struck them as important . But then you don't you don't have the time reference  that you 'd have if you had it live . And you don't have a lot of other cues that might be useful , professor b: Yeah . phd f: How do you synchronize the time in the CrossPad and the time of the recording ? phd g: so . grad h:  that was one of the issues we talked about originally and that that 's w part of the difficulty is that we need an infrastructure for using the time the CrossPads and so that means synchronizing the time phd g:  postdoc a:   grad h: You know you want it pretty close and there 's a fair amount of skew because it 's a hand - held unit with a battery postdoc a: Well when when I d grad h: and so you postdoc a: OK . grad h: so you have to synchronize at the beginning of each meeting all the pads that are being used , so that it 's synchronized with the time on that and then you have to download to an application , and then you have to figure out what the data formats are and convert it over if you wanna do anything with this information . phd e: Why grad h: And so there 's a lot of infrastructure which postdoc a: There is an alternative . grad h: unless someone postdoc a: There is an alternative , it 's still , there 's  you know , your point stands about there be needing to be an infrastructure , but it doesn't have to be synchronized with the little clock 's timer on it . You c  , I when I when I did it I synchronized it by voice , by whispering \" one , two , three , four \" onto the microphone grad h:  . grad h: Well , but then there 's the infrastructure at the other end phd e: Right . grad h: which someone has to listen to that and find that point , postdoc a: Yeah , it 's transcribed . phd g: Well , could we keep one of these things for another year ? Would h  is there a big cau grad h: We can keep all both of them for the whole whole year . phd g: just just in case we grad h: it 's just phd g: even maybe some of the transcribers who might be wanting to annotate  f just there 's a bunch of things that might be neat to do but I it might not be the case that we can actually synchronize them and then do all the infrastructure but we could at least try it out . professor b: Well one thing that we might try  is on some set of meetings , some collection of meetings , maybe EDU is the right one or maybe something else , we we get somebody to buy into the idea of doing this as part of the task . professor b:  part of the reason I think part of the reason that Adam was so interested in  the SpeechCorder sort of f idea from the beginning is he said from the beginning he hated taking notes and grad h: Yep . professor b: and so forth so and and Jane is more into it but eh  you know I don't know if you wanna really do do this all the time so I think the thing is to to get someone to actually buy into it and have at least some series of meetings where we do it . The p the the problem with the the more extended view , all these other you know with  quibbling about particular applications of it is that it looks like it 's hard to get people to   routinely use it ,  it just hasn't happened anyway . But maybe if we can get a person to phd g: Yeah I don't think it has to be part of a what everybody does in a meeting but it might be a useful , neat part of the project that we can , you know , show off as a mechanism for synchronizing events in time that happen that you just wanna make a note of , like what Jane was talking about with some later browsing , just just as a convenience , even if it 's not a full - blown note taking substitute . phd e: Well if you wanted to do that maybe the right architecture for it is to get a PDA with a wireless card . And and that way you can synchronize very easily with the the the meeting because you 'll be synchroni you can synchronize with the the Linux server and  phd g: So what kind of input would you be ? phd e: so so , if you 're not worried about grad h: Buttons . phd g: You 'd just be pressing like a a phd e: Well well you have a PDA and may and you could have the same sort of X interface or whatever , you 'd have to do a little eh a little bit of coding to do it . phd e: if if all you really wanted was you didn't want this secondary note - taking channel but just sort of being able to use m markers of some sort , a PDA with a l a wireless card would be the probably the right way to go . grad h:  for what what you 've been describing buttons would be even more convenient than anything else , phd g: M right . grad h: right ? You have the phd g: I don't have , you know , grandiose ideas in mind but I 'm just sort of thinking well we 've we 're getting into the next year now and we have a lot of these things worked out at in terms of the speech maybe somebody will be interested in this and postdoc a: I like this PDA idea . professor b: where like one one button was \"  - oh \" and then another button was \" that 's great \" and another button \" that 's f \" phd g: Or like this is my \" I 'm supposed to do this \" kind of button , postdoc a: Yeah . phd g: Yeah something like that or postdoc a: And then grad h:  I think the CrossPad idea is a good one . grad h: It 's just a question of getting people to use it and getting the infrastructure set up in such a way that it 's not a lot of extra work .  that 's part of the reason why it hasn't happened is that it 's been a lot of extra work for me phd g: Yeah . grad h: and postdoc a: But it 's also , it has this problem of having to go from an analog to a d a digital record too , phd g: W postdoc a: doesn't it ?  grad h: Well it 's digital but it 's in a format that is not particularly standard . postdoc a: But  , say , if i if if you 're writing if you 're writing notes in it does it it can't do handwriting recognition , right ? professor b: No , no , but it 's just it 's just storing the pixel informa position information , postdoc a: OK . postdoc a: I I guess what I 'm thinking is that the PDA solution you h you have it already without needing to go from the pixelization to a to a  professor b: Right . You don't have to phd e: The transfer function is less errorful , postdoc a: Oh , nicely put . phd g: Well it also it 's maybe realistic cuz people are supposed to be bringing their P D As to the meeting eventually , right ? That 's why we have this little I don't know what I don't wanna cause more work for anyone but I can imagine some interesting things that you could do with it and so if we don't have to return it and we can keep it for a year I don't know . grad h: Well w we don't we certainly don't have to return it , as I said . All all he said is that if you 're not using it could you return it , if you are using it feel free to keep it . The point is that we haven't used it at all and are we going to ? professor b: So we have no but  by I I would suggest you return one . phd g: We c professor b: We have some aspirations of using them phd g: One would probably be fine . professor b: and phd g: Maybe we could do like a student project , you know , maybe someone who wants to do this as their main like s project for something would be cool .  if we had them out and sitting on the table people might use them a little more professor b: Maybe Jeremy could sit in some meetings and press a button when there when when somebody laughed . grad h: although there is a little phd g: Well , I 'm yeah , that 's not a bad professor b: Yeah , yeah . phd g: Jeremy 's gonna be an he 's a new student starting on modeling brea breath and laughter , actually , which sounds funny but I think it should be cool , professor b: Yeah . phd g: You 're you 're gonna tease me ? grad h: Oh , equipment . grad h: And then at the same time I 'll probably rewire the room as per Jane 's suggestion so that  the first N channels are wireless , eh are the m the close - talking and the next N are far - field . professor b: You know what he means but isn't that funny sounding ? \" We ordered more wireless . \" It 's like wires are the things so you 're wiring you 're you 're you we 're we ordered more absence of the thing . phd g: I just it 's sort of a anachronism ,  it 's like It 's great . professor b:  there 's there 's all this stuff going on  between  Andreas and and and Dave and Chuck and others with various kinds of runs   recognition runs , trying to figure things out about the features but it 's it 's all sort of in process , so there 's not much to say right now . grad h: So just the transcript number and then the then the phd e: This is Yes , this is number two for me today . professor b: See all you have to do is go away to move way up in the phd e: Oh . grad h: Should we do simultaneous ? phd g: Well , I 'm just thinking , are you gonna try to save the data before this next group comes in ? professor b: Yeah . phd g: You have to plug your ears , by the way  Eric , grad h: Well I have to , phd d: You don't have to "

        "Query": "Which groups were thanked for their efforts and discussed as being heavily impacted?",
        "Summary": "In recognition of their life-saving efforts during the ongoing pandemic, essential workers were thanked, particularly during Paramedic Services Week. Additionally, members voiced their support for various marginalized groups, including advocating for aboriginals facing police brutality, students experiencing disrupted education, indigenous and rural residents lacking internet access, and the Black Lives Matter movement.",
        "Article": "anthony rota (nipissingtimiskaming, lib.)): We'll call this meeting to order. Welcome to the fifth meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic.  Pursuant to the order passed on Monday, April20, the committee is meeting today to consider ministerial announcements, to allow members of the committee to present petitions, and to question ministers, including the Prime Minister, about the COVID-19 pandemic. Tomorrow, May8, Dr.AndreaMcCrady, Dominion Carillonneur, will give a special recital to mark the 75th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day. Victory in Europe Day, VE Day, commemorates the formal acceptance of Germany's surrender by allied forces at the end of the Second World War. While the pandemic prevents us from gathering to celebrate in person, tomorrow at noon the voice of our nation will ring out in remembrance of this milestone in our history. Just so you are aware, the webcast will always show the person speaking rather than the entire committee. I would like to remind members that, as in the House of Commons or committee, they should not take photos of their colleagues or film the proceedings. In order to facilitate the work of the interpreters and to allow the meeting to proceed smoothly, I would ask you to follow some instructions. When you are ready to speak, click on the microphone icon to activate your microphone, or hold the space bar down while you are speaking. If you release the bar, your microphone will revert to mute, just like a walkie-talkie. Honourable members, I would like to remind you that if you want to speak English, you should be on the English channel. Should you wish to alternate between the two languages, you should change the channel to the language that you are speaking each time you switch languages. Should you need to request the floor outside of your designated speaking time, you should activate your mike and state that you have a point of order. If a member of the committee wishes to intervene on a point of order raised by another person, you should use the raised hand function to indicate to the chair that you wish to speak. Should any technical challenges arise, for example, in relation to interpretation, please advise the chair immediately by raising a point of order, and the technical team will work on resolving them. If you get accidentally disconnected, please try to rejoin the meeting with the information you used to join initially. Before we get started, please note that in the top right-hand corner of your screen is a button that you can use to change views. Speaker view allows you to focus on the person currently speaking; gallery view allows you to see a larger number of participants. You can click through the multiple pages in the gallery view to see who is on and how many more participants there are. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during the meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. In addition, to ensure a petition is considered properly presented, the certificate of the petition and each page of the petition for a petition certified in a previous Parliament should be mailed to the committee no later than 6 p.m. Chair, five years ago when Parliament passed Bill C-14, then justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould said that it represented a finely tuned balance between access and safeguards. Petitioners on the first petition I'm presenting are very concerned to see Bill C-7 before Parliament, which removes safeguards ahead of that five-year review. Petitioners specifically mention their concerns about the removal of the mandatory 10-day reflection period, which can already be waived in certain circumstances. They are concerned about reducing the number of witnesses required to oversee it and ensure that a request has been properly made. The second and final petition that I will be presenting today is with respect to Senate Bill S-204. This would make it a criminal offence for a person to go abroad and receive an organ from a person who did not consent. This responds specifically to concerns about organ harvesting in the People's Republic of China involving Falun Gong practitioners and increasing concerns that this is being or about to be applied to Uighurs as well. Petitioners are noting that in the previous Parliament there were bills on this, Bill C-350 and Bill S-240. Now, in this Parliament there is a bill, Bill S-204, and the petitioners hope that this 43rd Parliament will be the one that gets it passed. This is my first occasion to present a petition in our virtual format of the COVID-19 committee. The petition I am presenting today, which was previously approved, is from a number of constituents who are concerned that we pursue the Paris Agreement to hold the global average temperature increase to no more than 1.5C. The Paris Agreement itself embeds in it the concept of Just Transition with a capital J and a capital T, the concept of just transition ensuring fairness and support for all workers in the fossil fuel sector. The petitioners call upon the Government of Canada to move forward with an act to ensure just transition and to ensure adequate funding so that workers and communities dependent on the fossil fuel sector receive meaningful support to ensure security in their lives in the transition to more sustainable energy use. I want to thank the honourable members for their usual collaboration and now we'll go on to mr. james bezan (selkirkinterlakeeastman, cpc): On a point of order, Mr. Chair, on Tuesday, at our COVID-19 committee of the whole meeting, I was asking a question which started at 12:56:06 and was cut off at 1:00:32, so I still have 34 seconds of time remaining in my question time of five minutes. If you believe that my time was unjustly cut off and that it was unfair treatment of the official opposition when we were raising our points of order, I would ask that the 34 seconds be tacked on to the opening round for the opposition and credited to Rosemarie Falk, who will be leading off for the Conservatives. the chair: Normally what happens is the chair uses judgment, and with 35 seconds, there isn't enough time obviously for a full question or answer, most of the time. I want everyone to know that I do have a timer next to me and I am timing the questions, and I will be treating the answers the same way. We've taken a little bit of the chair's ability to give judgment on it, but it will be from now on. I would like to remind the honourable members that no member will be recognized for more than five minutes at a time and that members may split their time with one or more members by so indicating to the chair. Will the Prime Minister stand up for Canada's energy workers, or does he agree with the fringe left and those who want to destroy our country? ms. Chair, I believe that the language that the honourable member just used is unparliamentary mr. It is unacceptable to assert that anyone who wants to make a point about our economy is trying to destroy the country. As I pointed out this morning in my press conference, we cannot move forward on a transformation of our energy sector without supporting the workers in that energy sector. We need their innovation and we need their hard work if we are going to lower our emissions, if we are going to reach our the chair: We'll go to Ms. Chair, it has been 43 days since the finance minister promised Canada's energy sector liquidity through the Business Development Bank of Canada. If the government doesn't step up to support our energy sector, they are in effect doubling down on their support for foreign, unethically sourced oil. Chair, when will the credit options be available to Canada's small and medium energy firms? the chair: I want to remind honourable members that we do have interpreters who are listening and translating. Chair, from the very beginning, our priority through this pandemic and this crisis has been to support workers across the country. We have sent billions of dollars to workers right across the country, including Alberta, Saskatchewan, B.C., and Newfoundland and Labrador in the energy sector for them to be able to support their families through this difficult time. The announcements to date fall well short of what is needed to maintain a steady supply of affordable and healthy food. Instead of responding to specific COVID-19 challenges, our farmers are facing the Liberals' reannounced $125 million that was already budgeted in the AgriRecovery program. Will the Prime Minister finally step up and take our food supply chain seriously, or is agriculture just an afterthought for him? right hon. Chair, we take agriculture and our agricultural sector extremely seriously, which is why we announced hundreds of millions of dollars a couple of days ago to respond to pressing needs. We will continue to make investments to ensure both the safety of workers in our agricultural sector and the safety of our communities, as well as the continued flow of high-quality Canadian food onto our tables right across the country. Our farmers are faced with rising operational costs, a disrupted service industry, labour shortages and a reduced capacity at processing plants. When will the Prime Minister deliver adequate support to address the critical changes facing our ag industry? right hon. Chair, I would suggest respectfully that the honourable member take a look once again at the announcement we made, which actually highlights significant new investments to support our agricultural industry. Every step of the way in this unprecedented situation, we've been moving forward on doing more, on adjusting and on investing more. We need to support our agricultural sector and the people who work so hard to put food on Canadians' tables right across the country and we will continue to. Chair, Canadians expect to find healthy and affordable food at their grocery stores, but if the government does not take action now, that's not a given. It is an enormous hit to their bottom line, and the recent carbon tax hike is taking even more money out of the pockets of farmers at a time when they can afford it the least. Will the Prime Minister exempt all farm operations from the carbon tax and reimburse the money that they have already taken from them? right hon. Chair, it's a shame to hear the member opposite accidentallyunintentionally, I'm certainmislead the House and Canadians. This is the way of creating a better future for our kids and grandkids, which I know people in communities right across the country, including our farm communities, want to see happen. We are moving forward in a responsible way to put a price on pollution and put more money in average Canadians' pockets. marilne gill (manicouagan, bq): Thank you, Mr.Chair. I am thinking about the lobster fishery in the Magdalen Islands, the crab fishery on the Cte-Nord or those fishing for herring in the south of the Gasp. Because imports have ceased, because the domestic market is weak and in decline because of the interruption of the tourism and restaurant industries, the fishing industry and its fishers must be supported. justin trudeau: Our fishers do exceptional work that is extremely important in feeding Canadians and in contributing to our economic success through their exports around the world. I know about the processing industry and the $62.5million to be used essentially for freezing products, but I am talking about the fishers themselves. In addition, they feel that they will be losing money, because of the drop in the price of their resource. They are just as essential as farmers, but they are going to have to work at a loss and they are not going to have workers to assist them. Are you going to do anything else, in addition to the assistance of $62.5million? Time is of the essence. We recognize the challenges that fishers must face in terms of social distancing and of work that is often seasonal. We are going to continue working with the industry, with the fishers, and with the coastal communities in order to ensure that people have confidence in their abilities and in their future. In times of crisis, it is important for the government to be there to support people, and that is exactly what we are going to continue to do. But, given the cyclical nature of the industry, some sectors have had to postpone for several weeks the preparations they need for fishing activities. The current program could be modified in a number of ways, to accommodate the cycle, the dates, and the size of the companies. They would really like to take advantage of the $40,000loan, but they cannot because of their payroll. I can already suggest a number of solutions to the government and to the Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard, that would bring help to those businesses very quickly. The fishers carry on, because it is a duty for them, because they want to help us and to be part of the effort at this time of crisis. I would really like to hear a guarantee that they will be supported, that they will be able to put food on the table this year, and that they will be able to support the communities that often depend on the fishing industry, a major industry in those communities. justin trudeau: Minister Jordan has been working with the fishers, the fishing industry and the communities affected by the crisis since the crisis began. From the outset, our priority has been to support the millions of Canadians from coast to coast who have lost their jobs. We have been able to do so, but we are going to continue to work for those who must now face difficulties. the chair: Before we move to the next question, I would like to remind members of the committee to speak slowly, and to address their remarks to the chair and not directly to each other. They've seen revenues plummet, and at the same time the cost of delivering municipal services has risen. As the Prime Minister knows, municipalities are unable to run deficits and so they are facing the reality of cutbacks and serious cuts to the services that Canadians depend on. They're going to be even more important during the recovery, especially when it comes to delivering on the infrastructure programs before us. My question for the Prime Minister is, when can they expect federal financial support to arrive? right hon. Chair, no government in Canada's history has done more to work with our municipalities, with our cities, with the Federation of Canadian Municipalities to respond to the challenges they're facing and to partner with them. Things from infrastructure to investments have made a huge difference right across the country in the quality of life of Canadians in towns, large and small, from coast to coast to coast. As I'm sure the member well knows, our Constitution requires that most of the funding for municipalities flow through the provinces. We are working with the provinces, as we continue to work with the cities, to ensure that we're able to support this order of government that delivers the vast majority of services to Canadians with very little financial means. Chair, it would seem that the federal government has the fiscal capacity and the responsibility to help municipalities weather this crisis. Transit systems have been hit particularly hard and have seen the bulk of the layoffs in the municipal sector. These transit services carry essential workers to work, whether they are health care workers, grocery store workers, janitors or others. We will see service cutbacks precisely at a time when we want to be expanding transit and improving transit in our communities. Does the Prime Minister acknowledge that the federal government needs to step in to safeguard and protect Canada's transit services? right hon. Chair, this federal government recognizes how important it is to support all Canadians, which is why we put forward unprecedented measures to help millions upon millions of Canadians with the CERB and with the wage subsidy. I'll be having a conversation with all other first ministers tonight to talk about a broad range of issues. We have continued to engage with them, but again, it is important to respect the Constitution and understand that funding for municipalities and cities does go through the provinces. The federal government is happy to be there to support, but it must be the chair: We will go to Mr. Chair, I am wondering how the Prime Minister could explain to a bus driver in Vancouver who has been laid off that as a public sector worker, she can't access the federal wage subsidy, while an equivalent worker in the airline industry gets to keep her job with the federal help of that program. Chair, I'm happy to explain to the member and to all Canadians that our Constitution creates federal areas of jurisdiction and provincial areas of jurisdiction. The airline industry, like banking, like telecommunications, is a federal area of jurisdiction that we have been able to move forward on. More than that, we brought the Canada emergency response benefit and the wage subsidy to all industries across this country, because we knew that as the federal government, it was something that we needed to step up on the chair: We will go back to Mr. Faced with minimal health care capacity, remote indigenous communities in my riding are taking matters into their own hands. The Nuxalk have put up a checkpoint on Highway 20 to protect community members and prevent non-essential travel. In particular, it is to protect the three remaining fluent speakers of the Nuxalk language, these cherished elders in their community. The Haida on Haida Gwaii have set up a similar checkpoint, as have communities throughout British Columbia, yet federal support for indigenous communities amounts to only $39 million for all of the indigenous communities in B.C. Does the Prime Minister not agree that more support is warranted to help indigenous communities in my riding and across the country? right hon. Chair, from the very beginning, we made funds available to Canadians right across the country, particularly people in indigenous remote or northern communities who we knew would be facing more difficult challenges because of the existing vulnerabilities in their health care system and socio-economic circumstances. We have made unprecedented investments and we will continue to make the necessary investments, because we need to make sure that indigenous Canadians, and indeed all Canadians, have the supports they need to make it through this crisis. luc berthold (mganticl'rable, cpc): Thank you very much, Mr.Chair. I am going to keep talking about the area of jurisdiction that the Prime Minister likes to talk about, except that I want to point out the incompetence of the Liberals in keeping their commitments on infrastructure projects. As the provinces gradually restart their economies, can the Prime Minister tell us how many projects that the provinces have submitted are waiting for approval from his government? mr. luc berthold: Mr.Chair, I hope that the length of the pause will not be taken out of my time. catherine mckenna (minister of infrastructure and communities): I'm sorry, Mr.Chair, I was on mute. It is very important to build projects that will create good jobs the chair: We are returning to Mr.Berthold. How many projects are currently awaiting government approval? I know that the minister has been meeting virtually with the provinces over the last few days. Rather than wait for the right political opportunity to approve these files, will the minister commit today to respecting the provinces and approving by next week all the projects that are sitting on her desk? hon. catherine mckenna: Mr.Chair, I'm pleased with how we are working with the provinces and territories. We will announce the approval of projects because it's very important for our economy, our communities and creating good jobs. luc berthold: Does the minister understand that she hasn't told us how many projects are still pending? The construction season is very short. Approval of a project in July means that work can't begin until next year, which won't help revive our economy. catherine mckenna: I want to make it clear that we have approved hundreds of projects in the last few weeks. These projects are important for the economy and the environment, as well as for jobs the chair: We return now to Mr.Berthold. luc berthold: Mr.Chair, while the minister is calling for a green recovery of the country's economy, public transit is at risk. The Union des municipalits du Qubec estimates that the monthly losses are between $75million and $100million. catherine mckenna: Mr.Chair, we recognize the importance of public transit for our economy, since some essential workers use public transit. As the Prime Minister said, it's the provinces that must help because the money the chair: We return now to Mr.Berthold. luc berthold: Mr.Chair, once again, what we're hearing is that the government is passing the buck to the provinces. Unfortunately, the minister was unable to answer a single question about the number of infrastructure projects still on the federal government's desk, which is very important. In terms of the number of projects that we've approved, I would be happy to inform the hon. member of the exact number of all the approved projects that my department has been working very hard on over the past few months to approve projects to go forward. luc berthold: Mr.Chair, do I have any time left? the chair: No, your time is up. On March 28, the minister personally tweeted out a thank you to the People's Republic of China for donating PPE to Canada. More recently, Taiwan donated half a million surgical masks to Canada, yet here we are, two weeks later, and the minister has yet to personally thank Taiwan for its generosity. I can say, after my COVID foreign ministers call, that the world community has come together to make sure that supply chains will remain intact and that we will have transit hubs and air bridges. Chair, I didn't hear a thank you there, so I'm going to try again. On May 4, the Government of Taiwan delivered 25,000 surgical masks to the Government of British Columbia. Minister of Citizens' Services Anne Kang and Minister of State for Child Care Katrina Chen, who, as ministers, officially thanked the Government of Taiwan for its donation. Again, will the minister now do the right thing and, on behalf of Canadians, recognize the generosity of Taiwan and thank its government for that timely donation? hon. Chair, as I said to you before, Canada is grateful to all who have given supplies to Canada. As I said, when it comes to global health, when it comes to helping each other, I think it is a duty for all to come together. We are grateful and thankful for all those who have agreed to help Canada and Canadians from coast to coast to coast in times of need. I've repeated that and have said many times in many forums that we are grateful and thankful to all of those who are helping Canada. The Government of Taiwan has been the world leader in successfully fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. Sadly, the People's Republic of China continues to oppose Taiwan's membership in the World Health Organization. Will the minister now do the right thing and assure Canadians that he will fully support efforts to grant Taiwan membership in the World Health Organization? hon. That said, we support Taiwan to continue meaningful participation in international multilateral forums, particularly when it comes to health. We also believe that Taiwan's role as an observer in the World Health Assembly meeting is of interest to the international health community and we have been supportive of that. Can he tell us exactly how many Canadians remain abroad who have expressed a desire to be repatriated? hon. As of today, we have repatriated more than 20,000 Canadians on 232 flights from 87 countries. As the Prime Minister and I have said from the beginning, we will make our best effort to repatriate everyone who wants to come back home during the crisis. My office has received correspondence from Canadians concerned that trial delays due to COVID-19 may result in criminals walking free. As this government has been working overtime to criminalize law-abiding citizens with new and useless gun laws, will the Minister of Justice ensure that real criminals will not walk free as a result of delays in the justice system? hon. We have been working with my provincial counterparts across Canada, as well as with the various federal courts and also, through my provincial counterparts, with the superior courts and courts of appeal across Canada. Each particular jurisdiction has taken measures to ensure that basic essential services within the court system are maintained, through a variety of means, and we believe that we will be able to solve these various challenges. Chair, the regional relief and recovery fund was announced weeks ago as a way to help small and medium-sized businesses in rural communities, like those in my riding. Can the minister clarify whether we are days away or weeks away from this support flowing to the businesses that need it so desperately? hon. Chair, I had the chance to talk with many of the chambers of commerce and business owners throughout Atlantic Canada, and we hear their anxiety. That's why ACOA's doing great work on the ground to make sure we can help them through this very difficult period. We have increased the budget of ACOAgood newsand I'll be coming up with the details very soon. It will be a pleasure to collaborate with him to make sure that we can help many businesses and business owners across the Atlantic region. In particular, they are unable to access the emergency business account, because they do not have a payroll. There are hundreds and thousands of small businesses in this very situation, vital small businesses in our communities, but they do not meet this requirement. What does the Minister of Finance have to say to these small businesses that are suffering right now? hon. I want all the businesses that he is talking about and all of them throughout the country to know that we continue to work very hard to make sure they're supported through this difficult period. We know that businesses are being supported through getting access to the wage subsidy to keep their employees together, and they're getting help, whether it's with rent or to defray costs by deferring GST and HST or customs duty payments. Some have a personal account that they've dealt with over the years rather than a business account, and that makes them ineligible. Chair, small businesses are concerned about their ability to survive, and no amount of deferrals, loans or subsidies can substitute for their need to be open and servicing their customers. Can the government confirm that a sectoral risk analysis has taken place to assist the provinces in reopening the economy? hon. Chair, I can assure the member that we've been very clear in terms of our strategy around reopening the economy. We need to make sure that we follow the advice of the experts and the health authorities to do so in a manner that does not compromise the health and well-being of Canadians. We of course will have a sectoral lens, and as you can see by some of the initiatives and the support packages we've put forward the chair: We'll go back to Mr. Can the government confirm that the programs currently in place will be expanded to these hard-working Canadians? hon. Chair, I want to assure the honourable member that we continue to work with all of our small businesses and I want to thank him for raising this very important issue. I want to assure our Canadian small businesses that we are going to continue to do this work to make sure they are supported. james cumming: Can the minister give me a date when she will be able to announce to these businesses that they will be eligible? hon. mary ng: I want to assure our Canadian small businesses of their importance and of the importance of their contributions to all of our communities. I want them to know that we continue to listen and that we will ensure that they are supported and continue to be supported during this difficult time. Can you give me a date when I can tell these thousands of businesses they will be supported if they pay dividends or if they use contractors within their businesses? hon. The landlord says that he doesn't have the 25% needed to be eligible for the program because he's already paying for common area costs and deferrals on utilities, which he will have to pay on his mortgage. Will the government reform the rent relief program to focus on tenants and not just the landlords? hon. Chair, I want to let the member know that we are working to make sure that the details of the emergency program for rent are out there so that both tenants and landlords can understand the situation. We're seeing a significant number of both landlords and tenants coming forward to register for this program, and we are convinced that it will be in the best interests of landlords to move forward and give tenants this relief. Chair, we've been hearing, however, from small business owners that their landlords don't find the government's rent relief program appealing enough. Can the government confirm, given the program's low eligibility rate, that the program will be expanded and be more efficient in helping tenants? hon. Chair, we recognize that it's critically important that all of the details of this program be out there for landlords and tenants to understand. This is a program that we've put out within the last week, and we are confident that it's in the best interests of tenants and landlords. One easy way to do that would be to expand the Canada summer jobs program to businesses with over 50 employees. Will the government consider doing so to allow students to gain that very valuable work experience over the coming months? hon. The second uptake provided employers across the country with the ability to add their needs for students to the mix. During this pandemic, the government has consistently called for a team Canada, non-partisan approach, and I was glad to hear that said a little earlier today. However, at the same time, the current government has used a parliamentary back door to launch a poorly thought out gun ban. We have a government that didn't win the popular vote, and I'm just wondering how I explain to my residents, because I'm getting so many calls, that this is not a bloated response because, quite frankly, it is. Chair, I think the honourable member can explain to his constituents that the forming of regulations through order in council is actually the process prescribed in law in Canada under section 117.15 of the Criminal Code. I would also invite the member to advise his constituents that way back in 1991, when there were some Conservatives who called themselves Progressive, the Mulroney government brought forward, in Bill C-17, the authority under that section for an order in council to prescribe specific makes, models and variants of military firearms as prohibited or restricted. terry dowdall: I'm not sure, but I'm hoping, that I'll get an honest answer on this question from the minister, who has everything from rocket launchers to basically toy guns on the ban list. When will we get the cost of this buyback program? the chair: I want to remind the honourable members to please be careful in their language when they are referring to others. I won't comment on this one particularly, but I want all of you to be very, very careful when referring to other members. Chair, to respond to some of the obfuscations and deceptions that have been put out there. I think it's very clear, and I invite the member to look at the list of weapons that are the chair: We'll go back to Mr. bill blair: Actually, I'm very much looking forward to bringing forward legislation as soon as the House resumes. We will have a vigorous debate in Parliament about the form a buyback will take and we will bring forward a budget at that time. bill blair: If people are illegally in possession of the weapons and they're committing a crime, they will be dealt with for the crimes they commit. Canadians in my riding who suffer from cystic fibrosis are among the most vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. While these Canadians with existing lung conditions are incredibly worried about a virus that attacks the ability to breathe, the good news is that there are life-saving medicines for those with CF. I am wondering if and when the government will correct these guidelines and give access to life-saving medicines for our most vulnerable. Chair, as you know, the government has been very committed to improving access and affordability for prescription medications for all Canadians. The PMPRB regulatory amendments will help Canadians be able to afford their prescriptions, and Canada will continue to be an important market for new medicines. In fact, many countries with much lower medicine prices gained access to new medicines in the same time frame as Canada frame, or even faster, so we are excited to do this work. Chair, our seniors are being particularly hard hit right now during this pandemic, yet seniors have not been given any direct support. Funding to charities like the United Way is being labelled as support for seniors, but most won't see any of this support. Seniors in my riding have asked for an increase in their CPP and OAS, and to be able to make untaxed bulk withdrawals from their RRSPs while they still have some value. deb schulte (minister of seniors): I want to assure the honourable member and Canadians that our government has been working extremely hard on how best to support and serve seniors during this pandemic. the chair: You might want to try your space bar and keep it down while you're speaking. I want to assure the honourable member and Canadians that our government has been working extremely hard on how best to support and serve seniors during this pandemic. We've reduced the minimum RRIF withdrawal by 25%, and we've made the CERB available to working seniors who have lost their jobs due to the COVID pandemic. We know there's more work to do, and we'll have more to say in the future. the chair: I want to remind honourable members that if there are issues, we are taking note of them, and we'll hopefully resolve them by the next meeting. marie-hlne gaudreau (laurentideslabelle, bq): Thank you, Mr.Chair. In fact, we have been looking at a number of ways to support increased contact tracing across the country, including working with provinces and territories to boost their capacity through human resources and volunteer organizations. Anything we put forward as a digital tool to assist with contact tracing would be thoroughly considerate of Canadians' privacy rights. But you know as well as I do that the Privacy Commissioner has been calling us to task for a very long time now, because there is also a crisis of confidence. You know as well as I do that for 90%of Canadians, the misuse of their personal data is a cause for concern, whether it be for profiling or business development purposes. I'd like to know whether this commitment will be implemented quickly so that legislation can be passed on this issue, in this case the Privacy Act. We're talking about what is going on in Quebec, among other places, and I would like to make sure that the federal government commits to respecting the proposals regarding geolocation and contact tracing possibilities, with full respect for the right to privacy. We have worked very closely with provinces and territories for a long time before the outbreak, but certainly ever since the outbreak. We respect the rights of jurisdictional authorities to use tools that have been properly vetted through their own provincial and territorial legislation. marie-hlne gaudreau: Concerning privacy, there are 30million Quebeckers and Canadians who have had their personal data leaked. Why is it that our laws don't allow us to apply financial penalties so that we can then go further? The very basis is to be concerned about our fundamental rights. As the critic for access to information and privacy, I'd like a commitment that the federal government will deal not with what the provinces are doing, but with the Privacy Act. the chair: Your time is up, but I'll give the floor to the minister for 30seconds. Our government will ensure the privacy of Canadians is respected, support responsible innovation and take reasonable steps to strengthen enforcement powers. yvan baker (etobicoke centre, lib.): Thank you very much, Mr. Minister, in my riding of Etobicoke Centre, we are mourning the loss of 40 residents to COVID-19 at the Eatonville long-term care centre. Of all Canadians who have died from COVID-19, 79% were living in long-term care homes. I understand that long-term care homes fall within the jurisdiction of provincial governments in Canada, but this is a crisis. What is the federal government doing right now to help protect our seniors who are living in long-term care homes from COVID-19? What will we do to reform our long-term care homes in the future to ensure that our seniors in Etobicoke Centre and across Canada get the care they deserve? hon. We are deeply concerned by the outbreaks of COVID-19 in long-term care facilities, and our thoughts are with those who have lost a loved one. As my colleague mentioned, while these facilities are regulated by provinces and territories, we have been focused on protecting the health and safety of long-term care residents and staff while working with our partners in a team Canada approach. We're working with the provinces and territories to cost-share a temporary salary top-up for long-term care workers. We are working through investing $2 billion to secure personal protective equipment for the health of workers, including those in the long-term care homes, and we've deployed the Canadian Armed Forces to assist 25 long-term care homes in Quebec and Ontario. We all have a role to play to stop the spread of COVID-19 and to protect our seniors and caregivers. At the finance committee, we've heard a lot of concerns from all sectors of the economy as a result of COVID-19 and we've been presented with quite a number of possible solutions as well, several of which the government has acted upon. It is very welcome support, but I sincerely believe the farm sector will be taking the Prime Minister up on the suggestion that $250 million should be seen as an initial investment. However, as a result of reduced processor contracts for next year, plus cancelled seed contracts, millions of dollars of seed and process potatoes have no home. How does the minister see Tuesday's announcement addressing potato farmers' concerns? Second, in 2013, long-term financial safety nets were gutted by the Harper government. We know the importance of our potato farmers, and that's why we are launching a first-ever surplus food purchase program, a $50-million fund designed to help redistribute existing inventories, such as potatoes, to local food organizations. On the financial safety net that we have in place for our farmers, called the business risk management program, we announced up to $125 million in funding through AgriRecovery and made changes to AgriStability that will help producers quickly. In the meantime, I want to reiterate that BRM programs, including AgriInvest, are there to help farmers in difficult times. Robyn, who has owned Arbutus Health in Tofino for over 13 years, can't apply for the Canada emergency business account loan, simply because she doesn't have a payroll of over $20,000. With no business income and without emergency financing, it is virtually impossible for her to pay her bills or come up with the 25% needed for the Canada emergency commercial rent assistance program. The government promised to be flexible and willing to adjust its COVID response rollout so that nobody falls through the cracks, but Robyn, like tens of thousands of proprietors who are the economic job creators of our communities, urgently needs the government's help now. Will the government amend its programs to help more business owners so that people like Robyn don't lose their businesses? hon. I know he and I have talked about this, and I appreciate the input and the feedback that he is providing from business directly. I want to assure Robyn and her businesses, and many businesses across the country, that we are absolutely listening, and we will continue to make sure we are supporting those businesses during this period. We also know that more has to be done, and we will continue to work with you and businesses across the country so that we can indeed give them that necessary support to weather this difficult period of COVID-19. I was talking to Heather last night, who also owns a business in Tofino, Basic Goodness Pizzeria, with her partner Marco. Like many proprietors of family businesses who aren't on payroll, they don't qualify for the business loans. Now with the new rollout of the rent support, they're not sure if their landlord is willing to play ball and even apply. Heather was in tears last night as she told me that they have done nothing wrong to deserve being excluded from these emergency programs. Will the government fix the rent support program so that tenants can apply, instead of leaving it up to landlords, and so businesses can get the help they desperately need? hon. We've been working on offering a response for small businesses and charities and non-profit organizations, and we are continuing to listen on the ground to how we can better assist the businesses that fall through the cracks. Chair, when the government rolled out its commercial rent support program, why didn't it negotiate an eviction moratorium with the provinces, as Australia and other countries did, to protect business owners? hon. We've recognized it and we've been working with the provinces and territories to implement the Canada emergency commercial rent the chair: We'll go back to Mr. gord johns: To qualify for the Canada emergency wage subsidy, a 30% drop in revenue has to be shown. Anyone who's owned a business knows that even with this program, it's going to be hard to survive. Why is the government using a 70% measurement drop to qualify for the rent support program, but a 30% drop for the wage subsidy? hon. We've been working with provinces and territories to provide forgivable loans to commercial property owners, who in turn lower the rents for their tenants by 75%. We're hoping that tenants and landlords will be working together so we can support businesses during this very difficult crisis. the chair: Before we move on to the next question, Mr.Berthold, did you have a question or a point of order? mr. I checked the clock from the first round of five minutes, and as you may recall, it took a very long time for me to get an answer from the government. During my first turn, it took 50seconds before a government minister deigned to answer my questions. After checking my time, I realized that the discussion between Ms.McKenna and I went on for four minutes and 14seconds, so I wasn't able to ask the minister one final question, a very important one. I would ask you to take that into account and allow me to ask MinisterMcKenna one last question, please. the chair: The person chairing the meeting uses their judgment and does their best to keep an eye on what's going on. I think it's more or less equal for all the members, but I apologize if the honourable member feels that he was denied a few seconds. bill blair: The decision to close the border was made in Canada by Canadians in the best interest of Canadians. todd doherty: When will the government be in a position to inform Canadians of any changes to the agreement? hon. bill blair: I'm pleased to advise the member that we're continuing to monitor the situation, but I'm strongly of the opinion that the circumstances on both sides of our border do not indicate that this is the right time to make a change in the restrictions. todd doherty: Can the government confirm whether there are any discussions about reopening the border to certain modes of transportation and restricting others? the chair: Before I go to the minister, I want to remind the honourable members that we do have translators, and they are trying to translate. With respect to them, I know we're trying to get as many questions in as possible, but they do have to translate them, so please be considerate of our interpreters. chrystia freeland (deputy prime minister and minister of intergovernmental affairs): Let me please inform the honourable member that we are, of course, aware that the current agreement expires. navdeep bains: We are engaged with the industry, and we are working with them on a solution, Mr. Chair, will this relief package include funding for airline ticket refunds similar to what other countries around the world have done? Yes or no? hon. Chair, I can confirm that Air Canada has now adopted a policy of checking temperatures for passengers boarding Air Canada flights. Last week I asked the Minister of Labour if they were aware of a letter written on April 6 by CUPE to the Minister of Transport and the Minister of Labour. Minister, were you aware of that letter? the chair: I want to remind the honourable members to place their questions through the Chair and not directly. todd doherty: On April 6, CUPE wrote a letter to the Minister of Transport and the Minister of Labour. Before that I had conversations with CUPE with respect to flight attendants and the use of personal protective equipment. todd doherty: Can the minister confirm whether or not they have provided PPE to the flight attendants and/or training for front-line staff for airlines and airports? hon. This has become a policy to ensure the safety not only of passengers on board but also of the flight attendants and flight crew. He stated that he couldn't give his small business tenants a break on rent because the government is penalizing him for paying off his mortgage. Chair, as you know, we laid out the CECRA program just last week, and we are encouraging landlords to take that opportunity to support the renters. Is the minister aware of this, and are they trying to revise the CECRA program? hon. mona fortier: As you know, we've been working with provinces and territories to present that program. We are asking, actually encouraging, landlords to do their part and help tenants, like the one you mentioned, go through this. It's been heartbreaking, frankly, to hear that everything they've built and sacrificed for is in serious jeopardy, and through no fault of their own. Your government has created programs that are supposed to help them, but many legitimate businesses aren't able to apply. I'm hoping to hear specifics, not just nice words, on what you're going to do to help them. First, businesses that recently incorporatedfor example, in late 2019are unable to apply their entire 2019 payroll. As a result, many are falling short of the $20,000 payroll threshold required to qualify for this loan. What is your government going to do about these three scenarios? the chair: I just want to remind honourable members to place their questions through the Chair and not directly to the minister. As well, please take into consideration the interpreters, who have to listen and translate, so that we can have this conversation. Right from the very beginning, we've always said that we will listen and that we will work to make sure that measures go out to help our Canadian small businesses. She's absolutely right: 98% of all our businesses in this country are small businesses, so they absolutely contribute enormously to our communities and are job creators. For the Canada emergency business account, over 550,000 small businesses have been approved and are getting that support. I can assure the honourable member that we will continue to do this work so that businesses, all businesses, are supported, whether it is helping keep your employees together, helping with rent support, helping to keep your business's expenses low, or of course helping with the capital that is needed so that you can pay your operating expenses and your bills through this difficult time. Moving on, there are two issues regarding the 50% commercial rent assistance subsidy, where landlords pay 25%, the government pays 50%, and the tenant is responsible for 25%. First, many of the small landlords aren't able to take a 25% hit to their income, and are unable to provide the subsidy to their tenants. Second, with the 70% decline in revenue threshold for small businesses to even be eligible for the rent assist, many restaurants are at 65% or 67% decline. What is the government planning to do to streamline this program for small businesses that can't access but desperately need the rent subsidy? hon. Chair, as the Minister of Official Languages, I just want to raise the fact that interpretation is very complicated right now. In order to make sure that we can continue to uphold bilingualism within the House, I would love it if my colleagues could take down the pace a bit. I just want to remind everyone again that when you're asking a question, make sure you are doing it at a pace at which you're considering the people who are interpreting ms. mona fortier: As you know, we've been working with the provinces and territories to provide this forgivable loan to commercial property owners, who in turn lower the rent of their tenants by 75%. It will be very important that we understand what happens across the country, and we will monitor and adapt the program as we ms. Chair, it has been in the media quite a bit that this rent subsidy is not helping many, many, many small business owners. It's falling short of everything that was announced, so I think it needs to be taken a bit more seriously than that. We know that some still fall through the cracks and we will look at how we can continue to support businesses across the country. alexandra mends (brossardsaint-lambert, lib.)): We are now going to Mr. Three weeks ago, on April 17, the Minister of Canadian Heritage announced funding of $500 million to assist Canada's arts, sports and cultural sectors. steven guilbeault (minister of canadian heritage): Madam Chair, we will be releasing the details of that announcement, and how the money is going to be spent, in the coming days. kevin waugh: We all know that many media organizations, large and small, in Canada are struggling right now. Allegations have arisen that the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, CBC, is currently engaging in predatory behaviour and taking advantage of the current situation to harm its competitors using rate cuts. kevin waugh: Local community and ethnic media outlets and papers have strong ties to their communities that often go much deeper than the major media outlets. Is the government currently using any local or ethnic media outlets to provide crucial coronavirus information through advertising? hon. We need to get the information to Canadians on COVID-19, which is why we have started an ad-buy campaign of $30 million, which is being distributed in more than 900 local, regional and national newspapers across the country and 500 radio and TV stations in 12 different languages, including Farsi, Mandarin, Spanish, Italian and many more. It has received two ads from an ad agency in connection with the $30 million the government is doling out to help media outlets. Is this the kind of money you're attempting to dole out to help media: two ads in eight weeks? hon. steven guilbeault: Madam Chair, we have been doing a number of things for our media in Canada over the last few months and will continue to do so. On top of that $30 million ad-buy campaign, we have been investing $50 million in local journalism. Just this year, it means that 200 journalists will be hired in areas across the country where journalism is more poorly defined. kevin waugh: Madam Chair, last week, as the minister would know, 15 community newspapers, including eight in Manitoba and seven in the province of Ontario, closed their doors for good. Is the government currently planning any further measures aimed at assisting community or ethnic media organizations? We understand that many more will close their doors within the next 30 to 60 days. steven guilbeault: We are planning a number of other measures, some of which will be included in the $500 million. Of the $595 million that the media will receive, we have a tax credit that has now entered into force, and the cheques should be in the mail by the end of the summer. So there are a number of things we've done and a number of things we will be doing in the coming months as well. kevin waugh: Well, finally, you have the five members associated with that committee to dole out the $595 million. colleague that in order for us to provide tax breaks for the 2019 period, media outlets had to file their tax returns so we could go ahead. jol godin (portneufjacques-cartier, cpc): Thank you, MadamChair. This being the first time I've had the floor during a virtual sitting of Parliament, I'd like to take this opportunity to greet my fellow members, all 259participants. I'd like to talk about the Prime Minister's appearance on the show Tout le monde en parle. This is what he had to say about his economic recovery plan:     We are going to remain focused on the economy as a wholeinnovationresearch and science, the green economy and a fairer economyThere are things we are all reflecting on right now that reflection is going to continue. Can the government assure Canadians that it is being proactive and working on a plan to get the economy moving again? It must act now. Our government is wholly committed to restarting the economy, and we are working closely with the provinces to do just that. Last week, our government, together with the provincial and territorial premiers, released the principles that will guide efforts to restore economic activity across the country. jol godin: MadamChair, before we go any further, since it took a while for the minister, or the government, to answer the question, can I have that time back to ask questions? the acting chair (mrs. The Prime Minister's answer during his appearance on Tout le monde en parle didn't inspire much confidence and doesn't line up with the Deputy Prime Minister's comments. How can the government be proud of announcing $252million in assistance for the agri-food sector, when that is less than 1% of all the program funding the government has committed to help Canadians get through the COVID-19 crisis? Clearly, the government doesn't see the food supply chain as a priority and has no regard for farmers and pork and beef producers. Does the government realize that eating is vital to Canadians? When is the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food going to adjust the program and show respect for Canadian farmers? hon. This week, we focused on beef and pork producers and processors, as well as sectors with product surpluses that can be redirected to food banks. I can assure my fellow member that this is an additional step and that more supports are on the way in the weeks ahead. PortneufJacques-Cartier is home to a company that is already licensed by Health Canada and that, for 20years, has been manufacturing medical equipment including masks, face shields and thermometers. In mid-March, Health Canada reached out to the company to find out how much equipment it could manufacture to help fight COVID-19. The company confirmed that it could immediately start producing 200,000masks a week, ramping up to a million masks over the next few weeks. Can the health minister tell us why, 45days later, this company licensed by Health Canada hasn't received an order? hon. Industry and suppliers have enthusiastically answered our call to equip Canada with products and goods during the crisis. Seniors living alone are most at risk of economic insecurity, particularly single senior women, as gender inequality in the job market has translated all too often into inadequate retirement income. Madam Chair, can the minister commit to implementing a poverty reduction plan that addresses the unique challenges faced by older women? hon. deb schulte: Madam Chair, I want to assure the member that we are quite aware that this pandemic has typically affected single seniors, and many of those, given that they live longer, are single senior women. I want to assure her that we are working on this issue, and we have provided some supports already through measures such as the GST supplementary payment. jenica atwin: Madam Chair, older women represent a high proportion of residents in long-term care facilities. Having spent their lives caring for parents, children and often their partners, they find themselves needing care in nursing homes. Multiple outbreaks of COVID-19 in long-term care homes in Canada have highlighted systemic gaps that senior and elderly women may face in such facilities, as well as the working conditions of the female-dominated ranks of nurses and personal support workers. Madam Chair, can the minister commit to implementing a federal strategy for long-term care homes that recognizes quality of life for residents and working conditions for the employees, ideally one that goes hand in hand with a poverty reduction plan and enhanced home and community care investments across the country? hon. We are obviously deeply saddened by the outbreaks that have been going on in long-term care facilities and those who have lost their lives. We do recognize that the administration of long-term care and palliative care is the responsibility of provinces and territories; however, we have been taking a team Canada approach, and as you already know, we've been doing tremendous work with them to try to ensure that those who live in those facilities can be well cared for and safe. jenica atwin: Madam Chair, from May 4 to May 10, we are observing Mental Health Week. We know that our essential workers right now are experiencing unprecedented levels of stress and anxiety, on top of putting their own physical safety and health on the line. Most of these workers work in precarious jobs with no access to paid sick leave or vacation, and without any benefits to access mental health services. Apart from the very welcome investments in online resources, can the minister explain how the government will support these workers now and once the crisis is behind us? hon. I'm so glad that she's raising the issue of mental health and in particular how poor mental health is oftentimes connected to our socio-economic status. We do have new resources that are available to all Canadians free of charge through the Wellness Together portal, but there is more to do. I think the announcement of top-up wages, for example, which the Prime Minister spoke about today, is another example of how we're taking the health and wellness of all low-income Canadians very seriously. We know that mental health is not divorced from socio-economic status, and I look forward to working with her more on other measures that we can take together. jenica atwin: Madam Chair, we're all very aware of the importance of temporary foreign workers and their role in ensuring our food sovereignty across this country. How are we protecting them? Madam Chair, will the government take action to strengthen legislation and ensure Canadians have access to the food they need while the workers who help bring it to our tables have safe working conditions, regardless of where they are working in this country? hon. We are very concerned, as are countries around the world, that we support and create the environment for the health and safety of our temporary foreign workers and we value their contribution to our food supply chain here in Canada. We have issued guidelines to employers and are working very closely with local public health authorities in the provinces and territories to make sure workers are protected, that physical distancing and other recommendations are adhered to and that there are severe consequences if employers don't take care of their workers. alistair macgregor (cowichanmalahatlangford, ndp): Thank you, Madam Chair. My first question is this: Will the Liberal government prevent federal bailout funds from going to companies that use tax havens and avoid paying their fair share here in Canada, yes or no? hon. diane lebouthillier (minister of national revenue): We are working to make sure that anyone who tries to circumvent the rules faces serious consequences. Anyone who abuses the program could face fines of up to 225% of the subsidy amount as well as five years in prison. alistair macgregor: Madam Chair, I didn't really hear a yes to that question, so I'll repeat it. Does the government really think it's appropriate for tax-avoiding corporations to receive funding provided for by taxpayers? hon. alistair macgregor: Madam Chair, the agriculture funding announced by the government earlier this week amounts to less than 10% of what the Canadian Federation of Agriculture estimates will be required to help farmers weather this crisis. I have to remind my colleague that we have put in $5 billion through FCC, $50 million for the temporary foreign workers, two times $50 million for pork and beef producers this week, and $77 million for food processing. This is only the beginning, and we should not forget that the business risk management programs are still there to offer support. alistair macgregor: Yes, Madam Chair, but we're nearly two months into this pandemic and this announcement only came this week. marie-claude bibeau: Madam Chair, we are working closely with the farmers and their representatives to identify where the gaps are, but once again, we have made improvements to the AgriStability program. They can get, depending on the province, either 50% or 75% in advance payments, and they can also, right now, access their AgriInvest program. There is more than $2 billion ready to access today, if they have the acting chair (mrs. alistair macgregor: Madam Chair, federal disability recipients and seniors on fixed incomes have been hardest hit by cost of living increases from COVID-19. If we acknowledge that $2,000 per month is the minimum needed to get through this time, why are they being asked to survive on far less? When can they expect assistance, and how much will they receive? hon. deb schulte: Madam Chair, I want to make sure people realize that we have provided some assistance through the GST supplementary benefit. We are also providing support to those who are still working, and we have done that by allowing them to access the CERB. alistair macgregor: Madam Chair, as I think we've heard through today's question period, there are countless example of this government designing programs to exclude many small businesses that desperately need help. Whether it's the payroll requirements or other eligibility, we still, to this day, almost two months into the pandemic, have too many small businesses falling through the cracks. Madam Chair, why has the government taken this approach and when can we finally expect fixes to the whole system? hon. mary ng: Madam Chair, right from the get-go, we have been committed to making sure that Canadians are helped through this crisis, and that small businesses get the support that they need, so that we are saving businesses and jobs in this country. yves perron (berthiermaskinong, bq): Thank you, Mr.Chair. I hear the questions my fellow members are asking, and to be frank, I don't find the answers satisfactory. It is well and good to talk about existing programs, but they aren't working, so enough with that refrain. This morning, both farmers and processors came together for a press conference at the Union des producteurs agricoles's head office in Longueuil. Can the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food therefore tell us when she will announce significant supports for the industry? hon. marie-claude bibeau: We have already announced significant amounts of support, and more is on the way. It's not that the programs aren't working; it's that they aren't generous enough in farmers' eyes. That's why I'm working with my provincial counterparts to make improvements to programming, including AgriStability. After using the online AgriStability benefit estimator, a pork producer found out that he would get $11 per head, as they say in the industry. Pork producers are calling for $20 per head, so it's a good start, even though it's not enough and it isn't what they are asking for. We want to keep working together, but farmers have to access the money available to them through AgriStability. Even before the crisis, we were hearing from people in the industry that the programs were neither suitable nor sufficient. A few days ago, the government announced $50million in funding for pork producers, even though they are asking for $20per hog for 27million hogs. When is the government going to announce a whole lot more in funding support? What's been announced so far is only 10% of what farmers are asking for. However, I would point out to the member that, when it comes to AgriRecovery, we made an exception to the rule. That's two funding envelopes of $50million each to help cover the additional costs from the decrease in plant processing capacity. As the Prime Minister said, we are going to do more, and we are moving forward step by step. yves perron: What we concluded in committee this week is that the $125million is not new money. The government can't say that programs already exist and, at the same time, claim that they are new programs. Everyone knows that the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement came into force a month earlier than planned, despite the promises that had been made. An easy way to make money available without committing new spending is to provide compensation and announce programs for supply-managed sectors that got nothing. It seems to me that a time of crisis is a time for the government to practise some judo and announce measures. I am reaching out to the government, as I always do, but it has to come forward with announcements. marie-claude bibeau: Our commitment to farmers in supply-managed sectorsmeaning, egg, poultry and dairy farmersis as strong as it always was. Support for poultry and egg farmers is in the form of investment programs, which aligns well with the recovery. At this time, we are focusing on emergency programs to help farmers hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. As you know, legislative changes are needed to grant the Canadian Dairy Commission's request and increase its borrowing limit by $200million so it can buy more butter and cheese. Chair, we're all inundated, as we've heard during this entire question period, with Canadians' concerns about the economic restrictions and the social restrictions that they're under. Over the last couple of months, the WHO has given one very consistent message in terms of coming out of those economic and social restrictions. Tedros said in his briefing, We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test. On March 25, 44 days ago, he said, Aggressive measures to find, isolate, test, treat and trace are not only the best and fastest way out of extreme social and economic restrictionstheyre also the best way to prevent them. Does the minister agree with the WHO that relentless testing and tracing are critical to a successful economic and social relaunch strategy in Canada? hon. Absolutely, we agree that testing and contact tracing will form an important part of our response to living with COVID. We've been investing heavily in ensuring that we have the lab capacity, the collaboration across provinces and territories, and the variety of testing options to help us increase our capacity to test. We are aiming right now for a high volume of tests, but I will also say that in Canada we have one of the highest testing rates in the world. Although we're doing well, I can assure him that I am with him and I believe we need to do more. Chair, as I mentioned to his colleagues yesterday, we have currently the capacity to do approximately 60,000 tests per day across the country. Chair, it's hard for me to get that exact number, but I will get back to him with the exact number. She said, As a first tranche, roughly close to 60,000 is where the provinces can potentially expand to as a target already. Does the minister happen to know, ballpark, what the average number of daily tests in Canada has been since that statement? hon. patty hajdu: Your estimate was slightly higher than what my estimate was going to be, so that's a great piece of news. Listen, I will just say that I think if the premise here is that we could be doing more testing. I would agree, but I will also say that the provinces and territories are working incredibly hard on testing strategies that meet their own specific needs. Tam works with all the chief public health officers across the country to ensure that their testing strategy is going to be applicable and appropriate for their particular jurisdictions. mike lake: Following up on that, is there a jurisdiction in Canada where relentless testing is not the appropriate strategy as provinces consider relaunching? hon. For example, in British Columbia, where there are relatively fewer cases in general and less disease activity, they may have a different testing strategy than a province like Ontario, which is currently struggling with more outbreaks. mike lake: Given your comment that our current testing capability is 60,000, and acknowledging that only at one point in the entire history of our COVID response, over several months, has our weekly average been over 30,000it was about 31,000 for one day on a rolling basisMinister, are you satisfied with our current testing amounts right now, given that we're testing 50% of what the public health officer advises would be best? hon. patty hajdu: I'm so amazed by the work the provinces and territories have done in a very short time to increase their capacity. We are supporting them with the tools that they need to get more testing done, but also to have other components in place that will allow them to do the rapid tracing of positive cases. I think it's very important to remember that testing strategies will be different across the provinces, based on the outbreak disease epidemiology. Having said that, I know that we can all do better, and I'm certain that my counterparts feel the same"

        "Query": "Summarize the difficulties faced by secondary schools in carrying out curriculum reform, the opinions on support or changes of circumstances, the stress faced by the oil and gas industry, and the discussion about restoring Canadian businesses during the pandemic. Additionally, provide insights on the perspectives of Heather McPherson and Chrystia Freeland on restoring Canadian businesses during the pandemic.",
        "Summary": "Despite some primary schools having surplus funds, many secondary schools are facing deficits and a lack of funds. Additionally, there is a shortage of teachers with appropriate training. Concerns arise regarding the ability of lower-tier schools to adapt to the new curriculum and improve teaching quality. The approach to students has not changed, but individual circumstances may require adjustments from the Student Loans Company. Challenges in service delivery may arise due to staff shortages caused by illness, self-isolation, or adherence to social-distancing measures. Early monitoring was implemented due to the presence of campuses and activities in China and Southeast Asia. The oil and gas industry has been heavily impacted by anti-oil and gas lobby groups, resulting in the introduction of bills that restrict major projects and oil shipping. These actions have caused a significant decline in investment and a recession in the Alberta economy. Members express concerns about the government's handling of pandemic-related restrictions, particularly in relation to reopening businesses and providing effective stimulus. They emphasize the need to reopen fishing, restore agricultural supply chains, and support farmers. Questions are raised about the government's response to outbreaks in meat-packing plants and the provision of financial support to workers in unsafe conditions. The government is also questioned about providing pandemic relief funds to businesses utilizing tax havens. Hon. Chrystia Freeland acknowledges the hard work of farmers and emphasizes the importance of a safe working environment, trusting the Food Inspection Agency to regulate conditions.",
        "Article": "anthony rota (nipissingtimiskaming, lib.)): I call the meeting to order.  Welcome to the third meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. Pursuant to the order of reference of Monday, April20, the committee is meeting for the purposes of considering ministerial announcements, allowing members to present petitions, and questioning ministers of the crown, including the Prime Minister, in respect of the COVID-19 pandemic. I understand there's an agreement to observe a moment of silence in memory of the six members of the Canadian Armed Forces who lost their lives last Wednesday in a helicopter crash off the coast of Greece. Colleagues, we meet today to continue our discussion about how our country is dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. As we do, Canadians, like everyone around the world, are doing their best to live their lives until things improve. Meanwhile, as we look towards the future, I believe that it is also important to remember our past and to continue to mark the important moments in our shared history. Andrea McCrady, is performing a special recital to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Netherlands by the Canadian Forces. In May 1945, Canadian Forces played a major role in liberating the Dutch people from Nazi occupation. May 5 is now a national holiday in the Netherlands that commemorates the event and the great friendship that now exists between our two countries. Let me remind you that, as in the House or in committee, members may not take photographs of their colleagues or film the proceedings. In order to facilitate the work of our interpreters and ensure orderly meetings, I will outline a few rules. If you look at the bottom, you have a little flag that indicates whether it's English or French, and that's how we will be speaking.  I would like to remind members that petitions presented during a meeting of the special committee must already have been certified by the clerk of petitions.  In addition, to ensure that the petition is considered to have been properly presented, the certificate of the petition and each page of the petition for petitions certified in a previous Parliament should be emailed to the committee no later than 6 p.m. It includes removing the mandatory 10-day reflection period and the number of required witnesses who will witness a person's consent. The petitioners urge the House of Commons to immediately discontinue the removal of safeguards for people requesting euthanasia, and to put in place additional measures to protect vulnerable people. Petitioners call on members of the House, and hopefully the Senate as well, to support Bill S-204, which would make it a criminal offence for a person to go abroad and receive an organ for which there has not been consent. It would also create provisions under which a person could be made inadmissible to Canada if they had been involved in organ harvesting or trafficking. I want to remind all the members that there are specific headsets that have been mandated to all of us. If you don't have one, please talk to your IT ambassador and they will get one to you as quickly as possible. The reason for them is not so much for what you hear, but that our interpreters are working and there are work conditions that really make it difficult. Part of that is not having the appropriate boom on your headset, which will make it very difficult for them to hear and interpret for our members. The petitioners have noted that there are approximately 60 indigenous languages in Canada and that 2019, last year, was declared by the UN to be the year of indigenous languages. They draw attention to article 13 of the UNDRIP and to the TRC's calls to action numbers 13 to 16. Fundamentally, they call upon the Government of Canada to recognize indigenous languages as being official languages of Canada and to have each language recognized nationally, with implementations on regional and provincial levels, acknowledging that many regions have different languages. Chair, I am proud to present a petition on behalf of one of my constituents, Myles Lynch of St. Myles lives with cystic fibrosis and has had three lung transplants in the last five years, and he's only 22 years old. One thing Myles has been advocating for is the creation of a national opt-out program for organ donation. I am proud to have this certified today, with 1,318 signatures, asking the Standing Committee on Health to launch a study into the feasibility of the creation of a national opt-out program. I give kudos to Myles not only for his strength personally but also for his advocacy for others and for saving lives in our country by advocating for a better and an improved organ donation system. Chair, I'm very pleased to present this certified petition on behalf of several dozen residents of Toronto, Mississauga and Brampton, Ontario, who add their voices to those of the thousands upon thousands of Canadians who have signed similar petitions. Given that Canadians are living through unprecedented, catastrophic climate events, and at the same time our society, as you know, is suffering from worsening social and economic inequalitieshalf of Canadian families are only $200 away from insolvency in any given monthand particularly given the pandemic that we are currently experiencing, these petitioners are calling on the Government of Canada to support motion M-1, a made-in-Canada green new deal that I am presenting in front of the House of Commons. It calls on Canada to take bold and rapid action to tackle the climate emergency, and to put in place a shift to a clean and renewable energy economy. Chair, it's an honour to table a petition on behalf of constituents from CourtenayAlberni. Over 12,000 Canadians have died over the last four years due to fentanyl-poisoned sources. They cite that the current war on drugs has been costly and grossly ineffective; that it has resulted in widespread stigma towards addiction and against those who use illicit drugs; and that criminalization of particular substances has resulted in the establishment of a drug trade that now trafficks dangerous and lethal products such as fentanyl. They are citing that regulating to ensure safe sources, with proper measures and bylaws, will reduce the criminal element associated with street drugs. They are calling on the Government of Canada to declare the current opioid overdose and fenanyl poisoning crisis a national public health emergency under the Emergencies Act. They are calling for the government to reform current drug policy to decriminalize personal possession, as has been done in Portugal and other countries, and to create with urgency and immediacy a system to provide safe and unadulterated access to substances so that people who use substances experimentally, recreationally or chronically are not at imminent risk of overdose due to a contaminated source. Chair, I'm presenting a petition today that contains the concerns of Canadians in my riding with the government's approach to firearms legislation and regulation. The petition highlights that the Liberal government's December 5, 2019, Speech from the Throne contains numerous inaccuracies about current firearms legislation and regulation; that the term military-style assault rifles is a political phrase undefined in Canadian law; that municipalities are constitutionally unable to enact criminal law to ban handguns in their jurisdictions; that the experts, including chiefs of police, agree that banning firearms and requiring law-abiding gun owners to follow more unnecessary red tape will not increase public safety; that the majority of guns used in violent crimes are smuggled into Canada from the United States; and that the Liberal government continues to target law-abiding firearms owners instead of the gangs, drug traffickers and illegal gun traffickers responsible for violence in our communities. The petitioners in MissionMatsquiFraser Canyon are calling on the government to stop targeting law-abiding firearms owners; to cancel all plans to confiscate firearms legally owned by federally licensed, RCMP-vetted Canadians; and to focus our limited resources on anti-gang enforcement, on reducing the involvement of at-risk youth and gangs, on mental health and on providing the Canada Border Services Agency with the tools they need to do their job effectively. I would like to remind honourable members that no member shall be recognized for more than five minutes at a time and that members may split their time with one or more members by so indicating to the chair. I want to again remind honourable members to use the boom on the official headsets so that everything runs smoothly, not only for ourselves but also for the interpreters. pierre paul-hus (charlesbourghaute-saint-charles, cpc): Thank you, Mr.Chair. Although we are right in the middle of a pandemic and the government has agreed to set aside all parliamentary business in order to concentrate solely on eliminating the virus in Canada and its impacts, the Prime Minister is deceiving Canadians by introducing measures to punish law-abiding firearm owners. justin trudeau (prime minister): Mr.Chair, I feel that all Canadians were affected by the massacre in Nova Scotia. During the last election campaign, we promised to ban military-style assault weapons, and that is exactly what we have done. It is a shame that, once more, the Conservatives do not want to strengthen gun control in the country. However, I would like to know whether he considers that, with this order in council, organized crime, street gangs and other criminals are simply going to turn in their weapons. We are doing other things to eliminate or restrict handguns in our municipalities, to strengthen the control at our borders, and to implement other measures. member speak of those measures, because we are going to work together in the House to strengthen gun control. I hope that the Conservative Party will be part of that discussion in a positive way, in order to keep Canadians safe. pierre paul-hus: Mr.Chair, I can simply say to the Prime Minister that the Conservative Party has always been committed to battling criminals, not law-abiding citizens. Speaking of criminals, we know that, even before the pandemic, the Prime Minister had asked the Parole Board of Canada to release prisoners more easily and more quickly. The Minister of Public Safety told us that the people were approaching the end of their sentences or were older, but we are learning in the media that some dangerous criminals are being released. justin trudeau: The protection, the safety and the health of all Canadians are important for the government. This is why we have taken additional measures in our correctional services to ensure that guards and inmates are protected. We have indeed opened the doors to some more speedy releases, but only in very specific cases that present little or no danger for Canadians. pierre paul-hus: So is the Prime Minister confirming to us that no dangerous criminals have been precipitously released so that they do not have to experience COVID-19 within the walls? right hon. justin trudeau: There are very strict rules and principles to ensure that people posing a threat to society are not released. Is Canada going to stand by its allies in the Five Eyes and demand that the Chinese government be completely transparent? right hon. justin trudeau: We continue to stand in solidarity with our allies, including the Five Eyes, as they have stood in solidarity with Canada in terms of the two Canadians who have been unjustly detained for a long time in China. In the coming months and years, we expect to obtain answers to all our questions about the origin of this pandemic, including questions that are important for China. At the same time, we are going to work hard to ensure that all Canadians have the equipment and the protection they need to get through this pandemic. yves-franois blanchet (beloeilchambly, bq): Thank you, Mr.Chair. For some days, discussions have been going on between people from the Bloc Qubcois and people from the government with a view to collaboratively coming up with a proposal for seniors in Quebec and Canada. The gist of our proposal is to temporarily increase the old age security by about $25per week, or $110per month. The discussion has been going on for some time and it's a proposal that we made in the election campaign. Given that impatience, I realized I should not be the one answering them, it should be the Prime Minister. So here is my question for the Prime Minister: what are you doing to seek a solution that will increase the purchasing power of seniors in Quebec and Canada in the very short term? right hon. justin trudeau: Clearly, seniors need support and significant services from us because of COVID-19. Our priority was to implement income replacement benefits for workers who have lost their jobs because of COVID-19. The most vulnerable seniors are going to receive reimbursement of the GST, which will help them very quickly. We have also channelled $9million through the United Way, to help the most vulnerable seniors. I am very pleased that we have been able to work with other parliamentarians, including those in the Bloc Qubcois, to hear these concerns and to find the best way to help seniors in the short term. In terms of the pandemic, they have concerns about their physical security, but also about their financial security. yves-franois blanchet: In the last few hours, the Prime Minister has indicated that he could need the cooperation of other parties, including the Bloc Qubcois, on a completely different matter. We are very open to that discussion, but we want the same openness when we are asking for something to serve the people of Quebec. Seniors in my constituency, as in any other of the 338constituencies, are asking what we are doing. When will there be something for them? I want to be able to give them an answer of some kind. justin trudeau: There will be announcements in the coming days on the way in which we will be able to help seniors, particularly the most vulnerable seniors. There are horror stories, whether about the CHSLDs, or about our most vulnerable seniors across the country. There are seniors who are alone, seniors who are afraid of falling ill without ever seeing their grandchildren or their children again. We have to be there for those who belong to that great generation that fought for us during the second world war. Chair, every day I hear from people who are struggling to pay their bills and to keep a roof over their head. Instead of making sure that Canadians get the help they need, the government has created complicated programs that are still letting people fall through the cracks. If the Prime Minister won't commit to a universal benefit, will he at least commit to removing the restrictive eligibility criteria that are leaving the most vulnerable people behind? right hon. Chair, we knew, when this pandemic hit, that we needed to help Canadians who were suffering from coast to coast to coast, particularly the most vulnerable. That is why we moved forward rapidly with the Canada emergency response benefit, which has helped over seven million individual Canadians and has made a huge difference. We had to move very quickly to get this money out to people, and that is exactly what we did. That is why since that moment, we have continually worked on reaching out to the most vulnerable and supporting them as well. However, because she didn't make $5,000 last year, when the pandemic hit she didn't qualify for any benefits. Chair, our focus throughout this crisis has been on helping the most vulnerable with targeted measures that will lift Canadians out of poverty and will support them. Over the past five years, we've lifted over a million people out of poverty in this country, and we've continued to put the most vulnerable at the heart of everything we're doing. At the same time, we will continue to look for more ways to help even more than the seven million Canadians who successfully receive the CERB. We recognize there's more to do, and we will continue trying to do everything we can in this unprecedented situation. Chair, the government is weirdly committed to eligibility criteria that result in regular people not getting the support they need, but not so committed to criteria for corporations and billionaires who get our help. If a company is cheating the public, using offshore tax havens not to pay its fair share, it should not be eligible for government bailouts or benefits. Other countries, like Poland, Denmark and France, have made this commitment, and if they can do it, so can we. Will he commit now that if a company has money in offshore tax havens, it will not receive public funds? right hon. Chair, the measures we've put forward are focused on helping workers who lose their jobs, regardless of the companies they work for. It is a shame to hear the NDP, which used to be the party of workers, choosing to judge workers by which multinational they work for. We have moved forward with a wage subsidy such that the employers are obliged to pass every single penny on to the workers. That is help for the workers, and that has been our focus all the way through: ordinary Canadians who need support because they are unable to work because of COVID-19. I want to remind honourable members that we're trying to stay within committee rules, which state that the length of a question and the length of an answer should be approximately the same amount of time. She has about 45 seconds left, and hopefully that's about half and half for the question and the answer. My community was facing a crisis long before the pandemic hit, and now people who are living on the streets or in parks don't have the luxury of following public health advice and just staying home. In Victoria, the province and the municipality have stepped up with solutions to house people, at least for the short term, in local hotels. Will the federal government respond to this immediate crisis and provide the needed investments in long-term, stable housing? the chair: The right honourable Prime Minister, in 25 seconds or less, please. Working with partners, we have reduced poverty by over a million people in this country, but there is more to do. We recognize that during this pandemic there's even more to do for vulnerable Canadians, and we are partnering with orders of government to make sure that happens. jol godin (portneufjacques-cartier, cpc): A point of order, Mr.Chair. Could we please check so that I can hear in French what the Prime Minister is saying? the chair: Okay. I'm speaking English right now and I'm on the English toggle at the bottom of the screen. It does create a bit of a disjoint when we're speaking, but it's the way to get around that so we have interpretation that works for everyone. Chair, as this is our first opportunity to meet in any forum, I want to take this opportunity to express my condolences to the families of the brave men and women who lost their lives in the helicopter crash. I know that I speak for all parliamentarians when I extend our sympathy to their families and loved ones. Chair, I want to raise with the Prime Minister an issue that I've raised several times before, and that is a gap in the wage subsidy program. Those companies separately would qualify for the wage subsidy, but because of rules that the government designed, together they do not. Even though collectively they have experienced a massive drop in revenue and would otherwise be eligible, so far they've been unable to get confirmation that they will be able to access the program. Will the Prime Minister be able to deliver some good news to people who work for Brandt Tractor all across the country? right hon. justin trudeau: I thank the honourable member for his question and for his advocacy for his community and businesses in his riding. As I told him when we spoke directly, Finance officials have been directly in contact with the company in his riding. We recognize that there are particular elements in regard to this company that are challenging around application for the wage subsidy, but I know that Finance officials are working very hard to try to make sure that everyone who needs the subsidy gets it, so that the workers in his community can get the support they need. andrew scheer: The Prime Minister knows that there are many companies across the country that fall into this category as well, so we're hoping for some good news. Just flagging the time and date, it is well into May now and important decisions have to be made in very short order. There are other aspects of the government's plans to help get people through this crisis that are also causing people to fall through the cracks. As provinces start to open up, many companies are going to be faced with a very difficult decision of operating at perhaps 35% or 45% of regular revenues. They will not be able to access these programs and, in many cases, there is going to be a disincentive to reopen and put people back to work. Will the Prime Minister amend these programs to provide for more flexibility so that more and more Canadians can start to return to work in the weeks ahead? right hon. Chair, we are in an unprecedented crisis and we had to move quickly to support workers and to support families across the country, and that's exactly what we did. We're going to continue to work to try to respond to the reality that people and businesses are facing right across the country. I am eager to be faced with the challenge of how to ease off in these measures so that people can get back to work. We are still focused very much on giving the supports to workers and families that are so necessary in this time of crisis. As different provinces move forward towards reopening, as we look at different paths forward, I know that I will be able to count on all members in the House and, indeed, on Canadians from coast to coast to coast to figure out together what the best way will be to move forward on keeping us safe and restoring economic activity in the right way. the chair: We have about a minute left for maybe a 30-second question and a 30-second answer. The problems with them have been flagged for the government for weeks as well, but we're also going to see an additional challenge, where people who are receiving the emergency response benefit, who may have the option to go back to work and work some hours, are faced with a hard cap of $1,000 a month before they lose the CERB. Conservatives are proposing a progressive system, a more flexible system, where people will be able to earn more without losing their benefits as businesses ramp up but before normal working hours are restored. Again, will the Prime Minister build in some flexibility to lift the restrictive ceiling on what people can earn before losing benefits so that it always pays more to work? the chair: I believe the timer is telling all of us that the time is up, but I'll give the right honourable Prime Minister about 30 seconds to answer that, please. Our priority was getting support for Canadians right across the country with the CERB, with the wage subsidy and with other measures for students, for seniors, for farmers and for agricultural producers. We are going to work with communities and with industry as we look to reopen, to make sure that people have opportunities to work and are not penalized for it. However, our overarching priority was allowing Canadians to be confident in their ability to stay home, care for their loved ones, buy groceries and pay their rent so that we could keep safe during this pandemic. We've heard the Prime Minister admit that fixed incomes for some of them are down, rent is increasing and the price of groceries is increasing. Chair, after a lifetime of hard work, of course Canadians deserve peace of mind when it comes to their retirement security. Happily, their pensions and their benefits are still flowing, unlike for so many of those who have lost their jobs, but it's still tough. People received a GST credit, a supplementary payment that was $400 on average for single seniors and $600 for couples. I think you had reminded us as members that the amount of time for the answer should be similar to the amount of time for the question. the chair: I want to remind all honourable members to keep their answers as well as their questions as concise as possible. We see a number of inconsistencies in what is considered essential travel with regard to the U.S. While we have Americans coming over to buy cheaper prescription medications and to fish, individuals in my riding who are trying to get auditors over so that they can be approved for export businesses are being declined. We have people who have purchased masts from Canadian producers for their boats, and who want to come and pick them up, who are not being allowed to do that. When will they clarify the rules to the CBSA agents so that essential travel and trade and commerce, including individual commerce, is understood? hon. Chair, we have implemented very rigorous rules that have been well documented and understood by CBSA to stop all non-essential travel. At the same time, we recognize the importance of maintaining essential supply routes so that goods and services could reach Canada and we could put groceries on our shelves. The work we are doing to stop non-essential travel has been important for the health and safety of Canadians, and we will continue with that work. We see that many of them are not eligible for any of the benefit packages that have been rolled outEI, CERB, the wage subsidy, etc. What is the government going to do to address sole proprietors who are currently falling through the cracks? hon. Chair, first, let me say that we absolutely recognize there are businesses across the country of all sizes that are finding this to be extremely difficult. The intent of the measures we put forward is obviously not only to give individuals a bridge but to give businesses a bridge. We are looking at ways that we can ensure that the Canada emergency business account has the broadest possible application. We are looking at ways we can consider that eligibility process, recognizing that we need to make sure that the program continues to have its desired impact, and we will have more to say on that. Since then the minister has overruled the will of harvesters in Prince Edward Island and in the gulf who voted to start their seasons on time, but she has allowed harvesters from her own riding to proceed with their seasons as scheduled, giving them access to markets weeks before their competitors. This double standard is severely unfair and Atlantic harvesters are furious, as demonstrated during the protests on the Canso Causeway yesterday. When will the minister stop abusing her position and start respecting fish harvesters by opening up lobster fishing areas 23, 24 and 26? hon. Chair, when making decisions with regard to when seasons open, a number of factors are taken into account. They are complex decisions that take into account what is necessary for processors to be ready for the season, what is necessary for harvesters to be ready for the season, as well socio-economic impacts on the area. In the decisions we've made around the gulf, one of the main things we heard from all of those areas is that it was very important for them to start on the same date. Maybe I'll start muting if it's necessary, but interrupting is not going to solve anything. West coast fishing tourism is a key economic driver in British Columbia, especially in coastal communities, and yet the public fishery gets no respect from the government. A year later, the fisheries minister refuses even to discuss viable, science-based solutions to conserve B.C.'s public fisheries. Does the minister and her government have a will and a plan to support Canada's west coast fisheries and the communities they sustain? the chair: The hon. That's why we continue to work with those communities and with the fisheries to make sure that we're doing everything we possibly can to support them. During these extremely difficult times, we're working on measures with the fishery in B.C., as well as on the Atlantic coast and eastern Quebec, to make sure that we're delivering for them and that all of the issues they're having are being addressed. Chair, Canada's seniors, especially those on basic incomes, are being hard hit by the COVID-19 crisis as they face new rising costs and scarcity of services. Seniors require adequate caregiver supports, physical safety and freedom to access their savings to reinforce their financial security. Why has the government failed to recognize the increasing challenges that seniors are facing? Will the government support Canada's senior citizens? the chair: The hon. We have provided a GST credit supplement of $400 for single seniors and $600 for couples, for low- and modest-income seniors. We have also ensured that the Canada emergency response benefit is there for seniors who have lost income due to COVID-19. On April 23, my colleagues and I called on the government to create a program that would match students seeking employment with employers in Canada's essential food supply chains. What has the government done to match students and other Canadians seeking employment with employers in the agriculture and agri-food sectors, including those in the fish and seafood sector? hon. Chair, we're doing all we can to make sure, using our existing employment programs, that we create opportunities for students to work and get work experience this summer. We know that this is going to be really tough, especially in areas like agriculture, so we have dedicated streams for agriculture sector employers to access students with help from the government, and a number of different initiatives including Canada summer jobs, which I'm really excited to see the results of in the coming days. Arnold, it's the second time that I note you've threatened to cut off a Conservative microphone. I'm just wondering, given that this isn't the House of Commons and it's structured as a committee, what standing order would give you the right to cut off a member of Parliament using a mute button. It seems a little dictatorial, and I was just wondering whether you could clarify that, based on the Standing Orders. the chair: I don't think I threatened to use mute, but thank you for bringing that up. I am trying to keep the rules where the questions and the answers are equal, so that there are no interruptions on either side. Bring the papers with the actual verbiage on it where I threatened, and we'll go over it, but I don't think this is the venue to do that. rachael harder (lethbridge, cpc): Canadians have outrightly expressed outrage and disappointment with the government's initiative to put a gun ban in place. Does the minister stand by his comment that these changes would have prevented the tragedy in Nova Scotia? the chair: The honourable minister in 15 seconds or less, please. bill blair: We have heard from health professionals, women's rights organizations, victims groups and the police and our unions. They're all very supportive of the government's measure to ban weapons that have no place in a civil society and were designed to kill people. rachael harder: It's interesting that the minister is misleading Canadians in that comment because the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police has actually said that a gun ban will do nothing of the sort, that it actually will not protect Canadians. How many criminals will see guns seized because of the changes that have been implemented by the Liberal government? hon. The Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police said that they support a prohibition on all military-designed assault rifles. The chief in Toronto said that taking those assault rifles off the streets contributes to public safety, and the Canadian Association of Police Chiefs has declared that military assault rifles are produced for the sole purpose of killing people in large numbers and they urged successive governments to enact legislation to ban all military assault rifles. Absolutely no criminals will see their guns seized based on the Liberals' legislation that's coming forward because it actually goes after those who legally own and use their firearms. Can the Prime Minister please tell us why he decided to go after law-abiding citizens instead of actually going after criminals who have gotten their firearms in an illegal manner and then used them to commit crimes? the chair: The honourable minister in 25 seconds or less, please. bill blair: Yes, to be very clear, the order in council actually is targeted at weapons, weapons that were designed for military use, and in their design and in their intent, to kill people, they've actually been used in this country, at cole Polytechnique; in Moncton; at a Quebec City mosque; in Fredericton; at Mayerthorpe and most recently in Nova Scotia. They are being used and have been used in Canada and around the world to commit mass murder, and in the interest of public safety and at the urging the chair: We'll go on to Ms. Now I understand the Prime Minister has his food prepared for him at 24 Sussex Drive and then it's delivered to him at the cottage where he lives. Now, they're in a crisis right now, which means that regular Canadians are actually at risk of not having food available for them at the grocery stores where they purchase theirs. Why doesn't the Prime Minister care about the women and the men who work incredibly hard to keep Canada fed? hon. chrystia freeland (deputy prime minister and minister of intergovernmental affairs): Mr. member that our government cares very, very much about the women and men who work so hard to feed our country. Let me just say I am grateful to all the farmers, like my dad, who are out in their fields right now getting ready for seeding. We, as Canadians, are lucky to be citizens of an agricultural superpower, and our government believes in supporting our farmers and ranchers. rachael harder: I'm confused as to why the Prime Minister didn't take my question, and at a bare minimum as to why the agriculture minister doesn't feel it's important enough for her to be a part of this discussion today. When we have farmers who produce for Canadians on a daily basis and they're asking some serious and some very important questions, and we don't even have a minister who's willing to come to the table and engage in this conversation, that's shameful. Several meat-packing plants have been forced to shut down because of COVID-19 and, as a result, farmers are forced to hold stock longer than expected. Cattle producers in my region are spending more than $60,000 a day to keep their livestock fed while they wait for processing plants to reopen. When will the government take this seriously and at least implement a set-aside program for those who are beef producers in Canada? hon. Chair, let me just say that I feel there is nothing shameful at all in having me, the Deputy Prime Minister, answer questions about agriculture. I am actually very proud to speak up for Canada's amazing farmers, for our country's amazing ranchers, for our amazing pork producers and our poultry producers. james bezan (selkirkinterlakeeastman, cpc): Thank you, Mr. I too would like to express my sincere condolences to the families and friends of the six military heroes who lost their lives at sea last week. I'm sure that all members of the House stand shoulder to shoulder with the families, with the crew of the HMCS Fredericton and, indeed, with the entire Canadian Armed Forces community during this time of grief. Can the Minister of National Defence give us an update as to the Cyclone helicopter crash off the coast of Greece last week? hon. Our number one priority is to make sure that we look after them, and that's exactly what we are doing. I actually spoke with the Italian minister of defence and he promised full support for this investigation and any support that's required. the chair: I'm afraid I'm going to have to cut you off there, if we're going by the rules that were pointed out by the House. I know that back in early January, military intelligence through CF Intelligence Command was reporting, through the chain of command, the novel coronavirus and the outbreak in Wuhan. On what date was he, as Minister of National Defence, given his first intelligence briefing on the outbreak and the pandemic in China? hon. We work with our Five Eyes intelligence sources and this has been a whole-of-government effort, right from the beginning. Obviously, I can't discuss the intelligence in this forum, but I can assure you that our response has been well informed with the correct information. james bezan: Minister Sajjan, we know that intelligence was going up the chain of command in National Defence. It was reported in the media that in early January the hierarchy within the Canadian Armed Forces was being made aware of the coronavirus outbreak. As with all our intelligence, we work together from a whole-of-government perspective with all of our intelligence agencies. One thing I can assure you is that our response has been well informed with all the correct information that is provided to me and other members of cabinet. james bezan: What was that timeline? From the time you were first told, Minister Sajjan, about the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, what did you do with that intelligence? When did you give it to the Prime Minister or to Minister Hajdu as the Minister of Health? hon. Chair, let me say that our government's response to this global pandemic has of course been informed by the excellent work of Canadian intelligence agencies throughout. In January, the Prime Minister convened a meeting of the incident response group, and in January we increased screening at all major airports. All of these actions were informed by the work of our excellent intelligence community, and of course our work with our Five Eyes, NATO and NORAD allies. james bezan: I want to come back the chair: We now move to Mr.Ste-Marie. gabriel ste-marie (joliette, bq): Can I go ahead, Mr.Chair? the chair: Yes, go ahead. In an interview with Grald Fillion, tax expert Andr Lareau, who specializes in tax havens, pointed out that $350billion Canadian is parked in just 12tax havens. Mr.Lareau also notes that the government is aware that all of this Canadian money is stashed in tax havens but is doing nothing about it. He said that it's time for Canada to tackle the problem given that it has a $250-billion deficit, and that if it doesn't act now to change things, it never will. diane lebouthillier (minister of national revenue): Mr.Chair, as soon as we took office, in 2015, our government made cracking down on tax evaders in Canada and abroad a priority. I realize that my fellow member is impatient, but he has to understand that this is a very complex issue. Under our leadership, in three years, the Canada Revenue Agency has undertaken twice as many audits related to offshore tax evasion as it did in the 10years the Conservatives were in power. As we speak, the agency is conducting more than 50criminal investigations tied to international tax evasion. gabriel ste-marie: You're right, I am very impatient, because whenever I bring up the fact that companies are using tax havens legally, the minister misses the point and tells me that she is going after fraudsters. Since Parliament began sitting virtually, it's been mentioned a few times that Denmark and Poland have decided to deal with the issue. Even France's finance minister, Bruno LeMaire, said that companies with subsidiaries in tax havens would not be eligible for public assistance. We hear thePrime Minister and other government officials say all the time that the wage subsidies are going to workers, so I'd like to cite another examplebanks. The government is injecting huge amounts of cash into the financial system and repurchasing troubled assets in massive quantities, and yet, the five major banks in Toronto, alone, are continuing to save billions of dollars every year by artificially redirecting their profits to tax havens. This has nothing to do with wages for workers, and everything to do with the repurchase of troubled assets, cash flow and billions of dollars that the government could be going after. Is the government going to seize this opportunity to make the corporate use of tax havens illegal? hon. diane lebouthillier: Mr.Chair, our government is taking unprecedented steps through the Canada emergency wage subsidy measure to support businesses and workers affected by COVID-19. What's more, any employer receiving the subsidy who is deemed ineligible will have to repay the full amount. Anyone who abuses the program could face a fine of up to 225% of the wage subsidy amount and up to five years in prison. the chair: Mr.Ste-Marie, you have about 30seconds to ask your question, and about the same for the answer. Although completely immoral, the use of tax havens by companies is legal under section5907 of the Income Tax Regulations. We are going to have a $250-billion deficit to pay off, and everyone is going to have to chip in, including the rich who are currently taking advantage of the system. diane lebouthillier: Mr.Chair, thanks to a historic billion-dollar investment, our government has given the agency the resources it needs to do the job, and we are starting to see results. I'm proud of how the Government of Canada has been beside Canadians through every step of this pandemic and has supported Canadians when they needed it most. In BonavistaBurinTrinity and across our country, our commercial fishery has seen many challenges and impacts. Last week, my colleague, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, announced an investment that will ensure resilience of the food system by allowing Canada's fish and seafood processing sector to safely and efficiently process, store, package and distribute healthy, high-quality products on to the plates of Canadians. The fish harvesters in my riding are fearful of what will happen within this industry and their immediate futures. Chair, I want to thank my colleague from BonavistaBurinTrinity for keeping us well aware of what's happening in his riding with harvesters and with processors. It's the backbone and the lifeblood of our communities and that's why we want to be there to support them. We've already taken steps by making sure that the CERB is now able to be accessed by people who are seasonal workers. As well, we are making sure that people who are running out of fishers EI are also able to qualify for it. We also have made an investment of $62.5 million to support our processors to make sure they are able to be ready for the challenges that they are going to face because of COVID-19. We are working with our partners across industry to make sure we're hearing what their major concerns are. We will have more to say about that and what we will be able to do in the coming days. Chair, in my riding of SurreyNewton, I'm in close contact with businesses that represent all the chair: We have a point of order. damien kurek (battle rivercrowfoot, cpc): Sorry, but there seems to be an issue with the audio. Chair, in my riding of SurreyNewton, I'm in close contact with businesses that represent all vantage points in the supply chainfrom manufacturers to retailers, transport companies to warehousing. With provinces and territories moving at different speeds and implementing different protocols for reopening the economy, there is a lot of confusion in my local business community on the timing and logistics of how this will happen. With so many different parts of the supply chain operating in different jurisdictions, and with each business serving unique roles on this spectrum, how can the federal government serve to best coordinate with the provinces and territories so that the supply chain can be implemented smoothly as we embark on our economic recovery? hon. One of the most important things the federal government can do when it comes to the reopening of the Canadian economy is to work in close collaboration with the premiers of the provinces and territories. That's why I was so pleased that last week the Prime Minister, together with all the first ministers of the country, was able to issue a statement around the principles that will be guiding our entire country as we move towards a restart. This is so important because, as my colleague has pointed out, all of our business, our economic activity, happens across the country. We have been able to work together in fighting coronavirus, and we are going to work together in the future to keep on fighting coronavirus and to reopen Canada. In Alberta, meat-packing plants are directly responsible for nearly a quarter of all COVID-19 cases. The government and management ignored the pleas of workers and did not put effective safety protocols in place to deal with COVID-19. Now, two workers are dead, at least six more are in intensive care and COVID-19 is spreading like wildfire through these communities. On March 27, regarding the CERB, the Minister of Finance said that if workers don't feel comfortable in their work, if they decide to stay home, they can apply for the benefit, yet the website says differently. Will the minister guarantee that every Canadian receiving CERB, EI or the CESB will not lose their benefits if they refuse to return to work or to accept work that is unsafe due to COVID-19? hon. chrystia freeland: Let me thank the member, first of all, for her really very important question. I think all of us share the concern for Canada's essential workers who are keeping us safe, putting food on our tables and often working in difficult conditions. When it comes to the Cargill plant, this is an issue that our government has been very closely engaged in. My colleague, the Minister of Agriculture, has spoken with her provincial counterpart and the head of the plant. To the question my colleague asked about workers, it is absolutely the case that no Canadian should feel they need to work in an environment that is unsafe, and it is also very much the case that any Canadian who is feeling unwell should stay at home. This is the way that collectively we take care of ourselves and we take care the chair: We will go on to Ms. heather mcpherson: I just want to be clear, because I'm not a hundred per cent sure that I got an answer in that response, so I'll try one more time. Knowing that workers have a fundamental right to refuse unsafe work, can the minister confirm one hundred per cent that if workers refuse unsafe work, they will be able to access the CERB, or was the Minister of Finance incorrect when he spoke on March 27? the chair: The honourable minister. chrystia freeland: In a time of coronavirus that is even more the case, and the government of course should not penalize workers for doing the right thing and declining to go to work in unsafe conditions. the chair: I want to remind the honourable members to place their questions through the Chair to avoid back and forth, just to try to keep some order in the meeting. If the provincial government won't shut down the plant, will the federal government shut down unsafe plants through the Canadian Food Inspection Agency? hon. Chair, on the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, let me be very clear that my colleague, the Minister of Agriculture, has been in touch with provincial authorities. The duties of the food inspection agency, of course, are to ensure that the food produced at the plant is safe. We are working closely with provincial authorities and with health authorities to ensure that the chair: We will go back to Ms. Can the finance minister please let us know if Cargill, a company that is owned by billionaires, with business in Luxembourg, a known tax haven, has received any federal funding this year for COVID-related support? hon. diane lebouthillier: This is a tough time for Canadians, and our government is doing everything it can to support them. More than 7million Canadians have applied for the Canada emergency response benefit, which the Canada Revenue Agency and Service Canada administer. I want to say how proud I am of the work the agency is doing; staff worked tirelessly to get the program up and running in record time. richard bragdon (tobiquemactaquac, cpc): Thank you, Mr. Potato farmers in New Brunswick and across Canada are sitting on massive stores of potatoes that were destined for the restaurant industry, but due to the pandemic, they now have no customers. What is the Prime Minister's plan for the helping farmers offload these potatoes so that they are ready for the 2020 season? hon. We are aware that the coronavirus, by keeping us away from restaurants where we eat french fries, has had a profound effect on the market for potatoes. The program announced today by the Prime Minister and my colleague, the Minister of Agriculture, will be very helpful for potato farmers, including with the surplus food program that starts with a $50 million fund, and that the chair: We'll go back to Mr. With an estimated $300 million worth of potatoes in storage, the announced funding from the government today simply doesn't go far enough. How does the Prime Minister plan to mitigate these shortfalls and allow farmers to continue to grow the food we so desperately need? hon. The program today is $252 million, which comes on top of the broad range of other programs that farmers, of course, have access to. On potato farmers, in particular, I agree with the honourable member that this is a specific area of concern. I think all Canadians would like to see those potatoes not be wasted but be used, and that's why the $50 million for surplus food purchase is going to be so helpful. The $16-billion beef industry is expected to take a massive hit due to the closures and reduced production of the meat-packing plants. Does the government truly believe that the announced $125 million that is shared between beef, poultry and pork producers will be enough to support these multi-billion dollar industries so they can put food on the tables of Canadians? hon. Chair, I absolutely agree with the honourable member that our beef, pork and poultry producers are absolutely essential for our country. I am very pleased as a Canadian that we have security that comes from being a country that produces not only enough food for ourselves, but also enough food to feed the world. That is why the $125 million specifically to support our beef, pork and poultry producers is going to be so helpful. Chair, the government's announcement of $252 million for the agriculture sector falls well short of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture's request for immediate government relief for farmers. The president of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture, Mary Robinson, put it today something like this: that if the farmhouse is on fire, the government has offered the equivalent of a bucket of water. Does the government have a plan to offer more than just crumbs to keep the vital agriculture sector operating and providing the food we so desperately need? When will the government finally make those who literally keep our land and grow our food a priority in this time of crisis? hon. Chair, I don't know about the honourable member, but where I come from, $252 million is not just crumbs. I would like to take this opportunity to highlight two other aspects of the essential support for farmers that we announced today: the $77 million to support food processors, which will not only be important for the processors, but helpful for the farmers who produce products that go to them; and the $250 million that we would like to add to the Canadian Dairy Commission's line of credit to raise it to half a billion dollars, which will be very helpful to our essential dairy farmers. Chair, a couple in my riding has had to shut down their business, and they are on CERB. They were shocked when their 16-year-old son also qualified, and he is receiving $8,000 on the basis of part-time work throughout the school year. Why is the government handing out a windfall to teenagers who are living at home while denying university students and ignoring seniors on fixed incomes? hon. Chair, any individual who has lost work for COVID reasons is eligible for the CERB, regardless of their personal circumstances. If you made $5,000 in the past year and are a resident of Canada, you qualify for the CERB. This is not a matter of differentiating between the personal circumstances of individuals but of acknowledging that many workers in different situations have lost their work or have had their work significantly reduced because of COVID. cathay wagantall: Clearly, high school students would not have the same needs as university students and our seniors who are suffering at this time. The government's own findings on banning handguns and assault firearms state, In all cases the data does not conclusively demonstrate that these handgun or assault weapon bans have led to reductions in gun violence. Why is the Prime Minister so bent on penalizing law-abiding firearms owners when he should be focusing on funding our CBSA officers first, giving them the resources they need to seize smuggled firearms at our borders? hon. Chair, I note with some interest that when we brought forward legislation in a budget in the last two years to increase the number of officers at the border, the member opposite voted against it. The evidence is overwhelming that these weapons are designed to be used, and have been used, to kill innocent people. Countries that adopt sensible gun policiesplaces like New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdomhave all recognized that there's no place for these weapons in a civil society. There have been far too many people killed with these weapons, and even most recently, to honour and respect the terrible tragedy in Nova Scotia, the time to act is now, and we've acted. cathay wagantall: Last week the Minister of Agriculture said, Step by step we are giving our farmers...the tools they need to continue their...work. On April 30, the Canadian Federation of Agriculture called on the minister to create a $2.6-billion fund to maintain food security in Canada. This morning, the Prime Minister announced $252 million, hit-and-miss, across the agriculture sector. With all due respect, this is a slap in the face to our farmers and the agri-food sector. If the deputy minister is going to answer the question in her place, how does she see it is right to be providing $9 billion to students and only crumbs to our agriculture sector? hon. Chair, first of all, let me say I do not, as has now been suggested by two members opposite, consider it in any way shameful that I should be answering questions about our support for the agricultural sector. The $252 million of support is real and meaningful, and it is directed exactly where it is needed. As to the question about students, let me just point out that farm kids are students too, and farm kids will be benefiting from the support for students. Meat packing plants like Quebec-based Olymel are extremely worried that they won't be able to stay open throughout the pandemic. In the summer, these plants rely on students to do overtime and fill in for full-time employees on vacation. However, the Canada emergency student benefit makes it possible for these much-needed workers to stay home while still collecting the same amount of money. That's why the government must adjust its current summer job program for students in the agriculture and agri-food sectors. carla qualtrough: I can assure you that we are doing our best efforts to not disincentivize work. We are looking at ways we can create additional jobs through Canada summer jobs, through the the chair: There is a point of order. claude debellefeuille (salaberrysurot, bq): Mr.Chair, what the minister is saying is not being interpreted. carla qualtrough: Last week, as part of the measures announced around supporting our students, we announced the creation of 76,000 additional jobs, including jobs in the agriculture and processing sectors. This is exactly what we're doing through our youth employment and skills strategy, and that's what we'll continue to do. richard lehoux: I'm not sure the minister understood my question about the Canada emergency student benefit. I am very concerned about the agricultural sector, but the tourist and horticultural sectors are also on my mind. A number of business owners in my riding have reached out to me because the shortage of student workers is forcing them to shut down for the summer. Minister, what do you have to say to those business owners in the tourist and horticultural sectors whom you are not helping? hon. We've heard very clearly from the students that they want to work and want to serve in their communities in this time of crisis. That's why we're creating additional employment opportunities and an income support mechanism that allows them to work. Pork and beef producers are feeling the impact of the country's shutdown triggered by the pandemic. For the past five years, the government has been saying that the programs to help producers will be improved. When will the government make these changes, including the changes to agristability, and when can producers access them? hon. chrystia freeland: We announced over $77 million in assistance for food processors to help them protect their workers and deal with the costs associated with the coronavirus. To help livestock and pork producers, we established agrirecovery, a national initiative that will provide $125million to help producers adapt to market changes. The measures announced at noon today received a very cold reception from the entire agriculture and agri-food sector, since the sector had asked for about $2.6billion. I think that it's important to support our agri-food industry and our farms, given the significant need for sovereignty. Many Canadians in the agriculture and agri-food sector have made this clear, as I was saying earlier. chrystia freeland: Our country, Canada, will never depend on its neighbours or any other country for food. I want to mention another significant part of our announcement today, which is the $50million surplus food purchase program. alexandra mends (brossardsaint-lambert, lib.)): We'll now move on to the next question. blaine calkins (red deerlacombe, cpc): Madam Chair, how will the government's forced confiscation of law-abiding firearms owners' property prevent criminals from illegally acquiring firearms from the United States? hon. bill blair: Madam Chair, in response to that, I would simply remind the member that we have made it very clear that these weapons have no place in civil society, so we have prohibited military-style assault weapons that have been designed to be used to kill people and have been used to kill people. We'll bring forward new authorities, new offences, new penalties to deal with people who smuggle weapons across the border. We're also bringing in new regulations for the storage of weapons to make it more difficult for people to steal these guns. To deal with people who purchase them illegally and sell them illegally, there will be new offences and penalties to make ensure that they face the consequences. blaine calkins: The government previously has said that decisions like classifying firearms should be left to experts. A legal opinion that's already been obtained says that the bore of a 12-gauge shotgun with the choke removed is in excess of 20 millimetres. That is the same firearm that Olympic trap shooters, Olympic skeet shooters, duck hunters and geese hunters all across our country use on a very regular basis. First of all, we have prohibited large-bore weapons, such as grenade launchers, but with reference to the 10-gauge shotgun and the 12-gauge shotgun, I would simply remind the member that the bore of a 10-gauge shotgun is 19.69 millimetres in width and the bore of a 12-gauge shotgun is 18.53 millimetres in width, both of them under the size for prohibition and therefore not covered in the new prohibitions that the government introduced on Friday. blaine calkins: Madam Chair, the opinion is that of one of the foremost experts we have in Canada when it comes to firearms legislation. If the entirety of the barrel length is considered, then the removal of the choke makes that barrel in excess of 20 millimetres. There is no plan for a buyback program in this policy, and law-abiding firearms owners are not able currently to surrender their firearms. Given this, and the fact that law-abiding firearms owners aren't committing any gun violence, what was the government's immediate benefit of making this announcement on May 1? hon. Along with the prohibition that we have put in place, we have also, using the order in council, established an amnesty period, but the amnesty period is non-permissive grandfathering of those weapons. They cannot be used, they can't be taken to the range for shooting, they can't be used for hunting, they can't be sold and they can't be transferred, so we have put in strong measures to ensure that these weapons will not be available for use. We have also put in an amnesty period that will allow us to bring forward the legislation and a budget in order to effect a responsible, safe and effective buyback program to remove these weapons from society. blaine calkins: Madam Chair, since January 1, 2002, any law-abiding citizen who was issued with a firearms licence by the government would have been cross-referenced with a continuous eligibility check 6,695 times up until May 1 of this year. How many times was this most recent mass murderer here in Canada checked against a criminal database since January 2002? hon. bill blair: As the member is probably aware, there is a very extensive investigation currently being conducted into that individual and how he acquired his firearms, and it's not appropriate to discuss that. However, I think what is appropriate is to recognize that the weapons that this individual had available to him are weapons that were not designed for target shooting or hunting purposes or any sporting purposes. In the hands of someone who is intent on mass murder, they represent an unacceptable and deadly risk to Canadians, and that's why we have prohibited them. I'd also remind the member that other countries that have adopted sensible gun control laws, such as New Zealand, Australia and the United Kingdom, have also implemented very similar bans. I'd like to start by giving my condolences for the crew from the HMCS Fredericton who died, and in particular to the family of Captain Kevin Hagen. Other countries are strongly recommending that all citizens wear masks wherever people gather indoors, including in schools, on public transit and in stores. Taiwan has effectively stopped the spread of the coronavirus by supplying people with masks and installing dispensers of hand sanitizer throughout public spaces. Taiwan started in the top 10 countries affected by COVID-19, and today it is number 119. Will Canada follow Taiwan's example so we can lift the lockdown safely and get Canadians back to work? hon. patty hajdu (minister of health): Thank you very much, Madam Chair, and I thank the member for his question. There's no doubt that masks can play a role in a layered approach to protecting Canadians' health and safety, but as the member has mentioned, there are many other aspects to ensuring that Canadians are safe no matter where they go. Social distancing can provide the most protection, in fact, when you're out in public or you're in another place where there are other people. Tam has said that when physical distancing is not an option, Canadians should consider wearing a mask. I'd like to give a shout-out to Martha and her team, who are doing a fundraiser for the SPCA by making masks for citizens in my riding. Madam Chair, many people are falling through the cracks in the pandemic relief plan, including seniors who face an increase in the cost of living and a loss of retirement investment income. Will the government make the CERB a universal benefit to ensure that all Canadians who need help get help? If not, will the government increase old age security and allow seniors to withdraw funds from their RRSP without penalties so that they can pay their bills? hon. We do recognize that OAS and GIS are very important parts of the retirement income of Canadians, particularly lower-income seniors. The CERB is there for working seniors who have lost income as a result of COVID-19. We've also reduced the mandatory retirement withdrawals by 25%, and we've also spent half a billion dollars to support organizations that assist vulnerable Canadians, including seniors the acting chair (mrs. paul manly: Many small businesses do not meet the eligibility requirements for the various relief programs on offer, particularly sole proprietorships. At the same time, we have large companies in this country that use tax havens and loopholes to avoid paying their fair share of public services. Will the government ensure that the needs of small businesses are met and withhold relief from corporations that use tax havens to avoid paying taxes in Canada? hon. mary ng (minister of small business, export promotion and international trade): I want to thank the hon. That is why we have implemented many measures to help them weather this difficult period in COVID-19. Whether it is a small business loan, a wage subsidy or commercial rent assistance, or just lowering the cost by deferring GST or HST or customs duties, many measures have been put forward to help our small businesses through this very difficult time. As we navigate this pandemic crisis, we are also in the middle of another major crisis: the climate emergency. Will this government develop its economic recovery plan for the pandemic with the climate emergency at the forefront of its planning? the acting chair (mrs. The focus of the government at the present time is on combatting the virus and on steps to start to relax some of the measures that have been taken. As we look forward, we need to learn from the experiences of this crisis as well as look forward to some of the looming crises on the horizon. Climate change is one of those, and we certainly intend to reflect on resilience for the economy as we move forward. niki ashton (churchillkeewatinook aski, ndp): Thank you, Madam Chair. First nations across northern Manitoba and many others across the country have been doing everything possible to keep COVID-19 out of their communities. Many here have implemented strict lockdowns or travel restrictions, but the federal government has done virtually nothing to deal with the chronic issues that have made them vulnerable in the first place, such as overcrowded housing and the lack of hospitals. What is your government doing to support communities in the face of that possibility? Why isn't the government supporting the call for a ventilation centre in Berens River, a hospital in Cross Lake, a hospital in the Island Lake region? If the government couldn't act in time for this first wave of the pandemic, can it at least act in time for a potential second wave? hon. marc miller (minister of indigenous services): Indeed, Madam Chair, one of the reflections we have in coming out of this global pandemic is that we don't want to go into the next one with the same social determinants of health that have made indigenous communities more vulnerable and more susceptible to contracting and then spreading COVID-19. A lot of the historic housing funds that we have mobilized in order to address overcrowding in particular are cold comfort to those communities that are still finding themselves in overcrowded situations. In the staged approach to the epidemic and the onset of COVID-19, there are many measures that Indigenous Services Canada and as a whole of government we will deploy, including surge capacity, increased PPE, and nurses and doctors. Obviously, we are looking for a medical solution to a medical problem, and that is what we will spare no expense or resource to address as indigenous communities continue to face the looming threat of a second wave of COVID-19 as they start to relax some of their confinement procedures. niki ashton: Again, Madam Chair, to the Minister of Indigenous Services, many of us across northern Canada are deeply concerned by the outbreak taking place in northern Saskatchewan, centred in La Loche. Your government says it's committed to doing everything it can to keep first nations safe, yet nothing has been done to support calls for pandemic shutdowns. Will you support first nations in their call for shutdowns during this pandemic to save lives now? hon. Members won't be surprised to know that that number will only increase as the days go on and as we implement aggressive testing and contact tracing. We are working with surrounding first nations and communities and with the Mtis and Dene communities in La Loche to ensure that medical precautions are being put into place and that strict social distancing is being put into effect. This is a situation that is very much evolving minute by minute, and it is something for which we have deployed additional resources, along with Meadow Lake and the Northern Inter-Tribal Health Authority to ensure that there is a health response to a health problem. marc miller: One of the things we see as we see the evolving dynamic and the potential spreads, particularly the fear of clusters as communities, provinces, territories may choose to relax certain measures, is the need to have a more targeted approach as to how the economy reacts and deals with it, particularly in northern and vulnerable communities. This is something for which we will need to have a serious approach, with both the Minister of Natural Resources and also our provincial counterparts, to make sure that we aren't taking hasty measures to reopen the economy while we're trying to protectand this is our most important goalindigenous communities from getting exposed and spreading COVID-19. Hundreds of fishers and their families here in Manitoba who work with the Freshwater Fish Marketing Corporation are desperately calling for emergency support. Many are calling on the federal government to also work with them and the FFMC to redirect their product to domestic markets and communities here at home to address the growing food insecurity people are facing. When will your government announce support for inland fishers, including here in Manitoba, and will you work to ensure that their product, healthy fish, can be provided here at home for people who need it? hon. bernadette jordan: Madam Chair, we know that COVID-19 is having extreme impacts on northern first nations communities, especially with regard to fisheries in areas that rely on it for not only their livelihoods but also for the cultural importance. Indigenous harvesters are able to access through the aboriginal financial institutions the $306 million we've put in for support for indigenous small and medium-sized businesses. The funding allows for short-term interest-free loans as well as for non-repayable contributions. We also announced earlier that the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency has made available $15 million in non-repayable support for businesses. We know that there's more that needs to be done to support our first nations communities as well as our harvesters. I don't want to talk about the $1billion that the government used to track down tax cheats. I want to ask the minister why she isn't taking this opportunity to learn from countries that are putting an end to tax avoidance in tax havens, a legal but immoral practice in this day and age. Can she explain why she isn't showing leadership by convincing cabinet to change course and eliminate the legal measure known as tax avoidance, which enables companies to avoid paying taxes and put money in tax havens? hon. diane lebouthillier: MadamChair, as soon as our government took office in 2015, we made it a priority to crack down on tax cheats. Our government's historic investments of almost $1 billion have ensured that the agency can access the necessary resources for its work. claude debellefeuille: MadamChair, does the minister realize that she's being filmed and recorded and that she isn't answering my question? I don't want to talk about cheats. I want to talk about companies that use a legal mechanism to avoid paying taxes and to put their money in tax havens. Can she tell me how many companies legally take advantage of tax avoidance in tax havens? How much money escapes taxation through this legal mechanism? The government could invest this money in its economic recovery post-COVID-19. Regarding tax evasion abroad, our leadership made it possible for the agency to conduct twice as many audits in three years as it conducted in 10 years under the Conservatives. However, I don't understand the government's lack of willingness to eliminate this mechanism, which is legal but completely immoral. The Fdration de la relve agricole du Qubec and the UPA approached the Minister of Finance two weeks ago and still haven't received a response regarding the following issue. As a result, these farms are being penalized because they aren't eligible for the $40,000 in loans available through the Canada emergency business account. To qualify for these loans, the farms needed a payroll of $20,000 to $1.5million in 2019. Does the Minister of Finance plan to respond to the farmers who want to access the $40,000 in loans? hon. The tourism ministry was one of the first and hardest-hit industries during this crisis, yet despite the Prime Minister's announcement over three weeks ago now of a plan to bring forward a tourism-specific aid package to help the businesses who employ millions of unemployed Canadians who work in tourism, there's still been nothing from this government. I had the chance to talk to many of the leaders in the sector, and clearly there's a lot of anxiety. We also had the chance to work with all the G20 ministers of tourism all together, and we know we have to act the chair: We'll now go back to Mr. Tourism-based communities like the ones in Banff and Canmore, which I represent, are tourism-based economies and have unemployment rates of 85% or higher. They also don't qualify for a lot of the programs because they're seasonal businesses and make most or all of their revenues for the year from May to October, so they're at risk of losing their entire season. Will the government consider making changes to the programs to make sure that seasonal businesses can get help? What does the government plan to do to help the tourism industry recover after the pandemic? hon. Obviously, the tourism sector has access to many measures, including the CEBA account, the $40,000 account. They will be having access also to funding through the regional development agencies, and we'll be coming up with the details soon. Of course, in my colleague's riding of Banff, which is a fantastic place and a tourism gem, they will have access to the support through WD, western economic diversification. If there are particular cases you would like to raise with me, I would be more than happy to talk to you to see how, on the ground, we can help the tourism operators. It doesn't address anything about their concerns about the hard economic recovery they'll have after the pandemic. Another industry that's very hard hit in my province and my riding is the oil and gas industry. It's another industry the Prime Minister has promised to help, but there hasn't been anything. The only so-called assistance there's been to help hurting Albertans in the oil patch has been measures to speed up the death of the industry that they work in. Will the Liberal government ever show any concern for Albertans? Will they bring forward a plan to preserve Canadian jobs? Will they put forward a plan to ensure the use of Canadian oil before oil coming in from places like Saudi Arabia? hon. Chair, the federal government has taken several steps in recent weeks that will meaningfully support workers and communities that depend on this industry. We have the Canada emergency wage subsidy, which covers 75% of an employee's wages for the employer. We have more liquidity for oil and gas companies through new loans of $15 million to $60 million from the Business Development Bank of Canada. We continue to step forward in our response to the impacts of COVID-19 on my province here in Newfoundland and Labrador and on Alberta and Saskatchewan. These three provinces are being hit by two crises at the same time, a crisis of demand for oil and gas on the world markets and of course a crisis of public health with COVID-19. Chair, a lot of these things we're hearing about aren't going to actually help the industry to recover. Maybe what they could do is consider expediting the approval of billions of dollars of private sector projects that would put thousands and thousands of Canadians back to work. Will the government consider looking at ways that we can expedite projects? Will they look at ways that we can encourage the use of Canadian oil before the use of oil coming in from places like Saudi Arabia? hon. We have been working with labour, concentrating on workers and concentrating on the companies that support those jobs to make sure that they remain whole and those jobs will be there for those workers. We're particularly proud of our orphan wells program, which was launched by the Alberta government in conjunction with us. I am pleased to inform this House that the uptake on applications for that program is significantly higher than even we expected"
