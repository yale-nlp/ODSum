        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in Jinx Ship To The Rescue?",
        "Summary_1": "Brevet Lieutenant Commander David Farragut Stryakalski III, AKA Strike, is charged with commanding a run-down and faulty vessel, the Aphrodite. Aphrodite was the brain-child of Harlan Hendricks, an engineer who ushered in new technology ten years back. All three of his creations failed spectacularly, resulting in death and a failed career. The Aphrodite was the only ship to survive, and she is now used for hauling mail back and forth between Venus and Mars.\nStrike and Cob, the Aphrodite\u2019s only executive to last more than six months, recount Strike\u2019s great failures and how he ended up here. He used to fly the Ganymede, but was removed after he left his position to rescue colonists who didn\u2019t need rescuing. Strike was no longer trustworthy in Admiral Gorman\u2019s eyes, so he banished him to the Aphrodite. \nThe circuit that caused the initial demise of Aphrodite was sealed off. After meeting some members of his crew, Strike orders a conference for all personnel and calls in an Engineering Officer, one I.V. Hendricks. \nAfter Lieutenant Ivy Hendricks arrives--not I.V.--Strike immediately insults her by degrading the ship\u2019s designer, Harlan Hendricks. As it turns out, Hendricks is his daughter, and she vows to prove him wrong and all those who doubted her father. \nDespite their initial conflict, Strike and Hendricks\u2019 relationship soon evolves from resentment to respect. During this time, Strike\u2019s confidence in the Aphrodite plummets as she suffers from mechanical issues. \nThe Aphrodite starts to heat up as they get closer to the sun. The refrigeration units could not handle the heat, causing discomfort among the crew. As they get closer, a radar contact reveals that two dreadnaughts, the Lachesis and the Atropos, are doing routine patrolling. Nothing to worry about, except the Atropos had Admiral Gorman on board, hated by Strike and Hendricks.\nStrike and Hendricks make a joke about Gorman falling into the sun. As the temperature steadily climbs, the crew members overheat and begin fighting, resulting in a black eye. A distress signal came through from the Lachesis: the Atropos, with Gorman on board, was tumbling into the sun. The Lachesis was attempting to rescue them with an unbreakable cord, but they too were being pulled in. \nHendricks had fixed the surge-circuit rheostat, the one her father designed, and claimed it could help them rescue the ships. After some tension, Strike agrees and they race down to the sun to pick up the drifting dreadnaughts. \nStrike puts Hendricks in charge, but soon the heat overtakes her, and she is unable to continue. Strike takes over, attaches the Aphrodite to the Lachesis with a cord, and turns on the surge-circuit. They blast themselves out of there, rescuing the two ships and Admiral Gorman at the same time. \nCob and Strike are awarded Spatial Cross awards, while Hendricks is promoted to an engineering position at the Bureau of Ships. The story ends with Cob and Strike flipping through the pages of an address book until they land on Canalopolis, Mars. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Strike joins the crew of the Aphrodite after he has made several poor decisions while he was the captain of another spaceship. He is essentially being punished by his boss, Gorman, and put somewhere where he can do little harm. His job is to deliver the mail from Venus to Mars, so it\u2019s pretty straightforward. \n\nWhen he meets the Officer of the Deck, Celia Graham, he immediately becomes uncomfortable. He does not like to work with women in space, although it\u2019s a pretty common occurrence. He holds a captain\u2019s meeting the first day on the job, and he waits to meet his Engineering Officer, I.V. Hendricks. He makes a rude comment about how the man is late for his first meeting, but actually, the female Ivy has already shown up. \n\nAfter meeting Ivy formally, he makes a comment about how the ship Aphrodite was built by an imbecile. Ivy immediately tells him that he\u2019s wrong, and she knows this because the designer of the ship was none other than her own father. \n\nHis first week as captain on the new ship goes very poorly. Several repairs need to be done to Aphrodite, they run  behind schedule, and the new crew members have a tough time getting a handle on Aphrodite\u2019s intricacies. \n\nThe heat index in the ship begins to rise, and the crew members can no longer wear their uniforms without fainting. Suddenly a distress call comes in, and it\u2019s coming from the Atropos, a ship Captained by Gorman, and the Lachesis. The crew members hesitate to take the oldest and most outdated machinery on a rescue trip. Strike has been in trouble for refusing to follow commands before, and he knows it\u2019s a risky move. However, Ivy insists that she knows how to pilot the Aphrodite, and she can save the crew members on the Atropos and the Lachesis from death. They are quickly tumbling towards the sun, and they will perish if someone doesn\u2019t do something quickly. \n\nIvy takes control of the ship, and the heat on the Aphrodite continues to rise steadily. Eventually, she faints from pure heat exhaustion, and she tells Strike that he must take over. He does, and he manages to essentially lasso the other two ships, and with just the right amount of power, he pulls them back into orbit. \n\nAt a bar, after the whole ordeal, Cob pokes fun at Strike for staying on the Aphrodite. He then admits that he actually respects Strike\u2019s loyalty to the ship that saved his reputation. Cob asks about Strike\u2019s relationship with Ivy, but Strike tells him that she has taken her dad\u2019s former job, so she no longer works with him. Strike takes the moment to look up her info, presumably to restart the relationship. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The narrative follows commander Strike as he begins his command of the spaceship Aphrodite. Strike comes from a long line of military greats but himself is prone to poor professional decision making.\n\nAs he takes command, the mission is a simple mail run. However, in the course of their journey, they receive word of two ships in dire need of rescue. Strike and his engineering officer, Ivy Hendricks, decide to use the ships extremely risky surge-circuit to aid the ships.\n\nThe rescue is a success and the crew is hailed for its bravery in saving the doomed vessels. ",
        "Summary_4": "The story starts in a muddy swamp on Venus, where Strike, a Brevet Lieutenant Commander, is encountering his new ship, the Aphrodite, for the first time. Here on Venusport Base, he is introduced to the executive officer of the ship, a man who goes by Cob. Strike comes from a line of servicemen who were all well respected, but he himself has more of a reputation for causing trouble by saying the wrong things or deviating from mission plans. His reputation preceded him, as Cob had specific questions about some of these events. The Aphrodite was incredibly impressive when it was designed, but did not live up to its expectations. It had been refitted, and the new mission that Strike was to lead was a mail run between Venus and Mars. As he entered the ship, Strike began to meet his new crew, including Celia Graham, his Radar Officer. Strike is not used to women being on ships and is decidedly uncomfortable with the idea. As he is briefing the officers who were already present, Strike is surprised when he meets his new engineering officer, Ivy Hendricks. Ivy is the daughter of the man who designed the ship, and she is cold to Strike at first, as he is to her. However, her expertise in engineering generally, the ship specifically, and other skills as well as piloting, meant that Strike warmed up to her as their mission went on. As the ship was flying towards Mars on their route, the crew picked up a distress signal from the Lachesis, which was trying to pull the Atropos away from the gravitational pull of the sun after it was damaged in an equipment malfunction. The Admiral who had put Strike in charge of the Aphrodite was on the Atropos, and Ivy dislikes him even more than Strike does, but they know they have to try to save the crews. Strike is hesitant, but Ivy has a plan and insists that they try. She has spent all of her free time tinkering with the circuits, and takes charge. She turned the Aphrodite towards the ships in danger, and sends out a cable to connect the Aphrodite to those ships. After they are all connected, the ships continue to spin towards the sun, which causes Ivy to pass out, leaving Strike in charge. He manages to pull the ships into line and send the Aphrodite in the right direction before passing out himself. The Aphrodite has the power to pull everyone away from the Sun\u2019s gravity, but the acceleration knocks everyone out on all three ships. In the end, it was a successful rescue mission of multiple crews. Strike and Cob find themselves in an officer\u2019s club at the end of the story, discussing Ivy\u2019s new job, and Strike acknowledges that Cob is right about the Aphrodite having grown on him, and plans to stay its captain.",
        "Article": "What is it you wish? he barked. I understood in my discussions withthe other ... ah ... civilian there'd be no further need for theseirritating conferences.     I've just learned you're placing more students abroad, Mr. Gulver. Howmany this time?     Two thousand.     And where will they be going?     Croanie. It's all in the application form I've handed in. Your job isto provide transportation.     Will there be any other students embarking this season?     Why ... perhaps. That's Boge's business. Gulver looked at Retief withpursed lips.

She's got something terrific in her guts and only     her ice-cold lady engineer can coax it out of her!     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Planet Stories Winter 1948.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      Brevet Lieutenant Commander David Farragut Strykalski III of theTellurian Wing, Combined Solarian Navies, stood ankle deep in theviscous mud of Venusport Base and surveyed his new command with ajaundiced eye. The hot, slimy, greenish rain that drenched Venusportfor two-thirds of the 720-hour day had stopped at last, but now amiasmic fog was rising from the surrounding swampland, rolling acrossthe mushy landing ramp toward the grounded spaceship. Visibility wasdropping fast, and soon porto-sonar sets would have to be used to findthe way about the surface Base. It was an ordinary day on Venus.     Strike cursed Space Admiral Gorman and all his ancestors with a wealthof feeling. Then he motioned wearily to his companion, and togetherthey sloshed through the mud toward the ancient monitor.     The scaly bulk of the Tellurian Rocket Ship      Aphrodite     loomedunhappily into the thick air above the two men as they reached theventral valve. Strike raised reluctant eyes to the sloping flank of thefat spaceship.     It looks, he commented bitterly, like a pregnant carp.     Senior Lieutenant Coburn Whitley\u2014Cob to his friends\u2014nodded inagreement. That's our Lover-Girl ... old Aphrodisiac herself. The shipwith the poison personality. Cob was the      Aphrodite's     Executive,and he had been with her a full year ... which was a record for Execson the      Aphrodite     . She generally sent them Earthside with nervousbreakdowns in half that time.     Tell me, Captain, continued Cob curiously, how does it happenthat you of all people happened to draw this tub for a command? Ithought....     You know Gorman? queried Strykalski.     Cob nodded. Oh, yes. Yes, indeed. Old Brass-bottom Gorman?     The same.     Well, Cob ran a hand over his chin speculatively, I know Gorman'sa prize stinker ... but you were in command of the      Ganymede     . And,after all, you come from an old service family and all that. How comethis? He indicated the monitor expressively.     Strike sighed. Well, now, Cob, I'll tell you. You'll be spacing withme and I guess you've a right to know the worst ... not that youwouldn't find it out anyway. I come from a long line of very sharpoperators. Seven generations of officers and gentlemen. Lousy withtradition.     The first David Farragut Strykalski, son of a sea-loving Polishimmigrant, emerged from World War II a four-striper and CongressionalMedal winner. Then came David Farragut Strykalski, Jr., and, in theabortive Atomic War that terrified the world in 1961, he won a UnitedNations Peace Citation. And then came David Farragut Strykalski III ...me.     From such humble beginnings do great traditions grow. But somethinghappened when I came into the picture. I don't fit with the rest ofthem. Call it luck or temperament or what have you.     In the first place I seem to have an uncanny talent for saying thewrong thing to the wrong person. Gorman for example. And I take toomuch on my own initiative. Gorman doesn't like that. I lost the      Ganymede     because I left my station where I was supposed to be runningsection-lines to take on a bunch of colonists I thought were indanger....     The Procyon A people? asked Cob.     So you've heard about it. Strike shook his head sadly. My tacticalastrophysicist warned me that Procyon A might go nova. I left myroutine post and loaded up on colonists. He shrugged. Wrong guess. Nonova. I made an ass of myself and lost the      Ganymede     . Gorman gave itto his former aide. I got this.     Cob coughed slightly. I heard something about Ley City, too.     Me again. The      Ganymede's     whole crew ended up in the Luna Base brig.We celebrated a bit too freely.     Cob Whitley looked admiringly at his new Commander. That was the nightafter the      Ganymede     broke the record for the Centaurus B-Earth run,wasn't it? And then wasn't there something about....     Canalopolis?     Whitley nodded.     That time I called the Martian Ambassador a spy. It was at a TellurianEmbassy Ball.     I begin to see what you mean, Captain.     Strike's the name, Cob.     Whitley's smile was expansive. Strike, I think you're going to likeour old tin pot here. He patted the      Aphrodite's     nether bellyaffectionately. She's old ... but she's loose. And we're not likely tomeet any Ambassadors or Admirals with her, either.     Strykalski sighed, still thinking of his sleek      Ganymede     . She'llcarry the mail, I suppose. And that's about all that's expected of her.     Cob shrugged philosophically. Better than tanking that stinking rocketfuel, anyway. Deep space?     Strike shook his head. Venus-Mars.     Cob scratched his chin speculatively. Perihelion run. Hot work.     Strike was again looking at the spaceship's unprepossessing exterior.A surge-circuit monitor, so help me.     Cob nodded agreement. The last of her class.   <doc-sep> A week in space had convinced Strike that he commanded a jinx ship.Jetting sunward from Venus, the cantankerous      Aphrodite     had burned asteering tube through, and it had been necessary to go into free-fallwhile Jenkins, the Assistant E/O, and a damage control party effectedrepairs.

        "Query": "What is the role of Ivy Hendricks in the story Jinx Ship To The Rescue and how does her character develop?",
        "Summary_1": "Lieutenant Ivy Hendricks is the daughter of Harlan Hendricks, a formerly respected engineer. He created the surge-circuit, an innovation in interstellar astrogation, and he was awarded a Legion of Merit. He designed three famous ships: the Artemis, the Andromeda, and the Aphrodite, the prototype. Despite being hailed as the latest and greatest in technology, all three ships either exploded or failed. \nAccording to Lieutenant Ivy Hendricks, their failures were due to the lack of education on board. She claimed that her father asked for the crew members to be trained in surge-circuit technology, so they could use it properly and correctly. That wish was not granted and after all three ships failed, his reputation and career were doomed. Admiral Gorman pulled the plug on his career and therefore became the target of all Lieutenant Hendricks\u2019 hate. \nWith a bone to pick, Lieutenant Hendricks, a knowledgeable engineer herself, comes aboard the Aphrodite to serve as her engineer and occasional pilot. She wants to prove to the world that her father\u2019s creation was genius and deserving of praise. \nAlthough they started off on the wrong foot, Lieutenant Hendricks and Strike, her commander, develop a friendship and appreciation for each other. They bond over their deep hatred of Admiral Gorman and the joy of piloting a ship. She soon proves herself to Strike, and he begins to trust her. Their relationship walks the fine line between friendship and romance. \nAs the Aphrodite is attempting to rescue the fallen dreadnaughts, Lieutenant Hendricks comes up with the solution. Due to her constant tinkering on the ship, she had fixed the surge-circuit rheostat and made it ready to use. Initially, no one trusts her, seeing as the last time it was used people died. But Strike\u2019s trust in her is strong and true, so he approves the use of the surge-circuit. Hendricks pilots the ship, but soon becomes too overheated and comes close to fainting. Strike takes over piloting and eventually activates the surge-circuit. It works and they are able to rescue the two ships, one of which had Admiral Gorman, her sworn enemy, onboard. \nLieutenant Hendricks receives a major promotion; she is now an engineer at the Bureau of Ships. She proved them wrong, and restored her father\u2019s legacy and good name. The story ends with their romance left in the air, but Hendricks has much to be proud of. \n",
        "Summary_2": "\nLieutenant Ivy Hendricks is the new Engineering Officer on Aphrodite. Strike and Cob assume that Ivy is a man before she arrives because they are sexist and because her name is listed as I.V. in the orders. Ivy is actually the daughter of the man who designed the award-winning craft.\n\nShe is cold and unfriendly towards Strike after she meets him, and that\u2019s probably because he makes a rude comment about the ship which her father created. After a couple weeks of working together, the two begin to get along very well. Strike admires Ivy\u2019s piloting skills and her depth of knowledge about the Aphrodite. \n\nThe two also bond over their shared hatred of Strike\u2019s former boss, Gorman. Strike feels as though he has ruined his career, and Ivy thinks that Gorman torpedoed her father\u2019s career. Ivy wants nothing more than to prove that Gorman is an idiot. \n\nHowever, when Gorman\u2019s ship is hurtling towards the sun and he and his crew members are about to die, Ivy sees that it\u2019s the perfect opportunity to show Gorman just how wrong he was about the ship her father designed. It\u2019s a very dangerous mission, but Ivy is steadfast in her decision and she\u2019s deeply courageous. She pilots the ship for most of the rescue mission, but eventually faints from the extreme heat. She tells Strike that he needs to take over, and he does a great job. \n\nIvy is then promoted, and she moves to Canalopolis, Mars. She now outranks her former Captain, Strike. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Ivy Hendricks is the engineering officer assigned to the Aphrodite. She is the daughter of Harlan Hendricks, the ship's original designer. She is fiercely protective of her father's legacy and resents Admiral Gorman for the way he treated him.\n\nHendricks and Strike, form an alliance of sorts after his initial surprise of seeing a woman assigned to this officer's role. When news arrives that two ships are in danger of falling into the sun, Ivy lobbies to use her father's technology to save the ship. Strike agrees to her plan although the risks are high. The Aphrodite eventually saves the ships although Ivy faints in the process from the heat and command has to be taken over by Strike.\n\nThe successful mission results in a promotion for Ivy as she works as a designer in the Bureau of Ships like her father.",
        "Summary_4": "Ivy Hendricks is the new engineering officer on the Aphrodite, having been transferred from the Antigone. She is a tall woman with dark hair and contrasting pale blue eyes, who has a very wide range of experience in ship operations and engineering. Her father, Harlan Hendricks, was the man who designed the Aphrodite, so she knows the ship needs a lot of specific training. At first, the captain did not expect her to be a woman, and managed to imply that many people found her father incompetent. Although she seemed cold at first, as she reacted to the situation, she and the captain eventually got along fairly well, as he learned to appreciate her wide skill set that ranged from engineering to piloting. Ivy and Strike also had a common enemy in the higher ranks: Space Admiral Gorman. Once Spike trusted her he appreciated that Ivy spent a lot of spare time working on the old circuits, so she knew the ship like the back of her hand. When the Aphrodite found the Lachesis and the Atropos when following up on a distress signal, Ivy new the ship well enough to be able to formulate a plan to save everyone. She piloted the Aphrodite carefully, using cables shot with a rocket to connect the three ships together, but the spinning of the ships in the heat inside meant that she passed out and had to leave Strike to take over for her. Her plan was successful; she was promoted, and instead of returning to the Aphrodite she started a design job with the Bureau of Ships.",

Thethermometer stood at 135\u00b0 and tempers were snapping. Cob and CeliaGraham had tangled about some minor point concerning Lover-Girl'sweight and balance. Ivy went about her work on the bridge withoutspeaking, and Strike made no attempt to brighten her sudden depression.Lieutenant Evans had punched Bayne, the Tactical Astrophysicist,in the eye for some disparaging remark about Southern Californiawomanhood. The ratings were grumbling about the food....     And then it happened.     Cob was in the radio room when Sparks pulled the flimsy from thescrambler. It was a distress signal from the      Lachesis     . The      Atropos     had burst a fission chamber and was falling into the sun.Radiation made a transfer of personnel impossible, and the      Atropos     skeeterboats didn't have the power to pull away from the looming star.The      Lachesis     had a line on the sister dreadnaught and was valiantlytrying to pull the heavy vessel to safety, but even the thunderingpower of the      Lachesis'     mighty drive wasn't enough to break Sol'sdeathgrip on the battleship.     A fleet of souped-up space-tugs was on its way from Luna and Venusport,but they could not possibly arrive on time. And it was doubtful thateven the tugs had the necessary power to drag the crippled      Atropos     away from a fiery end.     Cob snatched the flimsy from Sparks' hands and galloped for theflying-bridge. He burst in and waved the message excitedly in front ofStrykalski's face.     Have a look at this! Ye gods and little catfish! Read it!     Well, dammit, hold it still so I can! snapped Strike. He read themessage and passed it to Ivy Hendricks with a shake of his head.     She read it through and looked up exultantly. This is      it     ! This isthe chance I've been praying for, Strike!     He returned her gaze sourly. For Gorman to fall into the sun? I recallI said something of the sort myself, but there are other men on thoseships. And, if I know Captain Varni on the      Lachesis     , he won't let gothat line even if he fries himself.     Ivy's eyes snapped angrily. That's not what I meant, and you know it!I mean this! She touched the red-sealed surge-circuit rheostat.     That's very nice, Lieutenant, commented Cob drily. And I know thatyou've been very busy adjusting that gismo. But I seem to recall thatthe last time that circuit was uncorked everyone aboard became part ofthe woodwork ... very messily, too.     Let me understand you, Ivy, said Strike in a flat voice. What youare suggesting is that I risk my ship and the lives of all of us tryingto pull old Gorman's fat out of the fire with a drive that's blownskyhigh three times out of three. Very neat.     There were tears bright in Ivy Hendricks' eyes and she soundeddesperate. But we can save those ships! We can, I      know     we can! Myfather designed this ship! I know every rivet of her! Those idiots offCallisto didn't know what they were doing. These ships needed speciallytrained men. Father told them that! And I'm trained! I can take her inand save those ships! Her expression turned to one of disgust. Or areyou afraid?     Frankly, Ivy, I haven't enough sense to be afraid. But are you socertain that we can pull this off? If I make a mistake this time ...it'll be the last. For all of us.     We can do it, said Ivy Hendricks simply.     Strike turned to Cob. What do you say, Cob? Shall we make it hotter inhere?     Whitley shrugged. If you say so, Strike. It's good enough for me.     Celia Graham left the bridge shaking her head. We'll all be dead soon.And me so young and pretty.     Strike turned to the squawk-box. Evans!     Evans here, came the reply.     Have Sparks get a DF fix on the      Atropos     and hold it. We'll home ontheir carrier wave. They're in trouble and we're going after them. Plotthe course.     Yes, Captain.     Strike turned to Cob. Have the gun-crews stand by to relieve theblack-gang in the tube rooms. It's going to get hotter than the hingesof hell down there and we'll have to shorten shifts.     Yes, sir! Cob saluted and was gone.     Strike returned to the squawk-box. Radar!     Graham here, replied Celia from her station.     Get a radar fix on the      Lachesis     and hold it. Send your dope up toEvans and tell him to send us a range estimate.     Yes, Captain, the girl replied crisply.     Gun deck!     Gun deck here, sir, came a feminine voice.     Have number two starboard torpedo tube loaded with a fish and a spoolof cable. Be ready to let fly on short notice ... any range.     Yes, sir! The girl switched off.     And now you, Miss Hendricks.     Yes, Captain? Her voice was low.     Take over Control ... and Ivy....     Yes?     Don't kill us off. He smiled down at her.     She nodded silently and took her place at the control panel. Smoothlyshe turned old Aphrodisiac's nose sunward....   <doc-sep> The other officers of the      T.R.S. Aphrodite     were in conference withthe Captain when Cob and the girl at his side reached the flyingbridge. She was tall and dark-haired with regular features and paleblue eyes. She wore a service jumper with two silver stripes on theshoulder-straps, and even the shapeless garment could not hide theobvious trimness of her figure.     Strike's back was toward the bulkhead, and he was addressing the others.     ... and that's about the story. We are to jet within 28,000,000 milesof Sol. Orbit is trans-Mercurian hyperbolic. With Mars in opposition,we have to make a perihelion run and it won't be pleasant. But I'mcertain this old boiler can take it. I understand the old boy whodesigned her wasn't as incompetent as they say. But Space Regs arespecific about mail runs. This is important to you, Evans. Yourastrogation has to be accurate to within twenty-five miles plus orminus the shortest route. And there'll be no breaking orbit. Now becertain that the refrigeration units are checked, Mister Wilkins,especially in the hydroponic cells. Pure air is going to be important.     That's about all there is to tell you. As soon as our ratherleisurely E/O gets here, we can jet with Aunt Nelly's postcard. Henodded. That's the story. Lift ship in.... He glanced at his wristchronograph, ... in an hour and five.     The officers filed out and Cob Whitley stuck his head into the room.Captain?     Come in, Cob. Strike's dark brows knit at the sight of the uniformedgirl in the doorway.     Cob's face was sober, but hidden amusement was kindling behind hiseyes. Captain, may I present Lieutenant Hendricks? Lieutenant      I-vy     Hendricks?     Strike looked blankly at the girl.     Our new E/O, Captain, prompted Whitley.     Uh ... welcome aboard, Miss Hendricks, was all the Captain could findto say.     The girl's eyes were cold and unfriendly. Thank you, Captain. Hervoice was like cracked ice tinkling in a glass. If I may have yourpermission to inspect the drives, Captain, I      may     be able toconvince you that the designer of this vessel was not ... as you seemto think ... a senile incompetent.     Strike was perplexed, and he showed it. Why, certainly ... uh ...Miss ... but why should you be so....     The girl's voice was even colder than before as she said, HarlanHendricks, Captain, is my father.  "

        "Query": "What is the connection between Strike and Aphrodite in Jinx Ship To The Rescue?",
        "Summary_1": "Strike is a member of a famous, well-behaved, and well-trained service family. His father and grandfather served in World War II and the Atomic War, respectively. Both earned medals for their heroic service. Strike, however, did not follow in his family\u2019s footsteps. \n\tWith a tendency to say the wrong thing at the wrong time, Strike often offended those around him and garnered a negative reputation. After being put in charge of the Ganymede, he soon lost his position after abandoning his station to rescue colonists who were not in danger. As well, he accused a Martian Ambassador of being a spy at a respectable ball. Admiral Gorman soon demoted him, and he became the commander of the Aphrodite. \n\tAt first, Strike was not a fan. He sees her as ugly, fat, and cantankerous. He misses the Ganymede, a shiny and new rocketship, and views the Aphrodite as less-than. \n\tWithin the first week of flying her, the Aphrodite had a burned steering tube, which made it necessary to go into free-fall as the damage control party made repairs. Strike\u2019s faith in Lover-Girl continued to plummet. \n\tHowever, after Lieutenant Hendricks, the resident engineer, got her hands on the Aphrodite, Strike\u2019s opinion started to change. Her knowledge of the ship, engineering, and piloting helped him gain confidence in both her abilities and those of Aphrodite.\nNear the end of the story, the Aphrodite is tasked with rescuing two ships that are falling into the sun. Previously Lieutenant Hendricks had fixed up the surge-circuit rheostat, and so she offered it up as the only solution. Strike agrees to try it, which shows his faith and trust in the Aphrodite. Luckily, all things go to plan, and the Aphrodite, with Strike piloting, is able to save the two ships and Admiral Gorman. \nAfter Strike won a medal himself, finally following in the family footsteps, he is offered his old position back on the Ganymede. He refuses, and instead returns to old Lover-Girl. He has grown fond of her over the course of their adventure, and they develop a partnership. ",
        "Summary_2": "Strike is completely unimpressed by the rocket ship Aphrodite. He comments that she looks like a pregnant carp, and he knows that he\u2019s been assigned captain of the ship because he messed up terribly on his other missions. \n\nAphrodite was built 10 years ago, and now she is completely outdated and a laughing stock compared to the other spaceships in the fleet.  She was designed by Harlan Hendricks, and the engineer received a Legion of Merit award for her design. \n\nStrike\u2019s mission is to fly Aphrodite to take the mail from Venusport to Canalopolis, Mars. It\u2019s boring and straightforward.\n\nWhen a disaster occurs and two other ships, the Atropos and the Lachesis, are in serious danger of getting too close to the sun, Strike agrees to take the old girl on a rescue mission. He is convinced by Ivy, since she knows the ship better than anyone else and she believes in her. \n\nAlthough Ivy takes Aphrodite most of the way there, its Strike who finishes the mission and saves his former boss, Gorman, and many other people from certain death. Aphrodite is the entire reason that Strike is able to mend his terrible reputation and he wins back respect from Gorman. Although they got off to a rocky start, Strike finds it impossible to leave his best girl, even when he is offered a job on another ship. He is loyal to the ship that made him a hero. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Strike is assigned to be commander of the spaceship Aphrodite. The ship is assigned as a mail carrier for the inner part of the solar system. The Aphrodite is a dilapidated design with an awful reputation. Strike ended up with the Aphrodite as a result of a series of poor professional decisions that resulted in him getting command of the more prestigious ship Ganymede taken away from him.\n\nHis initial impression of the Aphrodite softens to a grudging respect after the successful mission to save the Atropos and Lachesis. Although he presumably is in line to command the Ganymede again, another faux pas resulting in Strike continuing to command the Aphrodite.   ",
        "Summary_4": "At the beginning of the story, Strike is very reluctant to accept Aphrodite, because being in charge of the ship means a demotion for him. His perception of the ship at the beginning of the story is colored by this history, and his first impression of the ship is not a positive one, even from the outside. Besides the actual construction of the ship, the technology that ran it was not something he showed much faith in. The first week that he was in charge after leaving Venus, it seemed things were going drastically wrong. When one important piece of equipment burnt out, the ship went into freefall, requiring a lot of repair work from the engineers, and anyone in charge of navigation was handed more work because of this as well. The ship was really put to the test when the Aphrodite responded to the distress call from the Lachesis, whose crew was trying to keep the Atropos from falling into the sun. Because Ivy knew the Aphrodite so well, and had been working on the circuits, it turned out the Aphrodite was the perfect ship to save the day. She could not see the rescue all the way through to the end, because she passed out early, but Strike was conscious a little bit longer and took over until he also passed out. After this unexpected rescue mission, Cob, the Executive Officer, noted that Strike has a newfound appreciation for the ship, and has no intention of leaving. Strike is dedicated to his new mission, even though at the beginning of the story he wanted nothing more than to pilot something the same rank as his old ship.",
        "Article": "A week in space had convinced Strike that he commanded a jinx ship.Jetting sunward from Venus, the cantankerous      Aphrodite     had burned asteering tube through, and it had been necessary to go into free-fallwhile Jenkins, the Assistant E/O, and a damage control party effectedrepairs. When the power was again applied, Old Aphrodisiac was runningten hours behind schedule, and Strike and Evans, the AstrogationOfficer, were sweating out the unforeseen changes introduced into theorbital calculations by the time spent in free-fall.     The      Aphrodite     rumbled on toward the orbit of Mercury....     For all the tension between the occupants of the flying-bridge, Strikeand Ivy Hendricks worked well together. And after a second week inspace, a reluctant admiration was replacing the resentment betweenthem. Ivy spent whatever time she could spare tinkering with herfather's pet surge-circuit and Strike began to realize that there waslittle she did not know about spaceship engineering. Then, too, Ivyspent a lot of time at the controls, and Strike was forced to admitthat he had never seen a finer job of piloting done by man or woman.     And finally, Ivy hated old Brass-bottom Gorman even more than Strikedid. She felt that Gorman had ruined her father's career, and she wasdedicating her life to proving her father right and Brass-bottom wrong.There's nothing in the cosmos to nurture friendship like a common enemy.     At 30,000,000 miles from the sun, the      Aphrodite's     refrigerationunits could no longer keep the interior of the ship at a comfortabletemperature. The thermometer stood at 102\u00b0F, the very metal ofthe ship's fittings hot to the touch. Uniforms were discarded,insignia of rank vanished. The men dressed in fiberglass shorts andspaceboots, sweat making their naked bodies gleam like copper under thesodium-vapor lights. The women in the crew added only light blouses totheir shorts ... and suffered from extra clothing.     Strike was in the observation blister forward, when Ensign Grahamcalled to say that she had picked up a radar contact sunward. TheIFF showed the pips to be the      Lachesis     and the      Atropos     . The twodreadnaughts were engaged in coronary research patrol ... a purelyroutine business. But the thing that made Strike curse under his breathwas Celia Graham's notation that the      Atropos     carried none other thanSpace Admiral Horatio Gorman, Cominch Inplan.     Strike thought it a pity that old Brass-bottom couldn't fall intoHell's hottest pit ... and he told Ivy so.     And she agreed.   <doc-sep>   Jinx Ship To The Rescue     By ALFRED COPPEL, JR.

The scaly bulk of the Tellurian Rocket Ship      Aphrodite     loomedunhappily into the thick air above the two men as they reached theventral valve.

Senior Lieutenant Coburn Whitley\u2014Cob to his friends\u2014nodded inagreement. That's our Lover-Girl ... old Aphrodisiac herself. The shipwith the poison personality. Cob was the      Aphrodite's     Executive,and he had been with her a full year ... which was a record for Execson the      Aphrodite     . She generally sent them Earthside with nervousbreakdowns in half that time.     Tell me, Captain, continued Cob curiously, how does it happenthat you of all people happened to draw this tub for a command? Ithought....     You know Gorman? queried Strykalski.     Cob nodded. Oh, yes. Yes, indeed. Old Brass-bottom Gorman?     The same.     Well, Cob ran a hand over his chin speculatively, I know Gorman'sa prize stinker ... but you were in command of the      Ganymede     . And,after all, you come from an old service family and all that. How comethis? He indicated the monitor expressively.     Strike sighed. Well, now, Cob, I'll tell you. You'll be spacing withme and I guess you've a right to know the worst ... not that youwouldn't find it out anyway. I come from a long line of very sharpoperators. Seven generations of officers and gentlemen. Lousy withtradition.     The first David Farragut Strykalski, son of a sea-loving Polishimmigrant, emerged from World War II a four-striper and CongressionalMedal winner. Then came David Farragut Strykalski, Jr., and, in theabortive Atomic War that terrified the world in 1961, he won a UnitedNations Peace Citation. And then came David Farragut Strykalski III ...me.     From such humble beginnings do great traditions grow. But somethinghappened when I came into the picture. I don't fit with the rest ofthem. Call it luck or temperament or what have you.     In the first place I seem to have an uncanny talent for saying thewrong thing to the wrong person. Gorman for example. And I take toomuch on my own initiative. Gorman doesn't like that. I lost the      Ganymede     because I left my station where I was supposed to be runningsection-lines to take on a bunch of colonists I thought were indanger....     The Procyon A people? asked Cob.     So you've heard about it. Strike shook his head sadly. My tacticalastrophysicist warned me that Procyon A might go nova. I left myroutine post and loaded up on colonists. He shrugged. Wrong guess. Nonova. I made an ass of myself and lost the      Ganymede     . Gorman gave itto his former aide. I got this.     Cob coughed slightly. I heard something about Ley City, too.     Me again. The      Ganymede's     whole crew ended up in the Luna Base brig.We celebrated a bit too freely.     Cob Whitley looked admiringly at his new Commander. That was the nightafter the      Ganymede     broke the record for the Centaurus B-Earth run,wasn't it? And then wasn't there something about....     Canalopolis?     Whitley nodded.     That time I called the Martian Ambassador a spy. It was at a TellurianEmbassy Ball.     I begin to see what you mean, Captain.     Strike's the name, Cob.     Whitley's smile was expansive. Strike, I think you're going to likeour old tin pot here. He patted the      Aphrodite's     nether bellyaffectionately. She's old ... but she's loose. And we're not likely tomeet any Ambassadors or Admirals with her, either.     Strykalski sighed, still thinking of his sleek      Ganymede     . She'llcarry the mail, I suppose. And that's about all that's expected of her.     Cob shrugged philosophically. Better than tanking that stinking rocketfuel, anyway. Deep space?     Strike shook his head. Venus-Mars.     Cob scratched his chin speculatively. Perihelion run. Hot work.     Strike was again looking at the spaceship's unprepossessing exterior.A surge-circuit monitor, so help me.     Cob nodded agreement. The last of her class.   <doc-sep> And she was not an inspiring sight. The fantastically misnamed      Aphrodite     was a surge-circuit monitor of twenty guns built some tenyears back in the period immediately preceding the Ionian SubjugationIncident. She had been designed primarily for atomics, with asurge-circuit set-up for interstellar flight. At least that was theplanner's view. In those days, interstellar astrogation was in itsformative stage, and at the time of the      Aphrodite's     launching thesurge-circuit was hailed as the very latest in space drives.     Her designer, Harlan Hendricks, had been awarded a Legion of Meritfor her, and every silver-braided admiral in the Fleet had dreamedof hoisting his flag on one of her class. There had been three. The      Artemis     , the      Andromeda     , and the prototype ... old Aphrodisiac. Thethree vessels had gone into action off Callisto after the Phobos Raidhad set off hostilities between the Ionians and the Solarian Combine.     All three were miserable failures.     The eager officers commanding the three monitors had found the circuittoo appealing to their hot little hands. They used it ... in some way,wrongly.     The      Artemis     exploded. The      Andromeda     vanished in the generaldirection of Coma Berenices glowing white hot from the heat of aruptured fission chamber and spewing gamma rays in all directions.And the      Aphrodite's     starboard tubes blew, causing her to spend herstore of vicious energy spinning like a Fourth of July pinwheel under20 gravities until all her interior fittings ... including crew were atangled, pulpy mess within her pressure hull.     The      Aphrodite     was refitted for space. And because it was an integralpart of her design, the circuit was rebuilt ... and sealed. She becamea workhorse, growing more cantankerous with each passing year. Shecarried personnel.... She trucked ores. She ferried skeeterboats andtanked rocket fuel. Now, she would carry the mail. She would lift fromVenusport and jet to Canalopolis, Mars, without delay or variation.Regulations, tradition and Admiral Gorman of the Inner Planet Fleetrequired it. And it was now up to David Farragut Strykalski III to seeto it that she did....     The Officer of the Deck, a trim blonde girl in spotless greys salutedsmartly as Strike and Cob stepped through the valve.     Strike felt vaguely uncomfortable. He knew, of course, that at least athird of the personnel on board non-combat vessels of the Inner PlanetFleet was female, but he had never actually had women on board a shipof his own, and he felt quite certain that he preferred them elsewhere.     Cob sensed his discomfort. That was Celia Graham, Strike. Ensign.Radar Officer. She's good, too.     Strike shook his head. Don't like women in space. They make meuncomfortable.     Cob shrugged. Celia's the only officer. But about a quarter of ourratings are women. He grinned maliciously. Equal rights, you know.     No doubt, commented the other sourly. Is that why they namedthis ... ship 'Aphrodite'?     Whitley saw fit to consider the question rhetorical and remained silent.     Strike lowered his head to clear the arch of the flying-bridgebulkhead. Cob followed. He trailed his Captain through a jungleof chrome piping to the main control panels. Strike sank into anacceleration chair in front of the red DANGER seal on the surge-circuitrheostat.     Looks like a drug-store fountain, doesn't it? commented Cob.     Strykalski nodded sadly, thinking of the padded smoothness of the      Ganymede's     flying-bridge. But she's home to us, anyway.     The thick Venusian fog had closed in around the top levels of the ship,hugging the ports and cutting off all view of the field outside. Strikereached for the squawk-box control.     Now hear this. All officer personnel will assemble in the flyingbridge at 600 hours for Captain's briefing. Officer of the Deck willrecall any enlisted personnel now on liberty....     Whitley was on his feet, all the slackness gone from his manner.Orders, Captain?     We can't do anything until the new Engineering Officer gets here.They're sending someone down from the      Antigone     , and I expect him by600 hours. In the meantime you'll take over his part of the work. Seeto it that we are fueled and ready to lift ship by 602. Base will startloading the mail at 599:30. That's about all.     Yes, sir. Whitley saluted and turned to go. At the bulkhead, hepaused. Captain, he asked, Who is the new E/O to be?     Strike stretched his long legs out on the steel deck. A LieutenantHendricks, I. V. Hendricks, is what the orders say.     Cob thought hard for a moment and then shrugged his shoulders. I. V.Hendricks. He shook his head. Don't know him.  "

        "Query": "What is the backdrop of the story Jinx Ship To The Rescue?",
        "Summary_1": "Jinx Ship to the Rescue by Alfred Coppel, Jr. takes place in space, but more specifically in the Aphrodite. \n\tIt starts in the muddy Venusport Base on Venus. Venusport is famous for its warm, slimy, and green rain that falls for 480 hours of every day. A fog rolls in and degrades visibility. \n\tDespite starting on Venusport Base, the characters actually spend most of their time onboard the Aphrodite, a Tellurian Rocket Ship. The Aphrodite had a surge-circuit monitor of twenty guns built into her frame. She was bulky, fat, and ugly, and occasionally had some technical and mechanical struggles as well. \n\tAlthough her frame may not be appealing, she soon becomes victorious as she gains the trust of Strike and other members of his crew and saves two fallen dreadnaughts. With her surge-circuit rheostat rebuilt, the Aphrodite is finally able to accomplish what she was always meant to. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story starts on the planet of Venus. Venus has days that are 720 hours long, and rain is common. The rain is hot, slimy, and green, and it makes the already wet swamplands even more mushy. Fog is common on Venus.\n\nThe middle of the story takes place on the old and outdated ship, Aphrodite. She gives the crew members a lot of trouble on their first mission. She is in dire need of repairs, she\u2019s slow, and it\u2019s impossible to control her temperature. The crew members are unable to wear their uniforms because the temperature is over 100 degrees. \n\nAphrodite\u2019s mission is simple. She needs to take the mail from Venus to Mars, and it\u2019s the only thing she can be trusted to do successfully. So it\u2019s very impressive when she ends up being the hero of the day and manages to rescue two other ships that are headed towards the sun. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The narrative is set in the early 21st century primarily aboard the spaceship Aphrodite. The ship's mission is to deliver mail in the inner part of the solar system.\n\nThe ships route takes them around the sun and as a result the ambient temperature inside the ship begins to rise to intolerable levels due to proximity to the sun. Because of the heat, the coed crew is allowed to operate with very little clothing. Aphrodite is a ship of an outdated design that gives it a lack of comfort and subjects it to numerous small problems that make its operation frustrating.",
        "Summary_4": "The story starts at a spaceport on Venus, where it has been raining for hundreds of hours straight. The rain has stopped by the time the story starts, but it is left a lot of mud in the swampy marshes. It was nearing the end of the day, and the fog was enveloping the surroundings as it grew darker outside. It was hot and sticky at Venusport Base, but after Strike left the service on his mission in the Aphrodite, it would only grow hotter on board. The ship itself, where most of the story takes place, is an older, refitted, bulky type of ship. There were only two others like it, and their designer had been awarded a Legion of Merit for the three. However, this is the only one still in use, as the others were destroyed in a much earlier mission. Strike\u2019s disappointment in the ship seems to mirror the sentiment. Inside the ship, there are many systems of pipes connected the control panels, and the captain had to navigate carefully so that he didn\u2019t hit his head on the bulkhead. While in space, as the ship flew closer and closer to the sun, the interior of the ship grew hotter and hotter. The crew opted to wear as little clothing as possible in an attempt to handle the heat. When the Aphrodite received the distress call from the Lachesis, the ships were close enough to the sun to be affected by its gravitational pull. After the close call near the sun, once everyone regained consciousness, the story ends at an officer\u2019s club on Mars. It was a formal environment, and the Aphrodite\u2019s captain and executive officer planned the rest of their route from there.",

I left myroutine post and loaded up on colonists. He shrugged. Wrong guess. Nonova. I made an ass of myself and lost the      Ganymede     . Gorman gave itto his former aide. I got this.     Cob coughed slightly. I heard something about Ley City, too.     Me again. The      Ganymede's     whole crew ended up in the Luna Base brig.We celebrated a bit too freely.

Better than tanking that stinking rocketfuel, anyway. Deep space?     Strike shook his head. Venus-Mars.     Cob scratched his chin speculatively. Perihelion run. Hot work.

        "Query": "What is the story of Jinx Ship To The Rescue and how does it involve Strike?",
        "Summary_1": "Strike is a member of an esteemed service family on Venus; seven generations of well-behaved and well-trained operators. Unfortunately, Strike struggles to carry on the family tradition, and is known for misspeaking and offending those around him. By trusting his gut, he wound up failing his higher-ups and crew several times. All this culminated in an eventual mistrust of Strike, which led to him being charged with the Aphrodite. \n\tHis deep hatred of Space Admiral Gordon is passionate, but not without reason. Gordon is the one who demoted him to the Aphrodite. At the start, Strike is checking out his new vessel and notes how ugly the ship is. After examining the ship and it\u2019s crew, it is revealed that Strike is uncomfortable around women and believes they don\u2019t belong on a spaceship. \n\tIn order to start flying, he calls in an expert engineer to come aboard and travel with them. Thinking I.V. Hendricks is a man, he is excited to have them onboard. But when Ivy Hendricks shows up, a female engineer and the daughter of the Aphrodite\u2019s creator, his world is soon turned upside down. \n\tHis initial negative reaction to her is soon displaced by begrudging appreciation and eventually trust and friendship. Hendricks proves his previous theories about women wrong, and Strike is forced to accept that perhaps women do belong on a spaceship. She especially impresses him with her total knowledge of spaceship engineering and the Aphrodite in general. And it helped that she hated Admiral Gorman just as much as Strike, if not more. \n\tWhile flying by the sun to deliver mail, the Aphrodite receives a distress call from two ships: the Lachesis and the Atropos, the latter of which carried Admiral Gorman onboard. After the Aphrodite reached orbit, the Lachesis reached out and reported the Atropos was falling into the sun, due to a burst chamber. They couldn\u2019t move those onboard over thanks to all the radiation, so the Lachesis was attempting to pull the Atropos back using an unbreakable cord. But it wasn\u2019t enough. \n\tSince Ivy Hendricks had fixed the surge-circuit rheostat--the feature that crashed the original Aphrodite--, they were able to save the Lachesis and the Atropos and regain some of their dignity and former glory. \n\tStrike is awarded the Spatial Cross, as well as Cob, his friend and longtime executive of the Aphrodite. Strike was asked to return to the Ganymede, a beautiful sleek ship, but allegedly said the wrong thing to Gorman, and was instead sent back to the Aphrodite. Cob believes he did it on purpose, as Strike had grown quite fond of Lover-Girl. \n\tIvy has gone to the Bureau of Ships to engineer vessels, a great upgrade from her previous job. Cob pressures Strike to reach out to her, but he refuses. However, it ends on a hopeful note, with the potential for romance between Strike and Hendricks, and even more adventures on the clunky Aphrodite. ",
        "Summary_2": "Strike\u2019s real name is Brevet Lieutenant Commander David Farragut Strykalski III. After serving on the Ganymede, he is put in charge of the Aphrodite. He comes from many generations of officers. However, he doesn\u2019t feel like he fits the mold of his grandfather and great-grandfather and so on. His boss, Gorman, disagreed with several decisions he made in the past and sent him to work on the Aphrodite, the unimpressive spaceship.\n\nStrike does not like working with women in space, so he is disappointed when two of his crew members are powerful and successful females. He learns his lesson after working with Ivy Hendricks for a few weeks. She impresses him with her piloting skills and her knowledge of the ship that her father designed. \n\nStrike is skeptical at first when Ivy wants to take Aphrodite to rescue two ships whose crew members are in grave danger. He knows that the mistakes he made before got him on the Aphrodite, and there\u2019s a big chance that he\u2019ll be fired for trying to save the day, or worse, the mission could end in death for him and all of his crew members. He has feelings for Ivy, and her intense passion convinces him that she\u2019s right, Aphrodite can handle the mission and they can save those peoples\u2019 lives.\n\nIvy pilots the ship almost the entire route, but she is unable to finish the job when she passes out from the intense heat. Captain Strike takes over and saves the crews on the Atropos and the Lachesis. He is hailed as a hero, and he repairs his terrible reputation with the selfless act. He decides not to leave the Aphrodite. He wants to be loyal to the ship that worked so hard for him. He does decide to give Ivy a call. Even though she outranks him, he has to admit that he has a crush on her. ",
        "Summary_3": "Strike is the commander of the Aphrodite. He was originally the commander of the prestigious Ganymede. However a number of decisions made out of bravado as well as some unprofessional comments lost him that command.\n\nNow in command of a dilapidated ship, Strike comes to terms with his job. He commands a crew including a large number of women which makes him somewhat uncomfortable. His engineering officer Ivy Hendricks in particular seems to be of romantic interest to Strike.\n\nStrike ends up teaming with Ivy to save two ships from falling into the sun earning him a small promotion but an ill-advised comment prevents him from leaving the Aphrodite, perhaps to the satisfaction of Strike himself.",
        "Summary_4": "Strike is a highly decorated lieutenant commander in the Navy, who comes from a long line of ship operators. Although he has run many successful missions, he has a reputation of causing trouble\u2014his new Executive Officer, Cob, has heard a number of stories that he asks Strike for details about. Strike has lost command of the ship that he had been captaining, and is sent by Admiral Gorman to captain a mail route on the Aphrodite. He is extremely hesitant to have any positive feelings about the experience, from the ship itself, to the inclusion of women on its crew. Not only is this not the type of ship he is used to, he is never served with women on board. He has to navigate adapting to the new situation while adapting to the new job. Through the first week of his assignment, the ship and its crew grow on him. He comes to trust Ivy Hendricks, the Engineering Officer, and he lets her take charge to try to save the other ships when they respond to a distress call. Eventually, she passes out, and has to leave Strike in charge of getting the ships to safety. Eventually,  Strike passes out just like everyone else, from the ship\u2019s acceleration to break the sun\u2019s gravity. At the end of the story, it is clear that his increased appreciation for the ship means he plans on staying, to the delight of his Executive Officer. Cob alludes to Strike having feelings for Ivy, but he says that although she is nice, he has no interest in being with a woman with a higher ranked title than he has. ",

The hot, slimy, greenish rain that drenched Venusportfor two-thirds of the 720-hour day had stopped at last, but now amiasmic fog was rising from the surrounding swampland, rolling acrossthe mushy landing ramp toward the grounded spaceship. Visibility wasdropping fast, and soon porto-sonar sets would have to be used to findthe way about the surface Base. It was an ordinary day on Venus.     Strike cursed Space Admiral Gorman and all his ancestors with a wealthof feeling. Then he motioned wearily to his companion, and togetherthey sloshed through the mud toward the ancient monitor.     The scaly bulk of the Tellurian Rocket Ship      Aphrodite     loomedunhappily into the thick air above the two men as they reached theventral valve. Strike raised reluctant eyes to the sloping flank of thefat spaceship.     It looks, he commented bitterly, like a pregnant carp.     Senior Lieutenant Coburn Whitley\u2014Cob to his friends\u2014nodded inagreement. That's our Lover-Girl ... old Aphrodisiac herself. The shipwith the poison personality.

Tell me, Captain, continued Cob curiously, how does it happenthat you of all people happened to draw this tub for a command? Ithought....     You know Gorman? queried Strykalski.     Cob nodded. Oh, yes. Yes, indeed. Old Brass-bottom Gorman?     The same.

Thefrantic flame that lashed out from the      Lachesis'     tube was fading, herfission chambers fusing under the terrific heat of splitting atoms.Still she tried. She could not desert her sister ship, nor could shesave her. Already the two ships had fallen to within 18,000,000 milesof the sun's terrifying atmosphere of glowing gases. The prominencesthat spouted spaceward seemed like great fiery tentacles reaching forthe trapped men on board the warships. The atmospheric guiding fins,the gun-turrets and other protuberances on both ships were beginningto melt under the fierce radiance. Only the huge refrigeration plantson the vessels made life within them possible. And, even so, men weredying.     Swiftly, the fat, ungainly shape of old Aphrodisiac drew near. In herflying-bridge, Strike and Ivy Hendricks watched the stricken ships inthe darkened viewport.     The temperature stood at 140\u00b0 and the air was bitter with the smellof hot metal. Ivy's blouse clung to her body, soaked through withperspiration. Sweat ran from her hair into her eyes and she gaspedfor breath in the oven hot compartment. Strike watched her withapprehension.     Carefully, Ivy circled the two warships. From the starboard tube onthe gun-deck, a homing rocket leapt toward the      Atropos     . It plungedstraight and true, spilling cable as it flew. It slammed up againstthe hull, and stuck there, fast to the battleship's flank. Quickly,a robocrane drew it within the ship and the cable was made secure.Like cosmic replicas of the ancient South American bolas, the threespacecraft whirled in space ... and all three began that sunward plungetogether.        They were diving into the sun.        The heat in the      Aphrodite's     bridge was unbearable. The thermometershowed 145\u00b0 and it seemed to Strike that Hell must be cool bycomparison.     Ivy fought her reeling senses and the bucking ship as the slack cameout of the cable. Blackness was flickering at the edges of her fieldof vision. She could scarcely lift her hand to the red-sealed circuitrheostat. Shudderingly, she made the effort ... and failed. Conscious,but too spent to move, she collapsed over the blistering hot instrumentpanel.           Ivy!      Strike was beside her, cradling her head in his arm.     I ... I ... can't make it ... Strike. You'll ... have to run ... theshow ... after ... all.     Strike laid her gently in an acceleration chair and turned toward thecontrol panel. His head was throbbing painfully as he broke the seal onthe surge-circuit.     Slowly he turned the rheostat. Relays chattered. From deep withinold Lover-Girl's vitals came a low whine. He fed more power into thecircuit. Cadmium rods slipped into lead sheaths decks below in thetube-rooms. The whining rose in pitch. The spinning of the ships inspace slowed. Stopped. With painful deliberation, they swung into line.     More power. The whine changed to a shriek. A banshee wail.     Cob's voice came through the squawk-box, soberly. Strike, Celia'sfainted down here. We can't take much more of this heat.     We're trying, Cob! shouted Strike over the whine of the circuit. Thegauges showed the accumulators full.       Now!      He spun the rheostat tothe stops, and black space burst over his brain....     The last thing he remembered was a voice. It sounded like Bayne's. Andit was shouting. We're moving 'em! We're pulling away! We're.... Andthat was all.     The space-tug      Scylla     found them.     The three ships ...

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in Doorway to Kal-Jmar?",
        "Summary_1": "Syme Rector is the most-wanted raider in the Triplanet Patrol system and wants access to the ancient Martian city of Kal-Jmar so that he can steal the priceless objects located there. The city has been abandoned for thousands of years, but no human has been able to enter it. Rector crashed his ship in the Mare Cimmerium and left a false trail for authorities to divert them from following him to Lillis, where he plans to obtain a spaceman\u2019s identity card. This card will enable him to ship out on a freighter flight after he has obtained his stolen goods. \n\nRector follows a young patrolman until he catches him unaware on the observation deck of the Founders\u2019 Tower. Rector shoots him in the chest, steals his wallet, and throws his body over the parapet. However, a hook on the patrolman\u2019s uniform catches Rector, pulling Rector over the parapet. He manages to unhook himself, and just as he estimates he can hold on one minute longer, a man comes and pulls him up. The man is Harold Tate, and he invites Rector to have a drink with him. As they get drunk, Tate confides to Rector that he needs a guide to take him to Kal-Jmar; he has discovered a way to enter the dome surrounding the city. \n\nThe two men set out on their journey and follow a gully they reach. While they are in the lower part, Tate sees something overhead, and a boulder crashes down just to the left of their sand car. A horde of Martians surrounds them and forces the two men to go with them. The leader reveals that the Martians are telepathic and have no need for a spoken language. The Martians want nothing to do with the humans because there is nothing to gain from the humans. The leader tells the men the history of the two species of Martians but says they will kill the men.\n\nWhen the leader pulls his gun on Tate, Rector launches himself against the leader and wrestles away his gun. He shoots the leader and the other Martians as he dodges their shots. The two men then begin walking toward Kal-Jmar and reach the city. Tate uses his device to create a hole in the dome but realizes it isn\u2019t strong enough. Then he thinks of using it where a door would have been, and it works. Rector shoots Tate, and just before he dies, Tate warns him, \u201cYou\u2019ll be--sorry.\u201d Rector takes the device and enters the city, noting all the treasures he can steal. He realizes he is hungry and takes two food tablets, but they don\u2019t satisfy him. Then a lifelike robot that is a feeding machine enters and approaches Rector. Rector is startled and opens his mouth, and the robot shoots a feeding tube into Rector\u2019s throat and pours xopa juice into him. The juice is poisonous to humans, and Rector dies immediately. The doorway to Kal-Jmar closes.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Syme Rector is one of the most well-known outlaws in the galaxy. After crashing on Mars, he is desperate for a spaceman\u2019s identity card so he can remain in place just a little while longer. He follows a young man until he can murder him with his energy pistol. But as the body falls, so does Syme, who was hooked onto the man\u2019s clothing. He hangs off the ledge of the building as disattaches himself from the boy. His body falls to the group, just as Harold Tate, physicist, rescues Syme. \nWith his victim\u2019s wallet in hand, Syme takes Tate to the bar and orders drinks for the both of them. Tate drunkenly reveals his greatest invention and desire to go to Kal-Jmar to test it out. Syme agrees to take him to the city, with the hopes of glory and money in return. On their journey across Mars, they run into the native Martians and are captured. These terrifying creatures take them deep down into the caverns, where some oxygen is present. Since the Martians are going to kill them, they are able to reveal some of their secrest. They tell them the story of the downfall of Kal-Jmar, show off their telepathic abilities, and more. Syme is able to escape and kill all the Martians, rescuing Tate who was of no help. \nThey continue their journey, now on foot, even though Syme was injured in the fight. Once they reach Kal-Jmar, Tate sets up his equipment. His first try fails, due to the enormity of the force field. His battery power is limited though, and he only has a few more tries left. He figures out that there must be areas where the force field is weaker, doorways in the dome. Tate locates one and they use his invention on it. It works, and the doorway opens. As they move to enter it, Syme reminds Tate to gather his equipment. As he does this, Syme pulls out his gun and shoots Tate in the chest. He steals his equipment and steps through the rapidly closing doorway. \nNow in the great city of Kal-Jmar, he takes his time and explores. The architecture was magnificent and decadent, a true treasure. He imagines all the money he can make off of sealing the artifacts and materials here. \nHe enters a building and discovers oxygen is present. He takes off his spacesuit and breathes in the fresh air. He takes two food tablets to ease his hunger, but it\u2019s not enough. A telepathic Martian robot emerges, still operable thanks to its companions. Its job is to detect hunger and then feed those who need it. After detecting Syme\u2019s hunger, it thrusts a feeding tube down his throat and feeds him poisonous lichen. Syme collapses and dies, leaving Kal-Jmar unexplored and undiscovered.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Syme Rector is an outlaw looking for safe passage out of the Martian city of Lillis after the crash landing of his ship. He stalks and kills a boy in order to gain access to his identification and attempt to leave the planet and avoid the authorities.\n\nHe meets Harold Tate who is looking for a guide to take him to the ancient city of Kal-Jmar. Syme agrees to take Tate to his proposed location. On the way they meet Martians who they engage and defeat.\n\nOnce they reach Kal-Jmar, Tate is able to open a door to the city. Syme betrays Tate, killing him. However Syme is himself killed when a robot inside the city mistakes him for a hungry Martian and forcibly feeds him poisonous food.",
        "Summary_4": "Syme Rector crashes his spaceship in Mare Cimmerium and gets through the translucent dome. He needs to disguise himself as an authority figure to enter the city, and he will need a spaceman\u2019s identity card to do that.\n\nRector worries that the Triplanet Patrol will soon realize that he is an intruder. He follows a young patrolman and shoots him with a flame in the chest. He then takes his identification card and throws his body over the balcony. However, he unknowingly attaches the boy\u2019s clothing to his own, and he begins falling over the railing along with the corpse. He lands on a roof and manages to unhook himself from his victim. \n\nHarold Tate comes along and helps Rector get back to safety. The two earth men grab an alcoholic beverage and discuss some secret plans. Tate wants to visit Kal-Jmar, an ancient Martian city. He believes he has discovered a way to penetrate a dome there that houses the Martians\u2019 incredible machinery, equipment, and records. Rector agrees to go with him. \n\nThe men travel in a sand car and are quickly attacked by a horde of Martians who throw a boulder at them and wreck their car. They surround the vehicle, armed with spears and guns. Syme and Rector go with the Martians underground into a cavern. \n\nThere, they learn that the Martians speak English, and they are also telepathic. The leader informs them that he has to murder them. First, however, he will tell them anything they want to know. The leader reveals that he and the other Martians are not a separate species from the ancients as a popular theory stated. However, they are also not the ancestors of the ancients. The two groups of Martians lived alongside each other for many years, but when Mars\u2019 atmosphere changed quickly, the other group was unable to adapt. \n\nRector\u2019s rage suddenly bubbles up, and he attacks the lead Martian before the thought even crosses his mind. He is able to pull the Martian\u2019s gun out of his hand and he hits him over the head with it. In an incredible rage, Rector takes down every last enemy. \n\nWithout their car, the two men trudge through the sand towards the famous dome. Tate takes out his invention, and after a few tries, it begins working. A hole in the dome opens, and Rector takes out his gun and kills Tate. Rector grabs the machine and goes into the dome. He immediately sets his eyes on platinum, ornaments, machines, books, and records. In his mind, he makes big plans to steal as much as he can carry and sell it immediately. He will come back for bigger items later. \n\nHe sees a robot rolling silently around the room, and Rector realizes that the robot is there to feed the Martians. Before he can even process the realization, the robot approaches Rector and shoves a liquid poisonous fungus down his throat. The dome\u2019s door closes, and Rector dies. ",

He felt in thecontainer of his helmet, extracted a couple of food tablets, and poppedthem into his mouth.     They would take care of his needs, but they didn't satisfy his hunger.No food tablets for him after this! Steaks, wines, souffles.... Hismouth began to water at the very thought.     And then the robot rolled on soundless wheels into the room. Symewhirled and saw it only when it was almost upon him. The thing wasremarkably lifelike, and for a moment he was startled.     But it was not alive. It was only a Martian feeding-machine, kept inrepair all these millennia by other robots. It was not intelligent,and so it did not know that its masters would never return. It did notknow, either, that Syme was not a Martian, or that he wanted a steak,and not the distilled liquor of the      xopa     fungus, which still grew inthe subterranean gardens of Kal-Jmar. It was capable only of receivingthe mental impulse of hunger, and of responding to that impulse.     And so when Syme saw it and opened his mouth in startlement, therobot acted as it had done with its degenerate, slothful masters. Itsflexible feeding tube darted out and half down the man's gullet beforehe could move to avoid it. And down Syme Rector's throat poured a floodof      xopa     -juice, nectar to Martians, but swift, terrible death to humanbeings....

I understood in my discussions withthe other ... ah ... civilian there'd be no further need for theseirritating conferences.     I've just learned you're placing more students abroad, Mr. Gulver. Howmany this time?     Two thousand.     And where will they be going?     Croanie. It's all in the application form I've handed in. Your job isto provide transportation.     Will there be any other students embarking this season?     Why ... perhaps. That's Boge's business. Gulver looked at Retief withpursed lips. As a matter of fact, we had in mind dispatching anothertwo thousand to Featherweight.     Another under-populated world\u2014and in the same cluster, I believe,Retief said. Your people must be unusually interested in that regionof space.     If that's all you wanted to know, I'll be on my way. I have matters ofimportance to see to.     After Gulver left, Retief called Miss Furkle in. I'd like to have abreak-out of all the student movements that have been planned under thepresent program, he said. And see if you can get a summary of whatMEDDLE has been shipping lately.     Miss Furkle compressed her lips. If Mr. Magnan were here, I'm surehe wouldn't dream of interfering in the work of other departments.I ... overheard your conversation with the gentleman from the CroanieLegation\u2014     The lists, Miss Furkle.     I'm not accustomed, Miss Furkle said, to intruding in mattersoutside our interest cluster.     That's worse than listening in on phone conversations, eh? But nevermind. I need the information, Miss Furkle.     Loyalty to my Chief\u2014     Loyalty to your pay-check should send you scuttling for the materialI've asked for, Retief said. I'm taking full responsibility. Nowscat.     The buzzer sounded. Retief flipped a key. MUDDLE, Retief speaking....     Arapoulous's brown face appeared on the desk screen.     How-do, Retief. Okay if I come up?     Sure, Hank. I want to talk to you.     In the office, Arapoulous took a chair. Sorry if I'm rushing you,Retief, he said. But have you got anything for me?     Retief waved at the wine bottles. What do you know about Croanie?     Croanie? Not much of a place. Mostly ocean. All right if you likefish, I guess. We import our seafood from there. Nice prawns in monsoontime. Over a foot long.     You on good terms with them?     Sure, I guess so. Course, they're pretty thick with Boge.     So?     Didn't I tell you? Boge was the bunch that tried to take us over herea dozen years back. They'd've made it too, if they hadn't had a lot ofbad luck. Their armor went in the drink, and without armor they're easygame.     Miss Furkle buzzed. I have your lists, she said shortly.     Bring them in, please.   <doc-sep> Kal-Jmar was the riddle of the Solar System.

But they couldn't be reached.     For Kal-Jmar's dome was not the thing of steelite that protectedLillis: it was a tenuous, globular field of force that defied analysisas it defied explosives and diamond drills. The field extended bothabove and below the ground, and tunneling was of no avail. No one knewwhat had happened to the Martians, whether they were the ancestors ofthe present decadent Martian race, or a different species. No one knewanything about them or about Kal-Jmar.     In the early days, when the conquest of Mars was just beginning, Earthscientists had been wild to get into the city. They had observed itfrom every angle, taken photographs of its architecture and the robotsthat still patrolled its fantastically winding streets, and then theyhad tried everything they knew to pierce the wall.     Later, however, when every unsuccessful attempt had precipitated abloody uprising of the present-day Martians\u2014resulting in a rapiddwindling of the number of Martians\u2014the Mars Protectorate had steppedin and forbidden any further experiments; forbidden, in fact, anyEarthman to go near the place.     Thus matter had stood for over a hundred years, until Harold Tate.Tate, a physicist, had stumbled on a field that seemed to be identicalin properties to the Kal-Jmar dome; and what is more, he had found aforce that would break it down.     And so he had made his first trip to Mars, and within twenty-fourhours, by the blindest of chances, blurted out his secret to SymeRector, the scourge of the spaceways, the man with a thousand creditson his sleek, tigerish head.     Syme's smile was not tigerish now; it was carefully, studiedly mild.For Tate was no longer drunk, and it was important that it should notoccur to him that he had been indiscreet.     This is native territory we're coming to, Harold, he said. Betterstrap on your gun.     Why. Are they really dangerous?     They're unpredictable, Syme told him. They're built differently, andthey think differently. They breathe like us, down in their cavernswhere there's air, but they also eat sand, and get their oxygen thatway.     Yes, I've heard about that, Tate said. Iron oxide\u2014very interestingmetabolism. He got his energy pistol out of the compartment andstrapped it on absently.

So you think they might attack us? Tate asked again, nervously.     They      might     do anything, Syme said curtly. Don't worry about it.     The hills were much closer than they had seemed, because of Mars'deceptively low horizon.

        "Query": "What is the backdrop of the story Doorway to Kal-Jmar?",
        "Summary_1": "The setting of the story is on Mars. It begins in the city of Lillis, which is covered with a translucent steelite dome and is guarded by the Triplanet Patrol. One outstanding feature of the city is its Founders\u2019 Tower, which is the tallest building in Lillis. On the top level, there is an observation deck that looks out over the city. Outside the city is an area called the Mare Cimmerium. The planet has red dust and supports some life, specifically lichens and tumble-grass. It has mountains, canyons, gullies, and deserts.\n\nThe ancient city of Kal-Jmar features prominently in the story. It is an ancient city of the Martian race that was very advanced but is now abandoned. There are machines, records, and other objects left behind, and all are perfectly preserved inside a bubble-like dome that is formed by a force field. Humans have tried to enter the dome using explosives, diamond drills, and even tunnels under the city, but nothing they have tried has penetrated the dome. When Mars was first being conquered, humans tried to get into the city, but their efforts resulted in bloody battles with the current Martians, so eventually, the Mars Protectorate forbade any Earthmen from going near Kal-Jmar. The city has elaborate architecture and features a pair of twin towers. When Rector enters the city, he notices there is no dust, and the air is breathable. Doors open and close automatically. The room Rector enters has platinum ornaments set in the walls and the furniture. \n\nAs Tate and Rector travel toward Kal-Jmar in their sand car outside of Lillis, they note that Mars has a deceptively low horizon. The surface contains a series of dunes, channels, and gullies that they have to cross. The gully they follow is extremely deep and steep, and from the bottom, they can only see a small section of the sky. \n\nWhen the Martians take Tate and Rector to their cavern, it is approximately nine kilometers below the gully they were in. There is a sense of moisture in the tunnel they take to the Martians\u2019 cavern. In the cavern, the walls are covered with a phosphorescent glowing fungus, and there is air, although not enough for the humans to use. Some of the Martians eat the fungus. \n\n",
        "Summary_2": "Although the beginning of the story takes place on Venus, it quickly transitions to Mars. Specifically, the long-lost city of Kal-Jmar. \nWith a protective sphere, Kal-Jmar is impenetrable and the myth and folklore surrounding it are grandiose. Kal-Jmar is only one city on Mars (the last ancient city), where the rest of the Martians live. Many Terrestrials tried to access the city, to view the historic artifacts and glorious treasures, but each attempt only lead to infighting on Mars. Soon, the Mars Protectorate forbade Earthmen to travel on Mars, as well as perform any experiments on Kal-Jmar. \nThis city is rich with well-preserved artifacts and snippets of history that many vyed to get their hands on. This story surrounds the mysteries of this city as well as the desire and need to plunder it.\n",
        "Summary_3": "The story takes place on Mars in the future. The planet has been colonized by humans to the extent that cities such as Lillis are covered with immense domes to protect from the harsh Martian environment.\n\nThe characters in the story head to the ancient Martian domed city of Kal-Jmar. They head across the parched Martian landscape and eventually head down a gully which is filled with moisture and even a phosphorescent type of fungus. Kal-Jmar is filled with treasures but otherwise abandoned.",
        "Summary_4": "The story takes place on Mars. There are parts of Mars that have been colonized by earth men, like the city of Lillis, and parts that the current-day Martians still control. One of those areas is Kal-Jmar, an ancient city that earth men know very little about. When Tate and Rector first come across the city, they immediately notice its fantastic architecture. Although it\u2019s in a state of decay, it\u2019s obvious that the ancient city was once beautiful. \n\nThe dome at Kal-Jmar is particularly fantastic. For many years, earth men have tried to figure out how to break through its forcefield. However, the dome is impervious to bombs, and even diamonds cannot break its shell. Inside the dome are all of the relics of the ancient Martian civilization. Records, machines, books, and precious metals are all hidden away behind its walls. \n\nSeveral thousand years before the story starts, the environment on Mars changed. The ancient Martians were unable to adapt and survive, but the current-day Martians understood the changes they needed to make to survive in the new climate. The Martians survive on elements that are plentiful in the area in which they live, like fungus, sand, and lichens. \n",

When theyfinally reached a climbable spot, Syme was limping badly and Tate wasobviously exhausted.     They clambered wearily out onto the level sands again just as thesmall, blazing sun was setting. Luck, grunted Syme. Our only chanceof getting near the city is at night. He peered around, shading hiseyes from the sun's glare with a gauntleted hand. See that?     Following his pointing finger, Tate saw a faint, ephemeral arc showingabove a line of low hills in the distance. Kal-Jmar, said Syme.     Tate brightened a little. His body was too filled with fatigue for hismind to do any work on the problem that was baffling him, and so itreceded into the back of his mind.     Kal-Jmar, whispered Syme again.     There was no twilight. The sun dropped abruptly behind the low horizon,and darkness fell, sudden and absolute. Syme picked up the extra oxygentank and the suitcase, checked his direction by a wrist compass, andstarted toward the hills. Tate rose wearily to his feet and followedagain.     Two hours later, Kal-Jmar stood before them. They had wormed theirway past the sentry posts, doing most of the last two hundred meterson all fours. With skill and luck, and with Syme's fierce, burningdetermination, they had managed to escape detection\u2014and there theywere. Journey's end.     Tate stared up at the shining, starlight towers in speechlessadmiration. If the people who had built this city had been decadent,still their architecture was magnificent. The city was a rhapsody madesolid. There was a sense of decay about it, he thought, but it was thedecay of supreme beauty, caught at the very verge of dissolution andpreserved for all eternity.     Well? demanded Syme.     Tate started, shaken out of his dream. He looked down at the blacksuitcase, a little wonderingly, and then pulled it to him and opened it.     Inside, carefully wrapped in shock-absorbing tissue, was a fragilecontrivance of many tubes and wires, and a tiny parabolic mirror. Ithad a brand new Elecorp 210 volt battery, and it needed every volt ofthat tremendous power. Tate made the connections, his hands tremblingslightly, and set it up on a telescoping tripod. Syme watched himclosely, his big body tensed with expectation.     The field was before them, shimmering faintly in the starlight. Itlooked unsubstantial as the stuff of dreams, but both men knew that nopower man possessed, unless it was the thing Tate held, could penetratethat screen.     Tate set the mechanism up close to the field, aimed it very delicately,and closed a minute switch. After a long second, he opened it again.     Nothing happened.     The screen was still there, as unsubstantial and as solid as ever.There was no change.  "

        "Query": "What is the fate of Harold Tate in the tale Doorway to Kal-Jmar?",
        "Summary_1": "Harold Tate is a physicist who has developed a way to create an opening in the force field dome covering the ancient city of Kal-Jmar. Other humans have tried to enter, but none have succeeded. They have not been able to breach the force field, and efforts to do so led to bloody uprisings of current Martians, so the Mars Protectorate has forbidden any Earthmen to go there. Tate happens to be on the observation deck of the Founders\u2019 Tower when Syme Rector is trying to pull himself back over the parapet after getting pulled over it by the patrolman\u2019s body that he threw over the side. Tate invites Rector to have a drink with him, and when he is drunk, he tells Rector he trusts him because he has an honest face. Tate asks Rector to be his guide to Kal-Jmar and tells him about the device he invented. Tate sees the boulder that the Martians lob toward their sand car when they are in the gully and saves their lives by using a steering level to flip the car around and out of the main path of the boulder.\n\nWhen the Martians take the two men to their subterranean cavern and reveal that they can speak Terrestrial, Tate asks the leader many questions about the Martians. When the leader of the Martians starts to shoot him, Rector saves Tate by hitting the Martian, wrestling his gun away, and shooting the rest of the Martians while Tate cowers against the wall. When they reach Kal-Jmar, Tate uses his device to open the force field, but then Rector shoots him. As he is dying, Tate warns Rector that he will be sorry.\n",

More specifically, how to break through the impenetrable forcefield surrounding it. \nA relatively shy man, he is first introduced in the story by saving Syme\u2019s life. He pulls him up off the ledge, and then they run off and get the drink together. There, roused by culcha, he reveals his huge secret to the man he just saved. \nAfter showing him his invention, Syme agrees to guide him to Kal-Jmar. Tate had never been to Mars before, so he desperately needed someone to take him around. \nHis knowledge of the Martian race, when it comes to the scientific side, rivals that of Syme\u2019s, who\u2019d possibly run into them before. However, he is scared of the Martians and their unpredictability. \nAfter they are captured by the Martians, the leader announces their imminent death. While Syme orchestrates their escape by killing all the Martians with an energy gun, Tate stays glued to the wall. His cowardice annoys Syme, who was injured in the fight. \nIn the end, after they reach Kal-Jmar, Tate can open a door in the force field using his ingenus invention. The first time failed, but after careful consideration, he was able to succeed the second time. Once he had opened the field, Syme betrayed him and shot him in the chest with his energy gun.\n",

No one knewwhat had happened to the Martians, whether they were the ancestors ofthe present decadent Martian race, or a different species. No one knewanything about them or about Kal-Jmar.     In the early days, when the conquest of Mars was just beginning, Earthscientists had been wild to get into the city. They had observed itfrom every angle, taken photographs of its architecture and the robotsthat still patrolled its fantastically winding streets, and then theyhad tried everything they knew to pierce the wall.     Later, however, when every unsuccessful attempt had precipitated abloody uprising of the present-day Martians\u2014resulting in a rapiddwindling of the number of Martians\u2014the Mars Protectorate had steppedin and forbidden any further experiments; forbidden, in fact, anyEarthman to go near the place.     Thus matter had stood for over a hundred years, until Harold Tate.Tate, a physicist, had stumbled on a field that seemed to be identicalin properties to the Kal-Jmar dome; and what is more, he had found aforce that would break it down.     And so he had made his first trip to Mars, and within twenty-fourhours, by the blindest of chances, blurted out his secret to SymeRector, the scourge of the spaceways, the man with a thousand creditson his sleek, tigerish head.     Syme's smile was not tigerish now; it was carefully, studiedly mild.For Tate was no longer drunk, and it was important that it should notoccur to him that he had been indiscreet.     This is native territory we're coming to, Harold, he said. Betterstrap on your gun.     Why. Are they really dangerous?     They're unpredictable, Syme told him. They're built differently, andthey think differently. They breathe like us, down in their cavernswhere there's air, but they also eat sand, and get their oxygen thatway.     Yes, I've heard about that, Tate said. Iron oxide\u2014very interestingmetabolism. He got his energy pistol out of the compartment andstrapped it on absently.     Syme turned the little sand car up a gentle rise towards the tortuoushill country in the distance. Not only that, he continued. Theyeat the damndest stuff. Lichens and fungi and tumble-grass off thedeserts\u2014all full of deadly poisons, from arsenic up the line toxopite. They seem intelligent enough\u2014in their own way\u2014but they nevercome near our cities and they either can't or won't learn Terrestrial.When the first colonists came here, they had to learn      their     crazylanguage. Every word of it can mean any one of a dozen differentthings, depending on the inflection you give it. I can speak it some,but not much. Nobody can. We don't think the same.     So you think they might attack us? Tate asked again, nervously.     They      might     do anything, Syme said curtly. Don't worry about it.     The hills were much closer than they had seemed, because of Mars'deceptively low horizon. In half an hour they were in the midst of awilderness of fantastically eroded dunes and channels, laboring onsliding treads up the sides of steep hills only to slither down againon the other side.   <doc-sep> Syme looked at the man, nursing the tortured muscles of his arms. Hisrescuer was tall and thin, of indeterminate age. He had light, sandyhair, a sharp nose, and\u2014oddly conflicting\u2014pale, serious eyes and ahumorous wide mouth. He was still panting.     I'm not hurt, Syme said. He grinned, his white teeth flashing in hisdark, lean face. Thanks for giving me a hand.     You scared hell out of me, said the man. I heard a thud. Ithought\u2014you'd gone over. He looked at Syme questioningly.     That was my bag, the outlaw said quickly. It slipped out of my hand,and I overbalanced myself when I grabbed for it.     The man sighed. I need a drink.      You     need a drink. Come on. Hepicked up a small black suitcase from the floor and started for theelevator, then stopped. Oh\u2014your bag. Shouldn't we do something aboutthat?     Never mind, said Syme, taking his arm. The shock must have busted itwide open. My laundry is probably all over Lillis by now.     They got off at the amusement level, three tiers down, and found acafe around the corner. Syme wasn't worried about the man he had justkilled. He had heard no second thud, so the body must have stayed onthe first outcropping of the tower it struck. It probably wouldn't befound until morning.     And he had the wallet. When he paid for the first round of      culcha     , hetook it out and stole a glance at the identification card inside. Thereit was\u2014his ticket to freedom. He began feeling expansive, and evenfriendly toward the slender, mouse-like man across the table. It wasthe      culcha     , of course. He knew it, and didn't care. In the morninghe'd find a freighter berth\u2014in as big a spaceport as Lillis, therewere always jobs open. Meanwhile, he might as well enjoy himself, andit was safer to be seen with a companion than to be alone.     He listened lazily to what the other was saying, leaning his tall,graceful body back into the softly-cushioned seat.     Lissen, said Harold Tate. He leaned forward on one elbow, slipped,caught himself, and looked at the elbow reproachfully. Lissen, hesaid again, I trust you, Jones. You're obvi-obviously an adventurer,but you have an honest face. I can't see it very well at the moment,but I hic!\u2014pardon\u2014seem to recall it as an honest face. I'm going totell you something, because I need your help!\u2014help. He paused. Ineed a guide. D'you know this part of Mars well?     Sure, said Syme absently. Out in the center of the floor, an AGplate had been turned on. Five Venusian girls were diving and twistingin its influence, propelling themselves by the motion of theirdelicately-webbed feet and trailing long gauzy streamers of synthesilkafter them. Syme watched them through narrowed lids, feeling the glowof      culcha     inside him.     I wanta go to Kal-Jmar, said Tate.     Syme snapped to attention, every nerve tingling. An indefinable sense,a hunch that had served him well before, told him that something bigwas coming\u2014something that promised adventure and loot for Syme Rector.Why? he asked softly. Why to Kal-Jmar?     Harold Tate told him, and later, when Syme had taken him to his rooms,he showed him what was in his little black suitcase. Syme had beenright; it was big.   <doc-sep> He stood then in the middle of the room, arms akimbo, his head swimmingwith glory\u2014and remembered suddenly that he was hungry. He felt in thecontainer of his helmet, extracted a couple of food tablets, and poppedthem into his mouth.     They would take care of his needs, but they didn't satisfy his hunger.No food tablets for him after this! Steaks, wines, souffles.... Hismouth began to water at the very thought.     And then the robot rolled on soundless wheels into the room. Symewhirled and saw it only when it was almost upon him. The thing wasremarkably lifelike, and for a moment he was startled.     But it was not alive. It was only a Martian feeding-machine, kept inrepair all these millennia by other robots. It was not intelligent,and so it did not know that its masters would never return. It did notknow, either, that Syme was not a Martian, or that he wanted a steak,and not the distilled liquor of the      xopa     fungus, which still grew inthe subterranean gardens of Kal-Jmar. It was capable only of receivingthe mental impulse of hunger, and of responding to that impulse.     And so when Syme saw it and opened his mouth in startlement, therobot acted as it had done with its degenerate, slothful masters. Itsflexible feeding tube darted out and half down the man's gullet beforehe could move to avoid it. And down Syme Rector's throat poured a floodof      xopa     -juice, nectar to Martians, but swift, terrible death to humanbeings....     Outside, the last doorway to Kal-Jmar closed forever, across from thecold body of Tate.   "

        "Query": "What tools does Syme Rector rely on to stay alive in Doorway to Kal-Jmar?",
        "Summary_1": "Rector carries a pistol that, when shot, is silent. This enables him to shoot the young patrolman without drawing attention to himself or making people aware that there has been a shooting. In the sand car, Rector relies on the car\u2019s metal arm and thick wire cable to travel down into the gully. He has harpoon guns that he and Tate can use later if they need to climb back out of the gully. After Rector battles with the Martians and shoots them, he uses a tube of sealing liquid that he carries in his emergency kit to seal the tear in his suit so that he stops losing oxygen. He also uses the sealant to close the wound in his leg from the graze of one of the Benson guns the Martians fired at him. Rector and Tate use oxygen tanks and space suits in their journey to Kal-Jmar because there is not enough air for them to breathe without these items. When he is hungry, Rector takes two food tablets that he carries in his helmet.",
        "Summary_2": "Syme Rector is an outlaw, a man that relies on his wits and his tools to survive. His grand experiences and adventures have taught him several lifetime\u2019s worth of wisdom. His most trusted tool is his handy energy pistol, which he uses many times throughout the story. This gun is powerful and quick and can be found holstered on his hip. \nHe also steals a spaceman\u2019s identity card, someone named Jones, in order to not be caught on Mars. \nHe uses a sand car to travel across Mars and transport Tate to Kal-Jmar. This car is equipped with an anchor, as well as a pulley, so one can safely descend and ascend.\n",

Syme also carries a gun which he uses to shoot and kill the boy early in the story in order to steal his identification. He also uses the gun on Tate after he gains access to Kal-Jmar. Syme also uses a sand car to navigate the Martian Terrain and guide Tate to the location of Kal-Jmar.",
        "Summary_4": "\nRector would be immediately caught and punished if he were captured in the city of Lillis without identification. That\u2019s why the patrolman\u2019s identity card is so important. In order to get it, Rector has to stalk a young and innocent patrolman and murder him in broad daylight. He steals his wallet so that he can use his ID card, and he starts going by the name Jones. \n\nThe sand car is also an important item for Rector because its technology allows Rector and Tate to make their way through the sand and over the gullies of the difficult terrain on Mars. The car actually has metal arms that can go deep into the sand and lift the car up and over obstacles. Unfortunately, the car does not get the duo very far before a group of Martians attacks them and destroys the car. \n\nRector also has to steal the lead alien\u2019s gun in order to defend himself and his partner. He and Tate would perish if he did not have the courage to grab the gun out of the Martian\u2019s grasp and hit him over the head with it. He uses the weapon to murder the rest of the Martians and save Tate\u2019s life and his own.\n\nFinally, the entire mission to Kal-Jmar would be pointless without Tate\u2019s invention. As soon as Tate tells Rector about his work, Rector sees dollar signs. He wants to take advantage of Tate\u2019s knowledge and steal as many goods as possible from the impenetrable dome. As soon as Tate gets the machine to work and Rector knows he can go inside, he murders Tate so he can take everything for himself. \n",

[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Planet Stories Winter 1944.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      The tall man loitered a moment before a garish window display, his eyesimpassive in his space-burned face, as the Lillis patrolman passed.Then he turned, burying his long chin in the folds of his sand cape,and took up the pursuit of the dark figure ahead once more.     Above, the city's multicolored lights were reflected from thetranslucent Dome\u2014a distant, subtly distorted Lillis, through which thestars shone dimly.     Getting through that dome had been his first urgent problem, but now hehad another, and a more pressing one. It had been simple enough to passhimself off as an itinerant prospector and gain entrance to the city,after his ship had crashed in the Mare Cimmerium. But the rest wouldnot be so simple. He had to acquire a spaceman's identity card, and hehad to do it fast. It was only a matter of time until the TriplanetPatrol gave up the misleading trail he had made into the hill country,and concluded that he must have reached Lillis. After that, his onlysafety lay in shipping out on a freighter as soon as possible. He hadto get off Mars, because his trail was warm, and the Patrol thorough.     They knew, of course, that he was an outlaw\u2014the very fact of thecrashed, illegally-armed ship would have told them that. But theydidn't know that he was Syme Rector, the most-wanted and most-fearedraider in the System. In that was his only advantage.     He walked a little faster, as his quarry turned up a side street andthen boarded a moving ramp to an upper level. He watched until theshort, wide-shouldered figure in spaceman's harness disappeared overthe top of the ramp, and then followed.     The man was waiting for him at the mouth of the ascending tunnel.     Syme looked at him casually, without a flicker of expression, andstarted to walk on, but the other stepped into his path. He was quiteyoung, Syme saw, with a fighter's shoulders under the white leather,and a hard, determined thrust to his firm jaw.     All right, the boy said quietly. What is it?     I don't understand, Syme said.     The game, the angle. You've been following me. Do you want trouble?     Why, no, Syme told him bewilderedly. I haven't been following you.I\u2014     The boy knuckled his chin reflectively. You could be lying, he saidfinally. But maybe I've made a mistake. Then\u2014Okay, citizen, you canclear\u2014but don't let me catch you on my tail again.     Syme murmured something and turned away, feeling the spaceman's eyeson the small of his back until he turned the corner. At the nextstreet he took a ramp up, crossed over and came down on the other sidea block away. He waited until he saw the boy's broad figure pass theintersection, and then followed again more cautiously.     It was risky, but there was no other way. The signatures, the data,even the photograph on the card could be forged once Syme got his handson it, but the identity card itself\u2014that oblong of dark diamondite,glowing with the tiny fires of radioactivity\u2014that could not beimitated, and the only way to get it was to kill.     Up ahead was the Founders' Tower, the tallest building in Lillis. Theboy strode into the entrance lobby, bought a ticket for the observationplatform, and took the elevator. As soon as his car was out of sight inthe transparent tube, Syme followed. He put a half-credit slug into themachine, took the punctured slip of plastic that came out. The ticketwent into a scanning slot in the wall of the car, and the elevatorwhisked him up.   <doc-sep> Syme looked at the man, nursing the tortured muscles of his arms. Hisrescuer was tall and thin, of indeterminate age. He had light, sandyhair, a sharp nose, and\u2014oddly conflicting\u2014pale, serious eyes and ahumorous wide mouth. He was still panting.

        "Query": "What can be said about the Martians featured in Doorway to Kal-Jmar?",
        "Summary_1": "From the humans' perspective, the Martians are strange, unpredictable beings. They eat sand to get their oxygen, and lichens, fungi, and tumble-grass from the deserts, all of which contain substances like arsenic that are deadly poisons to humans. The humans believe the Martians cannot or will not learn their language, Terrestrial, and that they have their own language. In it, every word can have multiple meanings depending on the inflection used by the speaker. In truth, the Martians have been telepathic for several thousand years because the planet is practically airless. They are clever and only pretend not to understand Terrestrial, and they make up their complicated language to deceive the humans. \n\nMartians want no contact with humans because the Martians have nothing to gain from contact with them. They see the humans as imperialistic. They plan to kill Rector and Tate as part of their concept of justice. The Martians know that Kal-Jmar holds the secret that would make Mars have an Earthlike atmosphere within fifty years. The ancient Kal-Jmar Martians were the contemporaries of the current Martians' ancestors. When the atmosphere of Mars began thinning several thousand years earlier, the Kal-Jmar Martians sealed themselves in their dome where they died of plague and other causes, while the other Martians adapted to the change. \n\nThe Martians look like they have six legs but really have four legs and two arms. Their torsos bulge because they have a huge air bladder. They look a bit like dogs but have high foreheads and lips that are not split. They are covered with patches of black and white fur; with their muscles, they can control the patches so that they are primarily black or white, depending on the temperature. They can use weapons and are armed with spears and Benson guns when they confront Rector and Tate. \n\n",
        "Summary_2": "The ancient Martians, as is revealed later in the story, faced an urgent dilemma when the atmosphere surrounding Mars changed. They could either hide and make scientific changes to survive. Or they could stay where they were and adapt. One group hid in the city of Kal-Jmar, constructing an impenetrable dome around themselves. They remained the same for many years until a plague wiped out the entire population. \nThe other group was able to survive the atmospheric collapse by changing with it. Their dependence on oxygen lessened. They eat sand to get oxygen, as well as breathing it in the deep caverns below. They can eat poisonous lichens and mushrooms, fungi that would kill any other creature. \nAnd their bodies changed too. Now, they resemble dogs, with fur that changes color depending on the weather. With four legs and two arms, they are incredibly quick creatures. Their stomachs bulged out from their body, due to their evolutionary changes. The Martians are also telepathic, with no current language of their own. They are an incredibly advanced race. They developed air bladders that pumped oxygen from the stomach (sand) directly to the bloodstream. These are the native Martians, and, though energy guns were forbidden on Mars, some of them were armed with them. Others carry spears and other missiles.\n",
        "Summary_3": "The Martians have 4 legs and 2 arms. They are telepathic which aids in their communication on a planet with very little atmosphere. It is thought that they speak an immensely complex language and cannot speak to humans. This, however, is a deception on the part of the Martians who can speak to humans perfectly well. The Martians who currently live on the planet have adapted to live on the planet with no atmosphere. Their species' ancient contemporaries sealed themselves in cities like Kal-Jmar instead of adapting. ",
        "Summary_4": "The ancient Martians and a prolific species. They have thousands of machines and artifacts that they have created, and they preserved all of their equipment and accomplishments inside an impenetrable dome. Now, the current-day Martians protect the dome. The current-day Martians lived alongside the ancient Martians until the atmosphere on Mars changed rapidly and the ancients could not evolve quickly enough. \n\nThe current-day Martians are very different from earth men. Although they breathe oxygen, they also eat sand, fungi, and lichens. They do not come to cities where earth men preside, and they refuse to speak their tongue. The creatures have four legs and two arms, and they move incredibly fast. Their faces resemble dogs, except that they have large foreheads. Thick black fur covers their faces, and using their muscles sometimes turns the fur white. The Martians are also telepathic, but only Tate and Rector learn this fact. The rest of the earth men do not consider it a possibility. The species is very deceitful. They made up a fake language so that the earth men would not know their true tongue, and they pretend they cannot speak terrestrial although they truly can. \n",

Outside, the last doorway to Kal-Jmar closed forever, across from thecold body of Tate.    <doc-sep> It was a weird situation, Syme thought. His mind was racing, but as yethe could see no way out. He began to wonder, if he did, could he keepthe Martians from knowing about it? Then he realized that the Martianmust have received that thought, too, and he was enraged. He stood,holding himself in check with an effort.     Will you tell us why? Tate asked.     You were brought here for that purpose. It is part of our conceptionof justice. I will tell you and your\u2014friend\u2014anything you wish toknow.     Syme noticed that the other Martians had retired to the farther side ofthe cavern. Some were munching the glowing fungus. That left only theleader, who was standing alertly on all fours a short distance awayfrom them, holding the Benson gun trained on them. Syme tried not tothink about the gun, especially about making a grab for it. It was liketrying not to think of the word hippopotamus.     Tate squatted down comfortably on the floor of the cavern, apparentlyunconcerned, but his hands were trembling slightly. First why\u2014 hebegan.     There are many secrets in Kal-Jmar, the Martian said, among them avery simple catalyzing agent which could within fifty years transformMars to a planet with Terrestrially-thick atmosphere.     I think I see, Tate said thoughtfully. That's been the ultimate aimall along, but so far the problem has us licked. If we solved it, thenwe'd have all of Mars, not just the cities. Your people would die out.You couldn't have that, of course.     He sighed deeply. He spread his gloved hands before him and lookedat them with a queer intentness. Well\u2014how about the Martians\u2014theKal-Jmar Martians, I mean? I'd dearly love to know the answer to thatone.     Neither of the alternatives in your mind is correct. They were not aseparate species, although they were unlike us. But they were not ourancestors, either. They were the contemporaries of our ancestors.     Several thousand years ago Mars' loss of atmosphere began to makeitself felt. There were two ways out. Some chose to seal themselvesinto cities like Kal-Jmar; our ancestors chose to adapt their bodies tothe new conditions. Thus the race split. Their answer to the problemwas an evasion; they remained static. Our answer was the true one, forwe progressed. We progressed beyond the need of science; they remainedits slaves. They died of a plague\u2014and other causes.     You see, he finished gently, our deception has caused a naturalconfusion in your minds. They were the degenerates, not we.     And yet, Tate mused, you are being destroyed by contact withan\u2014inferior\u2014culture.     We hope to win yet, the Martian said.     Tate stood up, his face very white. Tell me one thing, he begged.Will our two races ever live together in amity?     The Martian lowered his head. That is for unborn generations. Helooked at Tate again and aimed the energy gun. You are a brave man,he said. I am sorry.     Syme saw all his hopes of treasure and glory go glimmering down thesights of the Martian's Benson gun, and suddenly the pent-up rage inhim exploded. Too swiftly for his intention to be telegraphed, beforehe knew himself what he meant to do, he hurled himself bodily into theMartian.   <doc-sep> Kal-Jmar was the riddle of the Solar System. It was the only remainingcity of the ancient Martian race\u2014the race that, legends said, hadrisen to greater heights than any other Solar culture. The machines,the artifacts, the records of the Martians were all there, perfectlypreserved inside the city's bubble-like dome, after God knew how manythousands of years. But they couldn't be reached.     For Kal-Jmar's dome was not the thing of steelite that protectedLillis: it was a tenuous, globular field of force that defied analysisas it defied explosives and diamond drills. The field extended bothabove and below the ground, and tunneling was of no avail. No one knewwhat had happened to the Martians, whether they were the ancestors ofthe present decadent Martian race, or a different species. No one knewanything about them or about Kal-Jmar.     In the early days, when the conquest of Mars was just beginning, Earthscientists had been wild to get into the city. They had observed itfrom every angle, taken photographs of its architecture and the robotsthat still patrolled its fantastically winding streets, and then theyhad tried everything they knew to pierce the wall.     Later, however, when every unsuccessful attempt had precipitated abloody uprising of the present-day Martians\u2014resulting in a rapiddwindling of the number of Martians\u2014the Mars Protectorate had steppedin and forbidden any further experiments; forbidden, in fact, anyEarthman to go near the place.     Thus matter had stood for over a hundred years, until Harold Tate.Tate, a physicist, had stumbled on a field that seemed to be identicalin properties to the Kal-Jmar dome; and what is more, he had found aforce that would break it down.     And so he had made his first trip to Mars, and within twenty-fourhours, by the blindest of chances, blurted out his secret to SymeRector, the scourge of the spaceways, the man with a thousand creditson his sleek, tigerish head.     Syme's smile was not tigerish now; it was carefully, studiedly mild.For Tate was no longer drunk, and it was important that it should notoccur to him that he had been indiscreet.     This is native territory we're coming to, Harold, he said. Betterstrap on your gun.     Why. Are they really dangerous?     They're unpredictable, Syme told him. They're built differently, andthey think differently. They breathe like us, down in their cavernswhere there's air, but they also eat sand, and get their oxygen thatway.     Yes, I've heard about that, Tate said. Iron oxide\u2014very interestingmetabolism. He got his energy pistol out of the compartment andstrapped it on absently.     Syme turned the little sand car up a gentle rise towards the tortuoushill country in the distance. Not only that, he continued. Theyeat the damndest stuff. Lichens and fungi and tumble-grass off thedeserts\u2014all full of deadly poisons, from arsenic up the line toxopite. They seem intelligent enough\u2014in their own way\u2014but they nevercome near our cities and they either can't or won't learn Terrestrial.When the first colonists came here, they had to learn      their     crazylanguage. Every word of it can mean any one of a dozen differentthings, depending on the inflection you give it. I can speak it some,but not much. Nobody can. We don't think the same.     So you think they might attack us? Tate asked again, nervously.     They      might     do anything, Syme said curtly. Don't worry about it.     The hills were much closer than they had seemed, because of Mars'deceptively low horizon. In half an hour they were in the midst of awilderness of fantastically eroded dunes and channels, laboring onsliding treads up the sides of steep hills only to slither down againon the other side.  "

        "Query": "Can you provide a brief summary of the storyline in RETIEF OF THE RED-TAPE MOUNTAIN?",
        "Summary_1": " The story begins with Consul Passwyn giving an assignment in a sealed envelope to Vice-Consul Retief, who is a diplomat with the Embassy. His mission is to visit the planet of Adobe and broker a land treaty between the Terrestrial settlers and an invading species, the Jaq. Before Retief leaves, Passwyn stresses the importance of following his orders exactly as written and acknowledges that no one from the Embassy has visited Adobe before, nor do they know the characteristics of the Jaq. Retief gets a ride to Adobe on a mail carrier with the help of a veteran pilot. When the pilot discovers they are entering the planet in the midst of war, he decides to leave on a lifeboat and gives control of the skiff to Retief. Then, Retief crash lands the skiff in order to avoid being blown up by a fission missile that was tracking him on his course. He lands in the middle of an Adoban oasis and immediately encounters a Terrestrial man named Potter, who confuses him for the cousin of one of his associates, Lemuel. Potter tells Retief about his group's history with the Jaqs, whom he refers to as \"Flap-jacks\" due to their wide, flat, tentacled bodies. Along with a team of settlers including Swazey, Lemuel, and Bert, Potter has been spending his days protecting his farms against attacks by the Jaqs after they mistakenly killed one three months prior, having mistaken it for one of the native species. Potter and his team do not trust the Embassy, having heard they are sending a representative to tell them to ceded control of the oases to the Jaqs. When they discover Retief is not Lemuel's cousin, Lemuel confronts Retief, who swiftly establishes his authority by knocking him out cold. When the group senses a Jaq nearby, Retief insists on dealing with the issue by himself. He hunts down the Jaq, they wrestle, and he assumes control by pressing his thumb against the Jaq\u2019s eye hole. The captive Jaq leads Retief to the Jaq headquarters, where he is introduced to their leader, Hoshick. Retief discovers the affability of the species and particularly their penchant for proper sportsmanship. He uses this knowledge to his advantage, and convinces Hoshick that it would be more sportsmanlike to abandon the war efforts and solve their differences through a simple wrestling match. Once again, he wins the match by squeezing his thumb against Hoshick\u2019s eye hole, and he convinces Hoshick to agree to cede control of the entirety of the oases to the Terrestrials and his people would be gifted all of the planets\u2019 desert areas. Upon returning to the Embassy, Retief tells Consul Passwyn the good news and then burns the envelope Passwyn had given him at the beginning of the story.",
        "Summary_2": "Consul Passwyn sends Vice-Consul Retief to Adobe to negotiate a peace deal between the native Jaqs and the human settlers who have moved there. Retief travels to Adobe on the mail ship, but as they near the planet, the pilot points out that there is fighting going on that he can see from fifty miles out; he refuses to land there to deliver Retief but offers Retief the use of the skiff. \n\nAs Retief begins heading toward the planet, he is tracked by a fission weapon. He outmaneuvers the bomb and lands on the planet where he soon encounters one of the settlers. They fight until the man realizes Retief is a human, introduces himself as Potter, and takes Retief to his camp where other men are. The men explain the history of their conflict with the Flap-jacks, saying that one of their men saw one and shot it thinking it was some sort of native game. After that, the Flap-jacks showed up at a farm and killed two cows. Since then, the two sides have been attacking each other back and forth.\n\nLemuel arrives and asks Retief who he is spying for as he pulls a weapon on him. Retief tells him to put the weapon up and then punches Lemuel quickly when he doesn\u2019t. Suddenly, they hear a noise; Retief throws a bucket of water on their fire, and they all dive for cover. Retief then announces he will go out by himself. \n\nAway from the camp, Retief sits and waits until a Flap-jack attacks him. He fights back and struggles but then manages to put his thumb in the creature\u2019s eye, which subdues it. Then he has the creature take him to its leader. In the Flap-jack\u2019s camp, Retief offers himself as a prisoner and is taken to the leader, who introduces himself as Hoshick of the Mosaic of the Two Dawns. Retief introduces himself as Retief of the Mountain of Red Tape. The two have dinner as Hoshick explains the Flap-jacks' history with the settlers. They think the settlers are sportsmen who enjoy skirmishes, so every time the setters attack them, the Flap-jacks attack back. The Flap-jacks plan to bring in more equipment and skirmishers to match the settlers. Hoshick says he personally prefers a more limited skirmish without nuclear or radiation-effect weapons. \n\nRetief suggests eliminating the weapons and explains that the settlers only use them when they think they are fighting against lower life forms. In further discussion, he learns that the Flap-jacks are worried that the settlers want to take over the deserts they need to grow the lichens they use for their food and wine. The Flap-jacks have no use for the oases. Retief brokers a deal where the Flap-jacks get all the deserts, and the settlers get all the oases.\n\nRetief briefs Passwyn when he returns to Ivory but does not reveal that he never opened the envelope containing his orders.\n",
        "Summary_3": "A Vice-Consul named Retief is sent to the planet Adobe to settle a dispute between the human settlers there and an indigenous species called the Jaq. He is given a thick envelope of instructions by his superior, Consul Passwyn, who tells him to follow them to the letter with no improvisation. Passwyn makes it clear that he thinks it will take a miracle to pull this mission off, but still tells Retief that he expects results. \n\nRetief lands on Adobe under arduous circumstances, during which his pilot bails out of the plane, he narrowly misses an atomic fission weapon, and he is immediately shot at upon landing. The shooter turns out to be Potter, a human who mistook Retief for a Jaq (or, as the human settlers refer to them, a \u201cflap-jack\u201d). He now assumes that Retief is the cousin of someone called \u201cLemuel\u201d, and brings him back to the other humans without letting Retief clarify his real identity. \n\nThe other humans are glad to see him, thinking he\u2019s a reinforcement. They tell him that they\u2019ve been engaged in back-and-forth raids with the Flap-jacks, and also that they\u2019ve heard that a bureaucrat is coming to talk them out of the dispute. Lemuel enters and reveals that Retief is not his cousin. He asks Retief who he is spying for and threatens him, at which time Retief easily subdues him in 1-2 punches, much to the awe of the other humans.\n\nRetief senses something outside and insists on looking into it alone. He hides and waits for a Jaq to attack him, and he subdues it by gouging its eye. He asks to see its leader, and is brought to the Jaq headquarters to dine and meet with Hoshick of the Mosaic of the Two Dawns. \n\nRetief and Hoshick eat and discuss how best to conduct next steps in the ongoing battle between the Jaq and the human settlers, of whom Hoshick seems to assume Retief is the leader. They discuss banning certain weapons, until Retief eventually gets Hoshick to agree to combat between the two of them. After discussing a few rules,  they commence to fight. Hoshick does well until Retief manages to gouge him until he goes limp. \n\nAfterward, Retief asks Hoshick if he would consider giving the human settlers the oases and vegetables on the planet if the humans would let the Jaq have all the desert areas. Hoshick likes the idea. \n\nRetief goes back to the human camp, gives them some wine and offers the same deal. They are equally happy to take the oases and give up the desert. \n\nWe then find Retief back with Consul Passwyn, who is shocked at the success of the mission. Passwyn, who never seems to give praise where it is actually due, says it\u2019s a good lesson about how things go when you follow instructions exactly. After Retief leaves the office, he tosses the envelope of instructions into the trash, still unopened. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Consul Passwyn meets with Vice-Consul Retief. Passwyn explains that Terrestrial settlers came to Adobe thinking it was uninhabited, but they started a war with the indigenous life form, the Flap-jacks. Passwyn hands Retief an envelope and tells him that he must handle the situation without any impromptu actions. \n\nThe mail pilot that is supposed to take Retief to Adobe refuses to do his job after he sees that there is a war going on. Retief pilots the skiff himself and crash lands on the planet. He gets out, enters a jungle-like habitat, and immediately looks for cover. A stocky man shoots at Retief, and Retief tackles him to the ground. The man, Potter, tells him that they\u2019ve been waiting for help from Ivory to come and battle the Flap-jacks. \n\nPotter takes Retief to meet with his comrades, and the men explain that the Flap-jacks have recently started using superior weaponry, and more Terrestrials have been killed. Lemuel walks up, butts in the men\u2019s conversation, points a gun at Retief, and accuses him of being a spy. Retief responds by punching Lemuel in the face and knocking him unconscious. The men hear a noise and get down on the ground. Retief tells the others that he\u2019s going to check it out by himself. \n\nRetief enters the desert of Flap-jack country. A Flap-jack attacks him, and in response he is able to wrap his arms around the alien and put his thumb into the creature\u2019s eye. The Flap-jack agrees to take Retief to his leader.\n\nAfter a short walk, Retief crawls on the ground to enter a cave. The leader, Hoshick of the Mosaic of the Two Dawns, congratulates Retief on being a worthy adversary. Hoshick uses a translating device to speak to Retief, and he offers the Terrestrial delicious food and several servings of tasty yellow wine. \n\nRetief asks Hoshick to consider getting rid of all weapons, and he suggests that this is the modern and polite way to fight. Weapons are reserved for vermin. He then goes one step further and asks Hoshick to keep the fight between the two of them. \n\nRetief and Hoshick go outside, remove their weapons, and engage in one-on-one combat. Retief remembers his trick and gouges Hoshick\u2019s eye. Retief wins, and Hoshick agrees to give the Terrestrials the sand that the Flap-jacks desperately want to harvest lichen for their wine. Retief offers to allow the Flap-jacks to keep the desert as long as the Terrestrials can have all of the oases and vegetable farming land. \n\nRetief returns to Potter, Lemuel, Swazey, and Bert. He has the men try the wine that Hoshick gifted to him and tells them about the deal he made. He hands the Treaty and the other important paperwork to Passwyn. Passwyn congratulates him on a job well done and by the book. Retief takes his original envelope of instructions and throws it in the incinerator. \n",
        "Article": "What is it you wish? he barked. I understood in my discussions withthe other ... ah ... civilian there'd be no further need for theseirritating conferences.     I've just learned you're placing more students abroad, Mr. Gulver. Howmany this time?     Two thousand.     And where will they be going?     Croanie. It's all in the application form I've handed in. Your job isto provide transportation.     Will there be any other students embarking this season?     Why ... perhaps. That's Boge's business. Gulver looked at Retief withpursed lips. As a matter of fact, we had in mind dispatching anothertwo thousand to Featherweight.     Another under-populated world\u2014and in the same cluster, I believe,Retief said. Your people must be unusually interested in that regionof space.     If that's all you wanted to know, I'll be on my way. I have matters ofimportance to see to.     After Gulver left, Retief called Miss Furkle in. I'd like to have abreak-out of all the student movements that have been planned under thepresent program, he said. And see if you can get a summary of whatMEDDLE has been shipping lately.     Miss Furkle compressed her lips. If Mr. Magnan were here, I'm surehe wouldn't dream of interfering in the work of other departments.I ... overheard your conversation with the gentleman from the CroanieLegation\u2014     The lists, Miss Furkle.     I'm not accustomed, Miss Furkle said, to intruding in mattersoutside our interest cluster.     That's worse than listening in on phone conversations, eh? But nevermind. I need the information, Miss Furkle.     Loyalty to my Chief\u2014     Loyalty to your pay-check should send you scuttling for the materialI've asked for, Retief said. I'm taking full responsibility. Nowscat.     The buzzer sounded. Retief flipped a key. MUDDLE, Retief speaking....     Arapoulous's brown face appeared on the desk screen.     How-do, Retief. Okay if I come up?     Sure, Hank. I want to talk to you.     In the office, Arapoulous took a chair. Sorry if I'm rushing you,Retief, he said. But have you got anything for me?     Retief waved at the wine bottles. What do you know about Croanie?     Croanie? Not much of a place. Mostly ocean. All right if you likefish, I guess. We import our seafood from there. Nice prawns in monsoontime. Over a foot long.     You on good terms with them?     Sure, I guess so. Course, they're pretty thick with Boge.     So?     Didn't I tell you? Boge was the bunch that tried to take us over herea dozen years back. They'd've made it too, if they hadn't had a lot ofbad luck. Their armor went in the drink, and without armor they're easygame.     Miss Furkle buzzed. I have your lists, she said shortly.     Bring them in, please.   <doc-sep>    RETIEF OF THE RED-TAPE MOUNTAIN     by KEITH LAUMER     Retief knew the importance of sealed     orders\u2014and the need to keep them that way!     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Worlds of If Science Fiction, May 1962.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      It's true, Consul Passwyn said, I requested assignment as principalofficer at a small post. But I had in mind one of those charming resortworlds, with only an occasional visa problem, or perhaps a distressedspaceman or two a year. Instead, I'm zoo-keeper to these confoundedsettlers. And not for one world, mind you, but eight! He stared glumlyat Vice-Consul Retief.     Still, Retief said, it gives an opportunity to travel\u2014     Travel! the consul barked. I hate travel. Here in this backwatersystem particularly\u2014 He paused, blinked at Retief and cleared histhroat. Not that a bit of travel isn't an excellent thing for ajunior officer. Marvelous experience.     He turned to the wall-screen and pressed a button. A system triagramappeared: eight luminous green dots arranged around a larger diskrepresenting the primary. He picked up a pointer, indicating theinnermost planet.     The situation on Adobe is nearing crisis. The confounded settlers\u2014amere handful of them\u2014have managed, as usual, to stir up trouble withan intelligent indigenous life form, the Jaq. I can't think why theybother, merely for a few oases among the endless deserts. However Ihave, at last, received authorization from Sector Headquarters totake certain action. He swung back to face Retief. I'm sending youin to handle the situation, Retief\u2014under sealed orders. He pickedup a fat buff envelope. A pity they didn't see fit to order theTerrestrial settlers out weeks ago, as I suggested. Now it is too late.I'm expected to produce a miracle\u2014a rapprochement between Terrestrialand Adoban and a division of territory. It's idiotic. However, failurewould look very bad in my record, so I shall expect results.     He passed the buff envelope across to Retief.     I understood that Adobe was uninhabited, Retief said, until theTerrestrial settlers arrived.     Apparently, that was an erroneous impression. Passwyn fixed Retiefwith a watery eye. You'll follow your instructions to the letter. In adelicate situation such as this, there must be no impulsive, impromptuelement introduced. This approach has been worked out in detail atSector. You need merely implement it. Is that entirely clear?     Has anyone at Headquarters ever visited Adobe?     Of course not. They all hate travel. If there are no other questions,you'd best be on your way. The mail run departs the dome in less thanan hour.     What's this native life form like? Retief asked, getting to his feet.     When you get back, said Passwyn, you tell me.   <doc-sep> Twenty minutes' walk into the desert brought Retief to a low rampartof thorn branches: the Flap-jacks' outer defensive line against Terryforays. It would be as good a place as any to wait for the move by theFlap-jacks. He sat down and eased the weight of his captive off hisback, but kept a firm thumb in place. If his analysis of the situationwas correct, a Flap-jack picket should be along before too long....     A penetrating beam of red light struck Retief in the face, blinked off.He got to his feet. The captive Flap-jack rippled its fringe in anagitated way. Retief tensed his thumb in the eye-socket.     Sit tight, he said. Don't try to do anything hasty.... His remarkswere falling on deaf ears\u2014or no ears at all\u2014but the thumb spoke asloudly as words.     There was a slither of sand. Another. He became aware of a ring ofpresences drawing closer.     Retief tightened his grip on the alien. He could see a dark shape now,looming up almost to his own six-three. It looked like the Flap-jackscame in all sizes.     A low rumble sounded, like a deep-throated growl. It strummed on, fadedout. Retief cocked his head, frowning.     Try it two octaves higher, he said.     Awwrrp! Sorry. Is that better? a clear voice came from the darkness.     That's fine, Retief said. I'm here to arrange a prisoner exchange.     Prisoners? But we have no prisoners.     Sure you have. Me. Is it a deal?     Ah, yes, of course. Quite equitable. What guarantees do you require?     The word of a gentleman is sufficient. Retief released the alien. Itflopped once, disappeared into the darkness.     If you'd care to accompany me to our headquarters, the voice said,we can discuss our mutual concerns in comfort.     Delighted.     Red lights blinked briefly. Retief glimpsed a gap in the thornybarrier, stepped through it. He followed dim shapes across warm sand toa low cave-like entry, faintly lit with a reddish glow.     I must apologize for the awkward design of our comfort-dome, said thevoice. Had we known we would be honored by a visit\u2014     Think nothing of it, Retief said. We diplomats are trained to crawl.     Inside, with knees bent and head ducked under the five-foot ceiling,Retief looked around at the walls of pink-toned nacre, a floor likeburgundy-colored glass spread with silken rugs and a low table ofpolished red granite that stretched down the center of the spaciousroom, set out with silver dishes and rose-crystal drinking-tubes.      III     Let me congratulate you, the voice said.     Retief turned. An immense Flap-jack, hung with crimson trappings,rippled at his side. The voice issued from a disk strapped to its back.You fight well. I think we will find in each other worthy adversaries.     Thanks. I'm sure the test would be interesting, but I'm hoping we canavoid it.     Avoid it? Retief heard a low humming coming from the speaker in thesilence. Well, let us dine, the mighty Flap-jack said at last. Wecan resolve these matters later. I am called Hoshick of the Mosaic ofthe Two Dawns.     I'm Retief. Hoshick waited expectantly, ... of the Mountain of RedTape, Retief added.     Take place, Retief, said Hoshick. I hope you won't find our rudecouches uncomfortable. Two other large Flap-jacks came into the room,communed silently with Hoshick. Pray forgive our lack of translatingdevices, he said to Retief. Permit me to introduce my colleagues....     A small Flap-jack rippled the chamber bearing on its back a silver trayladen with aromatic food. The waiter served the four diners, filled thedrinking tubes with yellow wine. It smelled good.     I trust you'll find these dishes palatable, said Hoshick. Ourmetabolisms are much alike, I believe. Retief tried the food. It had adelicious nut-like flavor. The wine was indistinguishable from Chateaud'Yquem.     It was an unexpected pleasure to encounter your party here,said Hoshick. I confess at first we took you for an indigenousearth-grubbing form, but we were soon disabused of that notion. Heraised a tube, manipulating it deftly with his fringe tentacles. Retiefreturned the salute and drank.     Of course, Hoshick continued, as soon as we realized that you weresportsmen like ourselves, we attempted to make amends by providing abit of activity for you. We've ordered out our heavier equipment and afew trained skirmishers and soon we'll be able to give you an adequateshow. Or so I hope.     Additional skirmishers? said Retief. How many, if you don't mind myasking?     For the moment, perhaps only a few hundred. There-after ... well,I'm sure we can arrange that between us. Personally I would prefer acontest of limited scope. No nuclear or radiation-effect weapons. Sucha bore, screening the spawn for deviations. Though I confess we've comeupon some remarkably useful sports. The rangerform such as you madecaptive, for example. Simple-minded, of course, but a fantasticallykeen tracker.     Oh, by all means, Retief said. No atomics. As you pointed out,spawn-sorting is a nuisance, and then too, it's wasteful of troops.     Ah, well, they are after all expendable. But we agree: no atomics.Have you tried the ground-gwack eggs? Rather a specialty of myMosaic....     Delicious, said Retief. I wonder. Have you considered eliminatingweapons altogether?  "

        "Query": "How do the Jaqs and Terrestrials interact with each other in RETIEF OF THE RED-TAPE MOUNTAIN?",
        "Summary_1": "The Jaq are a flat, wide-bodied species with tentacles and a tender orifice at the center of their bodies where a human chest would normally be. They are led by Hoshick, who has a strong interest in mining the deserts of Adobe for a special lichen used to craft their yellow wine. This wine would then be sold to planets across the universe. The Jaq make their headquarters in the desert. In the scattered oases of Adobe, the Terrestrial settlers have built farms in the rich soil of the planet's surface. The Terrestrials refer to the Jaq as \"Flap-jacks\" due to their unique physicality. One day, a Terrestrial man mistakes a Jaq for one of Adobe's native species, and he shoots and kills it. This ignites a war between the two groups. The central Terrestrials featured in the story--Potter, Lemuel, Bert, and Swazey--require assistance from their allies on Ivory because they only have three hundred men and are unsure they can defeat the Jaq. When the Embassy sends Retief to serve as an intermediary, he discovers that the two groups have similar interests--they each only want control of their separate areas. By craftily suggesting the use of weapons is no longer fashionable, Retief neutralizes the Jaq artillery and is able to convince both groups to reach a peace treaty. And, as it turns out, the Terrestrial settlements no longer have wine, so the adjacent existence of Jaq wine fields would have a mutual benefit.",
        "Summary_2": "The Jaqs and the Terrestrials fight each other throughout the story. It started when a human saw a Jaq and thought it was some type of native game and shot it. From that incident, the Jaqs concluded that the humans were sportsmen like themselves and responded by going to one of the farms and killing two cows. Since then, the two sides have been attacking back and forth, and the humans think the Jaqs are fighting against them. Hoshick explains that he actually prefers the skirmishes to be without weapons. Until Retief meets with the Jaqs and talks with Hoshick, none of the humans had interacted with the Jaqs peacefully. The humans think the Jaqs want to take over all the oases, and the Jaqs think the humans want to take over all the deserts.",
        "Summary_3": "The Jaqs and Terrestrials are at odds with each other over territorial rights on Adobe, but they clearly know nothing about each other, nor what the other group actually wants. A Terrestrial set off the disagreement by shooting at a Jaq, and the Jaqs have apparently killed several cows thinking they are humans. The Jaqs also believe that they are giving the Terrestrials what they want because they consider them fellow \u201csportsmen\u201d, while the Terrestrials are actually dwindling in number and living in fear. While they continue raiding each other without talking, they fail to understand that different parts of the planet interest them, and they need not fight at all. By the end of the story, Retief has settled the dispute and both parties have been given the lands they desire; they now all happily reside on the planet together under the new agreement. \n",
        "Summary_4": "The Terrestrials show up on Adobe thinking the land is uninhabited, but they quickly learn that the Flap-jacks are also there. One of the men shoots at an Adoban, and for three months, the Terrestrials engage in battle with the aliens. The Flap-jacks attack Swayzey\u2019s farm and kill two of his cows. The next time they showed up, Potter and Swazey shot at them. The men describe the aliens as dirty blankets. \n\nThe Flap-jacks begin using more advanced weaponry, like airships and automatic rifles. With their new technology, they are able to kill more Terrestrials. The men are very concerned about protecting their farmlands, and they believe the aliens want to take them. \n\nRetief is put in charge of mending the relationship between the Terrestrials and the Flap-jacks, so he goes to meet with their leader. He learns how to appropriately attack a Flap-jack when one of them charges at him when he enters their territory. The aliens are muscular and heavy with fringe-tentacles, and Retief is able to subdue the Flap-jack by gouging its eye with his thumb. \n\nThe Flap-jack\u2019s leader, Hoshick, is immediately cordial towards Retief. Hoshick must use a translating device to speak to him, but he is open to all kinds of suggestions from Retief. He has his waiter serve food and wine during their meeting, and he explains that once they figured out the Terrestrials were sportsmen, they wanted to up the ante and show them a good time with their advanced weaponry. In fact, Hoshick called in an additional hundred Adobans to make the fight more interesting. \n\nHoshick is quickly convinced that fighting with weapons is a lowly thing to do, and he agrees to fight Retief one-on-one. Hoshick loses the fight when Retief sticks his thumb in the alien\u2019s eye. Hoshick is willing to give the Terrestrials all of their land, but he admits that he\u2019s disappointed that he won\u2019t be able to continue farming lichens in the desert in order to make their delicious and profitable wine. \n\nRetief agrees that the Flap-jacks can keep the sand hills they need for harvesting lichens as long as the Terrestrials can have the oases and the farmlands. Essentially, the entire war was a miscommunication. Neither side wanted what the other had, but without a discussion about why each party was on Adobe, it was completely unclear to everyone that their motivations were dissimilar. \n",

You'll follow your instructions to the letter. In adelicate situation such as this, there must be no impulsive, impromptuelement introduced. This approach has been worked out in detail atSector.

If there are no other questions,you'd best be on your way. The mail run departs the dome in less thanan hour.     What's this native life form like? Retief asked, getting to his feet.     When you get back, said Passwyn, you tell me.   <doc-sep> Retief turned. A tall Groacian vibrated his mandibles in a gestureof contempt. From his bluish throat coloration, it was apparent thecreature was drunk.     To choke in your upper sac, the bartender hissed, extending his eyestoward the drunk. To keep silent, litter-mate of drones.     To swallow your own poison, dispenser of vileness, the drunkwhispered. To find a proper cage for this zoo-piece. He waveredtoward Retief. To show this one in the streets, like all freaks.     Seen a lot of freaks like me, have you? Retief asked, interestedly.     To speak intelligibly, malodorous outworlder, the drunk said. Thebarkeep whispered something, and two customers came up to the drunk,took his arms and helped him to the door.     To get a cage! the drunk shrilled. To keep the animals in their ownstinking place.     I've changed my mind, Retief said to the bartender. To be gratefulas hell, but to have to hurry off now. He followed the drunk out thedoor. The other Groaci released him, hurried back inside. Retief lookedat the weaving alien.     To begone, freak, the Groacian whispered.     To be pals, Retief said. To be kind to dumb animals.     To have you hauled away to a stockyard, ill-odored foreign livestock.     To not be angry, fragrant native, Retief said. To permit me to chumwith you.     To flee before I take a cane to you!     To have a drink together\u2014     To not endure such insolence! The Groacian advanced toward Retief.Retief backed away.     To hold hands, Retief said. To be palsy-walsy\u2014     The Groacian reached for him, missed. A passer-by stepped around him,head down, scuttled away. Retief backed into the opening to a narrowcrossway and offered further verbal familiarities to the drunken local,who followed, furious. Retief backed, rounded a corner into a narrowalley-like passage, deserted, silent ... except for the followingGroacian.     Retief stepped around him, seized his collar and yanked. The Groacianfell on his back. Retief stood over him. The downed native half-rose;Retief put a foot against his chest and pushed.     To not be going anywhere for a few minutes, Retief said. To stayright here and have a nice long talk.      II     There you are! Miss Meuhl said, eyeing Retief over her lenses. Thereare two gentlemen waiting to see you. Groacian gentlemen.     Government men, I imagine. Word travels fast. Retief pulled off hiscape. This saves me the trouble of paying another call at the ForeignMinistry.     What have you been doing? They seem very upset, I don't mind tellingyou.     I'm sure you don't. Come along. And bring an official recorder.     Two Groaci wearing heavy eye-shields and elaborate crest ornamentsindicative of rank rose as Retief entered the room. Neither offered acourteous snap of the mandibles, Retief noted. They were mad, all right.     I am Fith, of the Terrestrial Desk, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr.Consul, the taller Groacian said, in lisping Terran. May I presentShluh, of the Internal Police?     Sit down, gentlemen, Retief said. They resumed their seats. MissMeuhl hovered nervously, then sat on the edge of a comfortless chair.     Oh, it's such a pleasure\u2014 she began.     Never mind that, Retief said. These gentlemen didn't come here tosip tea today.     So true, Fith said. Frankly, I have had a most disturbing report,Mr. Consul. I shall ask Shluh to recount it. He nodded to the policechief.     One hour ago, The Groacian said, a Groacian national was broughtto hospital suffering from serious contusions. Questioning of thisindividual revealed that he had been set upon and beaten by aforeigner. A Terrestrial, to be precise. Investigation by my departmentindicates that the description of the culprit closely matches that ofthe Terrestrial Consul.     Miss Meuhl gasped audibly.     Have you ever heard, Retief said, looking steadily at Fith, of aTerrestrial cruiser, the      ISV Terrific     , which dropped from sight inthis sector nine years ago?     Really! Miss Meuhl exclaimed, rising. I wash my hands\u2014     Just keep that recorder going, Retief snapped.     I'll not be a party\u2014     You'll do as you're told, Miss Meuhl, Retief said quietly. I'mtelling you to make an official sealed record of this conversation.     Miss Meuhl sat down.     Fith puffed out his throat indignantly. You reopen an old wound,Mr. Consul. It reminds us of certain illegal treatment at Terrestrialhands\u2014     Hogwash, Retief said. That tune went over with my predecessors, butit hits a sour note with me.     All our efforts, Miss Meuhl said, to live down that terribleepisode! And you\u2014     Terrible? I understand that a Terrestrial task force stood off Groacand sent a delegation down to ask questions. They got some funnyanswers, and stayed on to dig around a little. After a week they left.Somewhat annoying to the Groaci, maybe\u2014at the most. If they wereinnocent.     IF! Miss Meuhl burst out.     If, indeed! Fith said, his weak voice trembling. I must protestyour\u2014   <doc-sep> Save the protests, Fith. You have some explaining to do. And I don'tthink your story will be good enough.     It is for you to explain! This person who was beaten\u2014     Not beaten. Just rapped a few times to loosen his memory.     Then you admit\u2014     It worked, too. He remembered lots of things, once he put his mind toit.     Fith rose; Shluh followed suit.     I shall ask for your immediate recall, Mr. Consul. Were it not foryour diplomatic immunity, I should do more\u2014     Why did the government fall, Fith? It was just after the task forcepaid its visit, and before the arrival of the first Terrestrialdiplomatic mission.     This is an internal matter! Fith cried, in his faint Groacian voice.The new regime has shown itself most amiable to you Terrestrials. Ithas outdone itself\u2014     \u2014to keep the Terrestrial consul and his staff in the dark, Retiefsaid. And the same goes for the few terrestrial businessmen you'vevisaed. This continual round of culture; no social contacts outside thediplomatic circle; no travel permits to visit out-lying districts, oryour satellite\u2014     Enough! Fith's mandibles quivered in distress. I can talk no more ofthis matter\u2014     You'll talk to me, or there'll be a task force here in five days to dothe talking, Retief said.     You can't! Miss Meuhl gasped.     Retief turned a steady look on Miss Meuhl. She closed her mouth. TheGroaci sat down.     Answer me this one, Retief said, looking at Shluh. A few yearsback\u2014about nine, I think\u2014there was a little parade held here. Somecurious looking creatures were captured. After being securely caged,they were exhibited to the gentle Groaci public. Hauled through thestreets. Very educational, no doubt. A highly cultural show.     Funny thing about these animals. They wore clothes. They seemed tocommunicate with each other. Altogether it was a very amusing exhibit.     Tell me, Shluh, what happened to those six Terrestrials after theparade was over?  "

        "Query": "In what location does the story of RETIEF OF THE RED-TAPE MOUNTAIN occur?",
        "Summary_1": "The story begins on the planet of Ivory, where Retief meets with his superior, Consul Passwyn. This seems to be the headquarters of the CDT, a kind of intergalactic governing body concerned with diplomatic efforts. The majority of the story's action takes place on the planet of Adobe. The planet is covered with vast deserts and spotted with several oases. The oases are like jungles with hot air, dense foliage, and dwarf trees along with a variety of wildlife from lizards to insects. They used to be sea-beds and therefore have rich soil for planting. The Terrestrials settlers live and built farms there. The Jaq built their headquarters in the midst of the deserts, where they prefer to stay for their rich resource of lichen used to produce wine. When Retief crash-lands on Adobe, he meets the Terrestrials in an oasis and eventually crosses over into the desert when he goes to consult with the leader of the Jaq, Hoshick. The Jaq headquarters is a comfort-dome with red lights, granite tables, fine silverware and glassware, pink walls, and a low-lying ceiling. Retief meets with Hoshick here and convinces him to engage in a skirmish. He then fights and defeats the leader outside the headquarters in the bright sand. After securing the deal, Retief returns to Ivory to report on the success of his mission.",
        "Summary_2": "The story begins and ends on a planet called Ivory. It is the location of the CDT and the Embassy where Retief works. The rest of the story takes place on a planet called Adobe, which has a native life form that the Terrestrial settlers call Flap-jacks. Adobe has deserts and oases. The human settlers have farms on the oases where they raise crops and cattle to help feed the space system. The Flap-jacks live in the desert where they can grow the lichens that they use for food and wine. The temperature during the daytime is warm, and the oases support trees, animals, insects, and the humans living there. The oases are old sea-beds and have good, deep topsoil. The Flap-jacks live in a comfort-dome that has a low ceiling about five feet high. The walls are a pink-colored nacre, and the floor looks like burgundy glass and is covered with silk rugs.",
        "Summary_3": "The majority of the story takes place on the planet Adobe, which has multiple topographical and climate features including a humid jungle, temperate oases, and rolling deserts. Retief reaches the planet via an aircrafts, and once there he visits several locations. He visits the camp of the Terrestrials, outdoors around a fire, as well as the low-to-the-ground but comparatively lavish dwellings of the Jaqs. These are surrounded by thorned branches for protection, but the inside of the Jaq headquarters is adorned with fine textures and surfaces like granite, silk, silver, and rose-crystal. Retief also spends the beginning and end of the story back at his unspecified posting with his superior, which is apparently quite rural and rugged. \n",
        "Summary_4": "The story takes place on Adobe. The Terrestrials have recently started farming there, and the Flap-jacks are also farming, but they are using the sand hills to grow lichens to make wine. The Flap-jack\u2019s side is desert, and the Terrestrial\u2019s side is more of a jungle. There are dwarf trees, song lizards, and insects, as wells as foliage and bushes. \n\nThe Terrestrials are using the land to keep their cattle, and they also value the dozens of oases. The ponds are a mile deep with excellent topsoil. \n\nIn the desert portion of the land, the leader of the Flap-jacks holds court in a cave surrounded by thorn branches. The cave\u2019s ceiling is not very tall, and it is decorated with silk rugs, polished red granite, silver dishes, and rose-crystal drinking glasses. \n\nAdobe is a place that both Flap-jacks and Terrestrials can use to their advantage, and they have nothing to fight over because the resources they desire to not overlap at all.\n",

When you get back, said Passwyn, you tell me.   <doc-sep> A scratchy sound issued from the disk. Pardon my laughter, Hoshicksaid, but surely you jest?     As a matter of fact, said Retief, we ourselves seldom use weapons.     I seem to recall that our first contact of skirmishforms involved theuse of a weapon by one of your units.     My apologies, said Retief. The\u2014ah\u2014the skirmishform failed torecognize that he was dealing with a sportsman.     Still, now that we have commenced so merrily with weapons.... Hoshicksignaled and the servant refilled tubes.     There is an aspect I haven't yet mentioned, Retief went on. I hopeyou won't take this personally, but the fact is, our skirmishformsthink of weapons as something one employs only in dealing with certainspecific life-forms.     Oh? Curious. What forms are those?     Vermin. Or 'varmints' as some call them. Deadly antagonists, butlacking in caste. I don't want our skirmishforms thinking of suchworthy adversaries as yourself as varmints.     Dear me! I hadn't realized, of course. Most considerate of you topoint it out. Hoshick clucked in dismay. I see that skirmishforms aremuch the same among you as with us: lacking in perception. He laughedscratchily. Imagine considering us as\u2014what was the word?\u2014varmints.     Which brings us to the crux of the matter. You see, we're up againsta serious problem with regard to skirmishforms. A low birth rate.Therefore we've reluctantly taken to substitutes for the mass actionsso dear to the heart of the sportsman. We've attempted to put an end tothese contests altogether....     Hoshick coughed explosively, sending a spray of wine into the air.What are you saying? he gasped. Are you proposing that Hoshick ofthe Mosaic of the Two Dawns abandon honor....?     Sir! said Retief sternly. You forget yourself. I, Retief of the RedTape Mountain, make an alternate proposal more in keeping with thenewest sporting principles.     New? cried Hoshick. My dear Retief, what a pleasant surprise! I'menthralled with novel modes. One gets so out of touch. Do elaborate.     It's quite simple, really. Each side selects a representative and thetwo individuals settle the issue between them.     I ... um ... fear I don't understand. What possible significance couldone attach to the activities of a couple of random skirmishforms?     I haven't made myself clear, said Retief. He took a sip of wine. Wedon't involve the skirmishforms at all. That's quite passe.     You don't mean...?     That's right. You and me.   <doc-sep> The girls set up a shout and threw stones down at the centaurs, whoreared, pawed the air, and galloped to a safe distance, from which theyhurled back insults in a strange tongue. Their voices sounded faintlylike the neighing of horses.     Amazons and centaurs, he thought again. He couldn't get the problemof the girls' phenomenal strength out of his mind. Then it occurredto him that the asteroid, most likely, was smaller even than Earth'smoon. He must weigh about a thirtieth of what he usually did, due tothe lessened gravity. It also occurred to him that they would be thirtytimes as strong. He was staggered. He wished he had a smoke.     At length, the amazons and the centaurs tired of bandying insultsback and forth. The centaurs galloped off into the prairie, the girlsresumed their march. Jonathan scrambled up hills, skidded down slopes.The brunette was beside him helping him over the rough spots.     I'm Olga, she confided. Has anybody ever told you what a handsomefellow you are? She pinched his cheek. Jonathan blushed.     They climbed a ridge, paused at the crest. Below them, he saw a deepvalley. A stream tumbled through the center of it. There were treesalong its banks, the first he had seen on the asteroid. At the head ofthe valley, he made out the massive pile of a space liner.     They started down a winding path. The space liner disappeared behinda promontory of the mountain. Jonathan steeled himself for the comingordeal. He would have sat down and refused to budge except that he knewthe girls would hoist him on their shoulders and bear him into the camplike a bag of meal.     The trail debouched into the valley. Just ahead the space linerreappeared. He imagined that it had crashed into the mountain, skiddedand rolled down its side until it lodged beside the stream. It remindedhim of a wounded dinosaur. Three girls were bathing in the stream. Helooked away hastily.     Someone hailed them from the space ship.     We've caught a man, shrieked one of his captors.     A flock of girls streamed out of the wrecked space ship.     A man! screamed a husky blonde. She was wearing a grass skirt. Shehad green eyes. We're rescued!     No. No, Ann Clotilde hastened to explain. He was wrecked like us.     Oh, came a disappointed chorus.     He's a man, said the green-eyed blonde. That's the next best thing.     Oh, Olga, said a strapping brunette. Who'd ever thought a man couldlook so good?     I did, said Olga. She chucked Jonathan under the chin. He shiveredlike an unbroken colt when the bit first goes in its mouth. He feltlike a mouse hemmed in by a ring of cats.     A big rawboned brute of a girl strolled into the circle. She said,Dinner's ready. Her voice was loud, strident. It reminded him ofthe voices of girls in the honky tonks on Venus. She looked at himappraisingly as if he were a horse she was about to bid on. Bring himinto the ship, she said. The man must be starved.     He was propelled jubilantly into the palatial dining salon of thewrecked liner. A long polished meturilium table occupied the center ofthe floor. Automatic weight distributing chairs stood around it. Hisfeet sank into a green fiberon carpet. He had stepped back into theThirty-fourth Century from the fabulous barbarian past.     With a sigh of relief, he started to sit down. A lithe red-head sprangforward and held his chair. They all waited politely for him to beseated before they took their places. He felt silly. He felt likea captive princess. All the confidence engendered by the familiarsettings of the space ship went out of him like wind. He, JonathanFawkes, was a castaway on an asteroid inhabited by twenty-seven wildwomen.  "

        "Query": "\"What role does wine play in the plot of RETIEF OF THE RED-TAPE MOUNTAIN?\"",
        "Summary_1": "Wine is the essential reason the Jaq came to Adobe in the first place. Their leader, Hoshick, envisioned sourcing its vast deserts for lichen. This lichen would then be used to produce a yellow wine that could be sold to planets all around the universe. When Retief first meets Hoshick, the Jaq leader provides him with a rose-crystal drinking-tube, from which they are able to sample this wine. Retief notes that the wine tastes delicious and smells good and reminds him of Chateau d'Yquem. This detail reveals the Jaq's interest in the finer things in life, in appearing distinguished. This interest is reflected in all of the Jaq's interactions with Retief, including his ability to be coerced into hand-to-hand combat because he deems it a more modern, sportsmanlike way of resolving issues. Wine again becomes important after Retief wins the fight and gets Hoshick to agree to the terms of his proposed land treaty with the Terrestrials. After Hoshick agrees, Retief attempts to convince the Terrestrials to agree as well. After learning of the lack of wine within their settlements, Retief lets the Terrestrials sample the wine provided to him by the Jaq. Eventually, the Terrestrials agree to the arrangement as well. Therefore, the wine is also a symbol of the newfound peace between the two previously warring groups.",
        "Summary_2": "The Jaqs make their own wine out of the lichens that they grow in the desert. The lichens will only grow in the desert, so the desert is extremely important to them. Their wine is of very high quality; in fact, Retief compares it to the wine from Chateau d\u2019Yquem. The wine helps Retief arrange the deal to divide the land between the settlers and Jaqs in a way that is favorable to both sides. The human settlers have not been able to produce wine; they believe that the bacteria required to make it won\u2019t grow on Yaq, so they have only been drinking stump water. Retief lets them try the Jaqs' wine, and they like it. This, along with the offer to give all of the deserts to the Jaqs and keep all of the oases for the humans, helps Retief work out the peace deal for the Jaqs and the settlers. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Wine is significant in the story because it symbolizes how little the Jaqs and the Terrestrials know about one another, and how they can live harmoniously. The Terrestrials believe that Adobe is lethal to the process of making alcohol and that wine can\u2019t be made. The Jaqs enjoy a sweet yellow wine made from lichens that they get from the desert. Retief settles the dispute with the Jaqs over wine, and then brings some with him to settle it with the Terrestrials, and both parties agree. The wine is a symbol of how their differing aims can complement each other and they can produce and trade different crops to benefit everyone. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Wine is an important part of the story because the Flap-jacks have only come to Adobe to make their wine. The leader of the Flap-jacks, Hoshick, explains that he brought his people to the planet to build his own Mosaic and till the sands to grow paradise-lichen. He hoped to make delicious and expensive wine with the crop and sell it all over the universe. \n\nRetief tries the wine during his conversation with Hoshick, and he compares the beverage to Chateau d'Yquem. When he takes some back to his men, they also find the wine to be wonderful. \n\nIf the Terrestrials had known in the beginning that the Flap-jacks were interested in harvesting the lichens in the sand, they never would have tried to engage in battle with them.\n",

You'll follow your instructions to the letter. In adelicate situation such as this, there must be no impulsive, impromptuelement introduced. This approach has been worked out in detail atSector. You need merely implement it. Is that entirely clear?     Has anyone at Headquarters ever visited Adobe?     Of course not. They all hate travel. If there are no other questions,you'd best be on your way. The mail run departs the dome in less thanan hour.     What's this native life form like? Retief asked, getting to his feet.     When you get back, said Passwyn, you tell me.   <doc-sep> Retief put aside his cigar, pulled the wires loose, nudged the cork,caught it as it popped up.     Bad luck if you miss the cork, Arapoulous said, nodding. Youprobably never heard about the trouble we had on Lovenbroy a few yearsback?     Can't say that I did, Hank. Retief poured the black wine into twofresh glasses. Here's to the harvest.     We've got plenty of minerals on Lovenbroy, Arapoulous said,swallowing wine. But we don't plan to wreck the landscape mining 'em.We like to farm. About ten years back some neighbors of ours landed aforce. They figured they knew better what to do with our minerals thanwe did. Wanted to strip-mine, smelt ore. We convinced 'em otherwise.But it took a year, and we lost a lot of men.     That's too bad, Retief said. I'd say this one tastes more like roastbeef and popcorn over a Riesling base.     It put us in a bad spot, Arapoulous went on. We had to borrowmoney from a world called Croanie. Mortgaged our crops. Had to startexporting art work too. Plenty of buyers, but it's not the same whenyou're doing it for strangers.     Say, this business of alternating drinks is the real McCoy, Retiefsaid. What's the problem? Croanie about to foreclose?     Well, the loan's due. The wine crop would put us in the clear. Butwe need harvest hands. Picking Bacchus grapes isn't a job you canturn over to machinery\u2014and anyway we wouldn't if we could. Vintageseason is the high point of living on Lovenbroy. Everybody joins in.First, there's the picking in the fields. Miles and miles of vineyardscovering the mountain sides, and crowding the river banks, with gardenshere and there. Big vines, eight feet high, loaded with fruit, and deepgrass growing between. The wine-carriers keep on the run, bringing wineto the pickers. There's prizes for the biggest day's output, bets onwho can fill the most baskets in an hour.... The sun's high and bright,and it's just cool enough to give you plenty of energy. Come nightfall,the tables are set up in the garden plots, and the feast is laid on:roast turkeys, beef, hams, all kinds of fowl. Big salads. Plenty offruit. Fresh-baked bread ... and wine, plenty of wine. The cooking'sdone by a different crew each night in each garden, and there's prizesfor the best crews.     Then the wine-making. We still tramp out the vintage. That's mostlyfor the young folks but anybody's welcome. That's when things start toget loosened up. Matter of fact, pretty near half our young-uns areborn after a vintage. All bets are off then. It keeps a fellow on histoes though. Ever tried to hold onto a gal wearing nothing but a layerof grape juice?   <doc-sep> A scratchy sound issued from the disk. Pardon my laughter, Hoshicksaid, but surely you jest?     As a matter of fact, said Retief, we ourselves seldom use weapons.     I seem to recall that our first contact of skirmishforms involved theuse of a weapon by one of your units.     My apologies, said Retief. The\u2014ah\u2014the skirmishform failed torecognize that he was dealing with a sportsman.     Still, now that we have commenced so merrily with weapons.... Hoshicksignaled and the servant refilled tubes.     There is an aspect I haven't yet mentioned, Retief went on. I hopeyou won't take this personally, but the fact is, our skirmishformsthink of weapons as something one employs only in dealing with certainspecific life-forms.     Oh? Curious. What forms are those?     Vermin. Or 'varmints' as some call them. Deadly antagonists, butlacking in caste. I don't want our skirmishforms thinking of suchworthy adversaries as yourself as varmints.     Dear me! I hadn't realized, of course. Most considerate of you topoint it out. Hoshick clucked in dismay. I see that skirmishforms aremuch the same among you as with us: lacking in perception. He laughedscratchily. Imagine considering us as\u2014what was the word?\u2014varmints.     Which brings us to the crux of the matter. You see, we're up againsta serious problem with regard to skirmishforms. A low birth rate.Therefore we've reluctantly taken to substitutes for the mass actionsso dear to the heart of the sportsman. We've attempted to put an end tothese contests altogether....     Hoshick coughed explosively, sending a spray of wine into the air.What are you saying? he gasped. Are you proposing that Hoshick ofthe Mosaic of the Two Dawns abandon honor....?     Sir! said Retief sternly. You forget yourself. I, Retief of the RedTape Mountain, make an alternate proposal more in keeping with thenewest sporting principles.     New? cried Hoshick. My dear Retief, what a pleasant surprise! I'menthralled with novel modes. One gets so out of touch. Do elaborate.     It's quite simple, really. Each side selects a representative and thetwo individuals settle the issue between them.     I ... um ... fear I don't understand. What possible significance couldone attach to the activities of a couple of random skirmishforms?     I haven't made myself clear, said Retief. He took a sip of wine. Wedon't involve the skirmishforms at all. That's quite passe.     You don't mean...?     That's right. You and me.  "

        "Query": "What role does the fission weapon play in RETIEF OF THE RED-TAPE MOUNTAIN?",
        "Summary_1": "After Retief takes command of the mail skiff, he narrowly misses colliding with a warhead that tracks his trajectory. Thanks to a swift maneuver, Retief is able to dodge its impact and crash-lands on Adobe. However, due to the red blip on his radar screen, Retief is now aware that one of the warring groups on the planet is using illegal fission weapons in battle. Initially, he believes the Terrestrials were responsible for this, but after meeting Potter, he realizes his mistake. Potter informs him the Terrestrials do not have weapons of that kind, so it has to be Jaq weaponry. This information becomes important later when Retief meets Hoshick for the first time. As the leader of the Jaq, Hoshick informs Retief that the skirmishes were a result of a desire to engage in more sportsmanlike conduct on the battlefield. Retief realizes he can use this desire to his advantage and pushes Hoshick to question whether or not weapons are required at all in resolving conflict. He pushes this idea further by suggesting his own kind would never solve problems with weapons, despite one of the Jaqs having been previously shot down by them. Retief excuses this by again playing into Hoshick's desire to appear more dignified and saying the shooting was a failure to recognize the Jaq as sportsmen. This tactic works, and he is able to use it to convince Hoshick to engage in hand-to-hand combat, which eventually leads to the resolution of the war.",
        "Summary_2": "The fission weapon is an indication of the intelligence and resources of the Jaqs, although at first, Retief doesn\u2019t know whose weapon it is. The fission weapon tracks the object it seeks and follows it. Retief is only able to avoid colliding with it by flying straight toward it at the last minute and passing it before it explodes. The leader of the Jaqs, Hoshick, says that he would prefer a contest without nuclear or radiation-effect weapons because it is such a bore having to screen the spawn for deviations afterward. Retief readily agrees that the humans will not use atomic weapons either for the same reason and because it wastes troops. This agreement is the first concession by the Jaqs and the humans about the fighting and is followed by other concessions that are advantageous to both sides.",
        "Summary_3": "The fission weapon is significant in the story for a few reasons. It nearly takes down the aircraft that Retief is flying to Adobe. He later finds out that the Jaqs have been using them in order to give the Terrestrials a good show of strength, and that their nuclear/radiation effect has spawned more creatures, such as the one that Retief briefly takes captive. The Terrestrials tell Retief that they don\u2019t have access to such weapons and that the Jaqs have been leveling up their weaponry; unbeknownst to them, the Jaqs have done so to try to compete with them. \n",
        "Summary_4": "The fission weapon is important because it almost kills Retief.\n\nRetief encounters the fission weapon when he is piloting the skiff alone towards Adobe. His original pilot refuses to transport him to the planet because he can see that there are missiles and other weapons in use. The pilot does not want to get killed, and he insists that Retief can die if that\u2019s what he wants to do.\n\nWhile Retief is flying towards Adobe, he sees a red blip show up on the screen of the skiff. Retief feels nervous and panicky because the red dot means that someone has deployed a warhead that emits heavy radiation, also known as a fission weapon. The fission weapon has been outlawed. He hopes that his skiff has not been spotted, and he changes course to avoid the warhead. When the missile comes within five miles of his vehicle, Retief decides to accelerate as fast as possible. He just makes it past the missile, and it explodes mid-air. The fission weapon makes Retief crash land on the planet. His skiff fills with smoke and his screen breaks. \n",

He turned to the wall-screen and pressed a button. A system triagramappeared: eight luminous green dots arranged around a larger diskrepresenting the primary. He picked up a pointer, indicating theinnermost planet.     The situation on Adobe is nearing crisis. The confounded settlers\u2014amere handful of them\u2014have managed, as usual, to stir up trouble withan intelligent indigenous life form, the Jaq. I can't think why theybother, merely for a few oases among the endless deserts. However Ihave, at last, received authorization from Sector Headquarters totake certain action. He swung back to face Retief. I'm sending youin to handle the situation, Retief\u2014under sealed orders. He pickedup a fat buff envelope. A pity they didn't see fit to order theTerrestrial settlers out weeks ago, as I suggested. Now it is too late.I'm expected to produce a miracle\u2014a rapprochement between Terrestrialand Adoban and a division of territory. It's idiotic.

When you get back, said Passwyn, you tell me.   <doc-sep> The mail pilot, a leathery veteran with quarter-inch whiskers, spattoward a stained corner of the compartment, leaned close to the screen.     They's shootin' goin' on down there, he said. See them white puffsover the edge of the desert?     I'm supposed to be preventing the war, said Retief. It looks likeI'm a little late.     The pilot's head snapped around. War? he yelped. Nobody told me theywas a war goin' on on 'Dobe. If that's what that is, I'm gettin' out ofhere.     Hold on, said Retief. I've got to get down. They won't shoot at you.     They shore won't, sonny. I ain't givin' 'em the chance. He startedpunching keys on the console. Retief reached out, caught his wrist.     Maybe you didn't hear me. I said I've got to get down.     The pilot plunged against the restraint, swung a punch that Retiefblocked casually. Are you nuts? the pilot screeched. They's plentyshootin' goin' on fer me to see it fifty miles out.     The mail must go through, you know.     Okay! You're so dead set on gettin' killed, you take the skiff. I'lltell 'em to pick up the remains next trip.     You're a pal. I'll take your offer.     The pilot jumped to the lifeboat hatch and cycled it open. Get in.We're closin' fast. Them birds might take it into their heads to lobone this way....     Retief crawled into the narrow cockpit of the skiff, glanced over thecontrols. The pilot ducked out of sight, came back, handed Retief aheavy old-fashioned power pistol. Long as you're goin' in, might aswell take this.     Thanks. Retief shoved the pistol in his belt. I hope you're wrong.     I'll see they pick you up when the shootin's over\u2014one way or another.     The hatch clanked shut. A moment later there was a jar as the skiffdropped away, followed by heavy buffeting in the backwash from thedeparting mail boat. Retief watched the tiny screen, hands on themanual controls. He was dropping rapidly: forty miles, thirty-nine....     A crimson blip showed on the screen, moving out.     Retief felt sweat pop out on his forehead. The red blip meant heavyradiation from a warhead. Somebody was playing around with an outlawedbut by no means unheard of fission weapon. But maybe it was just on ahigh trajectory and had no connection with the skiff....     Retief altered course to the south. The blip followed.     He checked instrument readings, gripped the controls, watching. Thiswas going to be tricky. The missile bored closer. At five miles Retiefthrew the light skiff into maximum acceleration, straight toward theoncoming bomb. Crushed back in the padded seat, he watched the screen,correcting course minutely. The proximity fuse should be set for nomore than 1000 yards.     At a combined speed of two miles per second, the skiff flashed pastthe missile, and Retief was slammed violently against the restrainingharness in the concussion of the explosion ... a mile astern, andharmless.     Then the planetary surface was rushing up with frightening speed.Retief shook his head, kicked in the emergency retro-drive. Pointsof light arced up from the planet face below. If they were ordinarychemical warheads the skiff's meteor screens should handle them. Thescreen flashed brilliant white, then went dark. The skiff flipped onits back. Smoke filled the tiny compartment. There was a series ofshocks, a final bone-shaking concussion, then stillness, broken by theping of hot metal contracting.   <doc-sep> A scratchy sound issued from the disk.

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in MIGHTIEST QORN?",
        "Summary_1": "Ambassador Nitworth, the local head of the government for the Terrestrials, has received an ultimatum from a species called the Qornt. The Qornt want to take over the planet that the Terrestrials currently occupy. This is surprising because the whereabouts of the Qornt have been unknown for the past two centuries. The Ambassador orders Second Secretary Magnan to travel to Roolit I, the planet where the Qornt are now, to investigate the situation in person. Retief is sent to go with Magnan, with orders from the Ambassador to avoid Magnan from doing anything impulsive. When they arrive, Retief wants to investigate the situation on the surface, whereas Magnan would have been happy to take one look and return to his office. As Retief is insisting on taking a look, the two men are spotted by two eight-foot-tall creatures and a skirmish starts. After Retief pulls Magnan from the fight, and some bickering takes place, the men learn that these two creatures are Verpp, not Qornt. They ask if they know about the Ultimatum sent to the Ambassador\u2014the men call the outer planet Smorbrod, but those on Roolit I call it Guzzum. Zubb and Slun (the Verpp) say that they aren\u2019t caught up on political matters, so they don\u2019t have anything to say about the upcoming invasion, but they do give the men information about where they are. Tarroon is the town they are closest to, where there are 15-20 Qornt, and Zubb and Slun say that the Qornt would mostly ignore Terrestrials, which makes Retief think they should walk right in. Magnan is afraid of a trap, but they head into the underground Qornt village. Once they make it to Qornt Hall, the group walks through a tunnel into a huge room with high ceilings, where the walls are plastered with weapons and other spoils of battle. It was a trap: the Verpp walk the men into the dining hall where the Qornt are having a feast, hoping that the Qornt would be mad at the men for interfering with the Verpp. It turns out the Qornt are even larger than the Verpp (twelve feet tall), and Qorn (the lead Qornt) is insistent that there will be no peace, because he is hungry for battle, so he ties up the men. Retief threatens them saying the Terrestrials intended to use Roolit I to test a bomb, and breaks out of his chains in the chaos\u2014the differences in gravity between the planets means that the men are very strong, even if they are much smaller than the Verpp and Qornt. Retief ties up Qorn and declares himself the new leader. The Qornt explain that Verpp molt into Qornt after a few other stages of metamorphosis, and that the Qornt are very driven by a need for battle. Upon return to the outer planet, we learn that Retief has supposedly recruited the Qornt for the Peace Enforcement Corps, and sends them out to battle, circumventing Nitworth\u2019s authority. \n",
        "Summary_2": "\tAmbassador Nitworth of the Terrestrials receives an undetectable message from the Qornt. This communication states that they will soon invade the CDT and pillage the surrounding area in 30 days time. The Qornt are known for their warlike tendencies and battle-hardy population, but they disappeared without a trace around 200 years ago. Despite their sudden reappearance on Terrestrial territory, the Terrestrials caught no sight of them on their Navigational Monitor Service. \n\tThe Ambassador and his military decide to evacuate their land, an incredible feat thanks to their 15 million Terrestrials. They give themselves one day to plan their move, before announcing it to the general population. \n\tMagnan, one of the Ambassador's men, is ordered to explore Roolit and find the Qorn. Magnan, though hesitant, is forced to accept and take Retief with him. As they explore, they come across two Verpp, Zubb and Slun. After a quick battle, Magnan and Retief win and speak to the Verpp as their captives. Their race is a peaceful one, focused on exploring nature and other species. \n\tZubb and Slun escort them to the Qornt den, where they are feasting. Slun leaves them outside of Qornt Hall, located in Tarroon.  Zubb guides them into the grand chamber, where the Qornt are in the midst of their weeks-long feast. The bejeweled hall features Qornt of different sizes and statuses. Qorn, the chief, is seated above them all in a headdress and plumage. Zubb explains that each Qornt has their own fully-automated dreadnought, AKA warship. \n\tAfter hearing about their weaponry and seeing the Qornt in all their beastly glory, Magnan decides to retreat. Zubb, however, betrays them and pulls out two guns. He announces their arrival after forcing the Terrestrials in. Qorn belches in response. The Qornt chain the two Terrestrials. \n\tThe chief boasts about what the Qornt will do to the Terrestrials and squanders Magnan\u2019s hopes for surrender or peace. However, the other Qornt are not in agreement. They seem fairly nonchalant about the matter. They understand that this is their duty as Qornt, but they also would rather feast and boast than fight. \n\tRetief claims that the Terrestrials will use Tarroon as a target for their new hell bomb. He delivers his own ultimatum to the Qornt, breaking the chains around his wrists. Taroon\u2019s gravity and atmosphere lighten the weight, hence Retief\u2019s ability to break the chains. Retief challenges Qorn to a battle, despite Qorn\u2019s greater size and stature. \n\tRetief wins, ties Qorn up, and names himself their new leader. The Qornt still plan on invading the Terrestrials, however, and Retief must find a solution. It\u2019s revealed that the Verpp transforms into the Qornt like a caterpillar becomes a butterfly. They reach a solution, however. The Qornt become the new task force for the Peace Enforcement Corps. The Verpp establish their own Consul in the city. Ambassador Nitworth is pleased with this turn of events, and the Qornt are sent on a mission right away.",
        "Summary_3": "A diplomatic corps of humans (Terrestrials) receives an ultimatum from the Qornt warlike alien race telling them to evacuate a planet or be destroyed. The alien race appeared suddenly and undetected by the humans. Two men, Mangan and Retief, are dispatched to the alien planet to investigate while an evacuation plan can be developed.\n\nMangan and Retief come upon two aliens who they mistake for Qornt but are actually Verpp. They are able to capture them and they lead the men to the Qornt community. Once their their captives turn on them and capture the men, binding them in chains.\n\nThe Qornt leader is uninterested in diplomatic discussions and is intent on invading the human planet. At this point Retief breaks his bonds which are only weak aluminum and defeats the Qornt leader in physical combat. Retief convinces the remaining Qornt to abandon the invasion plan and elect himself as their leader.\n\nWhen the human ambassador returns to discuss the evacuation, Mangan and Retief inform him that the Qornt have remarkably been folded into the Terrestrial Peace Corps and have been sent out on mission. Retief and Mangan will now be in charge of recruitment of Alien races into the human community.",
        "Summary_4": "Ambassador Nitworth appears in front of his staff to announce that the Qornt, a race that disappeared 200 years ago, has suddenly reappeared and is making demands. One of the most alarming facts about this assault is that the Qornt were able to appear on the planet without detection by any of the equipment the earth men use. \n\nWhen Magnan tries to sneak out of the meeting without an assignment, Nitworth sends him and Ratief to check out the Qornt in person. Within moments of their arrival at the site, a Qornt steps out of the bushes. Magnan immediately tries to escape, but another alien appears and the two Qornts stop him from running away. He is able to defend himself and knocks them both to the ground. \n\nThe aliens agree to take Magnan and Ratief to Qornt Hall to speak with Qorn, the leader. Once they reach the hall, the Qornt escorts pull out a couple of weapons and point them at Magnan. They want to tell Qorn that the two men have assaulted them and tried to kidnap them. Inside the meeting place, the wild-looking leader tells Ratief and Magnan that he has zero intention of negotiating a peace deal between the Qornts and the humans. Instead, he wants adventure and action. \n\nIt becomes clear that Qorn is forcing his men to go to war although some of them are not interested in the battle. Qorn argues that he is the ultimate leader, and it makes no difference if his subordinates agree with his decisions or not. \n\nRatief and Magnan were sent to the Qornts to negotiate the earth men's surrender, but Ratief completely changes the plan. He tells the leader that they want to deliver an ultimatum of their own. They will bomb the planet in a few days\u2019 time, regardless of whether the Qornts have left it or not. \n\nQorn insists that his troops are ready for war, but one of his subordinates cuts in to tell him that many of the other Qornts would prefer to feast and enjoy themselves without going to battle for no good reason. Ratief challenges Qorn to a fight, and he eventually gets the alien in a stranglehold. After Ratief wins, he claims himself leader of the Qornts. \n\nSeveral of the Qornts declare that they must go to war regardless of who their leader is. They were made for fighting even though they didn\u2019t like their past leader\u2019s decision to attack the earthmen. Magnan suggests that the group goes elsewhere to invade, and Ratief agrees.  \n\nAmbassador Nitworth shows up to save Ratief and Magnan, completely unaware that they have taken over the Qornts. The men explain to their boss that they have established the Foreign Brigade, and the Qornts will now work for them. They have been sent off on a far away mission. Ratief and Magnan also tell Nitworth that the Qornts never left the planet. They were hibernating underground for 200 years.\n",

Gentlemen, are any of you familiar with a race known as the Qornt?     There was a moment of profound silence. Nitworth leaned forward,looking solemn.     They were a warlike race known in this sector back in Concordiattimes, perhaps two hundred years ago. They vanished as suddenly asthey had appeared. There was no record of where they went.

Indeed, Mr. Magnan? Nitworth smiled icily. It appears the Qornt donot share that opinion. He plucked a heavy parchment from a folderbefore him, harrumphed and read aloud:     His Supreme Excellency The Qorn, Regent of Qornt, Over-Lord of theGalactic Destiny, Greets the Terrestrials and, with reference to thepresence in mandated territory of Terrestrial squatters, has the honorto advise that he will require the use of his outer world on thethirtieth day. Then will the Qornt come with steel and fire. Receive,Terrestrials, renewed assurances of my awareness of your existence,and let Those who dare gird for the contest.     Frankly, I wouldn't call it conciliatory, Magnan said.     Nitworth tapped the paper with a finger.     We have been served, gentlemen, with nothing less than an Ultimatum!     Well, we'll soon straighten these fellows out\u2014 the Military Attachebegan.     There happens to be more to this piece of truculence than appears onthe surface, the Ambassador cut in. He paused, waiting for interestedfrowns to settle into place.     Note, gentlemen, that these invaders have appeared on terrestrialcontrolled soil\u2014and without so much as a flicker from the instrumentsof the Navigational Monitor Service!     The Military Attache blinked. That's absurd, he said flatly. Nitworthslapped the table.     We're up against something new, gentlemen! I've considered everyhypothesis from cloaks of invisibility to time travel! The fact is\u2014theQornt fleets are indetectible!   <doc-sep> Magnan hovered at Retief's side. Twelve feet tall, he moaned. Anddid you notice the size of those hands?     Retief watched as Qorn's aides helped him out of his formal trappings.I wouldn't worry too much, Mr. Magnan. This is a light-Gee world. Idoubt if old Qorn would weigh up at more than two-fifty standard poundshere.     But that phenomenal reach\u2014     I'll peck away at him at knee level. When he bends over to swat me,I'll get a crack at him.     Across the cleared floor, Qorn shook off his helpers with a snort.     Enough! Let me at the upstart!     Retief moved out to meet him, watching the upraised backward-jointedarms. Qorn stalked forward, long lean legs bent, long horny feetclacking against the polished floor. The other aliens\u2014both servitorsand bejeweled Qornt\u2014formed a wide circle, all eyes unwaveringly on thecombatants.     Qorn struck suddenly, a long arm flashing down in a vicious cut atRetief, who leaned aside, caught one lean shank below the knee. Qornbent to haul Retief from his leg\u2014and staggered back as a haymaker tookhim just below the beak. A screech went up from the crowd as Retiefleaped clear.     Qorn hissed and charged. Retief whirled aside, then struck the alien'soff-leg in a flying tackle. Qorn leaned, arms windmilling, crashed tothe floor. Retief whirled, dived for the left arm, whipped it behindthe narrow back, seized Qorn's neck in a stranglehold and threw hisweight backward. Qorn fell on his back, his legs squatted out at anawkward angle. He squawked and beat his free arm on the floor, reachingin vain for Retief.     Zubb stepped forward, pistols ready. Magnan stepped before him.     Need I remind you, sir, he said icily, that this is an officialdiplomatic function? I can brook no interference from disinterestedparties.     Zubb hesitated. Magnan held out a hand. I must ask you to hand me yourweapons, Zubb.     Look here, Zubb began.     I      may     lose my temper, Magnan hinted. Zubb lowered the guns, passedthem to Magnan. He thrust them into his belt with a sour smile, turnedback to watch the encounter.     Retief had thrown a turn of violet silk around Qorn's left wrist, boundit to the alien's neck. Another wisp of stuff floated from Qorn'sshoulder. Retief, still holding Qorn in an awkward sprawl, wrappedit around one outflung leg, trussed ankle and thigh together. Qornflopped, hooting. At each movement, the constricting loop around hisneck, jerked his head back, the green crest tossing wildly.     If I were you, I'd relax, Retief said, rising and releasing his grip.Qorn got a leg under him; Retief kicked it. Qorn's chin hit the floorwith a hollow clack. He wilted, an ungainly tangle of over-long limbsand gay silks.     Retief turned to the watching crowd. Next? he called.     The blue and flame Qornt stepped forward. Maybe this would be a goodtime to elect a new leader, he said. Now, my qualifications\u2014     Sit down, Retief said loudly. He stepped to the head of the table,seated himself in Qorn's vacated chair. A couple of you finishtrussing Qorn up for me.     But we must select a leader!     That won't be necessary, boys. I'm your new leader.   <doc-sep> There was a momentary silence from all sides.     I guess so, grunted a giant Qornt in iridescent blue withflame-colored plumes.     Qorn's eyes bulged. He half rose. We've been all over this, hebassooned. He clamped bony fingers on the hilt of a light rapier. Ithought I'd made my point!     Oh, sure, Qorn.     You bet.     I'm convinced.     Qorn rumbled and resumed his seat. All for one and one for all, that'sus.     And you're the one, eh, Qorn? Retief commented.     Magnan cleared his throat. I sense that some of you gentlemen are notconvinced of the wisdom of this move, he piped, looking along thetable at the silks, jewels, beaks, feather-decked crests and staringeyes.     Silence! Qorn hooted. No use your talking to my loyal lieutenantsanyway, he added. They do whatever I convince them they ought to do.     But I'm sure that on more mature consideration\u2014     I can lick any Qornt in the house. Qorn said. That's why I'm Qorn.He belched again.     A servant came up staggering under a weight of chain, dropped it with acrash at Magnan's feet. Zubb aimed the guns while the servant wrappedthree loops around Magnan's wrists, snapped a lock in place.     You next! The guns pointed at Retief's chest. He held out his arms.Four loops of silvery-gray chain in half-inch links dropped aroundthem. The servant cinched them up tight, squeezed a lock through theends and closed it.     Now, Qorn said, lolling back in his chair, glass in hand. There's abit of sport to be had here, lads. What shall we do with them?     Let them go, the blue and flame Qornt said glumly.     You can do better than that, Qorn hooted. Now here's a suggestion:we carve them up a little\u2014lop off the external labiae and pinnae,say\u2014and ship them back.     Good lord! Retief, he's talking about cutting off our ears and sendingus home mutilated! What a barbaric proposal!     It wouldn't be the first time a Terrestrial diplomat got a trimming,Retief commented.     It should have the effect of stimulating the Terries to put up areasonable scrap, Qorn said judiciously. I have a feeling thatthey're thinking of giving up without a struggle.     Oh, I doubt that, the blue-and-flame Qornt said. Why should they?     Qorn rolled an eye at Retief and another at Magnan. Take these two,he hooted. I'll wager they came here to negotiate a surrender!     Well, Magnan started.     Hold it, Mr. Magnan, Retief said. I'll tell him.     What's your proposal? Qorn whistled, taking a gulp from his goblet.A fifty-fifty split? Monetary reparations? Alternate territory? I canassure you, it's useless. We Qornt      like     to fight.     I'm afraid you've gotten the wrong impression, your Excellency,Retief said blandly. We didn't come to negotiate. We came to deliveran Ultimatum.     What? Qorn trumpeted. Behind Retief, Magnan spluttered.     We plan to use this planet for target practice, Retief said. A newtype hell bomb we've worked out. Have all your people off of it inseventy-two hours, or suffer the consequences.      IV     You have the gall, Qorn stormed, to stand here in the center ofQornt Hall\u2014uninvited, at that\u2014and in chains\u2014     Oh, these, Retief said. He tensed his arms. The soft aluminum linksstretched and broke. He shook the light metal free. We diplomats liketo go along with colorful local customs, but I wouldn't want to misleadyou. Now, as to the evacuation of Roolit I\u2014       Zubb screeched, waved the guns. The Qornt were jabbering.     I told you they were brutes, Zubb shrilled.     Qorn slammed his fist down on the table. I don't care what they are!he honked. Evacuate, hell! I can field eighty-five combat-ready ships!     And we can englobe every one of them with a thousand Peace Enforcerswith a hundred megatons/second firepower each.     Retief. Magnan tugged at his sleeve. Don't forget their superdrive.     That's all right. They don't have one.     But\u2014     We'll take you on! Qorn French-horned. We're the Qorn! We glory inbattle! We live in fame or go down in\u2014     Hogwash, the flame-and-blue Qorn cut in. If it wasn't for you, Qorn,we could sit around and feast and brag and enjoy life without having toprove anything.     Qorn, you seem to be the fire-brand here, Retief said. I think therest of the boys would listen to reason\u2014     Over my dead body!     My idea exactly, Retief said. You claim you can lick any man inthe house. Unwind yourself from your ribbons and step out here on thefloor, and we'll see how good you are at backing up your conversation.  "

        "Query": "How does the dynamic between Magnan and Retief evolve in the story \"Mightiest Qorn\"?",
        "Summary_1": "Magnan and Retief are the men selected to go to the planet where the Qornt are based in order to investigate. Although Magnan was the first person assigned to the job, he is less comfortable out in the field compared to Retief, who ends up making most of the decisions. There is a tension here as they continue their adventure, with Magnan being scared and Retief encouraging him forward, and Retief saving Magnan when he is pinned by the Verpp. Magnan is the one who is explicitly a diplomat, but Retief takes over most conversations\u2014not only does he push the mission forward and insist on following the Verpp to the Qornt, but he eventually declares himself leader of the Qornt. Even when Ambassador Nitworth demands information from Magnan near the end, it is Retief who responds\u2014he wants the Ambassador to know that he is the one calling the shots, even if it has been behind the scenes. It\u2019s clear that Magnan has either not understood this, as if he were being tricked, or he is just not good at giving credit where credit is due, because he refers to the plan as his own recruiting scheme, correcting himself to say it was a group effort, even though it was all Retief\u2019s idea. At the very end of the story, Retief complies to all of Magnan\u2019s requests in an uncharacteristic way\u2014the interpretation is left open, but there is a possibility Retief is hiding something and intends to return as a military leader with the Qornt and perhaps attack the Terrestrials. \n",
        "Summary_2": "\tMagnan is a hesitant man, very aware of himself. His anxiety about the situation at hand is in direct relation to his self-preservation instincts. Retief, on the other hand, is far bolder, willing to sacrifice himself and his safety to explore, solve the issue, or reach a solution. At first, Retief makes fun of Magnan and his hesitancy. Often, Retief has to goad or tease Magnan just to make him come along with him. \n\tAfter Magnan takes down both the Verpps, Retief\u2019s respect for him grows, if only incrementally. Their sarcastic and snarky manner only grows as the story progresses. As they continue on their mission, Magnan continues to question Retief\u2019s ever-present bravery, but this only propels him forward. \n\tOnce Retief challenges Qorn to a duel, Magnan instantly tries to hold him back and questions his train of thought. After hearing Retief\u2019s plan, Magnan backs off and watches his comrade take down the chief. \n\tNow that Retief is their new leader, he and Magnan brainstorm with the Qornt about how to solve the issue at hand. Magnan always leads with the idea of peace, while Retief looks for other solutions. \n\tAlthough they experience some difficulties in the beginning, Magnan and Retief develop a friendly relationship where they are able to question each other, keep the other one safe, and bounce ideas off of each other.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Mangan and Retief begin their adventure on the planet at odds with each other. Mangan is in favor of leaving the planet while Retief proposing investigating further the more they learn. Mangan is diplomatic and risk-averse in his interaction while Retief prefers action.\n\nRetief is the cleverer of the two men and understands that although the Verpp and Qornt look imposing, the lower gravity on the planet renders them ineffectual physically. He uses this knowledge to his advantage to defeat Qorn, the leader of the Qornt and bluff the remainder of the population into establishing himself as their leader. Mangan, originally the leader of the expedition falls into line behind Retief's lead. By the end of the story Retief has accomplished a striking victory and now is beginning to view Mangan as another clueless dignitary like Nitworth and begins to discuss his future plans with the lower-class pilot, Cy.",
        "Summary_4": "Magnan and Ratief are sent to investigate the Qornt together. Before they leave, Ambassador Nitworth tells Ratief to make sure that Magnan does not do anything foolish or compulsive. \n\nHowever, as soon as they land on the planet, Magnan accuses Ratief of going against the boss\u2019s policies. Ratief tells Magnan to give him an hour to investigate the Qornts and to leave without him if he\u2019s not back in time. Ratief is clearly the braver of the two men. Yet, Magnan is able to show off his own skills and courage when the Qornts show up unexpectedly and jump out from behind a bush. Magnan knocks the aliens down without much thought. \n\nMagnan tries to convince Ratief to go back to their ship, but Ratief refuses and instead says that it\u2019s their job to go get the Qornts\u2019 attention. Although the two Qornts agree to bring them to their leader, Magnan is concerned that the Qornts are secretly plotting an attack against the diplomats. His doubts about their kindness have merit. The two Qornt escorts end up pulling out weapons and threatening the men. This time, it\u2019s Ratief who uses caution and tells Magnan not to scare the Qornts because they may get nervous and shoot. \n\nRatief takes charge of the mission and leaves Magnan\u2019s opinions about the situation out when he tells the Qorn that the two earthmen have come with an ultimatum. He completely changes his boss\u2019s message and tries to scare the Qornts into leaving. When the leader refuses, Ratief challenges him to a duel and comes out victorious. Ratief then nominates himself to be the new leader of the group.\n\nMagnan is stunned by Ratief\u2019s cavalier attitude, but he is supportive of his colleague. He trusts Ratief to make good decisions, even when his actions seem outlandish. \n",

I suspected you had hidden qualities, Zubb, Retief commented.     See here, Zubb! We're diplomats! Magnan started.     Careful, Mr. Magnan; you may goad him to a frenzy.     By no means, Zubb whistled. I much prefer to observe the frenzyof the Qornt when presented with the news that two peaceful Verpphave been assaulted and kidnapped by bullying interlopers. If there'sanything that annoys the Qornt, it's Qornt-like behavior in others. Nowstep along, please.     Rest assured, this will be reported!     I doubt it.     You'll face the wrath of Enlightened Galactic Opinion!     Oh? How big a navy does Enlightened Galactic Opinion have?     Stop scaring him, Mr. Magnan. He may get nervous and shoot. Retiefstepped into the banquet hall, headed for the resplendent figure atthe head of the table. A trio of flute-players broke off in mid-bleat,staring. An inverted pyramid of tumblers blinked as Retief swung past,followed by Magnan and the tall Verpp. The shrill chatter at the tablefaded.     Qorn turned as Retief came up, blinking three-inch eyes. Zubb steppedforward, gibbered, waving his arms excitedly. Qorn pushed back hischair\u2014a low, heavily padded stool\u2014and stared unwinking at Retief,moving his head to bring first one great round eye, then the other, tobear. There were small blue veins in the immense fleshy beak. The bushyhair, springing out in a giant halo around the grayish, porous-skinnedface, was wiry, stiff, moss-green, with tufts of chartreuse fuzzsurrounding what appeared to be tympanic membranes. The tall head-dressof scarlet silk and purple feathers was slightly askew, and a loop ofpink pearls had slipped down above one eye.     Zubb finished his speech and fell silent, breathing hard.     Qorn looked Retief over in silence, then belched.     Not bad, Retief said admiringly. Maybe we could get up a matchbetween you and Ambassador Sternwheeler. You've got the volume on him,but he's got timbre.     So, Qorn hooted in a resonant tenor. You come from Guzzum, eh? OrSmorbrod, as I think you call it. What is it you're after? More time?A compromise? Negotiations? Peace? He slammed a bony hand against thetable. The answer is      no     !     Zubb twittered. Qorn cocked an eye, motioned to a servant. Chain thatone. He indicated Magnan. His eyes went to Retief. This one's bigger;you'd best chain him, too.     Why, your Excellency\u2014 Magnan started, stepping forward.     Stay back! Qorn hooted. Stand over there where I can keep an eye onyou.     Your Excellency, I'm empowered\u2014     Not here, you're not! Qorn trumpeted. Want peace, do you? Well, Idon't want peace! I've had a surfeit of peace these last two centuries!I want action! Loot! Adventure! Glory! He turned to look down thetable. How about it, fellows? It's war to the knife, eh?  "

        "Query": "How does Magnan's attitude change throughout the story of MIGHTIEST QORN?",
        "Summary_1": "Second Secretary Magnan was selected by Ambassador Nitworth to travel to Roolit I to investigate the Qornt. Magnan does not have much field experience and is surprised by this assignment, and had been trying to get out of doing anything related to the Qornt issue when it was handed to him. He resigns himself to the task and Retief is assigned to go along with him. When they get to the planet, Magnan is clearly anxious\u2014he remarks on the quality of the view and states his intent to head back to finish the mission, but Retief doesn\u2019t let him give up so early. When the men are spotted by some creatures, and he tries to run for help, he is instead jumped by the creatures and Retief has to tear him free. This gives Magnan some confidence, and has a much more arrogant attitude towards the Verpp. He flaunts his title as diplomat and tries to assert as much dominance as he can. Once he learns that these are Verpp and not Qornt, he is preoccupied by the confusing details of the story: how many Qornt there are, and things like that. Once the group starts towards the Qornt\u2019s village, however, he becomes nervous again, no longer with the upper hand. He is not sure if he is walking into a trap, and becomes more and more nervous until the trap is revealed. Once at gunpoint standing in front of the Qornt, however, he has enough confidence to pry at the division between the Qornt who want war and those who aren\u2019t sold on the idea yet. Once Retief threatens the Qornt and a fight commences, Magnan still tries to talk his way out of Zubb shooting the men, gains confidence again, and insists on taking the guns. Once Qorn has been tied up, Magnan suggests putting the Verpp in charge, and asks the Qornt if there are alternatives to militaristic life that they would consider. Eventually they all make it back to where the story started, and he seems more passive again, until the Ambassador is on board with Retief\u2019s plan, and Magnan starts ordering Retief around again, though Retief\u2019s behavior has shifted in response. ",
        "Summary_2": "\tMagnan is one of Ambassador Nitworth\u2019s men, assumedly part of his military brigade. When Nitworth commands him to take Retief on a journey to find the Qornt, he balks and asks not to. He is essentially the literary version of a scaredy-cat. \n\tThroughout their journey, Retief has to come up with different encouragements or tricks to keep Magnan going, usually involving putting him in harm\u2019s way. At first, Magnan\u2019s self-preservation is what drives him forward. But as the story progresses, he soon grows to care for Retief in a purely platonic way. This development means he also tries to protect Retief in his own way, usually by questioning his choices and insisting safety comes first. \n\tAt the end, Magnan becomes a much braver man and negotiates with the Qornt himself. He constantly pushes for the idea of peace, not only for his own self-preservation but also for those around him. His basic instincts remain, but they expand to include the rest of the Terrestrials as well as the other races.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Mangan is the Second Secretary in the Terrestrial Diplomatic Corp. He answers to Ambassador Nitworth. He is chosen to perform reconnaissance on the alien planet along with Retief. Initially, Mangan is a by-the-books officer with something of a cowardly streak not wanting to engage in any risky action. Throughout his time on the planet, Mangan is continually proposing that they retreat before being pushed on by Retief.\n\nEventually when Mangan is nearly captured by the Verpp, he physically overpowers them. Eventually, Mangan is influenced by Retief's bravado and guile and aids him in deceiving the Qorn into joining the Terrestrial military complex.\n\nMangan also has a prejudiced view of social class (not unlike the Verpp) disapproving of Retief socializing with a mere pilot. This limitation prevents Mangan from seeing the bigger picture of the situation unlike Retief.",
        "Summary_4": "At the beginning of the story, Magnan, the diplomat, takes on very little responsibility. He listens to Nitworth\u2019s declarations about an unknown enemy invading their territory, and he is unphased. He tells Nitworth that it seems like everything is under control, so he is just going to head out. Nitworth sends him to check on the Qornt in person, and he is deeply unhappy with the assignment.\n\nUpon arrival, Magnan immediately tries to get out of doing any work by telling Ratief that they can\u2019t locate the group. He doesn\u2019t see it as his responsibility to save the earth men from the invaders. \n\nHowever, when the Qornts appear in front of him, he wastes no time in defending himself and his colleague and knocks them to the ground. After spending more time with the Qornts and getting to know them and their society better, Magnan becomes more invested in what happens to them and how the earth men handle their invasion. He fully supports Ratief when he asks Qorn to prove that he is in fact the strongest and again when Ratief claims the leadership role for himself. Magnan knows that everything Ratief is doing is against Nitworth\u2019s orders, but he trusts Ratief to make good decisions, and the whole ordeal is very entertaining. \n",
        "Article": "   MIGHTIEST QORN     BY KEITH LAUMER     Sly, brave and truculent, the Qornt     held all humans in contempt\u2014except one!     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Worlds of If Science Fiction, July 1963.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      I     Ambassador Nitworth glowered across his mirror-polished, nine-footplatinum desk at his assembled staff.     Gentlemen, are any of you familiar with a race known as the Qornt?     There was a moment of profound silence. Nitworth leaned forward,looking solemn.     They were a warlike race known in this sector back in Concordiattimes, perhaps two hundred years ago. They vanished as suddenly asthey had appeared. There was no record of where they went. He pausedfor effect.     They have now reappeared\u2014occupying the inner planet of this system!     But, sir, Second Secretary Magnan offered. That's uninhabitedTerrestrial territory....     Indeed, Mr. Magnan? Nitworth smiled icily. It appears the Qornt donot share that opinion. He plucked a heavy parchment from a folderbefore him, harrumphed and read aloud:     His Supreme Excellency The Qorn, Regent of Qornt, Over-Lord of theGalactic Destiny, Greets the Terrestrials and, with reference to thepresence in mandated territory of Terrestrial squatters, has the honorto advise that he will require the use of his outer world on thethirtieth day. Then will the Qornt come with steel and fire. Receive,Terrestrials, renewed assurances of my awareness of your existence,and let Those who dare gird for the contest.     Frankly, I wouldn't call it conciliatory, Magnan said.     Nitworth tapped the paper with a finger.     We have been served, gentlemen, with nothing less than an Ultimatum!     Well, we'll soon straighten these fellows out\u2014 the Military Attachebegan.     There happens to be more to this piece of truculence than appears onthe surface, the Ambassador cut in. He paused, waiting for interestedfrowns to settle into place.     Note, gentlemen, that these invaders have appeared on terrestrialcontrolled soil\u2014and without so much as a flicker from the instrumentsof the Navigational Monitor Service!     The Military Attache blinked. That's absurd, he said flatly. Nitworthslapped the table.     We're up against something new, gentlemen! I've considered everyhypothesis from cloaks of invisibility to time travel! The fact is\u2014theQornt fleets are indetectible!   <doc-sep> There was a momentary silence from all sides.     I guess so, grunted a giant Qornt in iridescent blue withflame-colored plumes.     Qorn's eyes bulged. He half rose. We've been all over this, hebassooned. He clamped bony fingers on the hilt of a light rapier. Ithought I'd made my point!     Oh, sure, Qorn.     You bet.     I'm convinced.     Qorn rumbled and resumed his seat. All for one and one for all, that'sus.     And you're the one, eh, Qorn? Retief commented.     Magnan cleared his throat. I sense that some of you gentlemen are notconvinced of the wisdom of this move, he piped, looking along thetable at the silks, jewels, beaks, feather-decked crests and staringeyes.     Silence! Qorn hooted. No use your talking to my loyal lieutenantsanyway, he added. They do whatever I convince them they ought to do.     But I'm sure that on more mature consideration\u2014     I can lick any Qornt in the house. Qorn said. That's why I'm Qorn.He belched again.     A servant came up staggering under a weight of chain, dropped it with acrash at Magnan's feet. Zubb aimed the guns while the servant wrappedthree loops around Magnan's wrists, snapped a lock in place.     You next! The guns pointed at Retief's chest. He held out his arms.Four loops of silvery-gray chain in half-inch links dropped aroundthem. The servant cinched them up tight, squeezed a lock through theends and closed it.     Now, Qorn said, lolling back in his chair, glass in hand. There's abit of sport to be had here, lads. What shall we do with them?     Let them go, the blue and flame Qornt said glumly.     You can do better than that, Qorn hooted. Now here's a suggestion:we carve them up a little\u2014lop off the external labiae and pinnae,say\u2014and ship them back.     Good lord! Retief, he's talking about cutting off our ears and sendingus home mutilated! What a barbaric proposal!     It wouldn't be the first time a Terrestrial diplomat got a trimming,Retief commented.     It should have the effect of stimulating the Terries to put up areasonable scrap, Qorn said judiciously. I have a feeling thatthey're thinking of giving up without a struggle.     Oh, I doubt that, the blue-and-flame Qornt said. Why should they?     Qorn rolled an eye at Retief and another at Magnan. Take these two,he hooted. I'll wager they came here to negotiate a surrender!     Well, Magnan started.     Hold it, Mr. Magnan, Retief said. I'll tell him.     What's your proposal? Qorn whistled, taking a gulp from his goblet.A fifty-fifty split? Monetary reparations? Alternate territory? I canassure you, it's useless. We Qornt      like     to fight.     I'm afraid you've gotten the wrong impression, your Excellency,Retief said blandly. We didn't come to negotiate. We came to deliveran Ultimatum.     What? Qorn trumpeted. Behind Retief, Magnan spluttered.     We plan to use this planet for target practice, Retief said. A newtype hell bomb we've worked out. Have all your people off of it inseventy-two hours, or suffer the consequences.      IV     You have the gall, Qorn stormed, to stand here in the center ofQornt Hall\u2014uninvited, at that\u2014and in chains\u2014     Oh, these, Retief said. He tensed his arms. The soft aluminum linksstretched and broke. He shook the light metal free. We diplomats liketo go along with colorful local customs, but I wouldn't want to misleadyou. Now, as to the evacuation of Roolit I\u2014       Zubb screeched, waved the guns. The Qornt were jabbering.     I told you they were brutes, Zubb shrilled.     Qorn slammed his fist down on the table. I don't care what they are!he honked. Evacuate, hell! I can field eighty-five combat-ready ships!     And we can englobe every one of them with a thousand Peace Enforcerswith a hundred megatons/second firepower each.     Retief. Magnan tugged at his sleeve. Don't forget their superdrive.     That's all right. They don't have one.     But\u2014     We'll take you on! Qorn French-horned. We're the Qorn! We glory inbattle! We live in fame or go down in\u2014     Hogwash, the flame-and-blue Qorn cut in. If it wasn't for you, Qorn,we could sit around and feast and brag and enjoy life without having toprove anything.     Qorn, you seem to be the fire-brand here, Retief said. I think therest of the boys would listen to reason\u2014     Over my dead body!     My idea exactly, Retief said. You claim you can lick any man inthe house. Unwind yourself from your ribbons and step out here on thefloor, and we'll see how good you are at backing up your conversation.   <doc-sep> Magnan hovered at Retief's side. Twelve feet tall, he moaned. Anddid you notice the size of those hands?     Retief watched as Qorn's aides helped him out of his formal trappings.I wouldn't worry too much, Mr. Magnan. This is a light-Gee world. Idoubt if old Qorn would weigh up at more than two-fifty standard poundshere.     But that phenomenal reach\u2014     I'll peck away at him at knee level. When he bends over to swat me,I'll get a crack at him.     Across the cleared floor, Qorn shook off his helpers with a snort.     Enough! Let me at the upstart!     Retief moved out to meet him, watching the upraised backward-jointedarms. Qorn stalked forward, long lean legs bent, long horny feetclacking against the polished floor. The other aliens\u2014both servitorsand bejeweled Qornt\u2014formed a wide circle, all eyes unwaveringly on thecombatants.     Qorn struck suddenly, a long arm flashing down in a vicious cut atRetief, who leaned aside, caught one lean shank below the knee. Qornbent to haul Retief from his leg\u2014and staggered back as a haymaker tookhim just below the beak. A screech went up from the crowd as Retiefleaped clear.     Qorn hissed and charged. Retief whirled aside, then struck the alien'soff-leg in a flying tackle. Qorn leaned, arms windmilling, crashed tothe floor. Retief whirled, dived for the left arm, whipped it behindthe narrow back, seized Qorn's neck in a stranglehold and threw hisweight backward. Qorn fell on his back, his legs squatted out at anawkward angle. He squawked and beat his free arm on the floor, reachingin vain for Retief.     Zubb stepped forward, pistols ready. Magnan stepped before him.     Need I remind you, sir, he said icily, that this is an officialdiplomatic function? I can brook no interference from disinterestedparties.     Zubb hesitated. Magnan held out a hand. I must ask you to hand me yourweapons, Zubb.     Look here, Zubb began.     I      may     lose my temper, Magnan hinted. Zubb lowered the guns, passedthem to Magnan. He thrust them into his belt with a sour smile, turnedback to watch the encounter.     Retief had thrown a turn of violet silk around Qorn's left wrist, boundit to the alien's neck. Another wisp of stuff floated from Qorn'sshoulder. Retief, still holding Qorn in an awkward sprawl, wrappedit around one outflung leg, trussed ankle and thigh together. Qornflopped, hooting. At each movement, the constricting loop around hisneck, jerked his head back, the green crest tossing wildly.     If I were you, I'd relax, Retief said, rising and releasing his grip.Qorn got a leg under him; Retief kicked it. Qorn's chin hit the floorwith a hollow clack. He wilted, an ungainly tangle of over-long limbsand gay silks.     Retief turned to the watching crowd. Next? he called.     The blue and flame Qornt stepped forward. Maybe this would be a goodtime to elect a new leader, he said. Now, my qualifications\u2014     Sit down, Retief said loudly. He stepped to the head of the table,seated himself in Qorn's vacated chair. A couple of you finishtrussing Qorn up for me.     But we must select a leader!     That won't be necessary, boys. I'm your new leader.  "

        "Query": "What makes the men so certain about the Qornt's superior tactical advantage? Can we gather information about the military strategies and equipment used by the group?",
        "Summary_1": "Because they Qornt have been underground for two centuries while they molted from the Verpp stage of their life cycle, they have gone undetected by the Terrestrials in this time. This led the Terrestrials to believe that the Qornt possessed superior technology of some kind, as they seemed to have reappeared out of nowhere. However, this is not the case, and it was merely that the group remained dormant for a long time. There are rumors of stealth technology and superior ships, including a superdrive, but not much firsthand information until Magnan and Retief make it to the surface of Roolit I, the planet that the Qornt are currently occupying. It is true that the Verpp and Qornt are physically larger than the Terrestrials, but the systems of gravity on the different planets means that the smaller Terrestrials are actually stronger and have a kind of advantage on Roolit I. The Verpp tell Magnan that the Qornt have huge, powerful warships that have a variety of weapon types. Not only this, but each Qornt has his own ship, which means that there is a large fleet of these. It comes to Magnan as a surprise, then, that the Qornt are not worried about diplomatic negotiation, but instead just seem to have an impulse that drives them to be in battle. ",
        "Summary_2": "\tWhen the Qornt reappears after a 200-year hiatus, Ambassador Nitworth and his men are terrified because their radars are unable to find them. Because of this, and the Qornt\u2019s leader\u2019s claim about their unrivaled weaponry, the men are sure of their demise. They gather their forces to come up with five different relocation plans and decide to execute the best one in 24 short hours. \n\tWith a population of 15 million Terrestrials, relocation is a mighty feat. By choosing relocation, it\u2019s clear that Ambassador Nitworth and his men have no faith in their fleet\u2019s ability against the Qornt\u2019s. \n\tLater on, when Retief and Magnan are with the Zubb and the Qornt, we discover that each Qornt has his own dreadnought. Zubb talks them up as well, explaining in detail about these fully automated warships. He also mentions their super drive and their unstoppable army. However, Retief is smart enough to figure out that since they\u2019ve been underground for 200 years, they wouldn\u2019t have access to all of this new technology. The Qornt are still a warring species, though, advanced technology or not. \n\tSince the leader and his men were not in line, their power fell dramatically. Retief was able to become their new leader with relative ease. He also appeases their warlike ways by assigning them to the Peace Enforcement Corps.\n",
        "Summary_3": "The men are convinced of Qornt superiority due to the fact that they appeared on the planet undetected by their instruments. Later, Mangan and Retief learn that the Qornt command a massive armada of warships that would be a imposing threat to the Terrestrials.\n\nThe military mindset of the Terrestrials is similarly aggressive as the Qornt. They are intent on countering the perceived threat but seeing that they are facing a technologically superior foe, they seek to surrender and save their population.",
        "Summary_4": "The humans\u2019 tools are unable to detect the Qornts\u2019 invasion at the beginning of the story, so they assume that they have far more advanced equipment. It is obvious that they have never before seen an arrival go completely undetected by their tools. At the end of the story, however, the truth that the Qornts were hibernating underground for 200 years comes to light. Therefore, the earth men did not \u201cmiss\u201d their invasion, they just didn\u2019t know that there were dozens of them buried underground. \n\nThe Qornts are self-proclaimed lovers of war. The original Qorn says that he has no desire for peace between his people and the earthlings because he much prefers adventure and action, regardless of the potential loss of life. Although some of his subordinates do not agree with his decision to battle the earth men, they do acknowledge that war is an essential part of the Qornts\u2019 society. \n\nThe Qornts are not always Qornts. Before they are Qornts, they are Verpp, and before that they are Rheuk, and before that, Boog, etc. No one survives the Qornt stage because the Qornt love military life. \n",
        "Article": "The beak twitched. Smorbrod? I know of no place called Smorbrod.     The outer planet of this system.     Oh, yes. We call it Guzzum. I had heard that some sort of creatureshad established a settlement there, but I confess I pay little note tosuch matters.     We're wasting time, Retief, Magnan said. We must truss these chapsup, hurry back to the boat and make our escape. You heard what theysaid.     Are there any Qornt down there at the harbor, where the boats are?Retief asked.     At Tarroon, you mean? Oh, yes. Planning some adventure.     That would be the invasion of Smorbrod, Magnan said. And unless wehurry, Retief, we're likely to be caught there with the last of theevacuees!     How many Qornt would you say there are at Tarroon?     Oh, a very large number. Perhaps fifteen or twenty.     Fifteen or twenty what? Magnan looked perplexed.     Fifteen or twenty Qornt.     You mean that there are only fifteen or twenty individual Qornt inall?     Another whistle. Not at all. I was referring to the local Qornt only.There are more at the other Centers, of course.     And the Qornt are responsible for the ultimatum\u2014unilaterally?     I suppose so; it sounds like them. A truculent group, you know. Andinterplanetary relations      are     rather a hobby of theirs.     Zubb moaned and stirred. He sat up slowly, rubbing his head. He spoketo his companion in a shrill alien clatter of consonants.     What did he say?     Poor Zubb. He blames me for his bruises, since it was my idea togather you as specimens.     You should have known better than to tackle that fierce-lookingcreature, Zubb said, pointing his beak at Magnan.     How does it happen that you speak Terrestrial? Retief asked.     Oh, one picks up all sorts of dialects.     It's quite charming, really, Magnan said. Such a quaint, archaicaccent.     Suppose we went down to Tarroon, Retief asked. What kind ofreception would we get?     That depends. I wouldn't recommend interfering with the Gwil or theRheuk; it's their nest-mending time, you know. The Boog will be busymating\u2014such a tedious business\u2014and of course the Qornt are tied upwith their ceremonial feasting. I'm afraid no one will take any noticeof you.     Do you mean to say, Magnan demanded, that these ferocious Qornt, whohave issued an ultimatum to the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne\u2014whoopenly avow their occupied world\u2014would ignore Terrestrials in theirmidst?     If at all possible.     Retief got to his feet.     I think our course is clear, Mr. Magnan. It's up to us to go down andattract a little attention.      III     I'm not at all sure we're going about this in the right way, Magnanpuffed, trotting at Retief's side. These fellows Zubb and Slun\u2014Oh,they seem affable enough, but how can we be sure we're not being ledinto a trap?     We can't.     Magnan stopped short. Let's go back.     All right, Retief said. Of course there may be an ambush\u2014     Magnan moved off. Let's keep going.     The party emerged from the undergrowth at the edge of a greatbrush-grown mound. Slun took the lead, rounded the flank of thehillock, halted at a rectangular opening cut into the slope.     You can find your way easily enough from here, he said. You'llexcuse us, I hope\u2014     Nonsense, Slun! Zubb pushed forward. I'll escort our guests to QorntHall. He twittered briefly to his fellow Verpp. Slun twittered back.     I don't like it, Retief, Magnan whispered. Those fellows areplotting mischief.     Threaten them with violence, Mr Magnan. They're scared of you.     That's true. And the drubbing they received was well-deserved. I'm apatient man, but there are occasions\u2014     Come along, please, Zubb called. Another ten minutes' walk\u2014     See here, we have no interest in investigating this barrow, Magnanannounced. We wish you to take us direct to Tarroon to interview yourmilitary leaders regarding the ultimatum!     Yes, yes, of course. Qornt Hall lies here inside the village.     This is Tarroon?     A modest civic center, sir, but there are those who love it.     No wonder we didn't observe their works from the air, Magnanmuttered. Camouflaged. He moved hesitantly through the opening.     The party moved along a wide, deserted tunnel which sloped downsteeply, then leveled off and branched. Zubb took the center branch,ducking slightly under the nine-foot ceiling lit at intervals with whatappeared to be primitive incandescent panels.     Few signs of an advanced technology here, Magnan whispered. Thesecreatures must devote all their talents to warlike enterprise.     Ahead, Zubb slowed. A distant susurration was audible, a sustainedhigh-pitched screeching. Softly, now. We approach Qornt Hall. Theycan be an irascible lot when disturbed at their feasting.     When will the feast be over? Magnan called hoarsely.     In another few weeks, I should imagine, if, as you say, they'vescheduled an invasion for next month.     Look here, Zubb. Magnan shook a finger at the tall alien. How is itthat these Qornt are allowed to embark on piratical ventures of thissort without reference to the wishes of the majority?     Oh, the majority of the Qornt favor the move, I imagine.     These few hotheads are permitted to embroil the planet in war?     Oh, they don't embroil the planet in war. They merely\u2014     Retief, this is fantastic! I've heard of iron-fisted military cliquesbefore, but this is madness!     Come softly, now. Zubb beckoned, moving toward a bend in theyellow-lit corridor. Retief and Magnan moved forward.   <doc-sep> As I see it, Retief said, dribbling cigar ashes into an empty wineglass, you Qornt like to be warriors, but you don't particularly liketo fight.     We don't mind a little fighting\u2014within reason. And, of course, asQornt, we're expected to die in battle. But what I say is, why rushthings?     I have a suggestion, Magnan said. Why not turn the reins ofgovernment over to the Verpp? They seem a level-headed group.     What good would that do? Qornt are Qornt. It seems there's always oneamong us who's a slave to instinct\u2014and, naturally, we have to followhim.     Why?     Because that's the way it's done.     Why not do it another way? Magnan offered. Now, I'd like to suggestcommunity singing\u2014     If we gave up fighting, we might live too long. Then what wouldhappen?     Live too long? Magnan looked puzzled.     When estivating time comes there'd be no burrows for us. Anyway, withthe new Qornt stepping on our heels\u2014     I've lost the thread, Magnan said. Who are the new Qornt?     After estivating, the Verpp moult, and then they're Qornt, of course.The Gwil become Boog, the Boog become Rheuk, the Rheuk metamorphosizeinto Verpp\u2014     You mean Slun and Zubb\u2014the mild-natured naturalists\u2014will becomewarmongers like Qorn?     Very likely. 'The milder the Verpp, the wilder the Qorn,' as the oldsaying goes.     What do Qornt turn into? Retief asked.     Hmmmm. That's a good question. So far, none have survived Qornthood.     Have you thought of forsaking your warlike ways? Magnan asked. Whatabout taking up sheepherding and regular church attendance?     Don't mistake me. We Qornt like a military life. It's great sport tosit around roaring fires and drink and tell lies and then go dashingoff to enjoy a brisk affray and some leisurely looting afterward. Butwe prefer a nice numerical advantage. Not this business of tackling youTerrestrials over on Guzzum\u2014that was a mad notion. We had no idea whatyour strength was.     But now that's all off, of course, Magnan chirped. Now that we'vehad diplomatic relations and all\u2014     Oh, by no means. The fleet lifts in thirty days. After all, we'reQornt; we have to satisfy our drive to action.     But Mr. Retief is your leader now. He won't let you!     Only a dead Qornt stays home when Attack day comes. And even ifhe orders us all to cut our own throats, there are still the otherCenters\u2014all with their own leaders. No, gentlemen, the Invasion isdefinitely on.     Why don't you go invade somebody else? Magnan suggested. I couldname some very attractive prospects\u2014outside my sector, of course.     Hold everything, Retief said. I think we've got the basis of a dealhere....      V     At the head of a double column of gaudily caparisoned Qornt, Retiefand Magnan strolled across the ramp toward the bright tower of the CDTSector HQ. Ahead, gates opened, and a black Corps limousine emerged,flying an Ambassadorial flag under a plain square of white.     Curious, Magnan commented. I wonder what the significance of thewhite ensign might be?     Retief raised a hand. The column halted with a clash of accoutrementsand a rasp of Qornt boots. Retief looked back along the line. The highwhite sun flashed on bright silks, polished buckles, deep-dyed plumes,butts of pistols, the soft gleam of leather.     A brave show indeed, Magnan commented approvingly. I confess theidea has merit.     The limousine pulled up with a squeal of brakes, stood on two fat-tiredwheels, gyros humming softly. The hatch popped up. A portly diplomatstepped out.     Why, Ambassador Nitworth, Magnan glowed. This is very kind of you.     Keep cool, Magnan, Nitworth said in a strained voice. We'll attemptto get you out of this.     He stepped past Magnan's out-stretched hand and looked hesitantly atthe ramrod-straight line of Qornt, eighty-five strong\u2014and beyond, atthe eighty-five tall Qornt dreadnaughts.     Good afternoon, sir ... ah, Your Excellency, Nitworth said, blinkingup at the leading Qornt. You are Commander of the Strike Force, Iassume?     Nope, the Qornt said shortly.     I ... ah ... wish to request seventy-two hours in which to evacuateHeadquarters, Nitworth plowed on.     Mr. Ambassador. Retief said. This\u2014     Don't panic, Retief. I'll attempt to secure your release, Nitworthhissed over his shoulder. Now\u2014     You will address our leader with more respect! the tall Qornt hooted,eyeing Nitworth ominously from eleven feet up.     Oh, yes indeed, sir ... your Excellency ... Commander. Now, about theinvasion\u2014     Mr. Secretary, Magnan tugged at Nitworth's sleeve.     In heaven's name, permit me to negotiate in peace! Nitworth snapped.He rearranged his features. Now your Excellency, we've arranged toevacuate Smorbrod, of course, just as you requested\u2014     Requested? the Qornt honked.     Ah ... demanded, that is. Quite rightly of course. Ordered.Instructed. And, of course, we'll be only too pleased to follow anyother instructions you might have.     You don't quite get the big picture, Mr. Secretary, Retief said.This isn't\u2014     Silence, confound you! Nitworth barked. The leading Qornt looked atRetief. He nodded. Two bony hands shot out, seized Nitworth and stuffeda length of bright pink silk into his mouth, then spun him around andheld him facing Retief.     If you don't mind my taking this opportunity to brief you, Mr.Ambassador, Retief said blandly. I think I should mention that thisisn't an invasion fleet. These are the new recruits for the PeaceEnforcement Corps.     Magnan stepped forward, glanced at the gag in Ambassador Nitworth'smouth, hesitated, then cleared his throat. We felt, he said, thatthe establishment of a Foreign Brigade within the P. E. Corps structurewould provide the element of novelty the Department has requestedin our recruiting, and at the same time would remove the stigma ofTerrestrial chauvinism from future punitive operations.     Nitworth stared, eyes bulging. He grunted, reaching for the gag, caughtthe Qornt's eye on him, dropped his hands to his sides.     I suggest we get the troops in out of the hot sun, Retief said.Magnan edged close. What about the gag? he whispered.     Let's leave it where it is for a while, Retief murmured. It may saveus a few concessions.   <doc-sep>    MIGHTIEST QORN     BY KEITH LAUMER     Sly, brave and truculent, the Qornt     held all humans in contempt\u2014except one!

        "Query": "What is the relationship between the Qornt and the other groups mentioned in the story of the Mightiest Qorn?",
        "Summary_1": "The Qornt is a race of aliens known for their militaristic tendencies that seemed to disappear two centuries ago. They are of particular issue because they have reappeared and written to the Terrestrials saying they would take over the planet that the Terrestrials are on. We eventually learn that the Qornt are but one stage in a longer life cycle, in which Gwil become Boog, who become Rheuk, who become Verpp, who eventually become Qornt after the two hundred year estivation period. It is only in this stage that they become antagonistic and warlike, but they do not know what happens after this stage because Qornt are expected to die in battle, and none have survived long enough to know what happens. The Qornt themselves are twelve feet tall and troll-like, with very bushy fur, huge eyes, and beaks. They are very comfortable with their militaristic traditions\u2014when we meet them, they are in the midst of a large feast that they partake in before going to war. They boast the spoils of battle on display in their great hall, and wear intricate headdresses to show their power. After a skirmish with the men on Roolit I, in which Qorn (the lead Qornt) is replaced in power by Retief, they eventually make it to the outer planets where they have presumably been recruited into the Peace Enforcement Corps.\n",
        "Summary_2": "\tThe Qornt are a large, bird-like, warring species with scary beaks and large eyes. They are similar in looks to the Verpp but much larger and scarier. \n\tAs it turns out, the Qornt and several other species undergo a sort of metamorphosis, similar to a caterpillar becoming a butterfly in our reality. Just as the caterpillar burrows itself in a cocoon, the Verpp burrow, molt, and then re-emerge as Qornt. However, the Verpp aren\u2019t born. They are initially of the Gwil species. The Gwil transform into the Boog, which then transform into the Rheuk, and then they become the Verpp. \n\tSadly, it\u2019s unknown what the Qornt might become during their transformation. No Qornt has ever survived long enough to experience the next metamorphosis if there is one. They always die in battle, supposedly to make room for the Verpp to burrow again. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The Qornt are an antagonistic alien race that have been rediscovered on the planet of Roolit I. They are a warlike race and have delivered an ultimatum to the Terrestrial inhabitants of Smorbrod that if they do not evacuate, they will invade. They are physically imposing, standing over 10 feet tall with a birdlike appearance.\n\nIn reality the Qornt are related to all of the other alien races on Roolit I. Each seperate race is a developmental stage of a single species. The Gwil become Boog, the Boog become Rheuk, which become Verpp which eventually become Qornt. The Qornt are predisposed to warlike tendencies so that they tend to die off and complete their life cycle in order to make room for new Qornt that develop from the Verpp. If they did not do this overpopulation would become an issue when they need to hibernate underground for 200 years. ",
        "Summary_4": "The Qornt originally lived in the Concordiate times, about 200 years ago. They vanished suddenly, and no historians know where it was that they went. However, Magnan and Ratief learn from the aliens that they were simply hibernating for two centuries. They never actually left the planet. \n\nThe Qornt are led by His Supreme Excellency The Qorn, Regent of the Qornt, Over-Lord of the Galactic Destiny. They are about eight feet tall, stand on two green legs, and move like birds. They have bushy green hair and white beaks. They love to attack other species and engage in dangerous action and war. \n\nQornt is the final stage in a long line of evolution of the being. The two beings that Magnan and Ratief meet are not actually Qornts, but Verpps. They are actually offended that the earth men mistake them for Qornts because they believe the similar but different creatures are argumentative and lowly. They are all \u201cpud\u2019s creatures,\u201d but they view themselves distinctly based on their place in the evolution of the being. No one survives the Qornt stage because they are always  engaging in war. \n",

I've considered everyhypothesis from cloaks of invisibility to time travel! The fact is\u2014theQornt fleets are indetectible!   <doc-sep> There was a momentary silence from all sides.     I guess so, grunted a giant Qornt in iridescent blue withflame-colored plumes.     Qorn's eyes bulged. He half rose. We've been all over this, hebassooned. He clamped bony fingers on the hilt of a light rapier. Ithought I'd made my point!     Oh, sure, Qorn.     You bet.     I'm convinced.     Qorn rumbled and resumed his seat. All for one and one for all, that'sus.     And you're the one, eh, Qorn? Retief commented.     Magnan cleared his throat. I sense that some of you gentlemen are notconvinced of the wisdom of this move, he piped, looking along thetable at the silks, jewels, beaks, feather-decked crests and staringeyes.     Silence! Qorn hooted. No use your talking to my loyal lieutenantsanyway, he added. They do whatever I convince them they ought to do.     But I'm sure that on more mature consideration\u2014     I can lick any Qornt in the house. Qorn said. That's why I'm Qorn.He belched again.     A servant came up staggering under a weight of chain, dropped it with acrash at Magnan's feet. Zubb aimed the guns while the servant wrappedthree loops around Magnan's wrists, snapped a lock in place.     You next! The guns pointed at Retief's chest. He held out his arms.Four loops of silvery-gray chain in half-inch links dropped aroundthem. The servant cinched them up tight, squeezed a lock through theends and closed it.     Now, Qorn said, lolling back in his chair, glass in hand. There's abit of sport to be had here, lads. What shall we do with them?     Let them go, the blue and flame Qornt said glumly.     You can do better than that, Qorn hooted. Now here's a suggestion:we carve them up a little\u2014lop off the external labiae and pinnae,say\u2014and ship them back.     Good lord! Retief, he's talking about cutting off our ears and sendingus home mutilated! What a barbaric proposal!     It wouldn't be the first time a Terrestrial diplomat got a trimming,Retief commented.     It should have the effect of stimulating the Terries to put up areasonable scrap, Qorn said judiciously. I have a feeling thatthey're thinking of giving up without a struggle.     Oh, I doubt that, the blue-and-flame Qornt said. Why should they?     Qorn rolled an eye at Retief and another at Magnan. Take these two,he hooted. I'll wager they came here to negotiate a surrender!     Well, Magnan started.     Hold it, Mr. Magnan, Retief said. I'll tell him.     What's your proposal? Qorn whistled, taking a gulp from his goblet.A fifty-fifty split? Monetary reparations? Alternate territory? I canassure you, it's useless. We Qornt      like     to fight.     I'm afraid you've gotten the wrong impression, your Excellency,Retief said blandly. We didn't come to negotiate. We came to deliveran Ultimatum.     What? Qorn trumpeted. Behind Retief, Magnan spluttered.     We plan to use this planet for target practice, Retief said. A newtype hell bomb we've worked out. Have all your people off of it inseventy-two hours, or suffer the consequences.      IV     You have the gall, Qorn stormed, to stand here in the center ofQornt Hall\u2014uninvited, at that\u2014and in chains\u2014     Oh, these, Retief said. He tensed his arms. The soft aluminum linksstretched and broke. He shook the light metal free. We diplomats liketo go along with colorful local customs, but I wouldn't want to misleadyou. Now, as to the evacuation of Roolit I\u2014       Zubb screeched, waved the guns. The Qornt were jabbering.     I told you they were brutes, Zubb shrilled.     Qorn slammed his fist down on the table. I don't care what they are!he honked. Evacuate, hell! I can field eighty-five combat-ready ships!     And we can englobe every one of them with a thousand Peace Enforcerswith a hundred megatons/second firepower each.     Retief. Magnan tugged at his sleeve. Don't forget their superdrive.     That's all right. They don't have one.     But\u2014     We'll take you on! Qorn French-horned. We're the Qorn! We glory inbattle! We live in fame or go down in\u2014     Hogwash, the flame-and-blue Qorn cut in. If it wasn't for you, Qorn,we could sit around and feast and brag and enjoy life without having toprove anything.     Qorn, you seem to be the fire-brand here, Retief said. I think therest of the boys would listen to reason\u2014     Over my dead body!     My idea exactly, Retief said. You claim you can lick any man inthe house. Unwind yourself from your ribbons and step out here on thefloor, and we'll see how good you are at backing up your conversation.   <doc-sep> As I see it, Retief said, dribbling cigar ashes into an empty wineglass, you Qornt like to be warriors, but you don't particularly liketo fight.     We don't mind a little fighting\u2014within reason. And, of course, asQornt, we're expected to die in battle. But what I say is, why rushthings?     I have a suggestion, Magnan said. Why not turn the reins ofgovernment over to the Verpp? They seem a level-headed group.     What good would that do? Qornt are Qornt. It seems there's always oneamong us who's a slave to instinct\u2014and, naturally, we have to followhim.     Why?     Because that's the way it's done.     Why not do it another way? Magnan offered. Now, I'd like to suggestcommunity singing\u2014     If we gave up fighting, we might live too long. Then what wouldhappen?     Live too long? Magnan looked puzzled.     When estivating time comes there'd be no burrows for us. Anyway, withthe new Qornt stepping on our heels\u2014     I've lost the thread, Magnan said. Who are the new Qornt?     After estivating, the Verpp moult, and then they're Qornt, of course.The Gwil become Boog, the Boog become Rheuk, the Rheuk metamorphosizeinto Verpp\u2014     You mean Slun and Zubb\u2014the mild-natured naturalists\u2014will becomewarmongers like Qorn?     Very likely. 'The milder the Verpp, the wilder the Qorn,' as the oldsaying goes.     What do Qornt turn into? Retief asked.     Hmmmm. That's a good question. So far, none have survived Qornthood.     Have you thought of forsaking your warlike ways? Magnan asked. Whatabout taking up sheepherding and regular church attendance?     Don't mistake me. We Qornt like a military life. It's great sport tosit around roaring fires and drink and tell lies and then go dashingoff to enjoy a brisk affray and some leisurely looting afterward. Butwe prefer a nice numerical advantage. Not this business of tackling youTerrestrials over on Guzzum\u2014that was a mad notion. We had no idea whatyour strength was.     But now that's all off, of course, Magnan chirped. Now that we'vehad diplomatic relations and all\u2014     Oh, by no means. The fleet lifts in thirty days. After all, we'reQornt; we have to satisfy our drive to action.     But Mr. Retief is your leader now. He won't let you!     Only a dead Qornt stays home when Attack day comes. And even ifhe orders us all to cut our own throats, there are still the otherCenters\u2014all with their own leaders. No, gentlemen, the Invasion isdefinitely on.     Why don't you go invade somebody else? Magnan suggested. I couldname some very attractive prospects\u2014outside my sector, of course.     Hold everything, Retief said. I think we've got the basis of a dealhere....      V     At the head of a double column of gaudily caparisoned Qornt, Retiefand Magnan strolled across the ramp toward the bright tower of the CDTSector HQ. Ahead, gates opened, and a black Corps limousine emerged,flying an Ambassadorial flag under a plain square of white.     Curious, Magnan commented. I wonder what the significance of thewhite ensign might be?     Retief raised a hand. The column halted with a clash of accoutrementsand a rasp of Qornt boots. Retief looked back along the line. The highwhite sun flashed on bright silks, polished buckles, deep-dyed plumes,butts of pistols, the soft gleam of leather.     A brave show indeed, Magnan commented approvingly. I confess theidea has merit.     The limousine pulled up with a squeal of brakes, stood on two fat-tiredwheels, gyros humming softly. The hatch popped up. A portly diplomatstepped out.     Why, Ambassador Nitworth, Magnan glowed. This is very kind of you.     Keep cool, Magnan, Nitworth said in a strained voice. We'll attemptto get you out of this.     He stepped past Magnan's out-stretched hand and looked hesitantly atthe ramrod-straight line of Qornt, eighty-five strong\u2014and beyond, atthe eighty-five tall Qornt dreadnaughts.     Good afternoon, sir ... ah, Your Excellency, Nitworth said, blinkingup at the leading Qornt. You are Commander of the Strike Force, Iassume?     Nope, the Qornt said shortly.     I ... ah ... wish to request seventy-two hours in which to evacuateHeadquarters, Nitworth plowed on.     Mr. Ambassador. Retief said. This\u2014     Don't panic, Retief. I'll attempt to secure your release, Nitworthhissed over his shoulder. Now\u2014     You will address our leader with more respect! the tall Qornt hooted,eyeing Nitworth ominously from eleven feet up.     Oh, yes indeed, sir ... your Excellency ... Commander. Now, about theinvasion\u2014     Mr. Secretary, Magnan tugged at Nitworth's sleeve.     In heaven's name, permit me to negotiate in peace! Nitworth snapped.He rearranged his features. Now your Excellency, we've arranged toevacuate Smorbrod, of course, just as you requested\u2014     Requested? the Qornt honked.     Ah ... demanded, that is. Quite rightly of course. Ordered.Instructed. And, of course, we'll be only too pleased to follow anyother instructions you might have.     You don't quite get the big picture, Mr. Secretary, Retief said.This isn't\u2014     Silence, confound you! Nitworth barked. The leading Qornt looked atRetief. He nodded. Two bony hands shot out, seized Nitworth and stuffeda length of bright pink silk into his mouth, then spun him around andheld him facing Retief.     If you don't mind my taking this opportunity to brief you, Mr.Ambassador, Retief said blandly. I think I should mention that thisisn't an invasion fleet. These are the new recruits for the PeaceEnforcement Corps.     Magnan stepped forward, glanced at the gag in Ambassador Nitworth'smouth, hesitated, then cleared his throat. We felt, he said, thatthe establishment of a Foreign Brigade within the P. E. Corps structurewould provide the element of novelty the Department has requestedin our recruiting, and at the same time would remove the stigma ofTerrestrial chauvinism from future punitive operations.     Nitworth stared, eyes bulging. He grunted, reaching for the gag, caughtthe Qornt's eye on him, dropped his hands to his sides.     I suggest we get the troops in out of the hot sun, Retief said.Magnan edged close. What about the gag? he whispered.     Let's leave it where it is for a while, Retief murmured. It may saveus a few concessions.  "

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in DUST UNTO DUST?",
        "Summary_1": "The story opens with Rodney, Martin and Wass landing on a foreign planet and overlooking an abandoned metal city where the inhabitants supposedly died more than a million years ago. They had thirteen hours to explore before they must return to their mother ship.\nThey notice a metal rim at the perimeter of the city that they must step over to enter, and continue in to explore. Wass must return to their \u201clifeboat\u201d spaceship to get a camera, but is unable to exit the city as the metal band they noticed coming in has turned into a dome-shaped shield over the entire city. They suspect it may be a radiation shield, and are suspicious that the wind they saw when landing and their inability to contact their home ship may indicate a tragedy took place as they arrived. \nThey find a control center of sorts with lots of knobs and levers, but do not engage with it for fear of not knowing what might happen. They all find the city somewhat familiar, but have no idea why. \nThey begin looking for where the water of the city comes from, since they may be able to find a way out of the city through its transport corridors. They all begin to start frightening each other with stories and seeing dust and objects move around in the dark. Rodney and Martin enter an underground tunnel through a hatch in the ground and Wass chooses not to follow them and instead leaves to return to the switchboard.\nAs Rodney and Martin discover a grate in the tunnel it begins to open for them. Wass delivers the message on the radio that he was able to do that from the control room, and then something attacks and kills him. Rodney and Martin escape to the outside of the dome to where others from their crew have come to their rescue. It is unclear whether Rodney and Martin ultimately live after they exit the tunnel.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Martin, Rodney, and Wass are the 11th expedition to arrive on this planet. However, with only 13 hours left before they need to depart, they are the first to discover the city tucked away on an island. They make their way to the malignant-looking, black buildings and step over a metal band to enter. They explore the city briefly, taking turns guessing at who lived here before and what everything meant. Martin asks for pictures, but Wass says he left the camera back in the lifeboat. He leaves to go retrieve it, while Martin and Rodney keep exploring. The buildings are surprisingly small and the doorways only reach their shoulders. Wass radios in to say that their is no exit, because a force field has sprung up around the city. They try and think of ways to escape, but they\u2019re not left with many options. They throw around the idea of an anti-radiation screen to protect the inhabitants. They decide to meet in the center of the city and explore one of the buildings to see if they can find an escape. \nAs they step in, they are all shocked at the interior architecture, which resembles a beehive. Rodney finds a switchboard, which they all fight over. Rodney and Wass want to try some switches and see if it will aid them in their escape, but Martin doesn\u2019t want to take such a big risk seeing as they still had eleven hours. They all pull their guns on each other, but the situation deescalates and they continue on their way. They travel down a ramp until they reach a flat wall. The dome was a force field on top, and then continued down with a metal surface. They went back up to the switchboard, until Wass stopped them. A glass case filled with seeds was to their left. They looked through it, but Martin stopped the boys from taking any out. Finally, at the switchboard with their weapons out, Martin tries to stop them from making any rash decisions as they still had nine hours. Rodney gets upset and impulsively flicks a switch. Martin tackles him before any more harm can be done. Wass realizes that there are water reservoirs under the city.  \nThey travel down again until they reach a hatch. It lifts up, and a coil slithers out. They quickly shut it, until Martin reasons that it\u2019s just dust. So he opens it again, and dust emerges. They throw down a rope with a flashlight and Martin heads down. Rodney follows after him, landing in the dust. Wass does not, however, and shuts the hatch above them. He thinks he will survive by the switchboard, not in the tunnels. Martin and Rodney travel for a few hours before reaching a closed grate. Wass laughs at them (only two hours left) and starts flicking switches. The grate suddenly opens, and they hear his screams. He is killed, but his sacrifice allowed the others to live. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Three men--Martin, Wass, and Rodney--are part of the crew of the eleventh inter-planetary expedition sent to explore a planet close to their own. Previous expeditions had not been able to locate the city said to be on the planet, but this crew has been successful where others have failed. The three men pilot a lifeboat to investigate the empty, metal city and only have thirteen hours to photograph and catalogue what they discover there before it will be too late to safely return to their planet. As they observe the city from a distance, they witness a large, dark cloud of wind and dust approaching the city. Approaching the city's borders, they discuss it is surrounded by a metal band, and in fact the entire city is made entirely of metal. Everything is a bit mysterious and even feels familiar to Martin. Who lived here? How did they see when it was dark outside? Did they crawl or walk? Were they a distant relative of their own species and experienced different evolutions? The men think about these things as they make their way through the city. Wass realizes he has forgotten his camera to take pictures and begins to muse that the city has a mind of its own. When he goes to retrieve his camera, the metal band bordering the town has unleashed a kind of force field, preventing Wass from leaving and effectively imprisoning the team. They wonder about the purpose of the wall--was it a defense mechanism against radiation used during some kind of war? The force field also prevents communication with their main ship, so they decide to make their way down into the city's depths to look for a way to escape. Once inside, they examine their surroundings and notice the architecture is the same smooth metal that formed the surface buildings and are arranged in a series of arches and corridors resembling a beehive. Rodney discovers a switchboard, which leads Martin to believe the whole city is some kind of machine or engine. After struggling to find a way out, Wass discovers a bank of glass cases filled with seeds. They return to the switchboard, and Rodney wants to flip one of the switches, since time is running out, but Martin punches him down to stop him. Then Martin to theorize there must be a water reservoir nearby. They move further into the depths and discover a hatch, inside of which is a sea of dust. Rodney and Martin follow the sea to a metal grate exit, but Wass stays behind. He flips a switch and is killed, but the metal grate opens and Rodney and Martin are freed.",
        "Summary_4": "The story takes place on a planet in the same star system as Earth, where the crew of the thirteenth flight to the planet is exploring. There are three scout ships, and the story focuses on one, with the crew of Rodney, Martin, and Wass. They see what they think is the only city on the planet, never before discussed by other crews, and approach it to investigate. They are struck by its darkness, both in the lack of light as well as the dark metal that makes up most of the structures. They notice a metal band that surrounds the city, and step over it to continue onward. When Wass turns back to find the camera he left behind, he realizes he's trapped, and that the metal band turned into something akin to a glass wall. They can no longer contact their ship and need a way out. They figure their best bet is to go towards the center of the city and make their way down, in case they can dig out. They head down a magnificent ramp, dwarfed by the grand architecture of the city, and come across what looks like a switchboard. Martin threatens Rodney when he tried to reach for the switchboard and forces the group to keep walking, hoping that if the force-field is a dome that covers the top of the city, they might be able to find a way out by going under it. They are baffled by the huge structures in the city that seem to be supporting themselves, unsure of how the city keeps itself up. They eventually find the end of the city where all they see is a blank wall, so they head back towards the switchboard. Through all of this, Martin is seeing glimpses of familiarity in the city that he can't place. They find glass cases of seeds, which Martin warns Wass not to disturb - it's possible that these plants had grown outside the city at one point and they did not know what to expect if they were released. Rodney flips a random switch, which makes Martin tackle him, and they head to look for a water source or reservoir, continuing further downwards. Rodney finds a large metal disk with a wheel next to it, and Martin opens up the hatch. The group sees that whatever was inside is moving, shut the door out of fear, and eventually open it back up to take a closer look. A tentacle made of what looks like sparkling light particles swirls up into the area the men were standing in, and Martin and Rodney climb down the hatch, wading through the deep dust at the bottom, with Wass refusing to follow. Martin and Rodney eventually find an escape hatch, but they have to rely on Wass to open it for them from the switchboard. Wass dies screaming at whatever had broken glass behind him, and Martin and Rodney are rescued by the rest of their crew. ",

He saw the dull, black walls of buildings shouldering grimly into thetwilight sky, saw the sheared edge where the metal city ended and thebarren earth began ... and he remembered observing, even before theylanded, the too-strict geometry imposed on the entire construction.     He frowned. The first impression was ... malignant.     Wass, blond and slight, with enough nose for three or four men,unbuckled his safety belt and stood up. Shall we, gentlemen? and witha graceful movement of hand and arm he indicated the waiting city.     Martin led Wass, and the gangling, scarecrow-like Rodney, through thestillness overlaying the barren ground. There was only the twilightsky, and harsh and black against it, the convoluted earth. And thecity. Malignant. He wondered, again, what beings would choose to builda city\u2014even a city like this one\u2014in such surroundings.     The men from the ship knew only the surface facts about this waitinggeometric discovery. Theirs was the eleventh inter-planetary flight,and the previous ten, in the time allowed them for exploration whilethis planet was still close enough to their own to permit a safe returnin their ships, had not spotted the city. But the eleventh expeditionhad, an hour ago, with just thirteen hours left during which a returnflight could be safely started. So far as was known, this was the onlycity on the planet\u2014the planet without any life at all, save tinymosses, for a million years or more. And no matter which direction fromthe city a man moved, he would always be going north.     Hey, Martin! Rodney called through his helmet radio. Martin paused.Wind, Rodney said, coming abreast of him. He glanced toward the blackpile, as if sharing Martin's thoughts. That's all we need, isn't it?     Martin looked at the semi-transparent figures of wind and dustcavorting in the distance, moving toward them. He grinned a little,adjusting his radio. Worried?     Rodney's bony face was without expression. Gives me the creeps, kindof. I wonder what they were like?     Wass murmured, Let us hope they aren't immortal.     Three feet from the edge of the city Martin stopped and stubbed at thesand with the toe of his boot, clearing earth from part of a shiningmetal band.     Wass watched him, and then shoved aside more sand, several feet away.It's here, too.     Martin stood up. Let's try farther on. Rodney, radio the ship, tellthem we're going in.     Rodney nodded.     After a time, Wass said, Here, too. How far do you think it goes?     Martin shrugged. Clear around the city? I'd like to know what itis\u2014was\u2014for.     Defense, Rodney, several yards behind, suggested.     Could be, Martin said. Let's go in.     The three crossed the metal band and walked abreast down a street,their broad soft soled boots making no sound on the dull metal. Theypassed doors and arches and windows and separate buildings. They movedcautiously across five intersections. And they stood in a squaresurrounded by the tallest buildings in the city.     Rodney broke the silence, hesitantly. Not\u2014not very big. Is it?     Wass looked at him shrewdly. Neither were the\u2014well, shall we callthem, people? Have you noticed how low everything is?     Rodney's laughter rose, too. Then, sobering\u2014Maybe they crawled.     A nebulous image, product of childhood's vivid imagination, movedslowly across Martin's mind. All right! he rapped out\u2014and the imagefaded.     Sorry, Rodney murmured, his throat working beneath his lantern jaw.Then\u2014I wonder what it's like here in the winter when there's no lightat all?     I imagine they had illumination of some sort, Martin answered, dryly.If we don't hurry up and get through this place and back to the ship,we're very likely to find out.     Rodney said quickly, I mean outside.     Out there, too, Rodney, they must have had illumination. Martinlooked back along the straight, metal street they'd walked on, and pastthat out over the bleak, furrowed slopes where the ship's lifeboatlay ... and he thought everything outside the city seemed, somehow,from here, a little dim, a little hazy.     He straightened his shoulders. The city was alien, of course, and thatexplained most of it ... most of it. But he felt the black city wassomething familiar, yet twisted and distorted.     Well, Wass said, his nose wrinkling a bit, now that we're here....     Pictures, Martin decided. We have twelve hours. We'll start here.What's the matter, Wass?     The blond man grinned ruefully. I left the camera in the lifeboat.There was a pause. Then Wass, defensively\u2014It's almost as if the citydidn't want to be photographed.     Martin ignored the remark. Go get it. Rodney and I will be somewherealong this street.     Wass turned away. Martin and Rodney started slowly down the wide metalstreet, at right angles to their path of entrance.     Again Martin felt a tug of twisted, distorted familiarity. It wasalmost as if ... they were human up to a certain point, the pointbeing, perhaps, some part of their minds.... Alien things, dark andsubtle, things no man could ever comprehend.     Parallel evolution on two inner planets of the same system? Somewhere,sometime, a common ancestor? Martin noted the shoulder-high doors, theheavier gravity, remembered the inhabitants of the city vanished beforethe thing that was to become man ever emerged from the slime, and hedecided to grin at himself, at his own imagination.     Rodney jerked his scarecrow length about quickly, and a chill sped upMartin's spine. What's the matter?     The bony face was white, the gray eyes were wide. I saw\u2014I thought Isaw\u2014something\u2014moving\u2014     Anger rose in Martin. You didn't, he said flatly, gripping theother's shoulder cruelly. You couldn't have. Get hold of yourself,man!     Rodney stared. The wind. Remember? There isn't any, here.     ... How could there be? The buildings protect us now. It was blowingfrom the other direction.     Rodney wrenched free of Martin's grip. He gestured wildly. That\u2014     Martin! Wass' voice came through the receivers in both their radios.Martin, I can't get out!   <doc-sep> Carpenter rubbed modestly gloved hands together. I have no immediatebusiness, so supposing I start showing you the sights. What would youlike to see first, Mr. Frey? Or would you prefer a nice, restful movid?     Frankly, Michael admitted, the first thing I'd like to do is getmyself something to eat. I didn't have any breakfast and I'm famished.Two small creatures standing close to him giggled nervously andscuttled off on six legs apiece.     Shh, not so loud! There are females present. Carpenter drew theyouth to a secluded corner. Don't you know that on Theemim it'sfrightfully vulgar to as much as speak of eating in public?     But why? Michael demanded in too loud a voice. What's wrong witheating in public here on Earth?     Carpenter clapped a hand over the young man's mouth. Hush, hecautioned. After all, on Earth there are things we don't do or evenmention in public, aren't there?     Well, yes. But those are different.     Not at all. Those rules might seem just as ridiculous to a Theemimian.But the Theemimians have accepted our customs just as we have acceptedthe Theemimians'. How would you like it if a Theemimian violatedone of our tabus in public? You must consider the feelings of theTheemimians as equal to your own. Observe the golden rule: 'Do untoextraterrestrials as you would be done by.'     But I'm still hungry, Michael persisted, modulating his voice,however, to a decent whisper. Do the proprieties demand that I starveto death, or can I get something to eat somewhere?     Naturally, the salesman whispered back. Portyork provides for allbodily needs. Numerous feeding stations are conveniently locatedthroughout the port, and there must be some on the field.     After gazing furtively over his shoulder to see that no females werewatching, Carpenter approached a large map of the landing field andpressed a button. A tiny red light winked demurely for an instant.     That's the nearest one, Carpenter explained.   <doc-sep> After a time he said, Rodney, Wass, it's dust, down there. Rememberthe wind? Air currents are moving it.     Rodney sat down on the metal flooring. For a long time he said nothing.Then\u2014It wasn't.... Why did you close the hatch then?     Martin did not say he thought the other two would have shot him,otherwise. He said merely, At first I wasn't sure myself.     Rodney stood up, backing away from the closed hatch. He held his gunloosely, and his hand shook. Then prove it. Open it again.     Martin went to the wheel. He noticed Wass was standing behind Rodneyand he, too, had drawn his gun.     The hatch rose again at Martin's direction. He stood beside it,outlined in the light of two torches.     For a little while he was alone.     Then\u2014causing a gasp from Wass, a harsh expletive from Rodney\u2014atenuous, questing alien limb edged through the hatch, curling aboutMartin, sparkling in ten thousand separate particles in the torchlight,obscuring the dimly seen backdrop of geometrical processions of strangeobjects.       Martin raised an arm, and the particles swirled in stately, shimmeringspirals.     Rodney leaned forward and looked over the edge of the hatch. He saidnothing. He eyed the sparkling particles swirling about Martin, andnow, himself.     How deep, Wass said, from his safe distance.     We'll have to lower a flashlight, Martin answered.     Rodney, all eagerness to be of assistance now, lowered a rope with atorch swinging wildly on the end of it.     The torch came to rest about thirty feet down. It shone on gentlyrolling mounds of fine, white stuff.     Martin anchored the rope soundly, and paused, half across the lipof the hatch to stare coldly at Wass. You'd rather monkey with theswitches and blow yourself to smithereens?     Wass sighed and refused to meet Martin's gaze. Martin looked at himdisgustedly, and then began to descend the rope, slowly, peering intothe infinite, sparkling darkness pressing around him. At the bottomof the rope he sank to his knees in dust, and then was held even. Hestamped his feet, and then, as well as he was able, did a standingjump. He sank no farther than his knees.     He sighted a path parallel with the avenue above, toward the nearestedge of the city. I think we'll be all right, he called out, as longas we avoid the drifts.     Rodney began the descent. Looking up, Martin saw Wass above Rodney.     All right, Wass, Martin said quietly, as Rodney released the rope andsank into the dust.     Not me, the answer came back quickly. You two fools go your way,I'll go mine.     Wass!     There was no answer. The light faded swiftly away from the opening.     The going was hard. The dust clung like honey to their feet, and eddiedand swirled about them until the purifying systems in their suits werehard-pressed to remove the fine stuff working in at joints and valves.     Are we going straight? Rodney asked.     Of course, Martin growled.     There was silence again, the silence of almost-exhausted determination.The two men lifted their feet out of the dust, and then laboriouslyplunged forward, to sink again to the knees, repeated the act, timeswithout number.     Then Wass broke his silence, taunting. The ship leaves in two hours,Martin. Two hours. Hear me, Rodney?     Martin pulled his left foot from the sand and growled deep in histhroat. Ahead, through the confusing patterns of the sparkling dust,his flashlight gleamed against metal. He grabbed Rodney's arm, pointed.     A grate.     Rodney stared. Wass! he shouted. We've found a way out!     Their radios recorded Wass' laughter. I'm at the switchboard now,Martin. I\u2014     There was a tinkle of breaking glass, breaking faceplate.     The grate groaned upward and stopped.     Wass babbled incoherently into the radio for a moment, and then hebegan to scream.     Martin switched off his radio, sick.     He turned it on again when they reached the opening in the metal wall.Well?     I've been trying to get you, Rodney said, frantically. Why didn'tyou answer?     We couldn't do anything for him.     Rodney's face was white and drawn. But he did this for us.     So he did, Martin said, very quietly.     Rodney said nothing.     Then Martin said, Did you listen until the end?     Rodney nodded, jerkily. He pulled three more switches. I couldn'tunderstand it all. But\u2014Martin, dying alone like that in a place likethis\u2014!     Martin crawled into the circular pipe behind the grate. It tilted uptoward the surface. Come on, Rodney. Last lap.     An hour later they surfaced about two hundred yards away from theedge of the city. Behind them the black pile rose, the dome of forceshimmering, almost invisible, about it.     Ahead of them were the other two scoutships from the mother ship.Martin called out faintly, pulling Rodney out of the pipe. Crew membersstanding by the scoutships, and at the edge of the city, began to runtoward them.     Radio picked you up as soon as you entered the pipe, someone said. Itwas the last thing Martin heard before he collapsed.   "

        "Query": "How does Wass's fate unfold in the story DUST UNTO DUST?",
        "Summary_1": "Wass is an equal part of the exploration party with Rodney and Martin until he has had enough and parts ways with them when they enter an underground passageway filled with dust. Wass instead returns to the switchboard and pulls a series of levers that allows Rodney and Martin to escape from the city through the underground tunnels - saving their lives. Wass ultimately dies at the switchboard, though it is not clear what kills him. ",
        "Summary_2": "Wass is one of the explorers sent out to further investigate this planet. He is a photographer and is the first to realize that they are trapped within the city\u2019s screen. Wass, Martin, and Rodney all try and figure out a way to get out, who these aliens were, and what they\u2019re going to do, but quickly their relationship begins to deteriorate. Wass and Rodney turn against Martin fairly quickly, as they are so desperate to escape that they aren\u2019t willing to further explore all options. \nWass meets Martin and Rodney in the center of the city before travelling into one of the buildings. They find a switchboard there, which he is in favor of messing with, but Martin persuades him otherwise. Wass continually points his weapon at Martin and forces him to perfom dangerous tasks first. He discovers the seed bank, which Martin cautions the rest of the crew not to touch. When Rodney and Martin land in the tunnels, Wass shuts the hatch above them and runs back to the switchboard. He taunts them with the time and how many hours left. He believes he will escape by flicking switches on the switchboard, and that Rodney and Martin will die in the tunnels. However, his flicking switches actually brought about Rodney and Martin\u2019s rescue, as the grate that they were stuck at opened. Wass dies after flicking three or four of the switches and his screams reverberate throughout their radio. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Not long after the three men enter the metal city, Wass senses that something is amiss. Something about the city's architecture reminds him of his nightmares and makes him feel uneasy. He worries they are trapped for good and will miss their return flight when a force field surrounding the city prevents him from returning to the lifeboat to fetch his camera. Wass also appears to be very curious about the nature and physical attributes of the species that populated the city prior to their disappearance. He believes they must have been shorter due to the small stature of the buildings. Over time, he begins to show signs that he might believe the city and planet are in some way alive and have a will of their own. Perhaps it is this will that caused Wass to forget his camera. He is also very invested in mysterious geometric patterns they discover during their wanderings through the depths of the city, and he becomes extremely excited when he discovers a bank of glass cases which hold some kind of seeds. Wass wants to open them, but Martin warns him against this. The seeds might be some kind of plant or perhaps the offspring of the species that retired there. Whatever the case, Martin insists they attempt to find a water reservoir because it will likely lead to their escape. Wass refuses to follow them in, and instead stays behind to flip the switch that opens the grate that allows Martin and Rodney to escape. Wass is killed in a mysterious fashion.  ",
        "Summary_4": "Wass is one of the three men in his scout ship, a subset of the larger crew he is on a mission with. He is a slight blonde man with a large nose, and is in charge of the camera equipment in their group. He wanders into the city with Martin and Rodney, and when he realizes he left the camera behind, he is also faced with a new problem: there seems to be a glass barrier trapping him and his crewmates in the old city. He shouts into his radio to update the others, and they begin to brainstorm. The three of them travel through much of the city and some of the buildings trying to find a way out, and they eventually find a large hatch that Martin and Rodney jump into. Wass refuses to join, staying on top of the hatch, but once Rodney and Martin find a way out they realize the exit is covered in a metal grate. Wass had made it to the switchboard by then, and flips four switches which open the exit for Rodney and Martin to leave, but he screams into the radio after he starts this. Whatever it was with him must have killed him, but thanks to Wass, his crewmates made it out of the city alive to be rescued by the rest of the ship. ",

Well, Wass said, his nose wrinkling a bit, now that we're here....     Pictures, Martin decided. We have twelve hours. We'll start here.What's the matter, Wass?     The blond man grinned ruefully. I left the camera in the lifeboat.There was a pause. Then Wass, defensively\u2014It's almost as if the citydidn't want to be photographed.     Martin ignored the remark. Go get it. Rodney and I will be somewherealong this street.     Wass turned away. Martin and Rodney started slowly down the wide metalstreet, at right angles to their path of entrance.     Again Martin felt a tug of twisted, distorted familiarity. It wasalmost as if ... they were human up to a certain point, the pointbeing, perhaps, some part of their minds.... Alien things, dark andsubtle, things no man could ever comprehend.     Parallel evolution on two inner planets of the same system? Somewhere,sometime, a common ancestor? Martin noted the shoulder-high doors, theheavier gravity, remembered the inhabitants of the city vanished beforethe thing that was to become man ever emerged from the slime, and hedecided to grin at himself, at his own imagination.     Rodney jerked his scarecrow length about quickly, and a chill sped upMartin's spine. What's the matter?     The bony face was white, the gray eyes were wide. I saw\u2014I thought Isaw\u2014something\u2014moving\u2014     Anger rose in Martin. You didn't, he said flatly, gripping theother's shoulder cruelly. You couldn't have. Get hold of yourself,man!     Rodney stared. The wind. Remember? There isn't any, here.     ... How could there be? The buildings protect us now. It was blowingfrom the other direction.     Rodney wrenched free of Martin's grip. He gestured wildly. That\u2014     Martin! Wass' voice came through the receivers in both their radios.Martin, I can't get out!   <doc-sep> Wass moved silently through the darkness beyond the torches. We allhave guns, Martin.     I'm holding mine. Martin waited.     After a moment, Wass switched his flashlight back on. He said quietly,He's right, Rodney. It would be sure death to monkey around in here.     Well.... Rodney turned quickly toward the black arch. Let's get outof here, then!     Martin hung back waiting for the others to go ahead of him down themetal hall. At the other arch, where the ramp led downward, he called ahalt. If the dome, or whatever it is, is a radiation screen there mustbe at least half-a-dozen emergency exits around the city.     Rodney said, To search every building next to the dome clean aroundthe city would take years.     Martin nodded. But there must be central roads beneath this main levelleading to them. Up here there are too many roads.     Wass laughed rudely.     Have you a better idea?     Wass ignored that, as Martin hoped he would. He said slowly, Thatleads to another idea. If the band around the city is responsible forthe dome, does it project down into the ground as well?     You mean      dig     out? Martin asked.     Sure. Why not?     We're wearing heavy suits and bulky breathing units. We have noequipment.     That shouldn't be hard to come by.     Martin smiled, banishing Wass' idea.     Rodney said, They may have had their digging equipment built right into themselves.     Anyway, Martin decided, we can take a look down below.     In the pitch dark, Wass added.     Martin adjusted his torch, began to lead the way down the metal ramp.The incline was gentle, apparently constructed for legs shorter, feetperhaps less broad than their own. The metal, without mark of any sort,gleamed under the combined light of the torches, unrolling out of thedarkness before the men.     At length the incline melted smoothly into the next level of the city.     Martin shined his light upward, and the others followed his example.Metal as smooth and featureless as that on which they stood shone downon them.     Wass turned his light parallel with the floor, and then moved slowly ina circle. No supports. No supports anywhere. What keeps all that upthere?     I don't know. I have no idea. Martin gestured toward the ramp withhis light. Does all this, this whole place, look at all familiar toyou?     Rodney's gulp was clearly audible through the radio receivers. Here?     No, no, Martin answered impatiently, not just here. I mean the wholecity.     Yes, Wass said dryly, it does. I'm sure this is where all mynightmares stay when they're not on shift.     Martin turned on his heel and started down a metal avenue which, hethought, paralleled the street above. And Rodney and Wass followed himsilently. They moved along the metal, past unfamiliar shapes made moreso by gloom and moving shadows, past doors dancing grotesquely in thethree lights, past openings in the occasional high metal partitions,past something which was perhaps a conveyor belt, past anothersomething which could have been anything at all.     The metal street ended eventually in a blank metal wall.     The edge of the city\u2014the city which was a dome of force above and abowl of metal below.     After a long time, Wass sighed. Well, skipper...?     We go back, I guess, Martin said.     Rodney turned swiftly to face him. Martin thought the tall man washolding his gun. To the switchboard, Martin?     Unless someone has a better idea, Martin conceded. He waited. ButRodney was holding the gun ... and Wass was.... Then\u2014I can't think ofanything else.     They began to retrace their steps along the metal street, back pastthe same dancing shapes of metal, the partitions, the odd windows, alllooking different now in the new angles of illumination.     Martin was in the lead. Wass followed him silently. Rodney, tall,matchstick thin, even in his cumbersome suit, swayed with jauntytriumph in the rear.     Martin looked at the metal street lined with its metal objects and hesighed. He remembered how the dark buildings of the city looked atsurface level, how the city itself looked when they were landing, andthen when they were walking toward it. The dream was gone again fornow. Idealism died in him, again and again, yet it was always reborn.But\u2014The only city, so far as anyone knew, on the first planet they'dever explored. And it had to be like this. Nightmares, Wass said, andMartin thought perhaps the city was built by a race of beings who atsome point twisted away from their evolutionary spiral, plagued by asort of racial insanity.     No, Martin thought, shaking his head. No, that couldn't be.Viewpoint ... his viewpoint. It was the haunting sense of familiarity,a faint strain through all this broad jumble, the junkpile of alienmetal, which was making him theorize so wildly.     Then Wass touched his elbow. Look there, Martin. Left of the ramp.     Light from their torches was reflected, as from glass.     All right, Rodney said belligerently into his radio. What's holdingup the procession?     Martin was silent.     Wass undertook to explain. Why not, after all? Martin asked himself. Itwas in Wass' own interest. In a moment, all three were standing beforea bank of glass cases which stretched off into the distance as far asthe combined light of their torches would reach.     Seeds! Wass exclaimed, his faceplate pressed against the glass.     Martin blinked. He thought how little time they had. He wet his lips.     Wass' gloved hands fumbled awkwardly at a catch in the nearest sectionof the bank.     Martin thought of the dark, convoluted land outside the city. If theywouldn't grow there.... Or had they, once? Don't, Wass!     Torchlight reflected from Wass' faceplate as he turned his head. Whynot?     They were like children.... We don't know, released, what they'll do.     Skipper, Wass said carefully, if we don't get out of this place bythe deadline we may be eating these.     Martin raised his arm tensely. Opening a seed bank doesn't help usfind a way out of here. He started up the ramp. Besides, we've nowater.     Rodney came last up the ramp, less jaunty now, but still holding thegun. His mind, too, was taken up with childhood's imaginings. Fora plant to grow in this environment, it wouldn't need much water.Maybe\u2014 he had a vision of evil plants attacking them, growing withsuper-swiftness at the air valves and joints of their suits \u2014only thelittle moisture in the atmosphere.

        "Query": "In what location does the narrative of DUST UNTO DUST occur?",
        "Summary_1": "The story takes place on the surface of a planet that has an abandoned city made of metal. The city is spooky and the inhabitants supposedly died over a million years ago. However, they see things moving strangely while they are in the city suggesting it is inhabited, and something kills Wass within the city during the story.\nThey explore the metal streets of the city, a room with a large switchboard, and seven levels underground. Rodney and Martin explore an underground tunnel that eventually leads them out of the city and to the safety of their fellow crew. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Dust Unto Dust by Lyman D. Hinckley takes place on an island that had been previously explored. The ten previous groups never discovered the dull, black city on the island, but the eleventh did. This is presumably the only city on this planet that had not been inhabited for more than a million years. Only small mosses grew on the planet. \nThis city is made of insidious, black metal with similar architectural designs to modern earth. However, everything is shorter, presumably to make up for the inhabitant\u2019s shortened size. The character theorize that this city was under attack at one point, which would explain the anti-radiantion screen or force field that surrounds the entire city. Dull black streets twist and turn throughout the city and buildings rise up above them. \nOne of the buildings was designed almost like a beehive, many openings and arches and ways to escape. There were shetlers built underneath the city, again another sign of war. Beneath the shelters lay a series of tunnels that could have been used to bring water into the city. Now they are simply filled with dust. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The story takes place on an unnamed planet close to the home planet of the story\u2019s three main characters. Martin, Rodney, and Wass are part of the crew on the eleventh inter-planetary expedition that seeks to discover the mysteries of the unnamed metal city. The planet is covered with mostly barren earth that leads up to the black city. A large cloud of dust blows over the city, which is protected by a kind of force field after the protagonists enter. The city is entirely constructed with smooth, black metal; Wass notes how low the buildings are, which might indicate the size of the species that previously lived there. When the protagonists decide to go underneath the city to find a way to escape, they discover several levels of interlocking arches and corridors that resemble a massive beehive. The men travel between levels using a number of ramps, and when they arrive at the bottommost level, they discover a subterranean level filled with a knee-high, flowing current of sparkling dust. Rodney and Martin follow the current to a metal grate, which leads to the surface outside the city.",
        "Summary_4": "This story takes place on a planet that is in the same star system as Earth, where thirteen different exploratory missions have visited. The humans had not realized that there was a city on the planet, from previous missions, but there is a lone city that one of the scout ships encounters on this thirteenth mission. There is a lot of sand and dust with some wind in the planet's terrain in general, and the city sticks out as being constructed of large metal structures. Everything in the city is at a very large scale: the man traverse wide ramps that they find under tall arches, and inside of buildings the halls and rooms seem endless. It is even more frightening in that the city is shrouded in darkness because of the metal streets, and the travelers wonder how much scarier it would be in the wintertime when there wasn't natural light. The city has a large metal ring surrounding it that the men are able to walk over to enter the city, but after they do this a large force-field of sorts is triggered and the ring transforms into the base of this protective barrier. Whatever this barrier's original purpose is, it has the effect of keeping the humans from leaving the city and blocks out the wind. Much of the story happens in the lower levels of the city, passing a switchboard and a seed bank and eventually ending up in a reservoir that held the pipe that the surviving men escaped through.",
        "Article": "  DUST UNTO DUST     By LYMAN D. HINCKLEY     It was alien but was it dead, this towering, sinister     city of metal that glittered malignantly before the     cautious advance of three awed space-scouters.     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Planet Stories Summer 1955.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      Martin set the lifeboat down carefully, with all the attention oneusually exercises in a situation where the totally unexpected hasoccurred, and he and his two companions sat and stared in awed silenceat the city a quarter-mile away.     He saw the dull, black walls of buildings shouldering grimly into thetwilight sky, saw the sheared edge where the metal city ended and thebarren earth began ... and he remembered observing, even before theylanded, the too-strict geometry imposed on the entire construction.     He frowned. The first impression was ... malignant.     Wass, blond and slight, with enough nose for three or four men,unbuckled his safety belt and stood up. Shall we, gentlemen? and witha graceful movement of hand and arm he indicated the waiting city.     Martin led Wass, and the gangling, scarecrow-like Rodney, through thestillness overlaying the barren ground. There was only the twilightsky, and harsh and black against it, the convoluted earth. And thecity. Malignant. He wondered, again, what beings would choose to builda city\u2014even a city like this one\u2014in such surroundings.     The men from the ship knew only the surface facts about this waitinggeometric discovery. Theirs was the eleventh inter-planetary flight,and the previous ten, in the time allowed them for exploration whilethis planet was still close enough to their own to permit a safe returnin their ships, had not spotted the city. But the eleventh expeditionhad, an hour ago, with just thirteen hours left during which a returnflight could be safely started. So far as was known, this was the onlycity on the planet\u2014the planet without any life at all, save tinymosses, for a million years or more. And no matter which direction fromthe city a man moved, he would always be going north.     Hey, Martin! Rodney called through his helmet radio. Martin paused.Wind, Rodney said, coming abreast of him. He glanced toward the blackpile, as if sharing Martin's thoughts. That's all we need, isn't it?     Martin looked at the semi-transparent figures of wind and dustcavorting in the distance, moving toward them. He grinned a little,adjusting his radio. Worried?     Rodney's bony face was without expression. Gives me the creeps, kindof. I wonder what they were like?     Wass murmured, Let us hope they aren't immortal.     Three feet from the edge of the city Martin stopped and stubbed at thesand with the toe of his boot, clearing earth from part of a shiningmetal band.     Wass watched him, and then shoved aside more sand, several feet away.It's here, too.     Martin stood up. Let's try farther on. Rodney, radio the ship, tellthem we're going in.     Rodney nodded.     After a time, Wass said, Here, too. How far do you think it goes?     Martin shrugged. Clear around the city? I'd like to know what itis\u2014was\u2014for.     Defense, Rodney, several yards behind, suggested.     Could be, Martin said. Let's go in.     The three crossed the metal band and walked abreast down a street,their broad soft soled boots making no sound on the dull metal. Theypassed doors and arches and windows and separate buildings. They movedcautiously across five intersections. And they stood in a squaresurrounded by the tallest buildings in the city.     Rodney broke the silence, hesitantly. Not\u2014not very big. Is it?     Wass looked at him shrewdly. Neither were the\u2014well, shall we callthem, people? Have you noticed how low everything is?     Rodney's laughter rose, too. Then, sobering\u2014Maybe they crawled.     A nebulous image, product of childhood's vivid imagination, movedslowly across Martin's mind. All right! he rapped out\u2014and the imagefaded.     Sorry, Rodney murmured, his throat working beneath his lantern jaw.Then\u2014I wonder what it's like here in the winter when there's no lightat all?     I imagine they had illumination of some sort, Martin answered, dryly.If we don't hurry up and get through this place and back to the ship,we're very likely to find out.     Rodney said quickly, I mean outside.     Out there, too, Rodney, they must have had illumination. Martinlooked back along the straight, metal street they'd walked on, and pastthat out over the bleak, furrowed slopes where the ship's lifeboatlay ... and he thought everything outside the city seemed, somehow,from here, a little dim, a little hazy.     He straightened his shoulders. The city was alien, of course, and thatexplained most of it ... most of it. But he felt the black city wassomething familiar, yet twisted and distorted.

Again Martin felt a tug of twisted, distorted familiarity. It wasalmost as if ... they were human up to a certain point, the pointbeing, perhaps, some part of their minds.... Alien things, dark andsubtle, things no man could ever comprehend.     Parallel evolution on two inner planets of the same system? Somewhere,sometime, a common ancestor? Martin noted the shoulder-high doors, theheavier gravity, remembered the inhabitants of the city vanished beforethe thing that was to become man ever emerged from the slime, and hedecided to grin at himself, at his own imagination.     Rodney jerked his scarecrow length about quickly, and a chill sped upMartin's spine. What's the matter?     The bony face was white, the gray eyes were wide. I saw\u2014I thought Isaw\u2014something\u2014moving\u2014     Anger rose in Martin. You didn't, he said flatly, gripping theother's shoulder cruelly. You couldn't have. Get hold of yourself,man!     Rodney stared. The wind. Remember? There isn't any, here.     ... How could there be? The buildings protect us now. It was blowingfrom the other direction.     Rodney wrenched free of Martin's grip. He gestured wildly. That\u2014     Martin! Wass' voice came through the receivers in both their radios.Martin, I can't get out!   <doc-sep> Quickly, Roddie drew the hammer from his waist. Then, with weapon readyfor an instantaneous blow, he stretched his left hand through thedarkness. He touched something warm, softish. Gingerly he felt overthat curving surface for identifying features.     While Roddie investigated by touch, his long fingers were suddenlyseized and bitten. At the same time, his right shin received a savagekick. And his own retaliatory blow was checked in mid-swing by anunexpected voice.     Get your filthy hands off me! it whispered angrily. Who do you thinkyou are?     Startled, he dropped his hammer. I'm Roddie, he said, squatting tofumble for it. Who do you think      you     are?     I'm Ida, naturally! Just how many girls      are     there in this raidingparty?     His first Invader\u2014and he had dropped his weapon!     Scrabbling fearfully in the dust for his hammer, Roddie pausedsuddenly. This girl\u2014whatever      that     was\u2014seemed to think him one ofher own kind. There was a chance, not much, but worth taking, to turndelay to advantage. Maybe he could learn something of value before hekilled her. That would make the soldiers accept him!     He stalled, seeking a gambit. How would      I     know how many girls thereare?     Half expecting a blow, he got instead an apology. I'm sorry, the girlsaid. I should have known. Never even heard your name before, either.Roddie.... Whose boat did you come in, Roddie?     Boat? What was a boat? How would I know? he repeated, voice tightwith fear of discovery.     If she noticed the tension, she didn't show it. Certainly her whisperwas friendly enough. Oh, you're one of the fellows from Bodega, then.They shoved a boy into our boat at the last minute, too. Tough, wasn'tit, getting separated in the fog and tide like that? If only we didn'thave to use boats.... But, say, how are we going to get away from here?     I wouldn't know, Roddie said, closing his fingers on the hammer, andrising. How did you get in?     Followed your footprints. It was sundown and I saw human tracks in thedust and they led me here. Where were you?     Scouting around, Roddie said vaguely. How did you know I was a manwhen I came back?     Because you couldn't see me, silly! You know perfectly well theseandroids are heat-sensitive and can locate us in the dark!     Indeed he did know! Many times he'd felt ashamed that Molly could findhim whenever she wanted to, even here in the manhole. But perhaps themanhole would help him now to redeem himself....   <doc-sep> After a time he said, Rodney, Wass, it's dust, down there. Rememberthe wind? Air currents are moving it.     Rodney sat down on the metal flooring. For a long time he said nothing.Then\u2014It wasn't.... Why did you close the hatch then?     Martin did not say he thought the other two would have shot him,otherwise. He said merely, At first I wasn't sure myself.     Rodney stood up, backing away from the closed hatch. He held his gunloosely, and his hand shook. Then prove it. Open it again.     Martin went to the wheel. He noticed Wass was standing behind Rodneyand he, too, had drawn his gun.     The hatch rose again at Martin's direction. He stood beside it,outlined in the light of two torches.     For a little while he was alone.     Then\u2014causing a gasp from Wass, a harsh expletive from Rodney\u2014atenuous, questing alien limb edged through the hatch, curling aboutMartin, sparkling in ten thousand separate particles in the torchlight,obscuring the dimly seen backdrop of geometrical processions of strangeobjects.       Martin raised an arm, and the particles swirled in stately, shimmeringspirals.     Rodney leaned forward and looked over the edge of the hatch. He saidnothing. He eyed the sparkling particles swirling about Martin, andnow, himself.     How deep, Wass said, from his safe distance.     We'll have to lower a flashlight, Martin answered.     Rodney, all eagerness to be of assistance now, lowered a rope with atorch swinging wildly on the end of it.     The torch came to rest about thirty feet down. It shone on gentlyrolling mounds of fine, white stuff.     Martin anchored the rope soundly, and paused, half across the lipof the hatch to stare coldly at Wass. You'd rather monkey with theswitches and blow yourself to smithereens?     Wass sighed and refused to meet Martin's gaze. Martin looked at himdisgustedly, and then began to descend the rope, slowly, peering intothe infinite, sparkling darkness pressing around him. At the bottomof the rope he sank to his knees in dust, and then was held even. Hestamped his feet, and then, as well as he was able, did a standingjump. He sank no farther than his knees.     He sighted a path parallel with the avenue above, toward the nearestedge of the city. I think we'll be all right, he called out, as longas we avoid the drifts.     Rodney began the descent. Looking up, Martin saw Wass above Rodney.     All right, Wass, Martin said quietly, as Rodney released the rope andsank into the dust.     Not me, the answer came back quickly. You two fools go your way,I'll go mine.     Wass!     There was no answer. The light faded swiftly away from the opening.     The going was hard. The dust clung like honey to their feet, and eddiedand swirled about them until the purifying systems in their suits werehard-pressed to remove the fine stuff working in at joints and valves.     Are we going straight? Rodney asked.     Of course, Martin growled.     There was silence again, the silence of almost-exhausted determination.The two men lifted their feet out of the dust, and then laboriouslyplunged forward, to sink again to the knees, repeated the act, timeswithout number.     Then Wass broke his silence, taunting. The ship leaves in two hours,Martin. Two hours. Hear me, Rodney?     Martin pulled his left foot from the sand and growled deep in histhroat. Ahead, through the confusing patterns of the sparkling dust,his flashlight gleamed against metal. He grabbed Rodney's arm, pointed.     A grate.     Rodney stared. Wass! he shouted. We've found a way out!     Their radios recorded Wass' laughter. I'm at the switchboard now,Martin. I\u2014     There was a tinkle of breaking glass, breaking faceplate.     The grate groaned upward and stopped.     Wass babbled incoherently into the radio for a moment, and then hebegan to scream.     Martin switched off his radio, sick.     He turned it on again when they reached the opening in the metal wall.Well?     I've been trying to get you, Rodney said, frantically. Why didn'tyou answer?     We couldn't do anything for him.     Rodney's face was white and drawn. But he did this for us.     So he did, Martin said, very quietly.     Rodney said nothing.     Then Martin said, Did you listen until the end?     Rodney nodded, jerkily. He pulled three more switches. I couldn'tunderstand it all. But\u2014Martin, dying alone like that in a place likethis\u2014!     Martin crawled into the circular pipe behind the grate. It tilted uptoward the surface. Come on, Rodney. Last lap.     An hour later they surfaced about two hundred yards away from theedge of the city. Behind them the black pile rose, the dome of forceshimmering, almost invisible, about it.     Ahead of them were the other two scoutships from the mother ship.Martin called out faintly, pulling Rodney out of the pipe. Crew membersstanding by the scoutships, and at the edge of the city, began to runtoward them.     Radio picked you up as soon as you entered the pipe, someone said. Itwas the last thing Martin heard before he collapsed.   "

        "Query": "How do Rodney, Martin, and Wass interact with each other in DUST UNTO DUST?",
        "Summary_1": "They are bound by a sense of duty to the mission. However, when they are put in the predicament of being trapped under the dome, their bond begins to fray and they start fighting with each other about the best means of escape.\nRodney and Martin squabble, but both stick together in exploring an underground tunnel filled with dust while Wass elects to go his own way. Wass ultimately appears to sacrifice his life to save Rodney and Martin by returning to the switchboard and opening a grate that allows them to escape from the city. \n",
        "Summary_2": "As colleagues and explorers, at first their relationship is well-balanced and intellectually-stimulating. They bounce ideas off of each other about the city, the force field, and its inhabitants. However, as soon as they realize that they\u2019re stuck, their relationship begins to crumble. \nAs each man feels their self-preservation instincts rise, their banter becomes more and more tense. After Wass reveals that they are stuck inside of the city due to the dome surrounding it, all three meet back in the center to find another way out. This is where the great source of their conflict begins. They explore one of the buildings and find a switchboard in it relatively quickly. Rodney and Wass want to flick some switches and see what happens, but Martin disagrees. They all pull their guns on each other, until Martin can convince them to only use the switchboard as a last resort. Over the course of the story, Rodney and Wass continually make Martin do things first, whether that be leading them on paths or travelling down the hatch. Wass and Rodney would often pull their guns out on him too, but Martin stayed relatively calm. \nAfter the discovery of the tunnel system, Rodney follows Martin down the hatch, but Wass shuts them in. He makes his way back to the switchboard, certain that his way is right and theirs is wrong. Although their relationship was pretty strong at first, their survival instinct, genuine fear, and malignant nature of the city all played a part to further divide the three. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Martin seems to be the de facto leader of the group, guiding them through the important decisions that lead them through the city. Rodney and Wass oscillate between being obedient followers and fearful, panicky crewmates who want to think and act independently. Wass has a stronger connection to the metaphysical elements of the metal city and seems to remember the place from his nightmares. He has an intense curiosity about the patterns he discovers in the metal architecture as well as the seeds he discovers in the glass cases. Martin is often impatient with his two crewmembers, particularly Rodney, whom he punches in the face and knocks to the ground to prevent him from flipping switches on the switchboard they discover. He also seems disgusted by Wass when he refuses to follow them into the dust current. Wass sacrifices himself to save his fellow crewmembers, although his death is shrouded in mystery.",
        "Summary_4": "Martin is clearly in charge, though he does not have a gentle hand. He threatens his crewmates frequently, putting them at gunpoint at multiple times throughout the story. Although it was Rodney who found the hatch that would get them out, Martin was the one who did the honors to open it, after shooting down the other ideas that the crew had including using the switchboard. Rodney wants to get things moving quickly, and wants to use the switchboard to try for a way out, but this is when Martin pulls a gun on him. Rodney also flips a random switch which makes Martin tackle him, so it seems that their dynamic is focused on Rodney doing reckless things and Martin wanting to get his way while trying to survive. Wass offers ideas to the other throughout their journey but he does not seem to be taken seriously, asking many general questions as he tries to interpret what is happening to him. However, it is Wass that got Rodney and Martin out in the end. ",
        "Article": "After a time he said, Rodney, Wass, it's dust, down there. Rememberthe wind? Air currents are moving it.     Rodney sat down on the metal flooring. For a long time he said nothing.Then\u2014It wasn't.... Why did you close the hatch then?     Martin did not say he thought the other two would have shot him,otherwise. He said merely, At first I wasn't sure myself.     Rodney stood up, backing away from the closed hatch. He held his gunloosely, and his hand shook. Then prove it. Open it again.     Martin went to the wheel. He noticed Wass was standing behind Rodneyand he, too, had drawn his gun.     The hatch rose again at Martin's direction. He stood beside it,outlined in the light of two torches.     For a little while he was alone.     Then\u2014causing a gasp from Wass, a harsh expletive from Rodney\u2014atenuous, questing alien limb edged through the hatch, curling aboutMartin, sparkling in ten thousand separate particles in the torchlight,obscuring the dimly seen backdrop of geometrical processions of strangeobjects.       Martin raised an arm, and the particles swirled in stately, shimmeringspirals.     Rodney leaned forward and looked over the edge of the hatch. He saidnothing. He eyed the sparkling particles swirling about Martin, andnow, himself.     How deep, Wass said, from his safe distance.     We'll have to lower a flashlight, Martin answered.     Rodney, all eagerness to be of assistance now, lowered a rope with atorch swinging wildly on the end of it.     The torch came to rest about thirty feet down. It shone on gentlyrolling mounds of fine, white stuff.     Martin anchored the rope soundly, and paused, half across the lipof the hatch to stare coldly at Wass. You'd rather monkey with theswitches and blow yourself to smithereens?     Wass sighed and refused to meet Martin's gaze. Martin looked at himdisgustedly, and then began to descend the rope, slowly, peering intothe infinite, sparkling darkness pressing around him. At the bottomof the rope he sank to his knees in dust, and then was held even. Hestamped his feet, and then, as well as he was able, did a standingjump. He sank no farther than his knees.     He sighted a path parallel with the avenue above, toward the nearestedge of the city. I think we'll be all right, he called out, as longas we avoid the drifts.     Rodney began the descent. Looking up, Martin saw Wass above Rodney.     All right, Wass, Martin said quietly, as Rodney released the rope andsank into the dust.     Not me, the answer came back quickly. You two fools go your way,I'll go mine.     Wass!     There was no answer. The light faded swiftly away from the opening.     The going was hard. The dust clung like honey to their feet, and eddiedand swirled about them until the purifying systems in their suits werehard-pressed to remove the fine stuff working in at joints and valves.     Are we going straight? Rodney asked.     Of course, Martin growled.     There was silence again, the silence of almost-exhausted determination.The two men lifted their feet out of the dust, and then laboriouslyplunged forward, to sink again to the knees, repeated the act, timeswithout number.     Then Wass broke his silence, taunting. The ship leaves in two hours,Martin. Two hours. Hear me, Rodney?     Martin pulled his left foot from the sand and growled deep in histhroat. Ahead, through the confusing patterns of the sparkling dust,his flashlight gleamed against metal. He grabbed Rodney's arm, pointed.     A grate.     Rodney stared. Wass! he shouted. We've found a way out!     Their radios recorded Wass' laughter. I'm at the switchboard now,Martin. I\u2014     There was a tinkle of breaking glass, breaking faceplate.     The grate groaned upward and stopped.     Wass babbled incoherently into the radio for a moment, and then hebegan to scream.     Martin switched off his radio, sick.     He turned it on again when they reached the opening in the metal wall.Well?     I've been trying to get you, Rodney said, frantically. Why didn'tyou answer?     We couldn't do anything for him.     Rodney's face was white and drawn. But he did this for us.     So he did, Martin said, very quietly.     Rodney said nothing.     Then Martin said, Did you listen until the end?     Rodney nodded, jerkily. He pulled three more switches. I couldn'tunderstand it all. But\u2014Martin, dying alone like that in a place likethis\u2014!     Martin crawled into the circular pipe behind the grate. It tilted uptoward the surface. Come on, Rodney. Last lap.     An hour later they surfaced about two hundred yards away from theedge of the city. Behind them the black pile rose, the dome of forceshimmering, almost invisible, about it.     Ahead of them were the other two scoutships from the mother ship.Martin called out faintly, pulling Rodney out of the pipe. Crew membersstanding by the scoutships, and at the edge of the city, began to runtoward them.     Radio picked you up as soon as you entered the pipe, someone said. Itwas the last thing Martin heard before he collapsed.    <doc-sep>   DUST UNTO DUST     By LYMAN D. HINCKLEY     It was alien but was it dead, this towering, sinister     city of metal that glittered malignantly before the     cautious advance of three awed space-scouters.     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Planet Stories Summer 1955.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      Martin set the lifeboat down carefully, with all the attention oneusually exercises in a situation where the totally unexpected hasoccurred, and he and his two companions sat and stared in awed silenceat the city a quarter-mile away.     He saw the dull, black walls of buildings shouldering grimly into thetwilight sky, saw the sheared edge where the metal city ended and thebarren earth began ... and he remembered observing, even before theylanded, the too-strict geometry imposed on the entire construction.     He frowned. The first impression was ... malignant.     Wass, blond and slight, with enough nose for three or four men,unbuckled his safety belt and stood up. Shall we, gentlemen? and witha graceful movement of hand and arm he indicated the waiting city.     Martin led Wass, and the gangling, scarecrow-like Rodney, through thestillness overlaying the barren ground. There was only the twilightsky, and harsh and black against it, the convoluted earth. And thecity. Malignant. He wondered, again, what beings would choose to builda city\u2014even a city like this one\u2014in such surroundings.     The men from the ship knew only the surface facts about this waitinggeometric discovery. Theirs was the eleventh inter-planetary flight,and the previous ten, in the time allowed them for exploration whilethis planet was still close enough to their own to permit a safe returnin their ships, had not spotted the city. But the eleventh expeditionhad, an hour ago, with just thirteen hours left during which a returnflight could be safely started. So far as was known, this was the onlycity on the planet\u2014the planet without any life at all, save tinymosses, for a million years or more. And no matter which direction fromthe city a man moved, he would always be going north.     Hey, Martin! Rodney called through his helmet radio. Martin paused.Wind, Rodney said, coming abreast of him. He glanced toward the blackpile, as if sharing Martin's thoughts. That's all we need, isn't it?     Martin looked at the semi-transparent figures of wind and dustcavorting in the distance, moving toward them. He grinned a little,adjusting his radio. Worried?     Rodney's bony face was without expression. Gives me the creeps, kindof. I wonder what they were like?     Wass murmured, Let us hope they aren't immortal.     Three feet from the edge of the city Martin stopped and stubbed at thesand with the toe of his boot, clearing earth from part of a shiningmetal band.     Wass watched him, and then shoved aside more sand, several feet away.It's here, too.     Martin stood up. Let's try farther on. Rodney, radio the ship, tellthem we're going in.     Rodney nodded.     After a time, Wass said, Here, too. How far do you think it goes?     Martin shrugged. Clear around the city? I'd like to know what itis\u2014was\u2014for.     Defense, Rodney, several yards behind, suggested.     Could be, Martin said. Let's go in.     The three crossed the metal band and walked abreast down a street,their broad soft soled boots making no sound on the dull metal. Theypassed doors and arches and windows and separate buildings. They movedcautiously across five intersections. And they stood in a squaresurrounded by the tallest buildings in the city.     Rodney broke the silence, hesitantly. Not\u2014not very big. Is it?     Wass looked at him shrewdly. Neither were the\u2014well, shall we callthem, people? Have you noticed how low everything is?     Rodney's laughter rose, too. Then, sobering\u2014Maybe they crawled.     A nebulous image, product of childhood's vivid imagination, movedslowly across Martin's mind. All right! he rapped out\u2014and the imagefaded.     Sorry, Rodney murmured, his throat working beneath his lantern jaw.Then\u2014I wonder what it's like here in the winter when there's no lightat all?     I imagine they had illumination of some sort, Martin answered, dryly.If we don't hurry up and get through this place and back to the ship,we're very likely to find out.     Rodney said quickly, I mean outside.     Out there, too, Rodney, they must have had illumination. Martinlooked back along the straight, metal street they'd walked on, and pastthat out over the bleak, furrowed slopes where the ship's lifeboatlay ... and he thought everything outside the city seemed, somehow,from here, a little dim, a little hazy.     He straightened his shoulders. The city was alien, of course, and thatexplained most of it ... most of it. But he felt the black city wassomething familiar, yet twisted and distorted.     Well, Wass said, his nose wrinkling a bit, now that we're here....     Pictures, Martin decided. We have twelve hours. We'll start here.What's the matter, Wass?     The blond man grinned ruefully. I left the camera in the lifeboat.There was a pause. Then Wass, defensively\u2014It's almost as if the citydidn't want to be photographed.     Martin ignored the remark. Go get it. Rodney and I will be somewherealong this street.     Wass turned away. Martin and Rodney started slowly down the wide metalstreet, at right angles to their path of entrance.     Again Martin felt a tug of twisted, distorted familiarity. It wasalmost as if ... they were human up to a certain point, the pointbeing, perhaps, some part of their minds.... Alien things, dark andsubtle, things no man could ever comprehend.     Parallel evolution on two inner planets of the same system? Somewhere,sometime, a common ancestor? Martin noted the shoulder-high doors, theheavier gravity, remembered the inhabitants of the city vanished beforethe thing that was to become man ever emerged from the slime, and hedecided to grin at himself, at his own imagination.     Rodney jerked his scarecrow length about quickly, and a chill sped upMartin's spine. What's the matter?     The bony face was white, the gray eyes were wide. I saw\u2014I thought Isaw\u2014something\u2014moving\u2014     Anger rose in Martin. You didn't, he said flatly, gripping theother's shoulder cruelly. You couldn't have. Get hold of yourself,man!     Rodney stared. The wind. Remember? There isn't any, here.     ... How could there be? The buildings protect us now. It was blowingfrom the other direction.     Rodney wrenched free of Martin's grip. He gestured wildly. That\u2014     Martin! Wass' voice came through the receivers in both their radios.Martin, I can't get out!   <doc-sep> They stood before the switchboard again. Martin and Wass side by side,Rodney, still holding his gun, slightly to the rear.     Rodney moved forward a little toward the switches. His breathing wasloud and rather uneven in the radio receivers.     Martin made a final effort. Rodney, it's still almost nine hours totake off. Let's search awhile first. Let this be a last resort.     Rodney jerked his head negatively. No. Now, I know you, Martin.Postpone and postpone until it's too late, and the ship leaves withoutus and we're stranded here to eat seeds and gradually dehydrateourselves and God only knows what else and\u2014     He reached out convulsively and yanked a switch.     Martin leaped, knocking him to the floor. Rodney's gun skittered awaysilently, like a live thing, out of the range of the torches.     The radio receivers impersonally recorded the grating sounds ofRodney's sobs.     Sorry, Martin said, without feeling. He turned quickly. Wass?     The slight, blond man stood unmoving. I'm with you, Martin, but, asa last resort it might be better to be blown sky high than to diegradually\u2014     Martin was watching Rodney, struggling to get up. I agree. As a lastresort. We still have a little time.     Rodney's tall, spare figure looked bowed and tired in the torchlight,now that he was up again. Martin, I\u2014     Martin turned his back. Skip it, Rodney, he said gently.     Water, Wass said thoughtfully. There must be reservoirs under thiscity somewhere.     Rodney said, How does water help us get out?     Martin glanced at Wass, then started out of the switchboard room, notlooking back. It got in and out of the city some way. Perhaps we canleave the same way.     Down the ramp again.     There's another ramp, Wass murmured.     Rodney looked down it. I wonder how many there are, all told.     Martin placed one foot on the metal incline. He angled his torch down,picking out shadowy, geometrical shapes, duplicates of the ones on thepresent level. We'll find out, he said, how many there are.     Eleven levels later Rodney asked, How much time have we now?     Seven hours, Wass said quietly, until take-off.     One more level, Martin said, ignoring the reference to time. I ...think it's the last.     They walked down the ramp and stood together, silent in a dim pool ofartificial light on the bottom level of the alien city.     Rodney played his torch about the metal figures carefully placed aboutthe floor. Martin, what if there are no reservoirs? What if there arecemeteries instead? Or cold storage units? Maybe the switch I pulled\u2014     Rodney! Stop it!     Rodney swallowed audibly. This place scares me....     The first time I was ever in a rocket, it scared me. I was thirteen.     This is different, Wass said. Built-in traps\u2014     They had a war, Martin said.     Wass agreed. And the survivors retired here. Why?     Martin said, They wanted to rebuild. Or maybe this was already builtbefore the war as a retreat. He turned impatiently. How should Iknow?     Wass turned, too, persistent. But the planet was through with them.     In a minute, Martin said, too irritably, we'll have a sentientplanet. From the corner of his eye he saw Rodney start at that. Knockit off, Wass. We're looking for reservoirs, you know.     They moved slowly down the metal avenue, between the twisted shadowshapes, looking carefully about them.     Rodney paused. We might not recognize one.     Martin urged him on. You know what a man-hole cover looks like. Headded dryly, Use your imagination.     They reached the metal wall at the end of the avenue and paused again,uncertain.     Martin swung his flashlight, illuminating the distorted metal shapes.     Wass said, All this had a purpose, once....     We'll disperse and search carefully, Martin said.     I wonder what the pattern was.     ... The reservoirs, Wass. The pattern will still be here for laterexpeditions to study. So will we if we don't find a way to get out.     Their radios recorded Rodney's gasp. Then\u2014Martin! Martin! I thinkI've found something!     Martin began to run. After a moment's hesitation, Wass swung in behindhim.     Here, Rodney said, as they came up to him, out of breath. Here. See?Right here.     Three flashlights centered on a dark, metal disk raised a foot or morefrom the floor.     Well, they had hands. With his torch Wass indicated a small wheel ofthe same metal as everything else in the city, set beside the disk.     From its design Martin assumed that the disk was meant to be graspedand turned. He wondered what precisely they were standing over.     Well, Skipper, are you going to do the honors?     Martin kneeled, grasped the wheel. It turned easily\u2014almost tooeasily\u2014rotating the disk as it turned.     Suddenly, without a sound, the disk rose, like a hatch, on a concealedhinge.     The three men, clad in their suits and helmets, grouped around thesix-foot opening, shining their torches down into the thing thatdrifted and eddied directly beneath them.     Rodney's sudden grip on Martin's wrist nearly shattered the bone.Martin! It's all alive! It's moving!     Martin hesitated long enough for a coil to move sinuously up toward theopening. Then he spun the wheel and the hatch slammed down.     He was shaking.  "

        "Query": "What was the crucial factor that enabled their getaway in DUST UNTO DUST?",
        "Summary_1": "Choosing to search underground for where water might enter and exit the city was an important step for them to find the tunnel that led to their escape. However, Wass\u2019 pulling levers at the switchboard was critical to opening the grate inside the tunnel that actually allowed them to leave. Otherwise, they did not have tools with them that would have likely allowed them to escape in time.\nIf Martin had not forced the team to join together when they were fighting over the control panel the first time, they likely may have never escaped as well.",
        "Summary_2": "After Rodney and Martin decided to escape through the tunnels, Wass stayed aboveground, taunting them. He thought his best chances were with the switchboard. While they traversed underground, he made his way back to the switchboard. With only two hours to spare, Rodney and Martin were faced with a closed grate. Wass came on through the radio, making fun of them, and then began to pull switches. Luckily enough, one of the switches he pulled activated the grate and it opened for them. Soon, they hear Wass screaming as he\u2019s dying. Martin and Rodney escape through the grate, which tunnels upward around 200 feet from the edge of the city. Because of Wass, they were able to escape alive. ",
        "Summary_3": "The discovery of the seeds leads Martin to assume there must be some kind of water source within the depths of the metal city, so they use the ramps to access the bottommost level. The team discovers a hatch there that opens to a sea of dust. Rodney and Martin lower themselves into the dust current, but Wass refuses to join them, choosing instead to stay in the city to test the switches Rodney had discovered earlier. Martin warns him that this is likely a death sentence, but Wass does not seem to care. Martin and Rodney follow the current to a metal grate, and Wass triggers the switch to open the gate. In doing so, he is killed in a mysterious fashion. Martin and Rodney crawl through a tunnel and surface outside the barrier of the metal city just in time to be picked up by their main ship before its return to their planet.",
        "Summary_4": "In order to escape the city, the men had to travel as far down as they could, looking for a reservoir that might have some kind of exit pathway. They do find a large hatch in the bottom of the building they are in, where Martin and Rodney jump into a deep pile of dust that they essentially wade through in order to make their way towards an exit. However, the pipe that they find to escape through is shut by a metal grate. Wass had never jumped through the hatch, and while standing at the switchboard, flipped four switches that raised the grate for them. Wass died while trying to open the escape route for his crewmates, but if it were not for him they would not have made it out alive.",

Martin did not say he thought the other two would have shot him,otherwise. He said merely, At first I wasn't sure myself.     Rodney stood up, backing away from the closed hatch. He held his gunloosely, and his hand shook. Then prove it. Open it again.     Martin went to the wheel. He noticed Wass was standing behind Rodneyand he, too, had drawn his gun.     The hatch rose again at Martin's direction. He stood beside it,outlined in the light of two torches.     For a little while he was alone.     Then\u2014causing a gasp from Wass, a harsh expletive from Rodney\u2014atenuous, questing alien limb edged through the hatch, curling aboutMartin, sparkling in ten thousand separate particles in the torchlight,obscuring the dimly seen backdrop of geometrical processions of strangeobjects.       Martin raised an arm, and the particles swirled in stately, shimmeringspirals.     Rodney leaned forward and looked over the edge of the hatch. He saidnothing. He eyed the sparkling particles swirling about Martin, andnow, himself.     How deep, Wass said, from his safe distance.     We'll have to lower a flashlight, Martin answered.     Rodney, all eagerness to be of assistance now, lowered a rope with atorch swinging wildly on the end of it.     The torch came to rest about thirty feet down. It shone on gentlyrolling mounds of fine, white stuff.     Martin anchored the rope soundly, and paused, half across the lipof the hatch to stare coldly at Wass. You'd rather monkey with theswitches and blow yourself to smithereens?     Wass sighed and refused to meet Martin's gaze. Martin looked at himdisgustedly, and then began to descend the rope, slowly, peering intothe infinite, sparkling darkness pressing around him. At the bottomof the rope he sank to his knees in dust, and then was held even. Hestamped his feet, and then, as well as he was able, did a standingjump. He sank no farther than his knees.     He sighted a path parallel with the avenue above, toward the nearestedge of the city. I think we'll be all right, he called out, as longas we avoid the drifts.     Rodney began the descent. Looking up, Martin saw Wass above Rodney.     All right, Wass, Martin said quietly, as Rodney released the rope andsank into the dust.     Not me, the answer came back quickly. You two fools go your way,I'll go mine.     Wass!     There was no answer. The light faded swiftly away from the opening.     The going was hard. The dust clung like honey to their feet, and eddiedand swirled about them until the purifying systems in their suits werehard-pressed to remove the fine stuff working in at joints and valves.     Are we going straight? Rodney asked.     Of course, Martin growled.     There was silence again, the silence of almost-exhausted determination.The two men lifted their feet out of the dust, and then laboriouslyplunged forward, to sink again to the knees, repeated the act, timeswithout number.     Then Wass broke his silence, taunting. The ship leaves in two hours,Martin. Two hours. Hear me, Rodney?     Martin pulled his left foot from the sand and growled deep in histhroat. Ahead, through the confusing patterns of the sparkling dust,his flashlight gleamed against metal. He grabbed Rodney's arm, pointed.     A grate.     Rodney stared. Wass! he shouted. We've found a way out!     Their radios recorded Wass' laughter. I'm at the switchboard now,Martin. I\u2014     There was a tinkle of breaking glass, breaking faceplate.     The grate groaned upward and stopped.     Wass babbled incoherently into the radio for a moment, and then hebegan to scream.     Martin switched off his radio, sick.     He turned it on again when they reached the opening in the metal wall.Well?     I've been trying to get you, Rodney said, frantically. Why didn'tyou answer?     We couldn't do anything for him.     Rodney's face was white and drawn. But he did this for us.     So he did, Martin said, very quietly.     Rodney said nothing.     Then Martin said, Did you listen until the end?     Rodney nodded, jerkily. He pulled three more switches. I couldn'tunderstand it all. But\u2014Martin, dying alone like that in a place likethis\u2014!     Martin crawled into the circular pipe behind the grate. It tilted uptoward the surface. Come on, Rodney. Last lap.     An hour later they surfaced about two hundred yards away from theedge of the city. Behind them the black pile rose, the dome of forceshimmering, almost invisible, about it.     Ahead of them were the other two scoutships from the mother ship.Martin called out faintly, pulling Rodney out of the pipe. Crew membersstanding by the scoutships, and at the edge of the city, began to runtoward them.     Radio picked you up as soon as you entered the pipe, someone said. Itwas the last thing Martin heard before he collapsed.    <doc-sep>   The Beast-Jewel of Mars     By V. E. THIESSEN     The city was strange, fantastic, beautiful.     He'd never been there before, yet already he     was a fabulous legend\u2014a dire, hateful legend.     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Planet Stories Spring 1955.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      He lay on his stomach, a lean man in faded one piece dungarees, and anodd metallic hat, peering over the side of the canal. Behind him thelittle winds sifted red dust into his collar, but he could not move; hecould only sit there with his gaze riveted on the spires and minaretsthat twinkled in the distance, far down the bottom of the canal.     One part of his mind said,      This is it, this is the fabled city ofMars. This is the beauty and the fantasy and the music of the legends,and I must go down there.     Yet somewhere deeper in his mind, deep inthe primal urges that kept him from death, the warning was taut andurgent.      Get away. They have a part of your mind now. Get away from thecity before you lose it all. Get away before your body becomes a husk,a soulless husk to walk the low canals with sightless eyes, like thosewho came before you.       He strained to push back from the edge, trying to get that fantasticbeauty out of his sight. He fought the lids of his eyes, fought toclose them while he pushed himself back, but they remained open,staring at the jeweled towers, and borne on the little winds the thinwail of music reached him, saying,      Come into the city, come down intothe fabled city     .     He slid over the edge, sliding down the sloping sides of the canal.The rough sandstone tore at his dungarees, tore at his elbow where ittouched but he did not feel the pain. His face was turned toward thetowers, and the sound of his breathing was less than human.     His feet caught a projecting bit of stone and were slowed for aninstant, so that he turned sideways and rolled on, down into the reddust bottom of the canal, to lie face down in the dust, with the chinstrap of the odd metallic hat cutting cruelly into his chin.     He lay there an instant, knowing that now he had a chance. With hisface down like this, and the dust smarting his eyes the image was gonefor an instant. He had to get away, he knew that. He had to mount thesides of the canal and never look back.     He told himself, I am Eric North, from Earth, the Third Planet of Sol,and this is not real.     He squirmed in the dust, feeling it bite his cheeks; he squirmed untilhe could get up and see nothing but the red sand stone walls of thecanal. He ran at the walls and clawed his way up like an animal in hishaste. He wouldn't look again.     The wind freshened and the tune of the music began to talk to him. Ittold of going barefoot over long streets of fur. It told of jewels, andwine, and women as fair as springtime. These and more were in the city,waiting for him to claim them.     He sobbed, and clawed forward. He stopped to rest, and slowly his headbegan to turn. He turned, and the spires and minarets twinkled at him,beautiful, soothing, stopping the tears that had welled down his cheeks.     When he reached the bottom of the canal he began to run toward the city.     When he came to the city there was a high wall around it, and a heavygate carved with lotus blossoms. He beat against the gate and cried,Oh! Let me in. Let me in to the city! The music was richer now, as ifit were everywhere, and the gate swung open without the faintest sound.     A sentinel stood before the opened gate at the end of a long bluestreet. He was dressed in red silk with his sleeves edged in blueleopard skin, and he wore a belt with a jeweled short sword. He drewthe sword from its scabbard, and bowed forward until the point of thesword touched the street of blue fur. He said, I give you the welcomeof my sword, and the welcome of the city. Speak your name so that itmay be set in the records of the dreamers.     The music sang, and the spires twinkled, and Eric said, I am EricNorth!     The sword point jerked, and the sentinel straightened. His face waswhite. He cried aloud, It is Eric the Bronze. It is Eric of theLegend. He whirled the sword aloft, and smashed it upon Eric's metalhat, and the hatred was a blue flame in his eyes.  "

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in MUCK MAN?",
        "Summary_1": "Asa Graybar is a biological engineer who studies keeping Slider eggs alive and he is accused of a crime at the opening of the story. He thinks he was framed by Tom Dorr, Hazeltyne\u2019s general manager.\nHe was offered one year as a \u201cchangeling\u201d on another planet or 5 years in rehabilitation on Earth. He elects to do the one year, and thinks that he will get into smuggling Slider eggs on Jordan\u2019s planet. Being a changeling is not a highly sought after line of work, but it pays well, and the people who do it have organs and body parts regenerated to better suit specialized tasks.\nAsa travels to Jordan\u2019s planet on a spaceship with a cellmate, Kershaw, who got caught stealing a Slider egg and is returning to serve more time. When they arrive they are both \u201cconverted\u201d into muck men, with the forms of frogs and scaly, pink skin. Their task is to collect Slider eggs and bring them back to the base which is watched over by a warden, Furston.\nAsa and Kershaw go out together for the first time into the mud so Kershaw can teach Asa how to find Slider eggs. They find one, and are immediately attacked by a Slider that disables one of Kershaw\u2019s legs. Kershaw calls for helicopters to come get them. Tom Dorr is operating the helicopter that comes to collect Kershaw in the field, and demands that Asa also give him the egg they found. Asa refuses to ensure his own safety that they would come back to get him as soon as they dropped off Kershaw.\nBack at the base Tom Dorr refuses to go back into the field to rescue Asa and gets into an argument with Harriet Hazeltyne (taking over charge of all operations for her father), and storms off. Harriet goes into the field to save Asa herself, but accidentally crashes the helicopter because she is not used to the double force of gravity. \nAsa is unable to right the helicopter, and they think it is unlikely they will be able to use its machine guns to keep them safe while the Sliders come to feed on the dead Slider they are near to in the night. They must get back to the base somehow, and the story ends with them contemplating how they might do this.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Asa Graybar is a biological engineer researching Slider eggs and was set up to be convicted of trying to steal one, most likely by Tom Dorr, the Hazeltyne company\u2019s general manager. Asa can serve five years in a rehabilitation clinic or one year working as a changeling on another planet. Asa chooses to work one year as a muck man on Jordan\u2019s Planet where the Slider eggs are harvested. Medical advancements allow doctors to adapt humans to work in the environments of the other planets, so Asa will have to undergo the change, making him a changeling. \n\tAsa travels to Jordan on a freighter but is kept locked up as a prisoner. His cellmate is Kershaw, a man who has worked as a muck man in the past. He loved Slider eggs so much that when he returned to Earth, he tried to steal a new one because they flashed so much more than the two-year-old egg that he could afford with his $9000 in earnings. Kershaw tells Asa that he thinks the slider egg flashes are the egg calling their mothers and explains how they handle the Sliders that attack when muck men remove an egg from the mud. \n\tOn Jordan, Asa has second thoughts but realizes that there is no turning back on becoming a changeling. Awakening after his transformation, Asa finds Kershaw waiting for him, and he helps Asa learn to hop rather than walk since they have the physical features of frogs now. Furston, the trusty/warden/parole officer, sends Kershaw to work and Asa for training. He also gives Asa some berries to eat that make him vomit; Furston tells him this is to make the point that everything that grows on the planet is poisonous, and Asa shouldn\u2019t get the idea that he can hide out until his term is up because he would starve to death. As he leaves, Asa sees two humans watching him from an observation tower and hops up to see who they are: Harriet Hazeltyne and Tom Dorr. \n\tFurston has Kershaw take Asa out to show him the ropes. Kershaw finds an egg, and Asa warns him to jump when he sees a Slider coming. Kershaw breaks a leg, and Asa manages to kill the Slider. When the helicopter arrives, Harriet and Tom Dorr are aboard. Asa refuses to give them the egg until he loads Kershaw. Then Dorr says there isn\u2019t room for Asa, and they will come back for him. Asa keeps the egg as insurance for them to return but later realizes that Dorr can come back later with another mucker.\n\tFinally, the helicopter returns, but it crashes. Harriet was flying it because Dorr refused to come back for Asa. She tells Asa that a dead Slider attracts other Sliders that will feed on it. Asa tries to upright the helicopter but can\u2019t, so they either have to stay and fight off the Sliders or try to make their way back to the facility.\n",
        "Summary_3": "At the start of the story, Asa Graybar has been convicted of a crime he believes he has been framed for: keeping a rare, fresh Slider egg in a lab. His options for punishment are five years in a \"social reorientation\" program or one year working on a different planet after modifying his body to function in a different environment. Asa's cellmate seems to think this is the much more dangerous option, but it's the one Asa chooses. The technology of the time allows for regeneration of cells, extending people's lives and allowing them to modify their anatomy to fit a different environment. Asa wants to go to Jordan's Planet specifically, and there is always need for workers there because it is dangerous, so he is able to get a post there. Kershaw, another convict, is on the same trip--he has done this work before. The two men are most interested in the eggs of a creature called a Slider. The eggs have beautiful clear shells and seem to discharge lightning, in a way the humans do not yet understand--being muck men on Jordan's Planet means hunting for these eggs. The eggs die over the course of four years, and Asa wants to find a way to preserve them--this would be a hit to the Hazeltyne monopoly, which Asa believes is the source of his being framed. After arriving on Jordan's Planet, Asa and Kershaw head to the conversion tanks and their bodies are modified to suit the planet. The result is frog-like with pinkish scaly skin and a pair of wings. Asa learns he has to hop instead of walk, and Kershaw gives him pointers as they head to meet Furston, the man who would assign them their jobs. Hazeltyne's daughter (Harriet) and general manager (Tom Dorr), who had been present at Asa's trial, watched as Asa trained--it seems Asa's not the only one who dislikes Dorr. Asa is given supplies to go on a muck trip with Kershaw so that he does not go on his first trip solo. Once they find a safe location, they start to dig for eggs, and Kershaw finds one. As it flashes, the mother Slider starts to run towards the men who run for their lives and call the rescue helicopter. Kershaw manages to drop the egg, and the two men fight under attack by the Slider. Asa recovers the egg as the helicopter arrives with Tom Dorr and Harriet inside, and Asa is worried by Dorr's demeanor. There is only space for one of the men in the helicopter but Asa seems to have been abandoned as he waits for the return. It turns out Dorr didn't think it was worth going back for Asa because he talked back to him. Eventually Harriet Hazeltyne makes it to him, but she crashes the helicopter because although she is a great pilot on Earth, she is not used to the gravity on this planet. ",
        "Summary_4": "Asa Graybar is convicted of stealing a slider egg from Hazeltyne Company. He believes he has been framed by Tom Dorr, Hazeltyne\u2019s general manager, who has brought the owner\u2019s daughter Harriet to the courtroom. Asa is given his choice of two sentences; rather than a relatively comfortable five years in a rehab clinic, Asa opts for a year as a changeling so that he can go to Jordan\u2019s Planet and study slider eggs. He believes his work with eggs prompted the Hazeltyne Company to frame him.\n\nAsa chooses to go to Jordan\u2019s Planet, where the eggs come from. On his way there, he meets Kershaw, a repeat muck man infatuated with the eggs.  Both men are turned into muck men: large, mutated creatures with some oddly unsettling human facial features. Humans have discovered how to prolong life and regenerate organs, which has also led to the changeling process, where convicts can be physiologically altered to be suited for life on other planets. \n\nAsa is trained to use his new body and reckon with the double gravity on the planet. The next day, Kershaw shows Asa the ropes until Kershaw finds an egg. His appreciation of it clouds his judgement, and Asa realizes just in time that Kershaw warned him that the sliders typically attack when the eggs are removed. A slider injures Kershaw\u2019s leg, and Asa jumps out of the way and calls for help before killing the slider in the nick of time. \n\nWhen a helicopter arrives, Tom Dorr and Harriet are in it. Asa insists that they should take the injured Kershaw and he should stay with the egg, since they both won\u2019t fit in the helicopter. Dorr demands that Asa give him the egg, but Asa refuses. The helicopter leaves Asa alone with the egg. \n\nAsa starts to get worried when the helicopter hasn\u2019t returned an hour later, and hopes the sliders don\u2019t attack at night. The helicopter comes back, but it lands clumsily and sticks in the mud. Harriet explains that she is a skilled pilot, but not in this gravity. She also details how she and Dorr argued because he wanted to leave Asa there and let the sliders (who do feed at night, on their own kind like the dead one near Asa) have at him. She told Dorr that she didn\u2019t like how he was running her father\u2019s business, and he told her to run it and stormed off. \n\nAs the passage ends, Asa and Harriet are in the midst of a dicey situation. He can\u2019t lift the helicopter up, and he doesn\u2019t think they\u2019d have a chance of fighting off the sliders in the rain - they\u2019ll have to try to make their way back. He asks Harriet where the rest of the muck men are, and she says they were all called back when the first helicopter came out, but that some may not be back yet. \n",
        "Article": "What is it you wish? he barked. I understood in my discussions withthe other ... ah ... civilian there'd be no further need for theseirritating conferences.     I've just learned you're placing more students abroad, Mr. Gulver. Howmany this time?     Two thousand.     And where will they be going?     Croanie. It's all in the application form I've handed in. Your job isto provide transportation.     Will there be any other students embarking this season?     Why ... perhaps. That's Boge's business. Gulver looked at Retief withpursed lips. As a matter of fact, we had in mind dispatching anothertwo thousand to Featherweight.     Another under-populated world\u2014and in the same cluster, I believe,Retief said. Your people must be unusually interested in that regionof space.     If that's all you wanted to know, I'll be on my way. I have matters ofimportance to see to.     After Gulver left, Retief called Miss Furkle in. I'd like to have abreak-out of all the student movements that have been planned under thepresent program, he said. And see if you can get a summary of whatMEDDLE has been shipping lately.     Miss Furkle compressed her lips. If Mr. Magnan were here, I'm surehe wouldn't dream of interfering in the work of other departments.I ... overheard your conversation with the gentleman from the CroanieLegation\u2014     The lists, Miss Furkle.     I'm not accustomed, Miss Furkle said, to intruding in mattersoutside our interest cluster.     That's worse than listening in on phone conversations, eh? But nevermind. I need the information, Miss Furkle.     Loyalty to my Chief\u2014     Loyalty to your pay-check should send you scuttling for the materialI've asked for, Retief said. I'm taking full responsibility. Nowscat.     The buzzer sounded. Retief flipped a key. MUDDLE, Retief speaking....     Arapoulous's brown face appeared on the desk screen.     How-do, Retief. Okay if I come up?     Sure, Hank. I want to talk to you.     In the office, Arapoulous took a chair. Sorry if I'm rushing you,Retief, he said. But have you got anything for me?     Retief waved at the wine bottles. What do you know about Croanie?     Croanie? Not much of a place. Mostly ocean. All right if you likefish, I guess. We import our seafood from there. Nice prawns in monsoontime. Over a foot long.     You on good terms with them?     Sure, I guess so. Course, they're pretty thick with Boge.     So?     Didn't I tell you? Boge was the bunch that tried to take us over herea dozen years back. They'd've made it too, if they hadn't had a lot ofbad luck. Their armor went in the drink, and without armor they're easygame.     Miss Furkle buzzed. I have your lists, she said shortly.     Bring them in, please.   <doc-sep> They went into a courtyard partly covered by a roof projecting fromthe Hazeltyne company's dome settlement. The far half of the courtyardwas open to the gray drizzle that fell almost ceaselessly from the skyof Jordan's Planet and turned most of its surface into marsh and mudflats. A high wall enclosed the far portion of the courtyard. Rangedalong the wall were thirty stalls for muck men.     From fifty yards across the courtyard a muck man bounded over to themin two leaps. Attached to a harness across his shoulders and chest werea gun and a long knife.     Names? he growled. He was a foot taller than Graybar and bigeverywhere in proportion.     Kershaw. I'm back, Furston.     I'm Graybar.     Kershaw again? Just start in where you left off, sucker. Come on,you. He pointed to Asa and leaped to the open portion of the courtyard.     Do what he says, Kershaw whispered to Graybar. He's sort of a trustyand warden and parole officer rolled into one.     Asa was put through a series of exercises to get him used to hisdistorted body, to teach him how to leap and how to dig. He was shownhow to operate the radio he would carry and how to fire the pencil-slimrockets of this gun. Finally he was told to eat a few berries from anative vine. He did so and immediately vomited.     Furston laughed.     That's to remind you you're still a man, Furston said, grinning.Everything that grows on this planet is poison. So if you got anyideas of hiding out till your term is up, forget 'em. Right here iswhere you eat.     Asa turned without a word and hopped feebly away from Furston. Helifted his head to breathe deeply and saw two humans watching him froman observation tower on the roof.     He leaped twenty feet into the air for a closer look.     Gazing at him with repugnance, after witnessing the end of his sessionwith Furston, were Harriet Hazeltyne and general manager Tom Dorr.     The girl's presence merely puzzled Asa, but Dorr's being here worriedhim. Dorr had tried to get rid of him once and was now in an excellentposition to make the riddance permanent.     At supper that night, squatting on the ground beside a low table withthe dozen other muck men operating from the dome, Asa asked what thetwo were doing out here.     The girl will inherit this racket some day, won't she? asked one ofthe others. She wants to see what kind of suckers are making her rich.     Maybe that guy Dorr brought her along to show her what a big wheelhe is, said one of the others. Just hope he doesn't take over theoperations.      III     Next morning Furston passed out guns, knives, radios, and pouches tocarry any eggs the muck men found. He gave each man a compass andassigned the sectors to be worked during the day. Finally he calledGraybar aside.     In case you don't like it here, Furston said, you can get a weekknocked off your sentence for every egg you bring in. Now get out thereand work that muck.     Furston sent Graybar and Kershaw out together so that the veteran couldshow Asa the ropes. Asa had already learned that the wall around thecourtyard was to keep Sliders out, not muck men in. He leaped over itand hopped along after Kershaw.     Feet slapping against the mud, they went about five miles from theHazeltyne station, swimming easily across ponds too broad to jump. Themud, if not precisely as pleasant to the touch as chinchilla fur, wasnot at all uncomfortable, and the dripping air caressed their skinslike a summer breeze back on Earth. Tiny, slippery creatures skiddedand splashed out of their way. Finally Kershaw stopped. His experiencedeye had seen a trail of swamp weeds crushed low into the mud.     Keep your eyes open, Kershaw said. There's a Slider been around herelately. If you see something like an express train headed our way,start shooting.     At each leap along the trail they peered quickly around. They saw noSliders, but this meant little, for the beasts lived under the mud asmuch as on top of it.     Kershaw halted again when they came to a roughly circular area some tenyards in diameter where the weeds had been torn out and lay rotting inthe muck.     We're in luck, he said as Asa skidded to a stop at his side. An eggwas laid somewhere here within the last week. These places are hard tospot when the new weeds start growing.     Kershaw took a long look around.     No trouble in sight. We dig.     They started at the center of the cleared area, shoveling up great gobsof mud with their hands and flinging them out of the clearing. Usuallya muck man dug in a spiral out from the center, but Graybar and Kershawdug in gradually widening semi-circles opposite each other. They hadto dig four feet deep, and it was slow going until they had a pitbig enough to stand in. Each handful of mud had to be squeezed gentlybefore it was thrown away, to make sure it didn't conceal an egg. As heworked, Asa kept thinking what an inefficient system it was. Everythingabout the operation was wrong.     Got it! Kershaw shouted. He leaped out of the pit and started wipingslime off a round object the size of a baseball. Asa jumped out towatch.     A big one, Kershaw said. He held it, still smeared with traces ofmud, lovingly to his cheek, and then lifted it to eye level. Just lookat it.      A SLIDER EGG      The egg was flashing with a mad radiance, like a thousand diamondsbeing splintered under a brilliant sun. Static crackled in Asa'searphones and he thought of what Kershaw had said, that thescintillation of an egg was an effect of its calls to a mother Sliderfor help. Asa looked around.     Jump! he shouted.     At the edge of the clearing a segmented length of greenish blackscales, some two feet thick and six feet high, had reared up out of theweeds. The top segment was almost all mouth, already opened to show rowupon row of teeth. Before Asa could draw his gun the Slider loweredits head to the ground, dug two front flippers into the mud and shotforward.     Asa leaped with all his strength, sailing far out of the clearing.While he was still in the air he snapped the mouthpiece of his radiodown from where it was hinged over his head. As he landed he turnedinstantly, his gun in his hand.     Calling the 'copter! he spoke rapidly into the mouthpiece. Kershawand Graybar, sector eight, five miles out. Hurry!     Graybar? asked a voice in his earphone. What's up?     We've got an egg but a Slider wants it back.     On the way.     Asa hopped back to the clearing. Kershaw must have been bowled over bythe Slider's first rush, for he was trying to hop on one leg as if theother had been broken. The egg lay flickering on top of the mud whereKershaw had dropped it. The Slider, eight flippers on each side workingmadly, was twisting its thirty feet of wormlike body around for anothercharge.     Aiming hastily, Asa fired a rocket at the monster's middle segment. Therocket smashed through hard scales and exploded in a fountain of grayflesh. The Slider writhed, coating its wound in mud, and twisted towardAsa. He leaped to one side, firing from the air and missing, and sawthe Slider turn toward the patch of weeds where he would land. His legswere tensed to leap again the moment he hit the mud, but he saw theSlider would be on top of him before he could escape. As he landed hethrust his gun forward almost into the mouth of the creature and firedagain.       Even as he was knocked aside into the muck, Asa's body was showeredwith shreds of alien flesh scattered by the rocket's explosion.Desperately pushing himself to his feet, he saw the long headless bodyshiver and lie still.   <doc-sep> Asa took a deep breath and looked around.     Kershaw! he called. Where are you?     Over here. Kershaw stood briefly above the weeds and fell back again.Asa leaped over to him.     Thanks, Kershaw said. Muck men stick together. You'll make a goodone. I wouldn't have had a chance. My leg's busted.     The helicopter ought to be here pretty soon, Asa said. He looked overat the dead Slider and shook his head. Tell me, what are the odds ongetting killed doing this?     Last time I was here there was about one mucker killed for every sixeggs brought out. Of course you're not supposed to stand there admiringthe eggs like I did while a Slider comes up on you.     Asa hopped over to the egg, which was still full of a dancing radiancewhere it rested on the mud. He scooped a hole in the muck and buriedthe egg.     Just in case there are any more Sliders around, he explained.     Makes no difference, said Kershaw, pointing upward. Here comes the'copter, late as usual.     The big machine circled them, hovered to inspect the dead Slider, andsettled down on broad skids. Through the transparent nose Asa could seeTom Dorr and Harriet Hazeltyne. The company manager swung the door openand leaned out.     I see you took care of the Slider, he said. Hand over the egg.     Kershaw has a broken leg, Asa said. I'll help him in and then I'llget the egg.     While Kershaw grabbed the door frame to help pull himself into thehelicopter, Asa got under his companion's belly and lifted him by thewaist. He hadn't realized before just how strong his new body was.Kershaw, as a muck man, would have weighed close to three hundredpounds on Earth, close to six hundred here.     Dorr made no move to help, but the girl reached under Kershaw'sshoulder and strained to get him in. Once he was inside, Asa saw, thecabin was crowded.     Are you going to have room for me too? he asked.     Not this trip, Dorr answered. Now give me the egg.     Asa didn't hesitate. The egg stays with me, he said softly.     You do what I tell you, mucker, said Dorr.     Nope. I want to make sure you come back. Asa turned his head toHarriet. You see, Miss Hazeltyne, I don't trust your friend. You mightask him to tell you about it.     Dorr stared at him with narrowed eyes. Suddenly he smiled in a way thatworried Asa.     Whatever you say, Graybar, Dorr said. He turned to the controls. Inanother minute the helicopter was in the sky.  "

        "Summary_1": "The story opens on Earth and then travels to Jordan\u2019s planet.\nJordan\u2019s planet is the place where Asa goes as a changeling to be a muck man. \nThere is a base on Jordan's planet which has a laboratory for converting prisoners into muck men, living quarters and kitchen, and a courtyard with high walls to keep the Sliders out. The surface of the planet is mud and the force of gravity is twice that on Earth. Asa's conversion into a frog-like person is necessary to survive there.\n\n",
        "Summary_2": "The story takes place in the future when humans have traveled to the stars, and medical advancements have enabled humans to regenerate damaged or deficient organs, enabling them to live until about two hundred years of age. The events in the story take place in several locations. It all begins on Earth in a courtroom where Asa Graybar has just been found guilty. From there, Asa is taken down a corridor to his jail cell, which is very small because it only takes Asa four steps to reach the other side. Once Asa decides to become a changeling and work as a muck man on Jordan\u2019s Planet, he ships to the planet on a space freighter where he is kept in a cell for the entire trip but can hear voices in the corridor. \n\tWhen they reach Jordan\u2019s Planet, Asa experiences the discomfort of the double gravity that makes his heart pound to keep his blood circulating. After his conversion to a changeling, Asa goes outside the company\u2019s dome settlement with Kershaw. There was a constant gray drizzle, and most of the planet\u2019s surface was marsh, mud flats, and ponds. On the roof of the settlement building, there is an observation tower. Muck men eat at tables that are low enough to accommodate their froglike physiology. Out in the mud where the muck men work, there are small, slippery creatures. There were also large, segmented creatures called Sliders who lay the eggs that the muck men harvest and attack them when they take an egg. \n\n",
        "Summary_3": "This story takes place on two separate planets, and the ship that the protagonist takes to travel between the two. The first is Earth, where Asa Graybar is convicted of a crime he did not commit. We see small pieces of the courtroom and prison that Asa visits for some time, but the focus is on the second planet. Jordan's Planet, a planet covered in mud and swamp creatures, has gravity twice as strong as that of Earth. Humans have a hard time dealing with the extra gravity and the mud, so those that stay to do work on the planet undergo medical procedures to make them more like giant frogs to allow them to swim through patches of mud that are too big to jump over. Jordan's Planet is significant because of the animals that live there, more specifically the Sliders and the eggs that they lay. These eggs have great value on Earth, so Hazeltyne, a tycoon on Earth, has built a settlement on Jordan's Planet as a place to train convicts working to recover the eggs for his own personal gain. ",
        "Summary_4": "The story takes place in a courtroom on Earth, a jail cell, an unspecified room where a medical exam takes place, a transport ship, and several locations on Jordan\u2019s Planet. On Jordan\u2019s Planet, the story moves from the medical office where the changeling conversions happen, a walled and partially covered courtyard where Asa does his training that houses multiple muck man-sized stalls, an office where Dorr and Harriet and the human higher ups work, and the muddy swamps where the muck men search for eggs. Jordan\u2019s Planet is muddy and treacherous, with double gravity. The story is set at an unspecified time in the future, when interplanetary travel and extreme biological mutations are commonplace and human lifespans average two-hundred years. \n",
        "Article": "They went into a courtyard partly covered by a roof projecting fromthe Hazeltyne company's dome settlement. The far half of the courtyardwas open to the gray drizzle that fell almost ceaselessly from the skyof Jordan's Planet and turned most of its surface into marsh and mudflats. A high wall enclosed the far portion of the courtyard. Rangedalong the wall were thirty stalls for muck men.     From fifty yards across the courtyard a muck man bounded over to themin two leaps. Attached to a harness across his shoulders and chest werea gun and a long knife.     Names? he growled. He was a foot taller than Graybar and bigeverywhere in proportion.     Kershaw. I'm back, Furston.     I'm Graybar.     Kershaw again? Just start in where you left off, sucker. Come on,you. He pointed to Asa and leaped to the open portion of the courtyard.     Do what he says, Kershaw whispered to Graybar. He's sort of a trustyand warden and parole officer rolled into one.     Asa was put through a series of exercises to get him used to hisdistorted body, to teach him how to leap and how to dig. He was shownhow to operate the radio he would carry and how to fire the pencil-slimrockets of this gun. Finally he was told to eat a few berries from anative vine. He did so and immediately vomited.     Furston laughed.     That's to remind you you're still a man, Furston said, grinning.Everything that grows on this planet is poison. So if you got anyideas of hiding out till your term is up, forget 'em. Right here iswhere you eat.     Asa turned without a word and hopped feebly away from Furston. Helifted his head to breathe deeply and saw two humans watching him froman observation tower on the roof.     He leaped twenty feet into the air for a closer look.     Gazing at him with repugnance, after witnessing the end of his sessionwith Furston, were Harriet Hazeltyne and general manager Tom Dorr.     The girl's presence merely puzzled Asa, but Dorr's being here worriedhim. Dorr had tried to get rid of him once and was now in an excellentposition to make the riddance permanent.     At supper that night, squatting on the ground beside a low table withthe dozen other muck men operating from the dome, Asa asked what thetwo were doing out here.     The girl will inherit this racket some day, won't she? asked one ofthe others. She wants to see what kind of suckers are making her rich.     Maybe that guy Dorr brought her along to show her what a big wheelhe is, said one of the others. Just hope he doesn't take over theoperations.      III     Next morning Furston passed out guns, knives, radios, and pouches tocarry any eggs the muck men found. He gave each man a compass andassigned the sectors to be worked during the day. Finally he calledGraybar aside.     In case you don't like it here, Furston said, you can get a weekknocked off your sentence for every egg you bring in. Now get out thereand work that muck.     Furston sent Graybar and Kershaw out together so that the veteran couldshow Asa the ropes. Asa had already learned that the wall around thecourtyard was to keep Sliders out, not muck men in. He leaped over itand hopped along after Kershaw.     Feet slapping against the mud, they went about five miles from theHazeltyne station, swimming easily across ponds too broad to jump. Themud, if not precisely as pleasant to the touch as chinchilla fur, wasnot at all uncomfortable, and the dripping air caressed their skinslike a summer breeze back on Earth. Tiny, slippery creatures skiddedand splashed out of their way. Finally Kershaw stopped. His experiencedeye had seen a trail of swamp weeds crushed low into the mud.     Keep your eyes open, Kershaw said. There's a Slider been around herelately. If you see something like an express train headed our way,start shooting.     At each leap along the trail they peered quickly around. They saw noSliders, but this meant little, for the beasts lived under the mud asmuch as on top of it.     Kershaw halted again when they came to a roughly circular area some tenyards in diameter where the weeds had been torn out and lay rotting inthe muck.     We're in luck, he said as Asa skidded to a stop at his side. An eggwas laid somewhere here within the last week. These places are hard tospot when the new weeds start growing.     Kershaw took a long look around.     No trouble in sight. We dig.     They started at the center of the cleared area, shoveling up great gobsof mud with their hands and flinging them out of the clearing. Usuallya muck man dug in a spiral out from the center, but Graybar and Kershawdug in gradually widening semi-circles opposite each other. They hadto dig four feet deep, and it was slow going until they had a pitbig enough to stand in. Each handful of mud had to be squeezed gentlybefore it was thrown away, to make sure it didn't conceal an egg. As heworked, Asa kept thinking what an inefficient system it was. Everythingabout the operation was wrong.     Got it! Kershaw shouted. He leaped out of the pit and started wipingslime off a round object the size of a baseball. Asa jumped out towatch.     A big one, Kershaw said. He held it, still smeared with traces ofmud, lovingly to his cheek, and then lifted it to eye level. Just lookat it.      A SLIDER EGG      The egg was flashing with a mad radiance, like a thousand diamondsbeing splintered under a brilliant sun. Static crackled in Asa'searphones and he thought of what Kershaw had said, that thescintillation of an egg was an effect of its calls to a mother Sliderfor help. Asa looked around.     Jump! he shouted.     At the edge of the clearing a segmented length of greenish blackscales, some two feet thick and six feet high, had reared up out of theweeds. The top segment was almost all mouth, already opened to show rowupon row of teeth. Before Asa could draw his gun the Slider loweredits head to the ground, dug two front flippers into the mud and shotforward.     Asa leaped with all his strength, sailing far out of the clearing.While he was still in the air he snapped the mouthpiece of his radiodown from where it was hinged over his head. As he landed he turnedinstantly, his gun in his hand.     Calling the 'copter! he spoke rapidly into the mouthpiece. Kershawand Graybar, sector eight, five miles out. Hurry!     Graybar? asked a voice in his earphone. What's up?     We've got an egg but a Slider wants it back.     On the way.     Asa hopped back to the clearing. Kershaw must have been bowled over bythe Slider's first rush, for he was trying to hop on one leg as if theother had been broken. The egg lay flickering on top of the mud whereKershaw had dropped it. The Slider, eight flippers on each side workingmadly, was twisting its thirty feet of wormlike body around for anothercharge.     Aiming hastily, Asa fired a rocket at the monster's middle segment. Therocket smashed through hard scales and exploded in a fountain of grayflesh. The Slider writhed, coating its wound in mud, and twisted towardAsa. He leaped to one side, firing from the air and missing, and sawthe Slider turn toward the patch of weeds where he would land. His legswere tensed to leap again the moment he hit the mud, but he saw theSlider would be on top of him before he could escape. As he landed hethrust his gun forward almost into the mouth of the creature and firedagain.       Even as he was knocked aside into the muck, Asa's body was showeredwith shreds of alien flesh scattered by the rocket's explosion.Desperately pushing himself to his feet, he saw the long headless bodyshiver and lie still.   <doc-sep> A round trip for the helicopter should have taken no more than twentyminutes, allowing time for Kershaw to be taken out at the settlement.     After an hour passed Asa began to worry. He was sure Dorr would returnfor the egg. Finally he realized that Dorr could locate the eggapproximately by the body of the dead Slider. Dorr could return for theegg any time with some other muck man to dig for it.     Asa pulled down the mouthpiece of his radio.     This is Graybar, calling the helicopter, he said. When are youcoming?     There was no answer except the hum of carrier wave.     If he tried to carry the egg back, Asa knew, Sliders would attack himall along the way. A man had no chance of getting five miles with anegg by himself. He could leave the egg here, of course. Even so hewould be lucky if he got back, following a hazy compass course fromwhich he and Kershaw had certainly deviated on their outward trip.There were no landmarks in this wilderness of bog to help him find hisway. The workers were supposed to home in on radio signals, if theylost their bearings, but Dorr would deny him that help.     What was the night like on Jordan's Planet? Maybe Sliders slept atnight. If he could stay awake, and if he didn't faint from hunger inthis strange new body, and if the Sliders left him alone....     A whirring noise made Asa jump in alarm.     Then he smiled in relief, for it was the helicopter, the blessedhelicopter, coming in over the swamp. But what if it was Dorr, comingback alone to dispose of him without any witnesses? Asa leaped for thecarcass of the dead Slider and took shelter behind it.     No machine-gun blast of rockets came from the helicopter. The bigmachine swooped low dizzily, tilted back in an inexpert attempt tohover, thumped down upon the mud and slid forward. As Asa jumped aside,the landing skids caught against the Slider's body and the helicopterflipped forward on its nose, one of the rotor blades plunging deep intothe mud.     Asa leaped forward in consternation. Not only was his chance of safepassage back to the settlement wrecked, but now he would have theextra burden of taking care of the pilot. When he reached the noseof the helicopter he saw that the pilot, untangling herself from thecontrols to get up, was Harriet Hazeltyne.      IV     Are you hurt? Asa asked her. She reached for his shoulder to steadyherself as she climbed out of the machine.     I guess not, she said. But taking a fall in this gravity is no fun.From the way my face feels I ought to be getting a black eye prettysoon.     What happened?     I made a fool of myself. She made a face back in the direction ofthe settlement. Dorr wasn't going to come after you. He said anyonewho talked back to him should try arguing with the Sliders.     She looked up at the machine-gun on the helicopter.     They feed at night, you know. And they eat their own kind, she said.The Slider you killed would draw them like ants to jam.     Asa glanced around quickly to make sure no Sliders had already come. Heeyed the helicopter with distaste at the thought of what a flimsy fortit would make.     Anyway, Harriet said, I told him he couldn't just leave you hereand we started arguing. I lost my temper. He thought he had brought meto Jordan's Planet on a fancy tour. I told him the real reason I washere was to check up for my father on the way he was running things andthere seemed to be a lot wrong. So he told me very politely I could runthings to suit myself and he walked off.     She shrugged, as if to indicate that she had made a mess of things.     And you took the helicopter by yourself, Asa said, as if he couldhardly believe it yet.     Oh, back on Earth I can make a helicopter do stunts. But I wasn't usedto this gravity. I don't suppose you could make this machine stand upstraight?     Asa tugged at the body of the Slider until he got it off the skids ofthe plane. He pulled with all his strength at the rotor blade sunk inthe mud, but the weight of the helicopter was upon it and the mud heldit with a suction of its own. After a few minutes he had to give up.     We fight off the Sliders, then, she said, as matter of factly as ifthat problem was settled. If it's any comfort, I know how to handlethe machine-gun.     Nope. In this drizzle, at night, the Sliders would be on us beforewe could see them. We've got to try to get back. He stood in thoughtwhile she stared at him patiently. What happened to the other muck menwho went out today? he asked.     They were called in when the 'copter came out the first time. Some ofthem may not have got back yet.   <doc-sep> Asa took a deep breath and looked around.     Kershaw! he called. Where are you?     Over here. Kershaw stood briefly above the weeds and fell back again.Asa leaped over to him.     Thanks, Kershaw said. Muck men stick together. You'll make a goodone. I wouldn't have had a chance. My leg's busted.     The helicopter ought to be here pretty soon, Asa said. He looked overat the dead Slider and shook his head. Tell me, what are the odds ongetting killed doing this?     Last time I was here there was about one mucker killed for every sixeggs brought out. Of course you're not supposed to stand there admiringthe eggs like I did while a Slider comes up on you.     Asa hopped over to the egg, which was still full of a dancing radiancewhere it rested on the mud. He scooped a hole in the muck and buriedthe egg.     Just in case there are any more Sliders around, he explained.     Makes no difference, said Kershaw, pointing upward. Here comes the'copter, late as usual.     The big machine circled them, hovered to inspect the dead Slider, andsettled down on broad skids. Through the transparent nose Asa could seeTom Dorr and Harriet Hazeltyne. The company manager swung the door openand leaned out.     I see you took care of the Slider, he said. Hand over the egg.     Kershaw has a broken leg, Asa said. I'll help him in and then I'llget the egg.     While Kershaw grabbed the door frame to help pull himself into thehelicopter, Asa got under his companion's belly and lifted him by thewaist. He hadn't realized before just how strong his new body was.Kershaw, as a muck man, would have weighed close to three hundredpounds on Earth, close to six hundred here.     Dorr made no move to help, but the girl reached under Kershaw'sshoulder and strained to get him in. Once he was inside, Asa saw, thecabin was crowded.     Are you going to have room for me too? he asked.     Not this trip, Dorr answered. Now give me the egg.     Asa didn't hesitate. The egg stays with me, he said softly.     You do what I tell you, mucker, said Dorr.     Nope. I want to make sure you come back. Asa turned his head toHarriet. You see, Miss Hazeltyne, I don't trust your friend. You mightask him to tell you about it.     Dorr stared at him with narrowed eyes. Suddenly he smiled in a way thatworried Asa.     Whatever you say, Graybar, Dorr said. He turned to the controls. Inanother minute the helicopter was in the sky.  "

        "Summary_1": "Asa thinks Tom framed him for the crime at the opening of the story. Tom is present on Jordan\u2019s planet when Asa arrives to begin his one year term as a muck man. \nTom is providing a tour of Jordan\u2019s planet to Harriet Hazeltyne, who is taking over her father\u2019s operations and wants to investigate how Toms is running things. Tom and Harriet get into an argument on Jordan\u2019s planet and Tom leaves in anger. It is unclear what his final fate is after leaving, though it is likely he will be removed from his post.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Tom Dorr is the general manager of the Hazeltyne company. He is thought to be responsible for Asa Graybar\u2019s arrest and conviction for theft of a Slider egg by planting an egg in Asa\u2019s lab. Dorr travels to Jordan\u2019s Planet with Harriet Hazeltyne; he thinks she is there for a tour, but she is really there on behalf of her father to see how Dorr is running the company\u2019s settlement on the planet because it seemed that things were not in order. Dorr flies the helicopter to pick up Asa and Kershaw when the Slider attacks them, but Dorr tells Asa there isn\u2019t room for him on that trip. Dorr then refuses to go back to pick up Asa, which leads to an argument with Harriet.

He is in the helicopter that arrives to rescue Kershaw and Asa when they are attacked while recovering an egg but makes no effort to help them into the helicopter and demands to take the egg from them, but when Asa refuses, Dorr heads back to the settlement with Kershaw and doesn't come back for Asa as he should; it is up to Harriet to decide Asa was worth retrieving.

You had to give up hope and freedom\u2014and being human!     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Worlds of If Science Fiction, November 1963.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      I     The girl with the Slider egg glittering in her hair watched thebailiff lead Asa Graybar out of the courtroom. He recognized her asold Hazeltyne's daughter Harriet, no doubt come to see justice done.She didn't have the hothouse-flower look Asa would have expected in agirl whose father owned the most valuable of the planetary franchises.She was not afraid to meet his eye, the eye of a judicially certifiedcriminal. There was, perhaps, a crease of puzzlement in her brow, as ifshe had thought crimes were committed by shriveled, rat-faced types,and not by young biological engineers who still affected crewcuts.     Tom Dorr, Hazeltyne's general manager, was her escort. Asa feltcertain, without proof, that Dorr was the man who had framed him forthe charge of grand theft by secreting a fresh Slider egg in hislaboratory. The older man stared at Asa coldly as he was led out ofthe courtroom and down the corridor back to jail.     Jumpy, Asa's cellmate, took one look at his face as he was put backbehind bars.     Guilty, Jumpy said.     Asa glared at him.     I know, I know, Jumpy said hastily. You were framed. But what's therap?     Five or one.     Take the five, Jumpy advised. Learn basket-weaving in a niceair-conditioned rehab clinic. A year on a changeling deal will seem alot longer, even if you're lucky enough to live through it.     Asa took four steps to the far wall of the cell, stood there brieflywith his head bent and turned to face Jumpy.     Nope, Asa said softly. I'm going into a conversion tank. I'm goingto be a muck man, Jumpy. I'm going out to Jordan's Planet and huntSlider eggs.     Smuggling? It won't work.     Asa didn't answer. The Hazeltyne company had gone after him becausehe had been working on a method of keeping Slider eggs alive. TheHazeltyne company would be happy to see him mark time for five yearsof so-called social reorientation. But if he could get out to Jordan'sPlanet, with his physiology adapted to the environment of that wretchedworld, he could study the eggs under conditions no laboratory couldduplicate. He might even be able to cause trouble for Hazeltyne.     His only problem would be staying alive for a year.   <doc-sep> They went into a courtyard partly covered by a roof projecting fromthe Hazeltyne company's dome settlement.

We're in luck, he said as Asa skidded to a stop at his side. An eggwas laid somewhere here within the last week. These places are hard tospot when the new weeds start growing.     Kershaw took a long look around.     No trouble in sight. We dig.     They started at the center of the cleared area, shoveling up great gobsof mud with their hands and flinging them out of the clearing. Usuallya muck man dug in a spiral out from the center, but Graybar and Kershawdug in gradually widening semi-circles opposite each other. They hadto dig four feet deep, and it was slow going until they had a pitbig enough to stand in. Each handful of mud had to be squeezed gentlybefore it was thrown away, to make sure it didn't conceal an egg. As heworked, Asa kept thinking what an inefficient system it was. Everythingabout the operation was wrong.     Got it! Kershaw shouted. He leaped out of the pit and started wipingslime off a round object the size of a baseball. Asa jumped out towatch.     A big one, Kershaw said. He held it, still smeared with traces ofmud, lovingly to his cheek, and then lifted it to eye level. Just lookat it.      A SLIDER EGG      The egg was flashing with a mad radiance, like a thousand diamondsbeing splintered under a brilliant sun. Static crackled in Asa'searphones and he thought of what Kershaw had said, that thescintillation of an egg was an effect of its calls to a mother Sliderfor help. Asa looked around.     Jump! he shouted.     At the edge of the clearing a segmented length of greenish blackscales, some two feet thick and six feet high, had reared up out of theweeds. The top segment was almost all mouth, already opened to show rowupon row of teeth. Before Asa could draw his gun the Slider loweredits head to the ground, dug two front flippers into the mud and shotforward.     Asa leaped with all his strength, sailing far out of the clearing.While he was still in the air he snapped the mouthpiece of his radiodown from where it was hinged over his head. As he landed he turnedinstantly, his gun in his hand.     Calling the 'copter! he spoke rapidly into the mouthpiece. Kershawand Graybar, sector eight, five miles out. Hurry!     Graybar? asked a voice in his earphone. What's up?     We've got an egg but a Slider wants it back.     On the way.     Asa hopped back to the clearing. Kershaw must have been bowled over bythe Slider's first rush, for he was trying to hop on one leg as if theother had been broken. The egg lay flickering on top of the mud whereKershaw had dropped it. The Slider, eight flippers on each side workingmadly, was twisting its thirty feet of wormlike body around for anothercharge.     Aiming hastily, Asa fired a rocket at the monster's middle segment. Therocket smashed through hard scales and exploded in a fountain of grayflesh. The Slider writhed, coating its wound in mud, and twisted towardAsa. He leaped to one side, firing from the air and missing, and sawthe Slider turn toward the patch of weeds where he would land. His legswere tensed to leap again the moment he hit the mud, but he saw theSlider would be on top of him before he could escape. As he landed hethrust his gun forward almost into the mouth of the creature and firedagain.       Even as he was knocked aside into the muck, Asa's body was showeredwith shreds of alien flesh scattered by the rocket's explosion.Desperately pushing himself to his feet, he saw the long headless bodyshiver and lie still.

        "Query": "How would you describe the dynamic between Asa and Kershaw in MUCK MAN?",
        "Summary_1": "They meet as cellmates on their way to Jordan\u2019s planet to convert to muck men. They convert into frog-like forms together. Kershaw is assigned to pick up where he left off as a return prisoner and Asa is taught how to operate in his new body.\nKershaw teaches Asa the ropes of how to collect slider eggs as a muck man. One muck man is killed for about every 6 Slider eggs that are found, and it is extremely dangerous. During their first time out they have to fight a Slider and Kershaw breaks his leg, relying on Asa to save him. This task bonds them together as they must trust each other with their lives.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Asa and Kershaw have a friendly relationship. When they are in a cell together on the flight to Jordan\u2019s Planet, Kershaw tells Asa what it is like to work there because he has worked there before. He is going back because he was caught stealing a new Slider egg that he couldn\u2019t resist because it was so beautiful. Kershaw tells Asa his theory that the flashes of the eggs are the eggs calling to their mothers because when muck men take one out of the muck, a Slider always comes right away. Kershaw helps Asa learn how to hop after Kershaw\u2019s transformation, and he gives him helpful advice about doing what Furston says. Kershaw also teaches Asa how to recognize when Sliders have been in an area recently and when an egg has recently been laid. When Kershaw finds the egg, Asa saves him by yelling for him to jump and then shooting the Slider and radioing for the helicopter. When the aircraft arrives, Asa carries Kershaw and puts him on board.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Asa and Kershaw are both convicted criminals with an interest in Slider eggs, though Asa believes he has been framed. The two of them meet because they are on the same transport to Jordan's Planet, reporting for a year of service as muck men to avoid five years of rehabilitation. Kershaw has been to Jordan's Planet before, so he becomes a mentor to Asa and gives him tips on who the various figureheads are at the settlement, and on how to do the job safely. The two of them go on a mission together once they arrive so that Asa can learn the ropes. Asa supports Kershaw as they are attacked by a Slider after Kershaw is injured. Kershaw believes in the mantra that muck men stick together and look out for each other and this allowed the men to warm up to each other very quickly, and the way the story is set up it seems they will be close friends as their story continues.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Asa and Kershaw have a friendly relationship. Asa empathizes with Kershaw\u2019s obsession with the eggs, and Kershaw serves as a mentor to Asa since he has already done time as a muck man on Jordan Planet. Kershaw is glad to have not only tips and training from Kershaw, but insight into the eggs themselves, which Kershaw loves and Asa is determined to study and learn more about. Their relationship is relatively jovial, especially considering their circumstances, and they look out for each other. After Kershaw finds the egg and is injured by the slider, he is grateful to Asa for saving his life and Asa is protective of him, insisting that Kershaw get into the helicopter first. \n",
        "Article": "Asa took a deep breath and looked around.     Kershaw! he called. Where are you?     Over here. Kershaw stood briefly above the weeds and fell back again.Asa leaped over to him.     Thanks, Kershaw said. Muck men stick together. You'll make a goodone. I wouldn't have had a chance. My leg's busted.     The helicopter ought to be here pretty soon, Asa said. He looked overat the dead Slider and shook his head. Tell me, what are the odds ongetting killed doing this?     Last time I was here there was about one mucker killed for every sixeggs brought out. Of course you're not supposed to stand there admiringthe eggs like I did while a Slider comes up on you.     Asa hopped over to the egg, which was still full of a dancing radiancewhere it rested on the mud. He scooped a hole in the muck and buriedthe egg.     Just in case there are any more Sliders around, he explained.     Makes no difference, said Kershaw, pointing upward. Here comes the'copter, late as usual.     The big machine circled them, hovered to inspect the dead Slider, andsettled down on broad skids. Through the transparent nose Asa could seeTom Dorr and Harriet Hazeltyne. The company manager swung the door openand leaned out.     I see you took care of the Slider, he said. Hand over the egg.     Kershaw has a broken leg, Asa said. I'll help him in and then I'llget the egg.     While Kershaw grabbed the door frame to help pull himself into thehelicopter, Asa got under his companion's belly and lifted him by thewaist. He hadn't realized before just how strong his new body was.Kershaw, as a muck man, would have weighed close to three hundredpounds on Earth, close to six hundred here.     Dorr made no move to help, but the girl reached under Kershaw'sshoulder and strained to get him in. Once he was inside, Asa saw, thecabin was crowded.     Are you going to have room for me too? he asked.     Not this trip, Dorr answered. Now give me the egg.     Asa didn't hesitate. The egg stays with me, he said softly.     You do what I tell you, mucker, said Dorr.     Nope. I want to make sure you come back. Asa turned his head toHarriet. You see, Miss Hazeltyne, I don't trust your friend. You mightask him to tell you about it.     Dorr stared at him with narrowed eyes. Suddenly he smiled in a way thatworried Asa.     Whatever you say, Graybar, Dorr said. He turned to the controls. Inanother minute the helicopter was in the sky.   <doc-sep> They went into a courtyard partly covered by a roof projecting fromthe Hazeltyne company's dome settlement. The far half of the courtyardwas open to the gray drizzle that fell almost ceaselessly from the skyof Jordan's Planet and turned most of its surface into marsh and mudflats. A high wall enclosed the far portion of the courtyard. Rangedalong the wall were thirty stalls for muck men.     From fifty yards across the courtyard a muck man bounded over to themin two leaps. Attached to a harness across his shoulders and chest werea gun and a long knife.     Names? he growled. He was a foot taller than Graybar and bigeverywhere in proportion.     Kershaw. I'm back, Furston.     I'm Graybar.     Kershaw again? Just start in where you left off, sucker. Come on,you. He pointed to Asa and leaped to the open portion of the courtyard.     Do what he says, Kershaw whispered to Graybar. He's sort of a trustyand warden and parole officer rolled into one.     Asa was put through a series of exercises to get him used to hisdistorted body, to teach him how to leap and how to dig. He was shownhow to operate the radio he would carry and how to fire the pencil-slimrockets of this gun. Finally he was told to eat a few berries from anative vine. He did so and immediately vomited.     Furston laughed.     That's to remind you you're still a man, Furston said, grinning.Everything that grows on this planet is poison. So if you got anyideas of hiding out till your term is up, forget 'em. Right here iswhere you eat.     Asa turned without a word and hopped feebly away from Furston. Helifted his head to breathe deeply and saw two humans watching him froman observation tower on the roof.     He leaped twenty feet into the air for a closer look.     Gazing at him with repugnance, after witnessing the end of his sessionwith Furston, were Harriet Hazeltyne and general manager Tom Dorr.     The girl's presence merely puzzled Asa, but Dorr's being here worriedhim. Dorr had tried to get rid of him once and was now in an excellentposition to make the riddance permanent.     At supper that night, squatting on the ground beside a low table withthe dozen other muck men operating from the dome, Asa asked what thetwo were doing out here.     The girl will inherit this racket some day, won't she? asked one ofthe others. She wants to see what kind of suckers are making her rich.     Maybe that guy Dorr brought her along to show her what a big wheelhe is, said one of the others. Just hope he doesn't take over theoperations.      III     Next morning Furston passed out guns, knives, radios, and pouches tocarry any eggs the muck men found. He gave each man a compass andassigned the sectors to be worked during the day. Finally he calledGraybar aside.     In case you don't like it here, Furston said, you can get a weekknocked off your sentence for every egg you bring in. Now get out thereand work that muck.     Furston sent Graybar and Kershaw out together so that the veteran couldshow Asa the ropes. Asa had already learned that the wall around thecourtyard was to keep Sliders out, not muck men in. He leaped over itand hopped along after Kershaw.     Feet slapping against the mud, they went about five miles from theHazeltyne station, swimming easily across ponds too broad to jump. Themud, if not precisely as pleasant to the touch as chinchilla fur, wasnot at all uncomfortable, and the dripping air caressed their skinslike a summer breeze back on Earth. Tiny, slippery creatures skiddedand splashed out of their way. Finally Kershaw stopped. His experiencedeye had seen a trail of swamp weeds crushed low into the mud.     Keep your eyes open, Kershaw said. There's a Slider been around herelately. If you see something like an express train headed our way,start shooting.     At each leap along the trail they peered quickly around. They saw noSliders, but this meant little, for the beasts lived under the mud asmuch as on top of it.     Kershaw halted again when they came to a roughly circular area some tenyards in diameter where the weeds had been torn out and lay rotting inthe muck.     We're in luck, he said as Asa skidded to a stop at his side. An eggwas laid somewhere here within the last week. These places are hard tospot when the new weeds start growing.     Kershaw took a long look around.     No trouble in sight. We dig.     They started at the center of the cleared area, shoveling up great gobsof mud with their hands and flinging them out of the clearing. Usuallya muck man dug in a spiral out from the center, but Graybar and Kershawdug in gradually widening semi-circles opposite each other. They hadto dig four feet deep, and it was slow going until they had a pitbig enough to stand in. Each handful of mud had to be squeezed gentlybefore it was thrown away, to make sure it didn't conceal an egg. As heworked, Asa kept thinking what an inefficient system it was. Everythingabout the operation was wrong.     Got it! Kershaw shouted. He leaped out of the pit and started wipingslime off a round object the size of a baseball. Asa jumped out towatch.     A big one, Kershaw said. He held it, still smeared with traces ofmud, lovingly to his cheek, and then lifted it to eye level. Just lookat it.      A SLIDER EGG      The egg was flashing with a mad radiance, like a thousand diamondsbeing splintered under a brilliant sun. Static crackled in Asa'searphones and he thought of what Kershaw had said, that thescintillation of an egg was an effect of its calls to a mother Sliderfor help. Asa looked around.     Jump! he shouted.     At the edge of the clearing a segmented length of greenish blackscales, some two feet thick and six feet high, had reared up out of theweeds. The top segment was almost all mouth, already opened to show rowupon row of teeth. Before Asa could draw his gun the Slider loweredits head to the ground, dug two front flippers into the mud and shotforward.     Asa leaped with all his strength, sailing far out of the clearing.While he was still in the air he snapped the mouthpiece of his radiodown from where it was hinged over his head. As he landed he turnedinstantly, his gun in his hand.     Calling the 'copter! he spoke rapidly into the mouthpiece. Kershawand Graybar, sector eight, five miles out. Hurry!     Graybar? asked a voice in his earphone. What's up?     We've got an egg but a Slider wants it back.     On the way.     Asa hopped back to the clearing. Kershaw must have been bowled over bythe Slider's first rush, for he was trying to hop on one leg as if theother had been broken. The egg lay flickering on top of the mud whereKershaw had dropped it. The Slider, eight flippers on each side workingmadly, was twisting its thirty feet of wormlike body around for anothercharge.     Aiming hastily, Asa fired a rocket at the monster's middle segment. Therocket smashed through hard scales and exploded in a fountain of grayflesh. The Slider writhed, coating its wound in mud, and twisted towardAsa. He leaped to one side, firing from the air and missing, and sawthe Slider turn toward the patch of weeds where he would land. His legswere tensed to leap again the moment he hit the mud, but he saw theSlider would be on top of him before he could escape. As he landed hethrust his gun forward almost into the mouth of the creature and firedagain.       Even as he was knocked aside into the muck, Asa's body was showeredwith shreds of alien flesh scattered by the rocket's explosion.Desperately pushing himself to his feet, he saw the long headless bodyshiver and lie still.   <doc-sep> Since it was cheaper to transport a normal human than to rig specialenvironments in a spaceship, every planet operated its own conversionchambers. On the space freighter that carried him from Earth AsaGraybar was confined to a small cabin that was opened only for a guardto bring meals and take out dirty dishes. He was still a prisoner.     Sometimes he could hear voices in the passageway outside, and onceone of them sounded like a woman's. But since women neither served onspaceships nor worked in the dome settlements on harsher worlds, hedecided it was his imagination. He might have been dead cargo for allhe learned about space travel.     Nevertheless his time was not wasted. He had as a companion, orcellmate, another convict who had elected conversion to muck man. Moreimportant, his companion had done time on Jordan's Planet before andhad wanted to return.     It's the Slider eggs, explained Kershaw, the two-time loser. Theones you see on Earth knock your eyes out, but they've already begunto die. There's nothing like a fresh one. And I'm not the first togo crazy over them. When I was reconverted and got home I had ninethousand dollars waiting for me. That'll buy a two-year-old egg thatflashes maybe four times a day. So I stole a new one and got caught.     Asa had held a Slider egg in his hand as he gazed into it. He couldunderstand. The shell was clear as crystal, taut but elastic, whilethe albumen was just as clear around the sparkling network of organicfilaments that served as a yolk. Along these interior threads playedtiny flashes of lightning, part of some unexplained process of life.Electrical instruments picked up static discharges from the egg, butthe phenomenon remained a mystery.     Hardly anyone faced with the beauty of a Slider's egg bothered toquestion its workings. For a few expectant moments there would be onlyrandom, fitful gleamings, and then there would be a wild coruscation oflight, dancing from one filament to the next in a frenzy of brilliance.     It took about four years for a Slider egg to die. Beauty, rarity andfading value made the eggs a luxury item like nothing the world hadever seen. If Asa had found a means of keeping them alive it would havemade him wealthy at the expense of the Hazeltyne monopoly.     You know what I think? Kershaw asked. I think those flashes arethe egg calling its momma. They sparkle like a million diamonds whenyou scoop one out of the muck, and right away a Slider always comesswooping out of nowhere at you.     I've been meaning to ask you, Asa said. How do you handle theSliders?     Kershaw grinned.     First you try to catch it with a rocket. If you miss you start leapingfor home. All this time you're broadcasting for help, you understand.When the Slider catches you, you leap up while it buries its jaws inthe mud where you were just standing. You dig your claws in its backand hang on while it rolls around in the mud. Finally, if the 'coptercomes\u2014and if they don't shoot off your head by mistake\u2014you live totell the tale.      II     Asa Graybar kept his normal form on Jordan's Planet just long enough tolearn the discomfort of double gravity. He was told he needed anotherphysical examination and was taken right in to a doctor. His heart waspounding to keep his blood circulating on this massive world, but thedoctor had apparently learned to make allowances.     Swallow this, said the doctor after making a series of tests.     Asa swallowed the capsule. Two minutes later he felt himself beginningto lose consciousness.     This is it! he thought in panic.     He felt someone ease him back down onto a wheeled stretcher. Beforeconsciousness faded completely he realized that no one got a chanceto back out of becoming a changeling, that he was on his way to theconversion tank right now.     When he finally awoke he felt well rested and very comfortable. But fora long time he was afraid to open his eyes.     Come on, Graybar, said a deep, booming voice. Let's test our wings.     It was not Kershaw's voice, but it had to be Kershaw. Asa opened hiseyes.     Everyone had seen pictures of muck men. It was different having onestand beside you. Kershaw looked much like an enormous frog except thathis head was still mostly human. He was sitting on webbed feet, hislower legs bent double under huge thighs, and his trunk tilted forwardso that his arms dangled to the ground. The arms were as thick aroundas an ordinary man's legs. The hands had become efficient scoops, withbroad fingers webbed to the first joint and tipped with spade-likeclaws. The skin was still pinkish but had become scaly. Not a thread ofhair showed anywhere on the body, not even on the head.     This, Asa realized, was what he looked like himself.     It would have been more bearable if the head had not retained strongtraces of humanity. The nostrils flared wide and the jaws hardlyemerged from the neck, but the ears were human ears and the eyes, underthose horny ridges, were human eyes. Asa felt sure that the eyes couldstill weep.     He started to walk forward and tipped over on his side. Kershaw laughed.     Come to daddy, babykins, Kershaw said, holding out his hands. Onlytry hopping this time. And take it easy.     Asa pushed himself upright with one arm and tried a small hop. Nerveand muscle coordination was perfect. He found himself leaping as highas Kershaw's head.     That's the way, Kershaw said approvingly. Now get this on and we'llgo outside.     Asa snapped on a belt and breech cloth combination that had flaps offabric dangling from the belt in front and behind. He followed asKershaw pushed open a sliding door to lead the way out of the roomwhere they had been left to revive from conversion.  "

        "Query": "What role does the egg play in the plot of MUCK MAN?",
        "Summary_1": "The Slider egg is a captivating object that has a clear shell, and light of various colors flash inside it. They are laid by Sliders on Jordan\u2019s planet and are collected by prisoners that are stationed there. The eggs only live for about 4 years, which makes them in demand. If they could be stabilized to live longer they would be even more valuable.\nTheir use is never discussed and the people in the story do not reveal why they are so valuable. Asa is working on a method to keep the eggs alive for longer at the opening of the story, but does not continue in that task during the plot.\n",
        "Summary_2": "\n\tThe Slider egg is a thing of such beauty that the Hazeltyne company that harvests and sells it is one of the most valuable franchises of all the planets. The eggs have a crystal clear shell and albumen, and the yolk is a sparkling network of filaments that flash like lightning. The eggs live for about four years, and their rarity and fading value makes them a luxury item.  The supposed theft of one of these eggs led to the arrest and conviction of Asa Graybar, a biological engineer with the company. Kershaw describes them as sparkling like a million diamonds when they are first pulled out of the mud, and even after spending a year as a muck man, he risks arrest again when he steals a new one that he can\u2019t resist. For his sentence, he chooses to become a muck man again, even though the work is extremely dangerous. The eggs are so valuable as to justify the expense of building a settlement on Jordan\u2019s Planet to harvest them.  \n",
        "Summary_3": "The events of the story are centered around Slider eggs. Sliders are creatures that live in the swamps on Jordan's Planet that have eight flippers on each side of their bodies, and are very protective of their eggs. They feed at nighttime, and consume members of their own species. In contrast, the eggs themselves are like magnificent works of art, with crystal clear shells and yolks that seem to emit electricity. These flashes of light start as the eggs are pulled out of the mud by the humans, and some suspect it is a way for the egg to signal to its mother that it is being handled by someone else. It is the flashes that seem to trigger the Slider attacks that often kill muck men working on the surface. Kershaw's time on Jordan's Planet made him obsessed with these eggs, and drove him to come back after he tried to steal one again. They die over the course of four years and Asa's goal is to find a way to preserve them, so he wants to study them at their source. The reason he is headed to Jordan's Planet is because he was accused (and convicted, though he believes he was framed) of hiding an egg in a lab. These eggs are also the key to the monopoly that Hazeltyne has, as a tycoon on Earth.   ",
        "Summary_4": "The egg is very significant to the story, as Asa was framed and convicted in the first place for his work with the eggs, his decision to undergo changeling conversion is centered around studying the eggs, and his new situation on Jordan Planet is centered around the collecting of slider eggs. Additionally, the eggs are what draw Kershaw into the story, as he was taken in by their allure during his last stint as a muck man, and got arrested again for stealing an egg. The eggs are also the source of wealth for the Hazeltyne Company. The first image the story gives us is a slider egg glittering in Harriet Hazeltyne\u2019s hair. \n",

Finally he calledGraybar aside.     In case you don't like it here, Furston said, you can get a weekknocked off your sentence for every egg you bring in. Now get out thereand work that muck.     Furston sent Graybar and Kershaw out together so that the veteran couldshow Asa the ropes. Asa had already learned that the wall around thecourtyard was to keep Sliders out, not muck men in. He leaped over itand hopped along after Kershaw.     Feet slapping against the mud, they went about five miles from theHazeltyne station, swimming easily across ponds too broad to jump. Themud, if not precisely as pleasant to the touch as chinchilla fur, wasnot at all uncomfortable, and the dripping air caressed their skinslike a summer breeze back on Earth. Tiny, slippery creatures skiddedand splashed out of their way. Finally Kershaw stopped. His experiencedeye had seen a trail of swamp weeds crushed low into the mud.     Keep your eyes open, Kershaw said. There's a Slider been around herelately. If you see something like an express train headed our way,start shooting.     At each leap along the trail they peered quickly around. They saw noSliders, but this meant little, for the beasts lived under the mud asmuch as on top of it.     Kershaw halted again when they came to a roughly circular area some tenyards in diameter where the weeds had been torn out and lay rotting inthe muck.     We're in luck, he said as Asa skidded to a stop at his side. An eggwas laid somewhere here within the last week. These places are hard tospot when the new weeds start growing.     Kershaw took a long look around.     No trouble in sight. We dig.     They started at the center of the cleared area, shoveling up great gobsof mud with their hands and flinging them out of the clearing. Usuallya muck man dug in a spiral out from the center, but Graybar and Kershawdug in gradually widening semi-circles opposite each other. They hadto dig four feet deep, and it was slow going until they had a pitbig enough to stand in. Each handful of mud had to be squeezed gentlybefore it was thrown away, to make sure it didn't conceal an egg. As heworked, Asa kept thinking what an inefficient system it was. Everythingabout the operation was wrong.     Got it! Kershaw shouted. He leaped out of the pit and started wipingslime off a round object the size of a baseball. Asa jumped out towatch.     A big one, Kershaw said. He held it, still smeared with traces ofmud, lovingly to his cheek, and then lifted it to eye level. Just lookat it.      A SLIDER EGG      The egg was flashing with a mad radiance, like a thousand diamondsbeing splintered under a brilliant sun. Static crackled in Asa'searphones and he thought of what Kershaw had said, that thescintillation of an egg was an effect of its calls to a mother Sliderfor help. Asa looked around.     Jump! he shouted.     At the edge of the clearing a segmented length of greenish blackscales, some two feet thick and six feet high, had reared up out of theweeds. The top segment was almost all mouth, already opened to show rowupon row of teeth. Before Asa could draw his gun the Slider loweredits head to the ground, dug two front flippers into the mud and shotforward.     Asa leaped with all his strength, sailing far out of the clearing.While he was still in the air he snapped the mouthpiece of his radiodown from where it was hinged over his head. As he landed he turnedinstantly, his gun in his hand.     Calling the 'copter! he spoke rapidly into the mouthpiece. Kershawand Graybar, sector eight, five miles out. Hurry!     Graybar? asked a voice in his earphone. What's up?     We've got an egg but a Slider wants it back.     On the way.     Asa hopped back to the clearing. Kershaw must have been bowled over bythe Slider's first rush, for he was trying to hop on one leg as if theother had been broken. The egg lay flickering on top of the mud whereKershaw had dropped it. The Slider, eight flippers on each side workingmadly, was twisting its thirty feet of wormlike body around for anothercharge.     Aiming hastily, Asa fired a rocket at the monster's middle segment. Therocket smashed through hard scales and exploded in a fountain of grayflesh. The Slider writhed, coating its wound in mud, and twisted towardAsa. He leaped to one side, firing from the air and missing, and sawthe Slider turn toward the patch of weeds where he would land. His legswere tensed to leap again the moment he hit the mud, but he saw theSlider would be on top of him before he could escape. As he landed hethrust his gun forward almost into the mouth of the creature and firedagain.       Even as he was knocked aside into the muck, Asa's body was showeredwith shreds of alien flesh scattered by the rocket's explosion.Desperately pushing himself to his feet, he saw the long headless bodyshiver and lie still.   <doc-sep> Since it was cheaper to transport a normal human than to rig specialenvironments in a spaceship, every planet operated its own conversionchambers. On the space freighter that carried him from Earth AsaGraybar was confined to a small cabin that was opened only for a guardto bring meals and take out dirty dishes. He was still a prisoner.     Sometimes he could hear voices in the passageway outside, and onceone of them sounded like a woman's. But since women neither served onspaceships nor worked in the dome settlements on harsher worlds, hedecided it was his imagination. He might have been dead cargo for allhe learned about space travel.     Nevertheless his time was not wasted. He had as a companion, orcellmate, another convict who had elected conversion to muck man. Moreimportant, his companion had done time on Jordan's Planet before andhad wanted to return.     It's the Slider eggs, explained Kershaw, the two-time loser. Theones you see on Earth knock your eyes out, but they've already begunto die. There's nothing like a fresh one. And I'm not the first togo crazy over them. When I was reconverted and got home I had ninethousand dollars waiting for me. That'll buy a two-year-old egg thatflashes maybe four times a day. So I stole a new one and got caught.     Asa had held a Slider egg in his hand as he gazed into it. He couldunderstand. The shell was clear as crystal, taut but elastic, whilethe albumen was just as clear around the sparkling network of organicfilaments that served as a yolk. Along these interior threads playedtiny flashes of lightning, part of some unexplained process of life.Electrical instruments picked up static discharges from the egg, butthe phenomenon remained a mystery.     Hardly anyone faced with the beauty of a Slider's egg bothered toquestion its workings. For a few expectant moments there would be onlyrandom, fitful gleamings, and then there would be a wild coruscation oflight, dancing from one filament to the next in a frenzy of brilliance.     It took about four years for a Slider egg to die. Beauty, rarity andfading value made the eggs a luxury item like nothing the world hadever seen. If Asa had found a means of keeping them alive it would havemade him wealthy at the expense of the Hazeltyne monopoly.     You know what I think? Kershaw asked. I think those flashes arethe egg calling its momma. They sparkle like a million diamonds whenyou scoop one out of the muck, and right away a Slider always comesswooping out of nowhere at you.     I've been meaning to ask you, Asa said. How do you handle theSliders?     Kershaw grinned.     First you try to catch it with a rocket. If you miss you start leapingfor home. All this time you're broadcasting for help, you understand.When the Slider catches you, you leap up while it buries its jaws inthe mud where you were just standing. You dig your claws in its backand hang on while it rolls around in the mud. Finally, if the 'coptercomes\u2014and if they don't shoot off your head by mistake\u2014you live totell the tale.      II     Asa Graybar kept his normal form on Jordan's Planet just long enough tolearn the discomfort of double gravity. He was told he needed anotherphysical examination and was taken right in to a doctor. His heart waspounding to keep his blood circulating on this massive world, but thedoctor had apparently learned to make allowances.     Swallow this, said the doctor after making a series of tests.     Asa swallowed the capsule. Two minutes later he felt himself beginningto lose consciousness.     This is it! he thought in panic.     He felt someone ease him back down onto a wheeled stretcher. Beforeconsciousness faded completely he realized that no one got a chanceto back out of becoming a changeling, that he was on his way to theconversion tank right now.     When he finally awoke he felt well rested and very comfortable. But fora long time he was afraid to open his eyes.     Come on, Graybar, said a deep, booming voice. Let's test our wings.     It was not Kershaw's voice, but it had to be Kershaw. Asa opened hiseyes.     Everyone had seen pictures of muck men. It was different having onestand beside you. Kershaw looked much like an enormous frog except thathis head was still mostly human. He was sitting on webbed feet, hislower legs bent double under huge thighs, and his trunk tilted forwardso that his arms dangled to the ground. The arms were as thick aroundas an ordinary man's legs. The hands had become efficient scoops, withbroad fingers webbed to the first joint and tipped with spade-likeclaws. The skin was still pinkish but had become scaly. Not a thread ofhair showed anywhere on the body, not even on the head.     This, Asa realized, was what he looked like himself.     It would have been more bearable if the head had not retained strongtraces of humanity. The nostrils flared wide and the jaws hardlyemerged from the neck, but the ears were human ears and the eyes, underthose horny ridges, were human eyes. Asa felt sure that the eyes couldstill weep.     He started to walk forward and tipped over on his side. Kershaw laughed.     Come to daddy, babykins, Kershaw said, holding out his hands. Onlytry hopping this time. And take it easy.     Asa pushed himself upright with one arm and tried a small hop. Nerveand muscle coordination was perfect. He found himself leaping as highas Kershaw's head.     That's the way, Kershaw said approvingly. Now get this on and we'llgo outside.     Asa snapped on a belt and breech cloth combination that had flaps offabric dangling from the belt in front and behind. He followed asKershaw pushed open a sliding door to lead the way out of the roomwhere they had been left to revive from conversion.  "

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in THE DESERT AND THE STARS?",
        "Summary_1": "As the story opens, Retief, the Minister to Flamme, is meeting with other members of the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne, including Under-Secretary Sternwheeler and Deputy Under-Secretary Magnan. The men discuss Retief\u2019s plan to visit Flamme in person to deal with the growing conflict between the Boyars, who have been living on Flamme for sixty years, and the Aga Kagans. The latter recently arrived on Flamme and began taking over land that the Boyars are farming. The Aga Kagans appear to be goat herders, living in tents and allowing their goats to graze on land that the Boyars use for crops, but in reality, the Aga Kagans have weapons, including 40 mm infinite repeaters and rocket launchers. Retief wants to offer the Boyars the support of the Corps, but Sternwheeler will only go so far as to authorize a \u201cstiffly worded Protest Note.\u201d With foresight, Retief has already drafted a note because he anticipated the Corps would respond with paperwork rather than action. \t\n\tRetief travels to Flamme and meets with Georges Duror, the Boyar Chef d\u2019Regime. Georges indicates that he has been holding back his men who want to attack the Aga Kagans for taking their land, and Retief reminds Georges that if the Boyars act without backing from the Corps, they are likely to be destroyed. Retief also tells Georges that the goats and tents are just for show; the Aga Kagans have a modern navy and bullet-proof cloaks, and on their home planet, they travel via modern helis and ground cars. Georges seems discouraged by this news, but Retief reminds him he has the Note and asks him to give diplomacy a chance.\n\tRetief and Georges travel to meet with the head of the Aga Kagans to deliver the Note. On the way, Georges points out the progress that the Boyars have made on Flamme. They stop their air-car when Georges sees a herd of goats in a grain field, and three Aga Kagan horsemen confront them. Retief asks them to take him and Georges to their leader, and they do. Retief introduces Georges as from the Planetary government to the leader, Stanley, and offers to read the Note. He begins with a series of titles until Stanley tells him to skip them. Retief flips two pages and begins a long, legalistic description of relocated people until Stanley cuts him off. Stanley says the Boyars will be accused of imperialism if they attack the Aga Kagans but offers to allow the Boyars to stay until they can make other arrangements. Stanley reveals that the Aga Kagans are slowly creating an empire, and he expects the Corps won\u2019t do anything about it. Georges and Stanley exchange heated insults. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Boyars have spent 60 years terraforming the planet of Flamme, and were assured support from the Corps in their endeavors to colonize the planet from the beginning. A second group, called the Aga Kagan, have begun to move into the planet to do what the Boyars have been told is fishing and homesteading. However, they have landed only males on the planet as well as rocket launchers, suggesting they are mounting an armed takeover.\n\nHigher officials in the Corps (the Under-Secretary) are now walking back their support of the Boyar, to the dismay of Retief - a diplomatic Minister to the planet. Retief has a history of working with the Boyar, and is irritated that the Corps are not willing to be any more engaged in helping them than writing a strongly worded note.\n\nRetief and the Chief d\u2019Regime of the Boyar, Georges, travel on a diplomatic mission via a hovercar to deliver the Note to the Aga Kagan. They encounter a party of three Aga Kagan in the foothills as they travel west, and after a very tense and offensive interaction between the parties are escorted to the leader - Exalted Ruler - of the Aga Kagan, Stanley.\n\nStanley is in an opulent tent being served by slave women that feed and provide for the men. Retief and Georges deliver the Note from the Corps and speak with Stanley largely in proverbs until Stanley persuades them to speak more directly. Georges is hot tempered, and overcome with irritation through the conversation with Stanley about the Aga Kagan moving onto Flamme - ultimately leaving the tent. Retief remains curious about Stanley\u2019s motivations and discovers that he is intent on continuing to invade, no matter the consequences. The story ends with the temper of Stanley flaring up, potentially starting a war on planet Flamme.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Reteif, the Minister to Flamme, approaches an Under-Secretary about the potential invasion that is happening on Flamme. He informs him of the Aga Kagans presence on the planet, and the Boyers very unhappy reaction. He assures the Under-Secretary that he has calmed the Boyers and asked for no action presently, but he wants to know what the Corps will do in response. After delving into the history of the situation--the Corps mainly stays out of the Aga Kagans imperialistic ways--, they reach an agreement to deliver a Protest Note to the Aga Kagans on behalf of the Corps. However, that\u2019s all they will do. \nRetief returns to Flamme and visits with Georges, the Chef d\u2019Regime of the Boyers. They sit in the Governor House, drinking barley whiskey, and discussing the Aga Kagan invasion. Georges informs him of the goat-issue, the ruined oyster patch, while Retief reveals that the Aga Kagan came armed and ready to fight. Georges wants to fight back, but Retief cautions him. Citing the Note, Retief believes they can solve this without any violence. \nThey take off in a car to the Aga Kagans\u2019 territory, past the fertile fields and beautiful lakes. They see goats running through a wheat field, further angering Georges. They are stopped by three Aga Kagans, the leader of which is Blackbeard, and Retief speaks to them in their native language. Using proverbs and confusing language, he gains entry into their camp and the smooth-faced Aga Kagans deliver them to their leader, the Aga Kaga. They are all armed, but Retief advises Georges on how to speak to the leader and reminds him to stick to the plan. \nThey arrive at a large black tent. The Aga Kaga is lounging with several female slaves surrounding him, doting on his every need. He has blue-black hair and he\u2019s very well-dresseed.  they discuss his plans to invade and how they are up for grabs, at least according to the Aga Kaga. The Aga Kaga claims the Boyars are truly the squatters, not his people. They converse in proverbs and diplomatic terms, until Retief brings out the Protest Note. Then they discuss the historical relevance to his conquering ways, and how the Aga Kaga, or Stanley, believes he will win without any protest from the Corps. \nGeorges makes fun of the Aga Kaga, and his words become more and more aggressive. Reteif finds it impossible that the Corps will simply sit back and watch him take over this planet. It\u2019s clear that Retief has some sort of ulteriour motive in this argument. The story ends with the argument evolving into yelling and harsh words. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Two groups, the Boyars and Aga Kagans, are fighting for control of Flamme, a planet the Boyars terraformed. It is up to the humans to act as mediators in this conflict, which they do under the ribbon of the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne. Retief, a member of the Corps, wants to give the Boyars official Corps support, but the Under-Secretary is hesitant to say anything too definite and offers to write a note. After the meeting, Magnan invites Retief to a reception later that day with a lot of figure-heads, but Retief wants to get back to Flamme, where he will hopefully keep war from breaking out.  On Flamme, Retief talks to Georges, a Boyar leader. Retief tries to convince Georges to give a diplomatic approach a shot, and advises him on how to proceed. The two of them head out of the capitol, discussing the countryside as Georges expresses his frustration about goats. Retief tries to keep Georges calm and takes his time to unwrap a cigar before he greets the Aga Kagans that approach. After some formalities, Retief explains that they have come to talk with the Aga Kagan leaders. They continue speaking in idioms, but Retief seems to have insulted the Aga Kagans. Retief and Georges eventually make it out of the situation, being led to the Aga Kagan headquarters. Once they arrive, the Aga Kagan known as Blackbeard orders Retief and Georges out of their car, and they are introduced to \"the Exalted One, the Aga Kaga, ruler of the East and West\". Then, the discussion in proverbs continues. Retief introduces his friend as \"M. Georges Duror, Chef d'Regime of the Planetary government\", referring to him as a planetary leader as a power play. This upsets the Aga Kaga, who doesn't consider Georges important. The three eventually sit to discuss the involvement of the Corps, and Retief pulls out the note from the sector's Under-Secretary. Just the statement of titles took at least two pages of the note, and the rest of the note was just as wordy, which frustrated the Aga Kaga, who smugly admitted he had been expecting this complaint. The Aga Kaga, who says to call him Stanley, is thankful that Retief speaks plainly for a diplomat. It turns out Stanley is trying to put up an image for his fellow people but isn't as dedicated to the plan as the others. His primary goal seems to be to live pleasurably while he is alive, but does admit he is there to take over the planet, although he insists it isn't aggressive of him to do. Aga Kaga tries to distract Georges' complaints by admiring his whiskey glass, but threatens the Boyars in the same breath. Retief and Stanley speak in thinly veiled threats citing various historical events, but eventually Retief says that the Corps will be forced to retaliate. It is with this that Georges stands up to defend himself and the story ends with tensions running high. \n",
        "Article": "   HOW TO MAKE FRIENDS     By JIM HARMON     Illustrated by WEST     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Galaxy Magazine October 1962.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]       Every lonely man tries to make friends.     Manet just didn't know when to stop!      William Manet was alone.     In the beginning, he had seen many advantages to being alone. It wouldgive him an unprecedented opportunity to once and for all correlateloneliness to the point of madness, to see how long it would take himto start slavering and clawing the pin-ups from the magazines, to beginteaching himself classes in philosophy consisting of interminablelectures to a bored and captive audience of one.     He would be able to measure the qualities of peace and decide whetherit was really better than war, he would be able to get as fat and asdirty as he liked, he would be able to live more like an animal andthink more like a god than any man for generations.     But after a shorter time than he expected, it all got to be a tearingbore. Even the waiting to go crazy part of it.     Not that he was going to have any great long wait of it. He was alreadytalking to himself, making verbal notes for his lectures, and he hadcut out a picture of Annie Oakley from an old book. He tacked it up andwinked at it whenever he passed that way.     Lately she was winking back at him.     Loneliness was a physical weight on his skull. It peeled the flesh fromhis arms and legs and sandpapered his self-pity to a fine sensitivity.     No one on Earth was as lonely as William Manet, and even William Manetcould only be this lonely on Mars.     Manet was Atmosphere Seeder Station 131-47's own human.     All Manet had to do was sit in the beating aluminum heart in the middleof the chalk desert and stare out, chin cupped in hands, at the flat,flat pavement of dirty talcum, at the stars gleaming as hard in theblack sky as a starlet's capped teeth ... stars two of which were moonsand one of which was Earth. He had to do nothing else. The wholegimcrack was cybernetically controlled, entirely automatic. No one wasneeded here\u2014no human being, at least.     The Workers' Union was a pretty small pressure group, but it didn'ttake much to pressure the Assembly. Featherbedding had been carefullyspecified, including an Overseer for each of the Seeders to honeycombMars, to prepare its atmosphere for colonization.     They didn't give tests to find well-balanced, well-integrated peoplefor the job. Well-balanced, well-integrated men weren't going toisolate themselves in a useless job. They got, instead, William Manetand his fellows.     The Overseers were to stay as long as the job required. Passenger fareto Mars was about one billion dollars. They weren't providing commuterservice for night shifts. They weren't providing accommodationsfor couples when the law specified only one occupant. They weren'tproviding fuel (at fifty million dollars a gallon) for visits betweenthe various Overseers. They weren't very providential.     But it was two hundred thousand a year in salary, and it offeredwonderful opportunities.     It gave William Manet an opportunity to think he saw a spaceship makinga tailfirst landing on the table of the desert, its tail burning asbright as envy.   <doc-sep> What is it you wish? he barked. I understood in my discussions withthe other ... ah ... civilian there'd be no further need for theseirritating conferences.     I've just learned you're placing more students abroad, Mr. Gulver. Howmany this time?     Two thousand.     And where will they be going?     Croanie. It's all in the application form I've handed in. Your job isto provide transportation.     Will there be any other students embarking this season?     Why ... perhaps. That's Boge's business. Gulver looked at Retief withpursed lips. As a matter of fact, we had in mind dispatching anothertwo thousand to Featherweight.     Another under-populated world\u2014and in the same cluster, I believe,Retief said. Your people must be unusually interested in that regionof space.     If that's all you wanted to know, I'll be on my way. I have matters ofimportance to see to.     After Gulver left, Retief called Miss Furkle in. I'd like to have abreak-out of all the student movements that have been planned under thepresent program, he said. And see if you can get a summary of whatMEDDLE has been shipping lately.     Miss Furkle compressed her lips. If Mr. Magnan were here, I'm surehe wouldn't dream of interfering in the work of other departments.I ... overheard your conversation with the gentleman from the CroanieLegation\u2014     The lists, Miss Furkle.

I need the information, Miss Furkle.     Loyalty to my Chief\u2014     Loyalty to your pay-check should send you scuttling for the materialI've asked for, Retief said. I'm taking full responsibility. Nowscat.     The buzzer sounded. Retief flipped a key. MUDDLE, Retief speaking....     Arapoulous's brown face appeared on the desk screen.     How-do, Retief. Okay if I come up?     Sure, Hank. I want to talk to you.     In the office, Arapoulous took a chair. Sorry if I'm rushing you,Retief, he said. But have you got anything for me?     Retief waved at the wine bottles. What do you know about Croanie?     Croanie? Not much of a place. Mostly ocean. All right if you likefish, I guess. We import our seafood from there. Nice prawns in monsoontime. Over a foot long.     You on good terms with them?     Sure, I guess so. Course, they're pretty thick with Boge.     So?     Didn't I tell you? Boge was the bunch that tried to take us over herea dozen years back. They'd've made it too, if they hadn't had a lot ofbad luck. Their armor went in the drink, and without armor they're easygame.     Miss Furkle buzzed. I have your lists, she said shortly.

        "Query": "How do Georges and Retief differ and what similarities do they share in THE DESERT AND THE STARS?",
        "Summary_1": "The two men have dealt with each other prior to the events in the story; Retief addresses Georges by his first name, so they know each other fairly well. However, Retief\u2019s position is higher than Georges\u2019s position. Retief works for the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne; Georges works for the Planetary government. Retief knows information about the Aga Kagans that Georges doesn\u2019t know, such as the fact that they are armed, have bulletproof cloaks, and have modern technology on their home planet. He has advised Georges about handling the situation with the Aga Kagans, urging him to prevent the Boyars from attacking the Aga Kagans, and Georges trusts Retief to secure assistance for them. Retief is sympathetic to the Boyars and their situation, trying to persuade Under-Secretary Sternwheeler to support them. When Retief tells Georges that he will personally deliver the Note to the Aga Kagans, Georges wants to help Retief and volunteers to go with him; Retief agrees. It is Retief who develops the plan for handling the Aga Kagans. Georges is impulsive, which leads Retief to keep watch on him. When they encounter the goats in the grain field, Retief has to convince Georges not to hurt the animals, and when the horsemen ride through the grain, Retief has to hold him back again. Retief is calmer in stressful situations and reminds Georges of their strategy: to make their flattery sound like insults and their insults sound like flattery. Georges seems unsure of himself and comments that he should have learned more about their habits before accompanying Retief. Retief has to translate what the Aga Kagans say for Georges in order for him to know what is going on. When the two men meet with Stanley, Retief maintains his calm demeanor, while Georges loses his temper.",
        "Summary_2": "Retief is a diplomatic Minister to Flamme and has strategic plans guiding his desire to see the Boyar continue to inhabit the planet Flamme. Georges is the Chief d\u2019Regime of the Boyar who has an offensive hot temper and hatred of the Aga Kagan that flares routinely while he accompanies Retief to meet with the Aga Kagan. In this way, their contrasting approaches to interacting with the Aga Kagan are a very suspenseful part of the story.\n\nThe two of them desire a similar outcome - for the Boyar to continue to inhabit Flamme and for the Aga Kagan to leave. Georges and Retief have had a history of working together that provides a sense of camaraderie between them, and Retief desires to help Georges achieve his goals on the planet.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Retief is the Minister to Flamme, a very diplomatic position. Georges is the Boyar Chef d\u2019Regime, the Boyers\u2019 leader and governor. Retief is a quirky man. His progressive nature and strong morals force him to attempt to save Flamme from the Aga Kagans invasion. However, his manner of doing so is sneaky and tricky, using proverbs to establish himself and make his way to the Aga. Georges, on the other hand, is a little more hot-headed. Although he has been patient so far in waiting for Retief\u2019s aid, he wishes to destroy the invaders and is struggling to hold back his men. When they confront the Aga Kaga, Retief takes the diplomatic approach, while Georges essentially yells at him. Although Georges may be the leader of the Boyers, Retief is the one who devises the plan and leads them to the Aga Kaga. ",
        "Summary_4": "Georges, the Boyar Chef d'Regime, has been on the planet Flamme for sixty years, overseeing its terraforming. He is understandably frustrated with the moves that the Aga Kagans are making on the territory of Boyar, and is upset at the amount of damage that the Aga Kagans are causing, as it took a long time to terraform the planet to make it what it is today. Retief is willing to get involved in the issue and backs Georges up but he goes with the flow, acting as a calm source of energy in the political sphere. It is Retief that works to convince Georges that he should consider a diplomatic approach to handling the situation, and travels to the Corps himself to make sure this is an option. Georges gets frustrated easily, as we see with the goats, and Retief is there to calm him down and remind him of the demeanor that will give him a better chance at the negotiating table. Retief speaks Kagan and is well-versed in their cultural norms, which is very useful for the purposes of negotiation. It also makes him very adept at making the Aga Kagans angry, which he does as soon as they encounter each other. On a more surface level, they are members of different groups of people, but they both hold some kind of political status within their groups respectively. ",
        "Article": "The air car followed the escort down a long slope to a dry river bedand across it, through a barren stretch of shifting sand to a greenoasis set with canopies.     The armed escort motioned the car to a halt before an immense tent ofglistening black. Before the tent armed men lounged under a pennantbearing a lion      couchant     in crimson on a field verte.     Get out, Blackbeard ordered. The guards eyed the visitors, theirdrawn sabers catching sunlight. Retief and Georges stepped from thecar onto rich rugs spread on the grass. They followed the ferociousgesture of the bearded man through the opening into a perfumed interiorof luminous shadows. A heavy odor of incense hung in the air, and thestrumming of stringed instruments laid a muted pattern of sound behindthe decorations of gold and blue, silver and green. At the far end ofthe room, among a bevy of female slaves, a large and resplendently cladman with blue-black hair and a clean-shaven chin popped a grape intohis mouth. He wiped his fingers negligently on a wisp of silk offeredby a handmaiden, belched loudly and looked the callers over.     Blackbeard cleared his throat. Down on your faces in the presence ofthe Exalted One, the Aga Kaga, ruler of East and West.     Sorry, Retief said firmly. My hay-fever, you know.     The reclining giant waved a hand languidly.     Never mind the formalities, he said. Approach.     Retief and Georges crossed the thick rugs. A cold draft blew towardthem. The reclining man sneezed violently, wiped his nose on anothersilken scarf and held up a hand.     Night and the horses and the desert know me, he said in resonanttones. Also the sword and the guest and paper and pen\u2014 Hepaused, wrinkled his nose and sneezed again. Turn off that damnedair-conditioner, he snapped.     He settled himself and motioned the bearded man to him. The twoexchanged muted remarks. Then the bearded man stepped back, ducked hishead and withdrew to the rear.     Excellency, Retief said, I have the honor to present M. GeorgesDuror, Chef d'Regime of the Planetary government.     Planetary government? The Aga Kaga spat grape seeds on the rug. Mymen have observed a few squatters along the shore. If they're indistress, I'll see about a distribution of goat-meat.     It is the punishment of the envious to grieve at anothers' plenty,Retief said. No goat-meat will be required.     Ralph told me you talk like a page out of Mustapha ben Abdallah KatibJelebi, the Aga Kaga said. I know a few old sayings myself. Forexample, 'A Bedouin is only cheated once.'     We have no such intentions, Excellency, Retief said. Is it notwritten, 'Have no faith in the Prince whose minister cheats you'?     I've had some unhappy experiences with strangers, the Aga Kaga said.It is written in the sands that all strangers are kin. Still, he whovisits rarely is a welcome guest. Be seated.      III     Handmaidens brought cushions, giggled and fled. Retief and Georgessettled themselves comfortably. The Aga Kaga eyed them in silence.       We have come to bear tidings from the Corps DiplomatiqueTerrestrienne, Retief said solemnly. A perfumed slave girl offeredgrapes.     Modest ignorance is better than boastful knowledge, the Aga Kagasaid. What brings the CDT into the picture?     The essay of the drunkard will be read in the tavern, Retief said.Whereas the words of kings....     Very well, I concede the point. The Aga Kaga waved a hand at theserving maids. Depart, my dears. Attend me later. You too, Ralph.These are mere diplomats. They are men of words, not deeds.     The bearded man glared and departed. The girls hurried after him.     Now, the Aga Kaga said. Let's drop the wisdom of the ages andget down to the issues. Not that I don't admire your repertoire ofplatitudes. How do you remember them all?     Diplomats and other liars require good memories, said Retief. Butas you point out, small wisdom to small minds. I'm here to effect asettlement of certain differences between yourself and the planetaryauthorities. I have here a Note, which I'm conveying on behalf of theSector Under-Secretary. With your permission, I'll read it.     Go ahead. The Aga Kaga kicked a couple of cushions onto the floor,eased a bottle from under the couch and reached for glasses.     The Under-Secretary for Sector Affairs presents his compliments to hisExcellency, the Aga Kaga of the Aga Kaga, Primary Potentate, HereditarySheik, Emir of the\u2014     Yes, yes. Skip the titles.     Retief flipped over two pages.     ... and with reference to the recent relocation of persons under thejurisdiction of his Excellency, has the honor to point out that theterritories now under settlement comprise a portion of that area,hereinafter designated as Sub-sector Alpha, which, under terms ofthe Agreement entered into by his Excellency's predecessor, and asreferenced in Sector Ministry's Notes numbers G-175846573957-b andX-7584736 c-1, with particular pertinence to that body designated inthe Revised Galactic Catalogue, Tenth Edition, as amended, VolumeNine, reel 43, as 54 Cygni Alpha, otherwise referred to hereinafter asFlamme\u2014     Come to the point, the Aga Kaga cut in. You're here to lodge acomplaint that I'm invading territories to which someone else laysclaim, is that it? He smiled broadly, offered dope-sticks and lit one.Well, I've been expecting a call. After all, it's what you gentlemenare paid for. Cheers.     Your Excellency has a lucid way of putting things, Retief said.     Call me Stanley, the Aga Kaga said. The other routine is just toplease some of the old fools\u2014I mean the more conservative membersof my government. They're still gnawing their beards and kickingthemselves because their ancestors dropped science in favor of alchemyand got themselves stranded in a cultural dead end. This charade issupposed to prove they were right all along. However, I've no timeto waste in neurotic compensations. I have places to go and deeds toaccomplish.     At first glance, Retief said, it looks as though the places arealready occupied, and the deeds are illegal.   <doc-sep> The Aga Kaga guffawed. For a diplomat, you speak plainly, Retief. Haveanother drink. He poured, eyeing Georges. What of M. Duror? How doeshe feel about it?     Georges took a thoughtful swallow of whiskey. Not bad, he said. Butnot quite good enough to cover the odor of goats.     The Aga Kaga snorted. I thought the goats were overdoing it a bitmyself, he said. Still, the graybeards insisted. And I need theirsupport.     Also, Georges said distinctly, I think you're soft. You lie aroundletting women wait on you, while your betters are out doing an honestday's work.     The Aga Kaga looked startled. Soft? I can tie a knot in an iron baras big as your thumb. He popped a grape into his mouth. As for therest, your pious views about the virtues of hard labor are as childishas my advisors' faith in the advantages of primitive plumbing. As formyself, I am a realist. If two monkeys want the same banana, in the endone will have it, and the other will cry morality. The days of my yearsare numbered, praise be to God. While they last, I hope to eat well,hunt well, fight well and take my share of pleasure. I leave to othersthe arid satisfactions of self-denial and other perversions.     You admit you're here to grab our land, then, Georges said. That'sthe damnedest piece of bare-faced aggression\u2014     Ah, ah! The Aga Kaga held up a hand. Watch your vocabulary, mydear sir. I'm sure that 'justifiable yearnings for territorialself-realization' would be more appropriate to the situation. Orpossibly 'legitimate aspirations, for self-determination of formerlyexploited peoples' might fit the case. Aggression is, by definition,an activity carried on only by those who have inherited the mantle ofColonial Imperialism.     Imperialism! Why, you Aga Kagans have been the most notoriousplanet-grabbers in Sector history, you\u2014you\u2014     Call me Stanley. The Aga Kaga munched a grape. I merely face therealities of popular folk-lore. Let's be pragmatic; it's a matter ofhistorical association. Some people can grab land and pass it offlightly as a moral duty; others are dubbed imperialist merely forholding onto their own. Unfair, you say. But that's life, my friends.And I shall continue to take every advantage of it.     We'll fight you! Georges bellowed. He took another gulp of whiskeyand slammed the glass down. You won't take this world without astruggle!     Another? the Aga Kaga said, offering the bottle. Georges glowered ashis glass was filled. The Aga Kaga held the glass up to the light.     Excellent color, don't you agree? He turned his eyes on Georges.     It's pointless to resist, he said. We have you outgunned andoutmanned. Your small nation has no chance against us. But we'reprepared to be generous. You may continue to occupy such areas as we donot immediately require until such time as you're able to make otherarrangements.     And by the time we've got a crop growing out of what was bare rock,you'll be ready to move in, the Boyar Chef d'Regime snapped. Butyou'll find that we aren't alone!   <doc-sep> That would have been a mistake, said Retief. The Aga Kagans aretough customers. They're active on half a dozen worlds at the moment.They've been building up for this push for the last five years. Ashow of resistance by you Boyars without Corps backing would be aninvitation to slaughter\u2014with the excuse that you started it.     So what are we going to do? Sit here and watch these goat-herders takeover our farms and fisheries?     Those goat-herders aren't all they seem. They've got a first-classmodern navy.     I've seen 'em. They camp in goat-skin tents, gallop around onanimal-back, wear dresses down to their ankles\u2014     The 'goat-skin' tents are a high-polymer plastic, made in the samefactory that turns out those long flowing bullet-proof robes youmention. The animals are just for show. Back home they use helis andground cars of the most modern design.     The Chef d'Regime chewed his cigar.     Why the masquerade?     Something to do with internal policies, I suppose.     So we sit tight and watch 'em take our world away from us. That's whatI get for playing along with you, Retief. We should have clobberedthese monkeys as soon as they set foot on our world.     Slow down, I haven't finished yet. There's still the Note.     I've got plenty of paper already. Rolls and rolls of it.     Give diplomatic processes a chance, said Retief. The Note hasn'teven been delivered yet. Who knows? We may get surprising results.     If you expect me to supply a runner for the purpose, you're out ofluck. From what I hear, he's likely to come back with his ears stuffedin his hip pocket.     I'll deliver the Note personally, Retief said. I could use a coupleof escorts\u2014preferably strong-arm lads.     The Chef d'Regime frowned, blew out a cloud of smoke. I wasn't kiddingabout these Aga Kagans, he said. I hear they have some nasty habits.I don't want to see you operated on with the same knives they use toskin out the goats.     I'd be against that myself. Still, the mail must go through.     Strong-arm lads, eh? What have you got in mind, Retief?     A little muscle in the background is an old diplomatic custom, Retiefsaid.     The Chef d'Regime stubbed out his cigar thoughtfully. I used to be apretty fair elbow-wrestler myself, he said. Suppose I go along...?     That, said Retief, should lend just the right note of solidarity toour little delegation. He hitched his chair closer. Now, depending onwhat we run into, here's how we'll play it....      II     Eight miles into the rolling granite hills west of the capital, ablack-painted official air-car flying the twin flags of Chief of Stateand Terrestrial Minister skimmed along a foot above a pot-holed road.Slumped in the padded seat, the Boyar Chef d'Regime waved his cigarglumly at the surrounding hills.     Fifty years ago this was bare rock, he said. We've bred specialstrains of bacteria here to break down the formations into soil, and wefollowed up with a program of broad-spectrum fertilization. We plannedto put the whole area into crops by next year. Now it looks like thegoats will get it.     Will that scrubland support a crop? Retief said, eyeing thelichen-covered knolls.     Sure. We start with legumes and follow up with cereals. Wait until yousee this next section. It's an old flood plain, came into productionthirty years ago. One of our finest\u2014     The air-car topped a rise. The Chef dropped his cigar and half rose,with a hoarse yell. A herd of scraggly goats tossed their heads among astand of ripe grain. The car pulled to a stop. Retief held the Boyar'sarm.     Keep calm, Georges, he said. Remember, we're on a diplomaticmission. It wouldn't do to come to the conference table smelling ofgoats.     Let me at 'em! Georges roared. I'll throttle 'em with my bare hands!     A bearded goat eyed the Boyar Chef sardonically, jaw working. Look atthat long-nosed son! The goat gave a derisive bleat and took anothermouthful of ripe grain.     Did you see that? Georges yelled. They've trained the son of a\u2014     Chin up, Georges, Retief said. We'll take up the goat problem alongwith the rest.     I'll murder 'em!     Hold it, Georges. Look over there.     A hundred yards away, a trio of brown-cloaked horsemen topped a rise,paused dramatically against the cloudless pale sky, then gallopeddown the slope toward the car, rifles bobbing at their backs, cloaksbillowing out behind. Side by side they rode, through the brown-goldengrain, cutting three narrow swaths that ran in a straight sweep fromthe ridge to the air-car where Retief and the Chef d'Regime hovered,waiting.     Georges scrambled for the side of the car. Just wait 'til I get myhands on him!     Retief pulled him back. Sit tight and look pleased, Georges. Nevergive the opposition a hint of your true feelings. Pretend you're a goatlover\u2014and hand me one of your cigars.     The three horsemen pulled up in a churn of chaff and a clatter ofpebbles. Georges coughed, batting a hand at the settling dust. Retiefpeeled the cigar unhurriedly, sniffed, at it and thumbed it alight. Hedrew at it, puffed out a cloud of smoke and glanced casually at thetrio of Aga Kagan cavaliers.     Peace be with you, he intoned in accent-free Kagan. May your shadowsnever grow less.  "

        "Query": "What is the backdrop of the story \"The Desert and the Stars\"?",
        "Summary_1": "The story\u2019s beginning takes place at the headquarters for the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne where Retief works, but the rest of the story takes place on the planet Flamme. Sixty years earlier, the Boyars settled on Flamme and set about making it suitable for farming by clearing the jungle, descumming the seas, irrigating the deserts, and setting out forests. For sixty years, the Boyars inhabited the planet by themselves, with only the saurian wildlife presenting a danger to them. Flamme is now a thriving planet. It has a Government House with comfortable lounge furniture, waiters in white jackets, colorful flowers, a lake, a lawn, and colorful flowerbeds. It also has beautiful sunsets. Outside the capital, there are rolling hills of granite. Flamme\u2019s main industry seems to be agriculture; fifty years ago they had bare rock, but they bred special strains of bacteria that broke the rock down to soil where they raised legumes and then grains. The Boyars also have oyster breeding beds. There are roads, although they have pot-holes, and air-cars for transportation. The Aga Kaban headquarters is a large black tent featuring air conditioning and a pennant featuring a lion \u201ccouchant in crimson on a field verte.\u201d It has the smell of incense, and someone is playing stringed instruments inside. There are colorful decorations in gold, blue, silver, and green. The Aga Kaba are accustomed to the finer things in life; Stanley even blows his nose on silk cloth. Their foods include grapes, oranges, and bananas, and their beverages include whiskey. Everything about the Aga Kaba\u2019s leader\u2019s tent suggests wealth and luxury.\n",
        "Summary_2": "The story is set on the planet of Flamme, which has been terraformed over the last sixty years into a habitable landscape for crop culture and fishing. It opens in the Corps offices where Retief meets with the Under-Secretary.\n\nRetief travels to a fancy government house of the Boyar Chief d\u2019Regime, Georges, that includes a waitstaff and an expansive verandah.\n\nThe diplomatic party travels eight miles west of the capital in a black official air-car flying twin flags of Chief of State and Terrestrial Minister. It continues on some unknown distance through granite hills to the opulent tent of the Exalted Ruler of the Aga Kaga. The tent is outfitted with rich rugs, stringed instruments playing and female slaves serving the men. The rest of the story takes place in this tent.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Much of The Desert and the Stars by Keither Laumer takes place on a previously barren, uninhabitable planet made fertile by the Boyars. After almost 100 years dedicated to terraforming the planet Flamme, the Boyars finally succeeded in making the planet habitable. With very advanced technology, they made the ground ripe and fertile, wheat stalks and barley floating in the wind. Oysters lie in the pools of water, and the great boulders and rock formations that will soon be eroded by a special bacteria will eventually host more crops. Their sunsets are striking and colorful, with beautiful poplar trees and well-maintained flower beds. \nRetief stays at the Government House with Georges, the Boyar Chef d\u2019Regime. The house overlooks a lake and is surrounding by beautiful gardens. \nThe Aga Kagans have taken over more of the rocky areas, introducing goats into the ecosystem. Their unwanted presence takes away from the belabored beauty that the Boyars created. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Most of the story takes place on Flamme, a planet occupied by the Boyars, the people who terraformed it, but more recently also occupied by the Aga Kagans. There is also a presence of the people from Earth, who work under the umbrella of the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne. In the capital city of Flamme, the view from the Government House is gorgeous, with various trees and flowers planted that seem to glow in the purple and red sunset of the planet. Outside of the capital, among the hills, it is less beautified and the streets have potholes. This area used to be covered entirely in rock, but the hills were created by the terraforming and fertilization technology of the Boyars. There are a lot of goats on these hills now, because of the Aga Kagans, and past this area there are stretches of sand and other green areas, which is where the Aga Kagan leaders are. \n",

That was the Doppler effect as the star'sradial velocity changed relative to the      Quest III     , as for forty hoursthe ship had decelerated.     They had seen many such stars come near out of the galaxy's glitteringbackdrop, and had seen them dwindle, turn red and go out as the      QuestIII     drove on its way once more, lashed by despair toward the speed oflight, leaving behind the mockery of yet another solitary and lifelessluminary unaccompanied by worlds where men might dwell. They had grownsated with the sight of wonders\u2014of multiple systems of giant stars, ofnebulae that sprawled in empty flame across light years.     But now unwonted excitement possessed the hundred-odd members of the      Quest III's     crew. It was a subdued excitement; men and women, theycame and stood quietly gazing into the big vision screens that showedthe oncoming star, and there were wide-eyed children who had been bornin the ship and had never seen a planet. The grownups talked in lowvoices, in tones of mingled eagerness and apprehension, of what mightlie at the long journey's end. For the      Quest III     was coming home; thesun ahead was      the     Sun, whose rays had warmed their lives' beginning.   <doc-sep> In the evening a girl brought Maitland his meal. As the door slidaside, he automatically stood up, and they stared at each other forseveral seconds.     She had the high cheekbones and almond eyes of an Oriental, skin thatglowed like gold in the evening light, yet thick coiled braids ofblonde hair that glittered like polished brass. Shorts and a sleevelessblouse of some thick, reddish, metallic-looking fabric clung to herbody, and over that she was wearing a light, ankle-length cloak of whatseemed to be white wool.     She was looking at him with palpable curiosity and something likeexpectancy. Maitland sighed and said, Hello, then glanced downself-consciously at his wrinkled green pajamas.       She smiled, put the tray of food on the table, and swept out, her cloakbillowing behind her. Maitland remained standing, staring at the closeddoor for a minute after she was gone.     Later, when he had finished the steak and corn on the cob and shreddedcarrots, and a feeling of warm well-being was diffusing from hisstomach to his extremities, he sat down on the bed to watch the sunsetand to think.     There were three questions for which he required answers before hecould formulate any plan or policy.     Where was he?     Who was Swarts?     What was the purpose of the tests he was being given?     It was possible, of course, that this was all an elaborate schemefor getting military secrets, despite Swarts' protestations to thecontrary. Maitland frowned. This place certainly didn't have theappearance of a military establishment, and so far there had beennothing to suggest the kind of interrogation to be expected fromforeign intelligence officers.     It might be better to tackle the first question first. He looked atthe Sun, a red spheroid already half below the horizon, and tried tothink of a region that had this kind of terrain. That prairie out therewas unique. Almost anywhere in the world, land like that would becultivated, not allowed to go to grass.     This might be somewhere in Africa....     He shook his head, puzzled. The Sun disappeared and its blood-huedglow began to fade from the sky. Maitland sat there, trying to gethold of the problem from an angle where it wouldn't just slip away.After a while the western sky became a screen of clear luminous blue,a backdrop for a pure white brilliant star. As always at that sight,Maitland felt his worry drain away, leaving an almost mystical sense ofpeace and an undefinable longing.     Venus, the most beautiful of the planets.     Maitland kept track of them all in their majestic paths through theconstellations, but Venus was his favorite. Time and time again hehad watched its steady climb higher and higher in the western sky,its transient rule there as evening star, its progression toward thehorizon, and loved it equally in its      alter ego     of morning star. Venuswas an old friend. An old friend....     Something icy settled on the back of his neck, ran down his spine, anddiffused into his body. He stared at the planet unbelievingly, fistsclenched, forgetting to breathe.     Last night Venus hadn't been there.     Venus was a morning star just now....       Just now!       He realized the truth in that moment.   <doc-sep>    The Sense of Wonder     By MILTON LESSER     Illustrated by HARRY ROSENBAUM     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Galaxy Science Fiction September 1951.

Every day for a week now, Rikud had come to the viewport to watchthe great changeless sweep of space. He could not quite explain thefeelings within him; they were so alien, so unnatural. But ever sincethe engines somewhere in the rear of the world had changed their tone,from the steady whining Rikud had heard all twenty-five years of hislife, to the sullen roar that came to his ears now, the feelings hadgrown.     If anyone else had noticed the change, he failed to mention it. Thisdisturbed Rikud, although he could not tell why. And, because he hadrealized this odd difference in himself, he kept it locked up insidehim.     Today, space looked somehow different. The stars\u2014it was a meaninglessconcept to Rikud, but that was what everyone called the brightpinpoints of light on the black backdrop in the viewport\u2014were notapparent in the speckled profusion Rikud had always known.

Rikud knew he should be exercising now, or bathing in the rays of thehealth-lamps. It had never occurred to him that he didn't feel like it;he just didn't, without comprehending.     Chuls' reminder fostered uneasiness. Often Rikud had dreamed of thetime he would be thirty and a father. Whom would the Calculator selectas his mate? The first time this idea had occurred to him, Rikudignored it. But it came again, and each time it left him with a feelinghe could not explain. Why should he think thoughts that no other manhad? Why should he think he was thinking such thoughts, when it alwaysembroiled him in a hopeless, infinite confusion that left him with aheadache?     Chuls said, It is time for my bath in the health-rays. I saw you hereand knew it was your time, too....     His voice trailed off. Rikud knew that something which he could notexplain had entered the elder man's head for a moment, but it haddeparted almost before Chuls knew of its existence.     I'll go with you, Rikud told him.

        "Query": "How does history play a part in THE DESERT AND THE STARS?",
        "Summary_1": "The history of Flamme itself is of great relevance to its value to both the Boyars and the Aga Kagans. When the Boyars settled the planet sixty years ago, it was habitable but unable to support much agriculture. They have spent sixty years terraforming Flamme, clearing jungles, descumming seas, irrigating deserts, and planting forests. Fifty years ago, the Boyars learned how to breed a special strain of bacteria that breaks down the granite that covered much of the surface. The granite breaks down to soil, and the Boyars add broad-spectrum fertilizer to make the land arable. The Boyars now have many fields of crops and are continuing to develop new sections for more. Their many years of intensive work in creating farming land and growing crops gives them a vested interest in their settlement.\nThe Aga Kagans are involved in empire-building. They have sent what appear to be goat herders and fishermen to Flamme to begin taking over the land. The goat herders are all male and have rocket launchers. They present a false appearance as homesteaders who lack access to modern technology; in reality, their tents are high-polymer plastic, and their robes are bullet-proof. On their home planet, they have helis and ground cars. The homesteaders set up camp in the middle of farm fields, allow their goats to graze on the crops, and cook their sheep\u2019s brains over dung fires. The fishermen are actually the Aga Kagan navy who come equipped with 40 mm infinite repeaters. The CDT knows that the Aga Kagans have been using this same method of invasion for the past five years in six other worlds. The Aga Kagans hide their modern technology in the places they are invading to dupe the people they are intruding on and to please the older conservatives in their government. \nThe Aga Kagans\u2019 approach to empire-building is based on their knowledge of Earth history. While their society has modern technology, their false appearance of third world trappings can be used to justify their invasions into \u201cmore advanced\u201d societies. Stanley admits the Aga Kagans move into an area after others have done the hard work of building the community and civilization so that the Aga Kagans can enjoy the fruits of the others\u2019 labors. By appearing to be a third world civilization, the Aga Kagans can defend their actions and gain empathy with a claim of \u201clegitimate aspirations, for self-determination of formerly exploited peoples.\u201d Stanley also acknowledges his familiarity with empire-builders on Earth and claims he won\u2019t make their mistake of going \u201ctoo far, too fast.\u201d He couches their approach as \u201can ancient and honorable custom\u201d and references Mein Kampf, the Communist Manifesto, and Leung\u2019s the Porcelain Wall. Based on the histories of the men behind these works, Stanley knows that the CDT will follow the practice of appeasement and allow the Aga Kagans to make their little land-grabs until they are positioned so that they cannot be stopped.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Stanley manipulates a historically exploited group, the Aga Kagan, to gain power. Stanley appears to be interested in exploiting whatever means necessary to acquire such power, and has positioned himself as the Exalted Ruler of the Aga Kagan to do so. He speaks negatively about the Aga Kagan and their elders which he pays lip service to, but ultimately executes his own strategies that may or may not be in line with the historical actions of their people. Stanley uses the history of the Aga Kagan as formerly exploited people to place the Corps into a complicated diplomatic situation to get his way that he relishes in and laughs about during the diplomatic visit from Retief and Georges.",
        "Summary_3": "The leader of the Aga Kagans uses history as a way to justify his actions and prove to himself and others that he will face little to no resistance in the process. He references colonial imperialism, colonization, and some of the most hated figures in history as his predecessors. By relying on the Corps silence, he truly believes that he will be able to conquer Flamme, destroy the Boyars, and do all this without any humanitarian uprising. \nBy taking it slow and biding their times, the Aga Kagans will acquire their empire slowly but surely. Based on previous knowledge, the Aga truly believes that the Corps will simply accept their invasion, so long as they don\u2019t move too quickly. He cites Hitler, Leung, and Stalin as references: these people moved too far too fast. \nHistory also sets up the present conflict. Sixty years earlier, the Corps encouraged and asked the Boyars to terraform Flamme and transform it into something beautiful. The Boyars did so, believing the Corps wwere on their side. Now, half a century later with the Aga Kagans encroaching on their territory, the Boyars are waiting for their previously promised Corps support and coming up empty. Interestingly enough, the Boyars asked the Aga Kagans to co-settle Flamme with them, but both the Corps and the Aga Kagans refused. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Flamme had been a wasteland, but was terraformed by the Boyars. The planet itself has a lot of history, which is part of the current conflict. The Aga Kagans had not wanted to help terraform the planet, but now that the hard work was done over many decades, they wanted to move in. History also plays a role in communication more generally. The Aga Kagans communicate in proverbs, which act as idioms referencing specific historical events. The Aga Kagans are also familiar with the history of other cultures, and aim to control the narrative of the history of various planets, deciding who is considered a warmonger versus labeling their own takeovers in a positive light. The Aga Kaga knows a lot about the history of Earth as well, and cites a number of historical events to Reteif during their impassioned discussion, along with names of famous historical manifestos. The Aga Kaga tries to use these historical events as points in an analogy, much like the proverbs his people communicate with regularly.  ",
        "Article": "We played. Tune after tune.John knew them all, from thelatest pop melodies to a swing versionof the classic      Rhapsody of TheStars     . He was a quiet guy duringthe next couple of hours, and gettingmore than a few words fromhim seemed as hard as extracting atooth. He'd stand by his fiddle\u2014Imean, his      Zloomph     \u2014with a dreamyexpression in those watery eyes,staring at nothing.     But after one number he studiedFat Boy's clarinet for a moment.Nice clarinet, he mused. Has anunusual hole in the front.     Fat Boy scratched the back ofhis head. You\u2014you mean here?Where the music comes out?     John Smith nodded. Unusual.     Hummm, I thought again.     Awhile later I caught him eyeingmy piano keyboard. What'sthe matter, John?     He pointed.     Oh, there, I said. A cigarettefell out of my ashtray, burnt a holein the key. If The Eye sees it, he'llswear at me in seven languages.     Even there, he said softly,even there....     There was no doubt about it.John Smith was peculiar, but hewas the best bass man this side of amusician's Nirvana.     It didn't take a genius to figureout our situation. Item one: Goon-Face'scountenance had evidencedan excellent imitation of Mephistophelesbefore John began to play.Item two: Goon-Face had beamedlike a kitten with a quart of creamafter John began to play.     Conclusion: If we wanted tokeep eating, we'd have to persuadeJohn Smith to join our combo.     At intermission I said, Howabout a drink, John? Maybe a shotof wine-syrup?     He shook his head.     Then maybe a Venusian fizz?     His grunt was negative.     Then some old-fashioned beer?     He smiled. Yes, I      like     beer.     I escorted him to the bar and assistedhim in his arduous climb ontoa stool.     John, I ventured after he'dtaken an experimental sip, wherehave you been hiding? A guy likeyou should be playing every night.     John yawned. Just got here. FiguredI might need some money soI went to the union. Then I workedon my plan.     Then you need a job. Howabout playing with us steady? Welike your style a lot.     He made a long, low hummingsound which I interpreted as anexpression of intense concentration.I don't know, he finally drawled.     It'd be a steady job, John. Inspirationstruck me. And listen, Ihave an apartment. It's got everything,solar shower, automatic chef,'copter landing\u2014if we ever get a'copter. Plenty of room there fortwo people. You can stay with meand it won't cost you a cent. Andwe'll even pay you over unionwages.     His watery gaze wandered lazilyto the bar mirror, down to the glitteringarray of bottles and then outto the dance floor.     He yawned again and spokeslowly, as if each word were a leadenweight cast reluctantly from histongue:     No, I don't ... care much ...about playing.     What      do     you like to do, John?     His string-bean of a body stiffened.I like to study ancient history ...and I must work on myplan.     Oh Lord, that plan again!     I took a deep breath. Tell meabout it, John. It      must     be interesting.     He made queer clicking noiseswith his mouth that reminded meof a mechanical toy being woundinto motion. The whole foundationof this or any other culture isbased on the history of all the timedimensions, each interwoven withthe other, throughout the ages. Andthe holes provide a means of studyingall of it first hand.       Oh, oh     , I thought.      But you stillhave to eat. Remember, you stillhave to eat.       Trouble is, he went on, thereare so many holes in this universe.     Holes? I kept a straight face.     Certainly. Look around you. Allyou see is holes. These beer bottlesare just holes surrounded by glass.The doors and windows\u2014they'reholes in walls. The mine tunnelsmake a network of holes under thedesert. Caves are holes, animals livein holes, our faces have holes,clothes have holes\u2014millions andmillions of holes!     I winced and thought, humorhim because you gotta eat, yougotta eat.     His voice trembled with emotion.Why, they're everywhere. They'rein pots and pans, in pipes, in rocketjets, in bumpy roads. There are buttonholesand well holes, and shoelaceholes. There are doughnutholes and stocking holes and woodpeckerholes and cheese holes.Oceans lie in holes in the earth,and rivers and canals and valleys.The craters of the Moon are holes.Everything is\u2014     But, John, I said as patiently aspossible, what have these holesgot to do with you?     He glowered at me as if I wereunworthy of such a confidence.What have they to do with me?he shrilled. I can't find the rightone\u2014that's what!     I closed my eyes. Which particularhole are you looking for, John?     He was speaking rapidly againnow.     I was hurrying back to the Universitywith the      Zloomph     to provea point of ancient history to thosefools. They don't believe that instrumentswhich make music actuallyexisted before the tapes! Itwas dark\u2014and some fool researcherhad forgotten to set a force-fieldover the hole\u2014I fell through.     I closed my eyes. Now wait aminute. Did you drop something,lose it in the hole\u2014is that why youhave to find it?     Oh I didn't lose anything important,he snapped,       just     my owntime dimension. And if I don't getback they will think I couldn't provemy theory, that I'm ashamed tocome back, and I'll be discredited.     His chest sagged for an instant.Then he straightened. But there'sstill time for my plan to work out\u2014withthe relative difference takeninto account. Only I get so tiredjust thinking about it.     Yes, I can see where thinkingabout it would tire any one.     He nodded. But it can't be toofar away.     I'd like to hear more about it,I said. But if you're not going toplay with us\u2014     Oh, I'll play with you, hebeamed. I can talk to      you     .      You     understand.     Thank heaven!   <doc-sep> A tall man, clad in a claw-hammer coat, came out from the wings andadvanced to the footlights.     People of Swamp City, he said, bowing, permit me to introducemyself. I am Doctor Universe, and these are my nine experts.     There was a roar of applause from the      Satellite     audience. When it hadsubsided, the man continued:     As most of you are familiar with our program, it will be unnecessaryto give any advance explanation. I will only say that on this stage arenine visi sets, each tuned to one of the nine planets. At transmittingsets all over these planets listeners will appear and voice questions.These questions, my nine experts will endeavor to answer. For everyquestion missed, the sender will receive a check for one thousand      planetoles     .     One thing more. As usual we have with us a guest star who will matchher wits with the experts. May I present that renowned writer ofscience fiction, Annabella C. Flowers.     From the left wing Grannie Annie appeared. She bowed and took her placeon the dais.     The Doctor's program began. The operator of the Earth visi twisted hisdials and nodded. Blue light flickered on the pantascope panel tocoalesce slowly into the face of a red-haired man. Sharp and dear hisvoice echoed through the theater:           Who was the first Earthman to titter the sunward side of Mercury?          Doctor Universe nodded and turned to Grannie Annie who had raised herhand. She said quietly:     Charles Zanner in the year 2012. In a specially constructedtracto-car.     And so it went. Questions from Mars, from Earth, from Saturn flowed inthe visi sets. Isolated miners on Jupiter, dancers in swank Plutoniancafes strove to stump the experts. With Doctor Universe offeringbantering side play, the experts gave their answers. When they failed,or when the Truthicator flashed a red light, he announced the name ofthe winner.     It grew a little tiresome after a while and I wondered why Grannie hadbrought me here. And then I began to notice things.     The audience in the      Satellite     seemed to have lost much of itsoriginal fervor. They applauded as before but they did so only at thesignal of Doctor Universe. The spell created by the man was complete.     Pompous and erect, he strode back and forth across the stage like ageneral surveying his army. His black eyes gleamed, and his thin lipswere turned in a smile of satisfaction.     When the last question had been answered I joined the exit-movingcrowd. It was outside under the street marquee that a strange incidentoccurred.     A yellow-faced Kagor from the upper Martian desert country shuffled by,dragging his cumbersome third leg behind him. Kagors, of course, had anunpleasant history of persecution since the early colonization days ofthe Red Planet. But the thing that happened there was a throw back toan earlier era.     Someone shouted, Yah, yellow-face! Down with all Kagors! As oneman the crowd took up the cry and surged forward. The helpless Kagorwas seized and flung to the pavement. A knife appeared from nowhere,snipped the Martian's single lock of hair. A booted foot bludgeonedinto his mouth.     Moments later an official hydrocar roared up and a dozen I.P. menrushed out and scattered the crowd. But a few stragglers lingered toshout derisive epithets.     Grannie Annie came out from behind the box office then. She took my armand led me around a corner and through a doorway under a sign that readTHE JET. Inside was a deep room with booths along one wall. The placewas all but deserted.     In a booth well toward the rear the old lady surveyed me with sobereyes.     Billy-boy, did you see the way that crowd acted?     I nodded. As disgraceful an exhibition as I've ever seen. The I.P. menought to clamp down.     The I.P. men aren't strong enough.     She said it quietly, but there was a glitter in her eyes and a harshline about her usually smiling lips.     What do you mean?   <doc-sep>    HOW TO MAKE FRIENDS     By JIM HARMON     Illustrated by WEST     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Galaxy Magazine October 1962.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]       Every lonely man tries to make friends.     Manet just didn't know when to stop!      William Manet was alone.     In the beginning, he had seen many advantages to being alone. It wouldgive him an unprecedented opportunity to once and for all correlateloneliness to the point of madness, to see how long it would take himto start slavering and clawing the pin-ups from the magazines, to beginteaching himself classes in philosophy consisting of interminablelectures to a bored and captive audience of one.     He would be able to measure the qualities of peace and decide whetherit was really better than war, he would be able to get as fat and asdirty as he liked, he would be able to live more like an animal andthink more like a god than any man for generations.     But after a shorter time than he expected, it all got to be a tearingbore. Even the waiting to go crazy part of it.     Not that he was going to have any great long wait of it. He was alreadytalking to himself, making verbal notes for his lectures, and he hadcut out a picture of Annie Oakley from an old book. He tacked it up andwinked at it whenever he passed that way.     Lately she was winking back at him.     Loneliness was a physical weight on his skull. It peeled the flesh fromhis arms and legs and sandpapered his self-pity to a fine sensitivity.     No one on Earth was as lonely as William Manet, and even William Manetcould only be this lonely on Mars.     Manet was Atmosphere Seeder Station 131-47's own human.     All Manet had to do was sit in the beating aluminum heart in the middleof the chalk desert and stare out, chin cupped in hands, at the flat,flat pavement of dirty talcum, at the stars gleaming as hard in theblack sky as a starlet's capped teeth ... stars two of which were moonsand one of which was Earth. He had to do nothing else. The wholegimcrack was cybernetically controlled, entirely automatic. No one wasneeded here\u2014no human being, at least.     The Workers' Union was a pretty small pressure group, but it didn'ttake much to pressure the Assembly. Featherbedding had been carefullyspecified, including an Overseer for each of the Seeders to honeycombMars, to prepare its atmosphere for colonization.     They didn't give tests to find well-balanced, well-integrated peoplefor the job. Well-balanced, well-integrated men weren't going toisolate themselves in a useless job. They got, instead, William Manetand his fellows.     The Overseers were to stay as long as the job required. Passenger fareto Mars was about one billion dollars. They weren't providing commuterservice for night shifts. They weren't providing accommodationsfor couples when the law specified only one occupant. They weren'tproviding fuel (at fifty million dollars a gallon) for visits betweenthe various Overseers. They weren't very providential.     But it was two hundred thousand a year in salary, and it offeredwonderful opportunities.     It gave William Manet an opportunity to think he saw a spaceship makinga tailfirst landing on the table of the desert, its tail burning asbright as envy.  "

        "Query": "What is the significance of the Aga Kagans in THE DESERT AND THE STARS?",
        "Summary_1": "The Aga Kagans are an empire-building society that has been increasing their presence in six other worlds by the time they appear on Flamme. The Aga Kagans send in men disguised as goat herders and fishermen who are actually armed and equipped with modern accessories. The Aga Kagans have a plan to build their empire by invading other worlds following the model of Adolf Hitler, but they plan to avoid his mistake of moving \u201ctoo far, too fast.\u201d The Aga Kagan leader, Stanley, is well-educated and a manipulator. He plays to the older conservative Aga Kagans by allowing the third-world trappings of goat herders to be used while he actually has disdain for their traditional values, but his charade gives him what he wants. The Aga Kagans wait until an area has done the hard work of building its civilization and becoming sustainable before he moves his men in. Although the CDT is aware of the Aga Kagans\u2019 actions, it wants to avoid warfare and meets the intrusions with diplomacy, but all the while, the Aga Kagans are ensconcing themselves for a permanent takeover of the places where they have intruded.\n",
        "Summary_2": "In the story, the Aga Kagan are portrayed as antagonists to the Boyar. They appear to be manipulated by Stanley into actions that may no longer be entirely in line with the beliefs of the Aga Kagan elders.\nThe Aga Kagans are a group that has been moving onto the planet Flamme for the past five years. They\u2019ve landed military equipment that suggests they are willing to move in violently if necessary, but have not yet been met with resistance from the Boyar who have been living on the planet for sixty years. \n\n",
        "Summary_3": "The Aga Kagans are a conquering people, known for their planet-grabbing tendencies. They have currently set up shop on the Boyer-populated planet, Flamme. After the Boyers spent 60 years redoing the planet and making it fertile and inhabitable, the Aga Kagans swooped in and are plotting an extremely slow invasion. They arrived with long robes and goat-skin tents, as well as lots and lots of goats. However, these robes and tents are actually made out of a special bullet-proof material. The goats were just for show. \nWith an incredible arsenal, an army of \u201chomesteaders,\u201d and armor to match, the Aga Kagans are fully prepared to invade the Boyers. They are the antagonist of the story, especially their leader, the Aga Kaga or Stanley, as he likes to be called. \n",
        "Summary_4": "The Aga Kagans seem to be making a move on the territory that the Boyars consider theirs. The Aga Kagans making a claim on this land could be an act of war, and the Corps wants to avoid a war as much as possible. They ruin some of what the Boyars have created, including an oyster breeding bed. They're on at least six planets and have spent at least the past five years trying to expand their territories. In this way, they act as the antagonists of the story, as a group that presents a challenge for the Boyars and the people from Earth to work against. ",
        "Article": "   THE DESERT AND THE STARS     BY KEITH LAUMER     The Aga Kaga wanted peace\u2014a     piece of everything in sight!     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Worlds of If Science Fiction, November 1962.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      I'm not at all sure, Under-Secretary Sternwheeler said, that I fullyunderstand the necessity for your ... ah ... absenting yourself fromyour post of duty, Mr. Retief. Surely this matter could have been dealtwith in the usual way\u2014assuming any action is necessary.     I had a sharp attack of writer's cramp, Mr. Secretary, Retief said.So I thought I'd better come along in person\u2014just to be sure I waspositive of making my point.     Eh?     Why, ah, there were a number of dispatches, Deputy Under-SecretaryMagnan put in. Unfortunately, this being end-of-the-fiscal-year time,we found ourselves quite inundated with reports. Reports, reports,reports\u2014     Not criticizing the reporting system, are you, Mr. Magnan? theUnder-Secretary barked.     Gracious, no, Magnan said. I love reports.     It seems nobody's told the Aga Kagans about fiscal years, Retiefsaid. They're going right ahead with their program of land-grabbing onFlamme. So far, I've persuaded the Boyars that this is a matter for theCorps, and not to take matters into their own hands.     The Under-Secretary nodded. Quite right. Carry on along the samelines. Now, if there's nothing further\u2014     Thank you, Mr. Secretary, Magnan said, rising. We certainlyappreciate your guidance.     There is a little something further, said Retief, sitting solidly inhis chair. What's the Corps going to do about the Aga Kagans?     The Under-Secretary turned a liverish eye on Retief. As Ministerto Flamme, you should know that the function of a diplomaticrepresentative is merely to ... what shall I say...?     String them along? Magnan suggested.     An unfortunate choice of phrase, the Under-Secretary said. However,it embodies certain realities of Galactic politics. The Corps mustconcern itself with matters of broad policy.     Sixty years ago the Corps was encouraging the Boyars to settleFlamme, Retief said. They were assured of Corps support.     I don't believe you'll find that in writing, said the Under-Secretaryblandly. In any event, that was sixty years ago. At that time afoothold against Neo-Concordiatist elements was deemed desirable. Nowthe situation has changed.     The Boyars have spent sixty years terraforming Flamme, Retief said.They've cleared jungle, descummed the seas, irrigated deserts, set outforests. They've just about reached the point where they can begin toenjoy it. The Aga Kagans have picked this as a good time to move in.They've landed thirty detachments of 'fishermen'\u2014complete with armoredtrawlers mounting 40 mm infinite repeaters\u2014and another two dozenparties of 'homesteaders'\u2014all male and toting rocket launchers.     Surely there's land enough on the world to afford space to bothgroups, the Under-Secretary said. A spirit of co-operation\u2014   <doc-sep> The leader of the three, a hawk-faced man with a heavy beard,unlimbered his rifle. He fingered it, frowning ferociously.     Have no fear, Retief said, smiling graciously. He who comes as aguest enjoys perfect safety.     A smooth-faced member of the threesome barked an oath and leveled hisrifle at Retief.     Youth is the steed of folly, Retief said. Take care that thebeardless one does not disgrace his house.     The leader whirled on the youth and snarled an order. He lowered therifle, muttering. Blackbeard turned back to Retief.     Begone, interlopers, he said. You disturb the goats.     Provision is not taken to the houses of the generous, Retief said.May the creatures dine well ere they move on.     Hah! The goats of the Aga Kaga graze on the lands of the Aga Kaga.The leader edged his horse close, eyed Retief fiercely. We welcome nointruders on our lands.     To praise a man for what he does not possess is to make him appearfoolish, Retief said. These are the lands of the Boyars. But enoughof these pleasantries. We seek audience with your ruler.     You may address me as 'Exalted One', the leader said. Now dismountfrom that steed of Shaitan.     It is written, if you need anything from a dog, call him 'sir',Retief said. I must decline to impute canine ancestry to a guest. Nowyou may conduct us to your headquarters.     Enough of your insolence! The bearded man cocked his rifle. I couldblow your heads off!     The hen has feathers, but it does not fly, Retief said. We haveasked for escort. A slave must be beaten with a stick; for a free man,a hint is enough.     You mock me, pale one. I warn you\u2014     Only love makes me weep, Retief said. I laugh at hatred.     Get out of the car!     Retief puffed at his cigar, eyeing the Aga Kagan cheerfully. The youthin the rear moved forward, teeth bared.     Never give in to the fool, lest he say, 'He fears me,' Retief said.     I cannot restrain my men in the face of your insults, the bearded AgaKagan roared. These hens of mine have feathers\u2014and talons as well!     When God would destroy an ant, he gives him wings, Retief said.Distress in misfortune is another misfortune.     The bearded man's face grew purple.     Retief dribbled the ash from his cigar over the side of the car.     Now I think we'd better be getting on, he said briskly. I've enjoyedour chat, but we do have business to attend to.     The bearded leader laughed shortly. Does the condemned man beg for theaxe? he enquired rhetorically. You shall visit the Aga Kaga, then.Move on! And make no attempt to escape, else my gun will speak you abrief farewell.     The horsemen glowered, then, at a word from the leader, took positionsaround the car. Georges started the vehicle forward, following theleading rider. Retief leaned back and let out a long sigh.     That was close, he said. I was about out of proverbs.     You sound as though you'd brought off a coup, Georges said. From theexpression on the whiskery one's face, we're in for trouble. What washe saying?     Just a routine exchange of bluffs, Retief said. Now when we getthere, remember to make your flattery sound like insults and yourinsults sound like flattery, and you'll be all right.     These birds are armed. And they don't like strangers, Georges said.Maybe I should have boned up on their habits before I joined thisexpedition.     Just stick to the plan, Retief said. And remember: a handful of luckis better than a camel-load of learning.   <doc-sep> The Aga Kaga guffawed. For a diplomat, you speak plainly, Retief. Haveanother drink. He poured, eyeing Georges. What of M. Duror? How doeshe feel about it?     Georges took a thoughtful swallow of whiskey. Not bad, he said. Butnot quite good enough to cover the odor of goats.     The Aga Kaga snorted. I thought the goats were overdoing it a bitmyself, he said. Still, the graybeards insisted. And I need theirsupport.     Also, Georges said distinctly, I think you're soft. You lie aroundletting women wait on you, while your betters are out doing an honestday's work.     The Aga Kaga looked startled. Soft? I can tie a knot in an iron baras big as your thumb. He popped a grape into his mouth. As for therest, your pious views about the virtues of hard labor are as childishas my advisors' faith in the advantages of primitive plumbing. As formyself, I am a realist. If two monkeys want the same banana, in the endone will have it, and the other will cry morality. The days of my yearsare numbered, praise be to God. While they last, I hope to eat well,hunt well, fight well and take my share of pleasure. I leave to othersthe arid satisfactions of self-denial and other perversions.     You admit you're here to grab our land, then, Georges said. That'sthe damnedest piece of bare-faced aggression\u2014     Ah, ah! The Aga Kaga held up a hand. Watch your vocabulary, mydear sir. I'm sure that 'justifiable yearnings for territorialself-realization' would be more appropriate to the situation. Orpossibly 'legitimate aspirations, for self-determination of formerlyexploited peoples' might fit the case. Aggression is, by definition,an activity carried on only by those who have inherited the mantle ofColonial Imperialism.     Imperialism! Why, you Aga Kagans have been the most notoriousplanet-grabbers in Sector history, you\u2014you\u2014     Call me Stanley. The Aga Kaga munched a grape. I merely face therealities of popular folk-lore. Let's be pragmatic; it's a matter ofhistorical association. Some people can grab land and pass it offlightly as a moral duty; others are dubbed imperialist merely forholding onto their own. Unfair, you say. But that's life, my friends.And I shall continue to take every advantage of it.     We'll fight you! Georges bellowed. He took another gulp of whiskeyand slammed the glass down. You won't take this world without astruggle!     Another? the Aga Kaga said, offering the bottle. Georges glowered ashis glass was filled. The Aga Kaga held the glass up to the light.     Excellent color, don't you agree? He turned his eyes on Georges.     It's pointless to resist, he said. We have you outgunned andoutmanned. Your small nation has no chance against us. But we'reprepared to be generous. You may continue to occupy such areas as we donot immediately require until such time as you're able to make otherarrangements.     And by the time we've got a crop growing out of what was bare rock,you'll be ready to move in, the Boyar Chef d'Regime snapped. Butyou'll find that we aren't alone!  "

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in INNOCENT AT LARGE?",
        "Summary_1": "Peter Matheny is a Martian sociodynamics professor sent to Earth on behalf of the Martian government under the guise of hiring an Earthman who can help manage and improve their export business. Armed with a hundred million dollars, his real mission is to find and enlist the service of a con man who can help the Martians concoct a securities scheme that will net greater profits than their current exports yield (the government hired him because of his experience formulating the Red Ankh Society scheme, which offered to sell bogus wisdom of the Old Martians). Peter is accustomed to the largely-empty deserts of Mars and enjoys the serenity of smoking a pipe while stargazing behind his small home in addition to other quiet hobbies such as reading, playing chess, and collecting minerals. When he arrives on Earth, he feels out of his element and uncomfortable due to the heavy, humid air and massive towers and neon lights he encounters in the crowded city, so he seeks a place where he can sit. He finds a place called \"The Church of Choice,\" where, to his delight, he discovers a number of gambling games in progress despite the ban on such activities on Earth. Because the Martian Constitution specifically allows for gambling, Peter partakes and shoots a successful game of craps. However, he expresses confusion about Earth rules for craps, since the Martian version employs a number of tricks and cheats. After the game, Peter feels uncomfortable again and tries to leave, but he is stopped by a man named Gus Doran, who takes him out for drinks. During their conversation, Peter tells Gus about the struggles of the Martian economy and explains how high Earth taxes and greedy middlemen have cut into the profits from their exports. Over the course of a few more drinks, Peter tells Gus about several frauds the Martians developed in an effort to bolster their economy and accidentally reveals his true intentions for visiting Earth to Gus. This information intrigues Gus who informs Peter that he has contacts that may be able to help. To ensure Peter's trust, Gus uses an oath box and promises not to tell anyone what he learned from Peter that night. Gus then suggests they celebrate by inviting some women to their hotel, and he leaves to make a phone call. He calls his business partner Peri, who is preparing to go on a date with a wealthy marijuana rancher. Gus convinces her to cancel the date and join him at the hotel so that together they can take advantage of Peter's amenability and hustle him out of a million dollars.",
        "Summary_2": "Peri tries to look sexy as she answers the visiphone and realizes it\u2019s Gus Doran on the other end. Gus is unhappy to hear that Peri has a date scheduled with a wealthy Indonesian man, and he tries to convince her to go out with a Martian instead. The Martian has a hundred million dollars available to freely spend, and Gus wants Peri to get some of that cash. She agrees.\n\nPeter Matheny arrives at the United Protectorates on Earth and shows his paperwork to enter the country. He is there on a recruiting mission, and the official advises him to head to the rural areas because no one in the cities would ever leave Earth. Peter walks through the city and wonders why he has been given this assignment. He\u2019s a professor of sociodynamics, and although he has advised the Martian government before, he\u2019s not sure he\u2019s equipped for the gig. He is supposed to find a con man that will work on Mars.\n\nPeter enters the Church of Choice and begins to gamble even though it\u2019s illegal on Earth. When he tries to pick his chips up, he is reminded that he\u2019s not really gambling. He\u2019s at church! Peter is embarrassed and relieved when Gus comes up to him and asks him to have a drink. Gus asks Peter about his background as an Earthman on Mars, and Peter provides Gus with information about why the Martians are so poor and all of the rackets and taxes that make living there and making a livable wage difficult. He explains that he\u2019s on Earth to find someone that can help the Martian people figure out how to appeal to Earthmen to bring in some capital to the red planet. After a few alcoholic drinks, Peter admits that Mars needs a true con-man that can make them lots of money. Gus offers to give Peter some of his acquaintances\u2019 contact information so that he may make some connections. \n \nGus suggests that the two men go get a hotel room, and they book a room at the Jupiter-Astoria. While there, Peter confesses that he wants to tell Gus more about his mission, but he can\u2019t unless Gus promises to keep everything a secret. They call room service for an oath box, and Gus agrees to keep everything hush-hush. Afterwards, Peter admits that the only way the Martians currently make money is through cons. Instead of selling precious Martian relics, they actually just manufacture them at scale and lie to consumers about their value. He also confesses that Junie O\u2019Brien, a little Martian girl who was dying, was a ploy to get Earthmen to send them money. Finally, he reveals that the Red Ankh Society, a group that claims to have knowledge handed down from the Old Martians, is also a con. Gus says that he may have just the right person for this job, but first they need to call the girls and celebrate. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Peter Matheny is a college professor on Mars who is sent to Earth on a diplomatic mission to find a con man to run a con game for the planet so that it can make a lot of money, but his cover story is that he is looking for a business manager for Martian trade. Unbeknownst to him, an Earth con man, Gus Doran, has learned of his arrival and his expense budget of one hundred million dollars and plans to get at least one million dollars from him. He contacts his associate, Peri, a sultry blonde who has luxurious gifts from men she dates, and makes plans for her to be Peter\u2019s date that evening. Matheny first enters The Church of Choice where parishoners can \u201cEnter, Play, and Pray.\u201d It offers gambling, a restaurant, and a bar. He plays a crap game and draws attention when he continually rolls a seven; he thinks the game hasn\u2019t started but has been winning over and over. When Matheny leaves the table, Gus Doran introduces himself and reminds Matheny he left his chips on the table, then invites him for a drink. Matheny appreciates Doran\u2019s company, and the two discuss tourism between Earth and Mars. Matheny focuses on the Martian economy and the need to build it up by attracting more Earth dollars. Mars makes very little money on its exports due to taxes, shipping fees, and so forth, and few tourists from Earth go there because they know the air is harder to breathe, and there are no big cities with entertainment venues, just small towns, villages, and ranches amidst scrub and desert. Mars has dabbled in multiple business ventures to make money, but most have yielded little profit. Matheny tells Doran that what Mars really wants is to operate a sweepstakes. Doran keeps Matheny drinking beer and wins his confidence until Matheny tells him his real purpose, to find someone to run a world-size con game. Doran checks Matheny into the Jupiter-Astoria and arranges for Peri to come to the room, and he tells Matheny he has some contacts who can help him find the person he needs. He even orders an oath box from room service, takes the pill, and puts on the conditioner helmet; then he states the oath that he will not tell anyone what Matheny tells him. Matheny tells him that the current Martians are already running a con game; they built their \u201cancient\u201d ruins for the Billingsworth Expedition to find and manufacture the relics they sell. He also tells Matheny about another con, a little girl on Mars who was a mathematical prodigy but dying of an incurable disease. She collected Earth coins, and sympathetic people sent a billion dollars. The \u201clittle girl\u201d is now their finance minister, and her incurable disease was aging. He also admits the Red Ankh Society is a modern creation. Doran says he thinks he can help Matheny find his con man. \n\n",
        "Summary_4": "Esteemed-escort, Peri, is dressing for a date with Mr. Sastro when she receives a call from Gus Doran. He informs her of a Martian who will pay even more than this heir may and who\u2019s a little unfamiliar with Earth terms. After some bickering, she agrees on 500,000 for payment and calls off the date. Moving backward in time, Peter Matheny arrives on Earth and is questioned by the passport official. He gives him a half-truth and quickly moves on. Matheny was sent to Earth to hire a conman for Mars. Mars has been struggling financially for years now, and their biggest economic ploys are all schemes. \nMatheny stands out on Earth, unaccustomed to the gravity and air here. As well, his clothes are 40-years out of style and mark him as a Martian. Being a professor, Matheny isn\u2019t entirely sure why sent him, but he did devise the Red Ankh Society, one of their schemes. He enters the Church of Choice and decided to play a game of crap. He wants to play for money, but the other churchgoers ward him off. He leaves embarrassed and runs into Gus Doran who brought him his chips. They grab a drink at Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar & Grill, but not before Matheny had already blabbed about half his business. Doran covers the drinks: a beer for Matheny and a whiskey sour for himself. They drink and talk about the Martian economy and how their goods may be pricey, but the real profit is nowhere near as high. Matheny, a little tipsy, tells Doran that they\u2019re looking for an Earth executive, someone who\u2019d make a hundred megabucks a year on a five-year contract. He mentions as well that he has extra money for expenses on Earth, which draws Doran in. Doran reveals he has connections, so Matheny tells him they need a con man. \nThey leave for the Jupiter-Astoria where they encounter sexual chairs. Doran suggests they get a girl, most likely with Peri in mind, and he tells Matheny to get some new clothes. Doran tells Matheny again he has contacts, so Matheny makes him swear under an oath box before he will reveal their true secrets. After, Matheny tells him about their schemes, from the Red Ankh Society to Junie O\u2019Brien. Doran thinks he has the man for Matheny, but first, he suggests going to the bar to celebrate with a girl. \n",

        "Query": "What is the location where the events of INNOCENT AT LARGE take place?",
        "Summary_1": "There are several locations where key events in the story take place including Peri's residence, the immigration office, the Earth city, the Church of Choice, Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar & Grill, and the Jupiter-Astoria hotel. In addition, at various points throughout the narrative, Peter recalls life on Mars, which is covered with deserts and scrub thorn and an atmosphere with drier air and lesser gravity compared to Earth's humidity and strong gravitation. Martian society is largely rural with very small towns and villages, and their weeks are different than those on Earth; they have a day called \"Tenthday\" when Peter likes to play poker with his coworkers, and he sometimes visits a place called Swindletown. Peter often notes the differences between Earth's commercialism and reliance upon automation and Mars' more calm, individualistic society. Peter is overwhelmed by the bright, neon lights, massive towers, and sheer amount of vehicles and people in the city where he arrives on Earth and longs for his small cottage and rock garden back on Mars. To navigate the city, Peter takes cabs, and to access the different levels of the towers, he utilizes the ramp system. Looking for a place to sit, Peter finds The Church of Choice, which seems to be an establishment where people can drink and gamble, although gambling is illegal on Earth. The Church of Choice features craps tables, roulette wheels, and even Bingo and has a large, marble lobby at its entrance that leads into a number of dim rooms with Gothic architecture. After meeting Gus there, the two leave and share drinks at Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar & Grill, a place where diners can talk in private sitting at soundproof booths while enjoying a strip show. The carpeted hotel room he shares with Gus at the Jupiter-Astoria has a pneumatic device that can deliver drinks straight from the bar along with anything else someone may require, such as the oath box Gus uses to cement Peter's trust in him. There is also a bathroom and a \"sexy type of furniture\" that operates like a massage chair.",
        "Summary_2": "The story is set on a city on Earth. Peter Matheny, a college professor, arrives from Mars to find a con-man that can help make Mars a more economically viable place to live. The city on Earth is a shock to Peter. It has neon lights, enormous crowds, and people wearing brightly colored pajamas on the streets. The sky is impossible to see because of the pollution, and the hundreds of buildings are incredibly tall. \n\nPeter refers to Earth as the \"greatest commercial empire the human race has ever seen,\" and everywhere he turns he sees businesses that make loads of money and people opening up their wallets for a good time. People appear only in groups, and they are very organized as if their only true purpose is to band together and collect capital. \n\nPeter goes to the Church of Choice hoping to gamble, but he quickly learns that although the place sells chips like a true gambling parlor, it's all for fun. Later, Peter checks into the Jupiter-Astoria hotel and is impressed by the sexy furniture and expensive-looking fixtures. \n\nEarth is essentially the exact opposite of Mars, where people live in small cottages and have a difficult time making money. There are no major businesses other than the cons that the embassy creates like children with fake diseases that need to collect money for their medical services and mass manufactured Martian relics. \n\n\n",
        "Summary_3": "The story takes place on Earth in the hot, humid month of August. Men wear colorful clothes and are described as looking like\u201ca rainbow\u201d dressed in pajamas and the women as wearing Neo-Sino dresses and goldleaf hats. There is a lot of traffic, and in larger cities, there are multi-colored towers half a mile high that block the stars and moon. Gambling is illegal, but churches make gambling available. There is a lively entertainment industry with nightclubs, bars, strip clubs, etc., in large cities like Newer York. There are provincial, less industrialized regions as well, such as Russia and Congolese Belgium, which some people refer to as the sticks.   \t\nOn Mars, life is more peaceful. Matheny enjoys the quiet rock garden behind his cottage where he can smoke his pipe with Orion for company\u2014when the temperature isn\u2019t too far below zero. People who live there have changed to have longer legs and an expanded chest as a result of the gravity, and the atmosphere makes it harder to hear sounds. Mars has a civilized society with universities, a central government, and specialized organizations such as the Red Ankh Society. Mars lacks much of the technology that exists on Earth, specifically the automation to bring any service you want to you on a twenty-four-hour basis. On Mars, gambling is legal, in part because it relieves the sheer boredom of the deserts. People cheat, and organizations offering gambling have systems that astute players can figure out. Matheny frequently mentions that Mars has a dollar shortage or is poor and suggests that Earth should send tourists to Mars, but Doran points out that the people who do go to Mars come back and complain that there is barely enough air to survive there and that there are no cities, just small towns, villages, and ranches. The landscape is mainly dust, sand, and thorn scrub. Mars needs equipment and supplies from Earth. Whatever Mars exports to Earth requires enormous costs to ship, and after wholesalers and retailers, salespeople, advertisers, and taxes are paid, there is very little profit left. The planet is able to produce paper products, such as postcards, travel posters, and books. It has resorted to con schemes to make more money.\n",
        "Summary_4": "The story takes place on Earth, far into the future where some humans have already begun to colonize Mars. This new Earth is outfitted with modern technology and some Martian goods, like thyle. Gambling and other immoral acts are illegal, though they are not on Mars. The air is much heavier on Earth than Mars, and people tend to travel in packs. Busy and crowded, the city never sleeps and is filled to the brim with stylish people. \nOne scene takes place in the Church of Choice, which has a restaurant upstairs and play-gambling to the left. All chips purchased are contributions to the church, and the games feature crap, bingo, and other card games. At the bar, Doran and Matheny are seated in a noise-controlled section, where curtains block out most other sounds, ensuring their privacy. The Jupiter Astoria faces beautiful tall towers, and it houses chairs that are designed to wrap around those sitting in them. \n",

It was a military craft, from theoutpost on the near moon, and forward, near the nose, there was theblazoned emblem of the Ninth Fleet. The rocket roared directly overExtrone's tent, turned slowly, spouting fuel expensively, and settledinto the scrub forest, turning the vegetation beneath it sere by itsblasts.     Extrone sat on an upholstered stool before his tent and spatdisgustedly and combed his beard with his blunt fingers.     Shortly, from the direction of the rocket, a group of four high-rankingofficers came out of the forest, heading toward him. They were spruce,the officers, with military discipline holding their waists in andknees almost stiff.     What in hell do you want? Extrone asked.     They stopped a respectful distance away. Sir.... one began.     Haven't I told you gentlemen that rockets frighten the game? Extronedemanded, ominously not raising his voice.     Sir, the lead officer said, it's another alien ship. It was sighteda few hours ago, off this very planet, sir.     Extrone's face looked much too innocent. How did it get there,gentlemen? Why wasn't it destroyed?     We lost it again, sir. Temporarily, sir.     So? Extrone mocked.     We thought you ought to return to a safer planet, sir. Until we couldlocate and destroy it.     Extrone stared at them for a space. Then, indifferently, he turnedaway, in the direction of a resting bearer. You! he said. Hey! Bringme a drink! He faced the officers again. He smiled maliciously. I'mstaying here.     The lead officer licked his firm lower lip. But, sir....     Extrone toyed with his beard. About a year ago, gentlemen, there wasan alien ship around here then, wasn't there? And you destroyed it,didn't you?     Yes, sir. When we located it, sir.     You'll destroy this one, too, Extrone said.     We have a tight patrol, sir. It can't slip through. But it might try along range bombardment, sir.   <doc-sep> Purnie worked his way down the hill, imploring them to save themselves.The sounds they made carried a new tone, a desperate foreboding ofdeath.

The men on the beach are nearly buried, Captain. And the rest of ushere in the water\u2014     Forbes. Can you see Forbes? Maybe he's\u2014 His sounds were cut off by awavelet gently rolling over his head.     Purnie could wait no longer. The tides were all but covering one of theanimals, and soon the others would be in the same plight. Disregardingthe consequences, he ordered time to stop.     Wading down into the surf, he worked a log off one victim, then hetugged the animal up to the sand. Through blinding tears, Purnie workedslowly and carefully. He knew there was no hurry\u2014at least, not as faras his friends' safety was concerned. No matter what their conditionof life or death was at this moment, it would stay the same way untilhe started time again. He made his way deeper into the orange liquid,where a raised hand signalled the location of a submerged body. Thehand was clutching a large white banner that was tangled among thelogs. Purnie worked the animal free and pulled it ashore.     It was the one who had been carrying the shiny object that spit smoke.     Scarcely noticing his own injured leg, he ferried one victim afteranother until there were no more in the surf. Up on the beach, hestarted unraveling the logs that pinned down the animals caught there.He removed a log from the lap of one, who then remained in a sittingposition, his face contorted into a frozen mask of agony and shock.Another, with the weight removed, rolled over like an iron statue intoa new position. Purnie whimpered in black misery as he surveyed thechaotic scene before him.     At last he could do no more; he felt consciousness slipping away fromhim.     He instinctively knew that if he lost his senses during a period oftime-stopping, events would pick up where they had left off ... withouthim. For Purnie, this would be death. If he had to lose consciousness,he knew he must first resume time.     Step by step he plodded up the little hill, pausing every now and thento consider if this were the moment to start time before it was toolate. With his energy fast draining away, he reached the top of theknoll, and he turned to look down once more on the group below.     Then he knew how much his mind and body had suffered: when he orderedtime to resume, nothing happened.     His heart sank. He wasn't afraid of death, and he knew that if he diedthe oceans would roll again and his friends would move about. But hewanted to see them safe.     He tried to clear his mind for supreme effort. There was no      urging     time to start. He knew he couldn't persuade it by bits and pieces,first slowly then full ahead. Time either progressed or it didn't.

        "Summary_1": "Gus is a con artist who works with Peri and Sam Wendt to primarily target wealthy, powerful men and extort money from them. He is short, chisel-faced, has slicked-back hair, and wears blue pajamas with a red zigzag, a sleighbell cloak, and slippers. When the story begins, Peri is preparing to go on a date with the heir apparent of Indonesia, Inc. who is also a wealthy marijuana rancher, supposedly to use him for money. Gus convinces her to change her plans to help him swindle Peter since he has discovered Peter has a hundred million dollars at his disposal and appears to be susceptible to Gus's charming and manipulative ways. Gus goads Peter into confessing his secret by providing him with beer and akvavit and gains his trust by wearing the helmet attached to the oath box. At the end of the story, Gus agrees to help Peter find his confidence man by utilizing his network of underworld contacts, but instead calls Peri to begin implementing his con.",
        "Summary_2": "Gus is a con-man who works with a woman named Peri. He uses his natural charisma to speak to men with money and try to get them to call Peri to have a little fun with her. His research and his ability to talk to all kinds of people puts her in touch with wealthy individuals that spend a lot of money on her. She then splits the profits with Gus. Gus introduces himself to Peter because he seems out of place at the Church of Choice. He can tell by his old clothes and height that he is a Martian, and he acts as though he is genuinely interested in learning about Peter's life on Mars and his business mission. The reality is that Gus sees that Peter is an oddball and decides to learn more about him in case he would make a good victim. Through his conversations with Peter, he learns that he is working for the Martian government, and he decides to hook Peter up with Peri so that they can take advantage of Peter's naivety. ",
        "Summary_3": "Gus Doran is a confidence man on Earth. He knows Peri and uses her \u201cservices\u201d for individuals with a lot of money whom he thinks he can use for his own personal gains. He interacts directly with the \u201cmark\u201d to gain the man\u2019s confidence, lower his defenses, and trick him into giving part of his money to Doran. At the story\u2019s beginning, Doran arranges for Peri to be available for the Martian diplomat with the hundred million dollar expense account. Doran intends to win the man\u2019s confidence and then bilk him of one million dollars. Gus \u201cmeets\u201d Peter Matheny, the diplomat from Mars, at the gaming tables of the church and invites him to have a drink. Gus wins Matheny\u2019s confidence so that Matheny reveals the dollar deficit that Mars is experiencing and the planet\u2019s desire to hire a manager to help it build up its tourist industry. One way Gus builds this confidence is through empathetic responses. Matheny reveals that while Mars produces vermouth that is bought and served on Earth, he can\u2019t stand the stuff. Gus responds that he can\u2019t stand the stuff either but has always been afraid to admit it. Matheny explains that Mars has very little profit after paying the engineers, salespeople, advertisers, and Earth taxes on its exports, and Gus acts as if he is a small-time business consultant and says maybe he can help Matheny, all the while planning to take Matheny\u2019s money. When Matheny suggests there is more he could tell him, Gus offers to use an oath box, swallows the pill, and dons the helmet to confirm that he is honest and trustworthy. When Matheny eventually admits that Mars wants a con man to run a worldwide con, Gus indicates he can help him find someone to do it.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Gus Doran is an Earthman who just happens to know a lot of Earthmen. He runs into Peter Matheny, a visiting Martian, and soon realizes that he can have a hell of a time with this guy. Doran serves as Matheny\u2019s tour guide and takes him to a bar and a hotel where he can stay. When he realizes that Matheny is looking for an Earthman to serve as an executive for Mars (essentially a conman), he sees potential there. Once he realizes that Matheny has millions of dollars to spend on expenses here, he sees even more potential there. Doran propels Matheny forward and takes this slightly lost Martian on a wild journey. As well, he promises Matheny that he knows someone who could be the perfect person for this position. Doran also knows Peri, an escort, who will presumably make an entrance later on in the story. ",

Damn it, just because they're so much moresophisticated than I, do I have to talk like a leaky boiler?       The helpful Earthman was not tall. He was dark and chisel-faced andsleekly pomaded, dapper in blue pajamas with a red zigzag, a sleighbellcloak and curly-toed slippers.

I am not doing one thing in particular. Besides, I have never meta Martian. I am very interested.     There aren't many of us on Earth, agreed Matheny. Just a smallembassy staff and an occasional like me.     I should think you would do a lot of traveling here. The old motherplanet and so on.     We can't afford it, said Matheny.

I always wanted to, said Doran. I would like to see the what theycall City of Time, and so on.

        "Query": "What does the Red Ankh Society represent in INNOCENT AT LARGE?",
        "Summary_1": "The Red Ankh Society is a con devised by Peter for the Martian government as a way to boost their economy. People paid for the exclusive privilege of access to the secrets and ancient wisdom of the Old Martians; in reality, these were just bogus semantics compiled for the sake of earning large amounts of money. However, the existence of the Red Ankh Society reveals quite a bit about Mars, the role of cons in the story, and even Peter himself. During Peter's discussion with Gus, we learn the Martians are descended from Earthmen who preferred greater freedom than was offered by the United Protectorate and moved to Mars to establish a life there. They work to make the planet habitable and attractive to tourists, but the process is slow because they cannot afford the equipment and power plants required to build on a scale that will attract the necessary amount of visitors needed to turn a profit. This leads the government to resort to drastic measures; they wield their skills at playing tricks and cheating at gambling (they even have a city called Swindletown) to implement a number of schemes meant to draw in vast amounts of cash such as the Red Ankh Society, the construction and sale of phony ancient relics and ruins, and the saga of Junie O'Brien (a little girl whose fake illness raised a billion dollars for the planet). This leads the government to send Peter to Earth in order to purchase the services of a con man who can help implement a new scheme to sell Martian securities. This trip introduces Peter to Gus, who begins work on a plan to swindle Peter out of a million dollars.",
        "Summary_2": "The Red Ankh society is one of may cons that Peter has come up with to help the Martian government make money. The Society claims to have secret knowledge from ancient aliens, and people who purchase a membership into the Society can get their hands on the information that the old Martians had. Peter admits that he himself came up with this con, and although it has made some money for the planet, it just isn't enough. The Martian embassy is looking for an Earthman who can help the Martians trick the other Earthmen into investing in Mars or perhaps creating a tourist industry there, although there's really nothing worth seeing. The Red Ankh Society is emblematic of the way the Martians make money: by tricking Earthmen into believing that Mars is mysterious and interesting and purchasing items that truly hold no value. ",
        "Summary_3": "Peter Matheny, a sociodynamics professor at Devil\u2019s Kettle University, is the person who came up with the idea for the Red Ankh Society, which was established as a money-making venture for Mars, and he was selected for the mission to Earth because of this idea. The Society advertises that it can pass on the \u201cmysterious knowledge\u201d of the Old Martians and possesses the \u201csecret wisdom of the Ancient Aliens.\u201d The organization is a fake, but it has become the top dollar-earning business on Mars. While Mars lags behind Earth in its earning capacity, this organization generates more money for Mars than any other business. This scam is just one of several that Mars has used to make money.\n",
        "Summary_4": "The Red Ankh Society was a ploy developed by Peter Matheny to bring more capital to the Martian Nation. This scheme involved producing advertisements, both visual and auditory, that told stories of the Ancient Aliens of Mars. This older generation supposedly had lots of wisdom to share with a select audience. The Red Ankh Society was only available to the few people willing to pay the steep price for it to uncover more secrets about the ancient Martians. This Society is significant because it is one of the reasons the Martian government chose creator Peter Matheny for this job on Earth, and it shows what schemes and ploys the Martians must come up with in order to make money. ",
        "Article": "Doran blew up in laughter. That is one thing I would never spill, evenwithout security. I told you about my girl friend, didn't I?     Yes, and that calls to mind the Little Girl, said Mathenyapologetically. She was another official project.     Who?     Remember Junie O'Brien? The little golden-haired girl on Mars, amathematical prodigy, but dying of an incurable disease? She collectedEarth coins.     Oh, that. Sure, I remember\u2014Hey! You didn't!     Yes. We made about a billion dollars on that one.     I will be double damned. You know, Pete, I sent her a hundred-buckpiece myself. Say, how is Junie O'Brien?     Oh, fine. Under a different name, she's now our finance minister.Matheny stared out the wall, his hands twisting nervously behind hisback. There were no lies involved. She really does have a fataldisease. So do you and I. Every day we grow older.     Uh! exclaimed Doran.     And then the Red Ankh Society. You must have seen or heard their ads.'What mysterious knowledge did the Old Martians possess? What wasthe secret wisdom of the Ancient Aliens?

He would have liked to say it was his suggestion originally, but itwould have been too presumptuous. He was talking to an Earthman, whohad heard everything already.     Doran whistled.     That's about all, so far, confessed Matheny. Perhaps a con is ouronly hope. I've been wondering, maybe we could organize a Martianbucket shop, handling Martian securities, but\u2014well, I don't know.     I think\u2014 Doran removed the helmet and stood up.     Yes? Matheny faced around, shivering with his own tension.     I may be able to find the man you want, said Doran. I just may. Itwill take a few days and might get a little expensive.     You mean.... Mr. Doran\u2014Gus\u2014you could actually\u2014     I cannot promise anything yet except that I will try. Now you finishdressing. I will be down in the bar. And I will call up this girl Iknow. We deserve a celebration!   <doc-sep> The traditional office of Planetary Dilettante was a civil-servicejob, awarded by competitive examination whenever it fell vacant tothe person who scored highest in intelligence, character and generalgloonatz. However, the tests were inadequate when it came to measuringsense of proportion, adaptiveness and charm\u2014and there, Skkiru felt,was where the essential flaw lay. After all, no really effective testwould have let a person like Bbulas come out on top.     The winner was sent to Gambrell, the nearest planet with a TerranLeague University, to be given a thorough Terran-type education. Noindividual on Snaddra could afford such schooling, no matter howgreat his personal fortune, because the transportation costs were soimmense that only a government could afford them. That was the reasonwhy only one person in each generation could be chosen to go abroad atthe planet's expense and acquire enough finish to cover the rest of thepopulation.     The Dilettante's official function had always been, in theory, to servethe planet when an emergency came\u2014and this, old Luccar, the formerPresident, had decided, when he and the Parliament had awakened to thefact that Snaddra was falling into ruin, was an emergency. So he had,after considerable soul-searching, called upon Bbulas to plan a methodof saving Snaddra\u2014and Bbulas, happy to be in the limelight at last,had come up with this program.     It was not one Skkiru himself would have chosen. It was not one, hefelt, that any reasonable person would have chosen. Nevertheless, theBbulas Plan had been adopted by a majority vote of the Snaddrath,largely because no one had come up with a feasible alternative and,as a patriotic citizen, Skkiru would abide by it. He would accept thestatus of beggar; it was his duty to do so. Moreover, as in the case ofthe planet, there was no choice.     But all was not necessarily lost, he told himself. Had he not, in hisanthropological viewings\u2014though Bbulas might have been the only oneprivileged to go on ethnological field trips to other planets, he wasnot the only one who could use a library\u2014seen accounts of societieswhere beggarhood could be a rewarding and even responsible station inlife? There was no reason why, within the framework of the primitivesociety Bbulas had created to allure Terran anthropologists, Skkirushould not make something of himself and show that a beggar was worthyof the high priestess's hand\u2014which would be entirely in the Terranprimitive tradition of romance.     Skkiru! Bbulas was screaming, as he spun, now that the Terrans wereout of ear- and eye-shot Skkiru, you idiot, listen to me! What arethose ridiculous things you are wearing on your silly feet?     Skkiru protruded all of his eyes in innocent surprise. Just someold pontoons I took from a wrecked air-car once. I have a habit ofcollecting junk and I thought\u2014     Bbulas twirled madly in the air. You are not supposed to think. Leaveall the thinking to me!     Yes, Bbulas, Skkiru said meekly.   <doc-sep> A dropshaft deposited him on a walkway. The crowd, a rainbow of men inpajamas and robes, women in Neo-Sino dresses and goldleaf hats, swepthim against the rail. For a moment, squashed to the wire, he stared ahundred feet down at the river of automobiles.      Phobos!     he thoughtwildly.      If the barrier gives, I'll be sliced in two by a dorsal finbefore I hit the pavement!       The August twilight wrapped him in heat and stickiness. He could seeneither stars nor even moon through the city's blaze. The forest ofmulti-colored towers, cataracting half a mile skyward across moreacreage than his eyes reached, was impressive and all that, but\u2014heused to stroll out in the rock garden behind his cottage and smoke apipe in company with Orion. On summer evenings, that is, when thetemperature wasn't too far below zero.       Why did they tap me for this job?     he asked himself in a surge ofhomesickness.      What the hell is the Martian Embassy here for?       He, Peter Matheny, was no more than a peaceful professor ofsociodynamics at Devil's Kettle University. Of course, he had advisedhis government before now\u2014in fact, the Red Ankh Society had been hisidea\u2014but still he was at ease only with his books and his chess andhis mineral collection, a faculty poker party on Tenthday night and anoccasional trip to Swindletown\u2014       My God     , thought Matheny,      here I am, one solitary outlander in thegreatest commercial empire the human race has ever seen, and I'msupposed to find my planet a con man!       He began walking, disconsolately, at random. His lizardskin shirt andblack culottes drew glances, but derisive ones: their cut was fortyyears out of date. He should find himself a hotel, he thought drearily,but he wasn't tired; the spaceport would pneumo his baggage to himwhenever he did check in. The few Martians who had been to Earth hadgone into ecstasies over the automation which put any service you couldname on a twenty-four-hour basis. But it would be a long time beforeMars had such machines. If ever.     The city roared at him.     He fumbled after his pipe.      Of course     , he told himself,      that's whythe Embassy can't act. I may find it advisable to go outside the law.Please, sir, where can I contact the underworld?       He wished gambling were legal on Earth. The Constitution of the MartianRepublic forbade sumptuary and moral legislation; quite apart from therambunctious individualism which that document formulated, the articlewas a practical necessity. Life was bleak enough on the deserts,without being denied the pleasure of trying to bottom-deal some friendwho was happily trying to mark the cards. Matheny would have found afew spins of roulette soothing: it was always an intellectual challengeto work out the system by which the management operated a wheel. Butmore, he would have been among people he understood.     The frightful thing about the Earthman was the way he seemed toexist only in organized masses. A gypsy snake oil peddler, ploddinghis syrtosaur wagon across Martian sands, just didn't have a prayeragainst, say, the Grant, Harding & Adams Public Relations Agency.  "

        "Query": "What is the role of Peri in the story INNOCENT AT LARGE?",
        "Summary_1": "Peri is Gus Doran's business associate along with someone named Sam Wendt. The three of them operate an enterprise centering on Peri's ability to attract rich and powerful men and swindle them for cash. Peri has golden blonde hair and silver-blue eyes and a light complexion, and she has a private phone number she gives to men involved in the group's schemes. At the beginning of the story, she wears a dinner gown as she prepares to go on a date with a marijuana rancher, who is also the heir apparent to Indonesia, Inc. When she receives a phone call, she changes from her gown into a more casual bathrobe, thinking one of her many suitors is calling her and wants to make him feel special. However, the casualness of the bathrobe is misleading as it is worth thousands of dollars and was given to her by a representative of the Antarctic Enterprise. She even tousles up her coiffed hair to complete the image. When she realizes it is only Gus Doran calling, she grows impatient and drops her facade. On the call with Gus, she learns of his introduction to Peter Matheny, and together they agree on a scheme to extort a million dollars from him. Gus wants to split the cash evenly between the three of them, but Peri insists on fifty percent for her share. She cancels the date with the marijuana rancher and prepares to go meet Gus and Peter at the Jupiter-Astoria.",
        "Summary_2": "Peri is Gus's girl, and she makes money for herself and for him by making rich men feel important and worthy of her time. When she first enters the story, she is barely dressed in a robe and purposefully places some blond hair in front of her eyes to look demure for a video call. Although she already has a date with a wealthy man scheduled for that evening, she changes her mind when Gus tells her that he has a Martian who's holding millions of dollars and wants to see her. Gus originally offers Peri one-third of the takeaway, but she insists that she gets half of the pot of money. Gus makes the connections with the wealthy guys, but it's Peri who ultimately takes advantage of them and gets them to fork over their money. ",
        "Summary_3": "Peri seems to be a high-class call girl who collaborates with others to scam men out of their money. She has a casual bathrobe which cost several thousand dollars and was given to her by either the president of Antarctic Enterprise or the chairman of the board; she has had so many \u201cdates\u201d that she has difficulty keeping them straight. When her visiphone chimes, she preps herself to look sultry, slipping out of her dinner gown and into the robe, fixing her hair just so, and making sure the robe is loose around the top and tight around the hips. When she answers the call, she says she is sorry to keep the caller waiting but that she was just taking a bath; this suggestive information is meant to lure in her caller. The caller is Gus Doran, who is her scam associate. He tells her that she has a date that night with a backwoods Martian, a man who lacks sophistication but who has come to Earth as a Martian diplomat with a large expense budget of one hundred million dollars. Peri tells Gus that she is having dinner with the heir apparent of Indonesia, Inc. Gus tells Peri he thinks they can get one million dollars from the Martian and states Peri\u2019s cut will be one-third of that. Peri interrupts him and states that her share will be half a million dollars and that she has a headache that will prevent her from seeing the heir apparent of Indonesia, Inc. After Gus \u201cbefriends\u201d the Martian diplomat and earns his trust, he gets the Martian drunk and suggests inviting a girl he knows to help them celebrate their upcoming business arrangement of a con man to work for Mars; the girl is Peri. We can assume she will help Gus make his deal that will provide a million-dollar payout that they will split. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Peri is a highly-esteemed and very expensive escort, based on her clothing alone. The casual bathrobe she puts on to answer a call probably cost several thousand dollars. Although she was supposed to meet with Mr. Sastro tonight, the heir apparent of Indonesia, Inc. and marijuana rancher, Doran persuades her to meet with Matheny instead. She is drawn in by Matheny\u2019s excessive funds for his visit to Mars. She and Doran come up with a plan called \u201cBadger,\u201d which involves another fellow called Sam Wendt, presumably to steal all of Matheny\u2019s money.

Aggression on Terrestrial-occupied territory by an alienspecies. Obviously, we can't allow it.     Magnan drew a large folder from his desk.     A show of resistance at this point is necessary. Unfortunately,Jorgensen's Worlds are technologically undeveloped areas. They'refarmers or traders. Their industry is limited to a minor role intheir economy\u2014enough to support the merchant fleet, no more. The warpotential, by conventional standards, is nil.     Magnan tapped the folder before him.     I have here, he said solemnly, information which will change thatpicture completely. He leaned back and blinked at Retief.  "

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in The CONJURER of VENUS?",
        "Summary_1": "Jonny Johnson is one of Earth\u2019s foremost scientists, but no one on Venus is supposed to know that. He and another man, Caldwell, have come looking for another human named Martin, and it would be quite dangerous for him and them if anyone knew they were there. Johnson enters a bar known for providing patrons with dreams, and meets a gorgeous and dangerous woman named Vee Vee. \n\nVee Vee attempts to use a tactic known as the Karmer nerve paralysis on Johnson, which he swiftly blocks. They enter the Room of the Dreamer together, even though they don\u2019t trust each other (and Caldwell has tipped off Johnson to watch out for her because she has been asking about Martin). As they enter the room and Johnson and Vee Vee lob threats back and forth, she reveals that she knows who he is but says she will keep his secret. \n\nThe Dreamer, Unger, enters the room and the dreaming commences. It seems to affect everyone, including Johnson, who sees a spaceship and then is upset that he can\u2019t get it back. He has the odd sensation of different bodily organs speaking to him and trying to convince him what he\u2019s seeing is real as he watches Unger levitate high into the air. \n\nUnger falls, hard, and the crowd gets very upset and murmurs suggest a human is at fault. Vee Vee suddenly kisses Johnson, saying she might not be able to later. He is puzzled by this, until he sees that Martin is in the room and the crowd is converging on him. Johnson and Caldwell fire their effective but not fatal zit guns into the crowd as Johnson calls out Vee Vee\u2019s name and Caldwell tells him to forget about her. As the passage ends they are trying to get through the frantic throng of people to reach Martin. \n",
        "Summary_2": "John Michael Johnson and Caldwell are scientists from Earth that are attempting to undertake a covert mission on Venus to locate Martin. They believe he can be found at a Venusian theatrical experience called the dreaming, whereby a room full of people are led into a dream state by a Venusian named Unger. \n\nJohnson and Caldwell pretend not to know each other, and Caldwell keeps watch over Johnson - tapping out messages to him in code on the bar top so they can communicate from a distance. Caldwell detects sinister intentions of Vee Vee and tries to warn Johnson repeatedly as she joins Johnson and he begins to be swept up by her captivating beauty and manipulations. Johnson has flashes of concern that VeeVee may be planted by someone who suspects the intentions that he and Caldwell have at the bar, but he dismisses those thoughts.\n\nVee Vee forces Johnson into the dreaming spectacle to take place that evening in a dark theatre within the bar. She attempts to disable Johnson using the Karmer grip, but is astonished when he is able to break it. Despite her confident influence over Johnson, she becomes scared and clings to Johnson through the dreaming. \n\nHumans fall into the dream state more reluctantly than Venusians, and Johnson wakes out of his dream of a ship to see that Unger is levitating above the floor at the center of the room. This is a huge discovery for him that he can hardly believe. Within his body, he experiences a surge of readiness to action, but this is abruptly broken by another human interrupting the dreaming. Martin has broken Unger\u2019s dreaming session, toppling Unger to the floor from a height and waking all the other dreamers who are furious. VeeVee kisses Johnson and leaves rapidly while the theatre goers break into violence and Caldwell and Johnson start firing their stun weapons around the room trying to apprehend Martin before he escapes.\n",
        "Summary_3": "An Earthman named Johnson walks through rain-filled Venus to get to the bar. Johnson is after a genius named Martin, and he and his colleague Caldwell have traveled to Venus to find him.  He enters, hearing rhythmic music and sensing the feelings of those around him. Caldwell is in the bar as well, but they pretend they don\u2019t know each other. Johnson orders a tarmur from a Venusian waiter and asks about the dreams. Unger, a great dreamer, will be performing tonight, so Johnson asks the waiter to come back and ask again later. Johnson sits down at the bar and enjoys his green beverage. A girl sits down next to him: tan, scantily clad, with blue eyes and brown hair, and a fabulous necklace. Instantly, Johnson feels both attracted and worried for her. She was not safe here in this bar, even on this planet, dressed like that. They flirt, and she introduces herself as Vee Vee, after stating that she is not a child. Johnson cannot figure out why she is on this planet. He wonders if she was sent to monitor him because the Venusians suspected his mission, but he quickly brushes that off because he would\u2019ve been killed already had they figured it out. \nCaldwell rushes next to Johnson, pretending to be drunk and disorderly, and informs Johnson that Vee Vee knows who Martin is, the man that they\u2019re searching for. Vee Vee and Johnson decide to attend the dreaming, but on their way to the room, she attempts to paralyze him using the Karmer nerve block. He gets out of it and injures her in the process. This confirms her theory that he is John Michael Johnson, esteemed human scientist. Caldwell follows them into the Room of the Dreamer. \nThe room is heavily perfumed and filled with cushions and rugs for people to lie on. The music gets louder as the room gets darker. Vee Vee holds onto Johnson as Unger suddenly appears in the center of the room. He lies down to sleep, and soon everyone follows after him. The Venusians first, humans last. Johnson thinks he notices a pattern in the room, but he finally drifts off and sees a spaceship, the one he dreamt of as a boy. Vee Vee woke him up, but he was unable to return to sleep due to the high-speed whirring sound. He saw Unger levitating ten feet above the ground and couldn\u2019t believe his eyes. Perhaps Johnson starts dreaming again, or maybe he\u2019s hallucinating, either way, his body starts speaking to him as his mind sees Unger. A Venusian awoke from their dream, and a human\u2019s cry caused everyone else to wake up. Suddenly, Unger dropped back to the ground. \nEveryone tries to figure out who disturbed the Dreaming. Fingers point to Martin, who was there after all. Vee Vee quickly kisses Johnson and then disappears. Caldwell and Johnson pull out their non-lethal zit guns and shoot at the crowd who were trying to attack Martin. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Johnson, a scientist from Earth, has traveled to Venus in search of a missing Earth scientist named Martin. He goes to an entertainment venue where patrons can have liquor, women, or dreams. An associate, Caldwell, is already there, it seems they have an agreement not to acknowledge each other\u2019s presence. Johnson orders a drink at the bar, and a young woman joins him and strikes up a conversation. Johnson is surprised to see such a young, beautiful woman alone in the bar because it isn\u2019t safe. She introduces herself as Vee Vee, and Johnson begins to suspect that the Venusians are using her to get to him; he knows that they would kill him if they knew his purpose. Caldwell comes to the bar to place an order, and his fingers tap nervously on the bar top; Johnson interprets the taps as a message warning him about the girl because she was asking about Martin earlier. Vee Vee comments about Caldwell\u2019s apparent drunkenness and calls him Johnson\u2019s friend. Johnson denies knowing him, but Vee Vee accuses him of lying. Vee Vee accompanies Johnson to the dreaming, and while she is holding his arm, she uses a move   on himcalled the Karmer nerve paralysis. Recognizing what is happening, Johnson hits her shoulder, breaking her grip, and Vee Vee is astonished because he is the first man she knew who could break it. Johnson warns her not to try it again, and she says she doesn\u2019t make the same mistake twice, and the second time she breaks her victim\u2019s neck. She claims she will use Eve\u2019s way to get to him next. She addresses Johnson by his name and says his ability to break the Karmer nerve grip confirmed his identity for her. They move to the dreaming room, select a spot, and settle on some cushions; Caldwell settles next to them. The music plays and perfumes fill the air. Eventually a spotlight shines in the center of the room, and the famous dreamer Unger appears. When he settles in to sleep, everyone in the room begins dreaming their own dreams. Johnson wakens and notices a whirring sound that seems familiar but from a different place; he can\u2019t restart his dream and sees Unger\u2019s body levitating upward. Johnson becomes hyperaware of his organs and imagines they are talking to him, and his adrenals tell him they are making adrenalin, and his pancreas is preparing him for action. Someone yells out, woken from his dream. Unger\u2019s body drops to the floor from a height of ten feet. A Venusian claims a human broke the dreaming, and pandemonium breaks loose. Vee Vee kisses Johnson and disappears, and Johnson and Caldwell see the Venusians attacking Martin and start shooting them with their zit guns.\n\n\n",

But his     luck had run its course, and now he was     marooned on a rogue planet\u2014fighting to save     himself from a menace weapons could not kill.     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Planet Stories Fall 1944.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]            And so, my dear     , Dennis detected a faint irony in the phrase,       I'mafraid I can offer no competition to the beauties of five planets\u2014oris it six? With regret I bow myself out, and knowing me as you do,you'll understand the futility of trying to convince me again. Anyway,there will be no temptation, for I'm sailing on a new assignment I'veaccepted. I did love you.... Good-by.          Dennis Brooke had lost count of the times he'd read Marla's lastletter, but every time he came to these final, poignant lines, theynever failed to conjure a vision of her tawny loveliness, slender asthe palms of Venus, and of the blue ecstasy of her eyes, wide with aperpetual wonder\u2014limpid as a child's.     The barbaric rhythms of the      Congahua     , were a background of annoyancein Dennis' mind; he frowned slightly as the maneuvers of the Mercuriandancer, who writhed among the guests of the notorious pleasure palace,began to leave no doubt as to her intentions. The girl was beautiful,in a sultry, almost incandescent sort of way, but her open promise lefthim cold. He wanted solitude, somewhere to coordinate his thoughtsin silence and salvage something out of the wreck of his heart, notto speak of his career. But Venus, in the throes of a gigantic boomupon the discovery of radio-active fields, could offer only onesolitude\u2014the fatal one of her swamps and virgin forests.     Dennis Brooke was thirty, the time when youth no longer seems unending.When the minor adventures of the heart begin to pall. If the loss ofMarla left an aching void that all the women of five planets could notfill, the loss of Space, was quite as deadly. For he had been grounded.True, Koerber's escape from the I.S.P. net had not quite been hisfault; but had he not been enjoying the joys of a voluptuous JovianChamber, in Venus' fabulous Inter-planetary Palace, he would have beenready for duty to complete the last link in the net of I.S.P. cruisersthat almost surrounded the space pirate.     A night in the Jovian Chamber, was to be emperor for one night. Everydream of a man's desire was marvelously induced through the skilful useof hypnotics; the rarest viands and most delectable drinks appeared asif by magic; the unearthly peace of an Olympus descended on a man'ssoul, and beauty ... beauty such as men dreamed of was a warm realityunder the ineffable illumination of the Chamber.     It cost a young fortune. But to pleasure mad, boom-ridden Venus, afortune was a bagatelle. Only it had cost Dennis Brooke far more than asheaf of credits\u2014it had cost him the severe rebuff of the I.S.P., andmost of his heart in Marla.     Dennis sighed, he tilted his red, curly head and drank deeply of theinsidious      Verbena     , fragrant as a mint garden, in the tall frostyglass of Martian      Bacca-glas     , and as he did so, his brilliant hazeleyes found themselves gazing into the unwinking, violet stare of ayoung Martian at the next table. There was a smouldering hatred inthose eyes, and something else ... envy, perhaps, or was it jealousy?Dennis couldn't tell. But his senses became instantly alert. Dangerbrought a faint vibration which his superbly trained faculties couldinstantly denote.     His steady, bronzed hand lowered the drink, and his eyes narrowedslightly. Absorbed in trying to puzzle the sudden enmity of thisMartian stranger, he was unaware of the Mercurian Dancer. The latterhad edged closer, whirling in prismatic flashes from the myriadsemi-precious stones that studded her brief gauze skirt. And now, ina final bid for the spacer's favor she flung herself in his lap andtilted back invitingly.     Some of the guests laughed, others stared in plain envy at thehandsome, red-haired spacer, but from the table across, came thetinkling sound of a fragile glass being crushed in a powerful hand,and a muffled Martian curse. Without warning, the Martian was on hisfeet with the speed of an Hellacorium, the table went crashing to oneside as he leaped with deadly intent on the sprawled figure of DennisBrooke. A high-pitched scream brought instant silence as a Terran girlcried out. Then the Martian's hand reached out hungrily. But Dennis wasnot there.   <doc-sep>   The CONJURER of VENUS     By CONAN T.

The headwaiter was gone into the throng. Johnson wasat the bar. Behind it, a Venusian was bowing to him. Tarmur, Johnsonsaid. The green drink was set before him. He held it up to the light,admiring the slow rise of the tiny golden bubbles in it. To him,watching the bubbles rise was perhaps more important than drinkingitself.     Beautiful, aren't they? a soft voice said. He glanced to his right.A girl had slid into the stool beside him. She wore a green dress cutvery low at the throat. Her skin had the pleasant tan recently onEarth. Her hair was a shade of abundant brown and her eyes were blue,the color of the skies of Earth. A necklace circled her throat andbelow the necklace ... Johnson felt his pulse quicken, for two reasons.Women such as this one had been quickening the pulse of men since thedays of Adam. The second reason concerned her presence here in thisplace where no woman in her right mind ever came unescorted. Her eyessmiled up at him unafraid. Didn't she know there were men present herein this space port city who would snatch her bodily from the barstool and carry her away for sleeping purposes? And Venusians werehere who would cut her pretty throat for the sake of the necklace thatcircled it?     They      are     beautiful, he said, smiling.     Thank you.     I was referring to the bubbles.     You were talking about my eyes, she answered, unperturbed.     How did you know? I mean....     I am very knowing, the girl said, smiling.     Are you sufficiently knowing to be here?     For an instant, as if doubt crossed her mind, the smile flickered. Thenit came again, stronger. Aren't you here?     Johnson choked as bubbles from the tarmur seemed to go suddenly up hisnose. My dear child ... he sputtered.     I am not a child, she answered with a firm sureness that left nodoubt in his mind that she knew what she was saying. And my name isVee Vee.     Vee Vee? Um. That is....

        "Query": "What is the role of Johnson in The CONJURER of VENUS?",
        "Summary_1": "Johnson, whose full name is John Michael Johnson, is described by Vee Vee as one of Earth\u2019s foremost scientists, and an expert in the field of electro-magnetic radiation in human bodies. He is the protagonist of the story, a human man who has apparently come to Venus in search of another human named Martin. He goes to a bar that has a Room of the Dreamer. Before he enters it, he encounters Vee Vee. She incites both lust and anxiety in Johnson, as he is attracted to her but doesn\u2019t think she should be alone at a Venusian bar. After she attempts to use Karmer\u2019s nerve paralysis on him, he blocks her and threatens her not to do it again. They go into the Room of the Dreamer, where Johnson discovers that Vee Vee knows who he is. The Unger enters and the dreaming begins. Johnson sees a spaceship before him and the room seems to disappear behind him. Johnson is upset when the spaceship disappears and he can\u2019t get it back. He sees Unger starting to levitate and all of Johnson\u2019s various body parts seem to talk to him. When Unger falls, Vee Vee kisses Johnson. He is confused and then realizes that Martin is there and is being attacked. As the passage ends, Johnson and Caldwell are shooting people with their zit guns and trying to get toward Martin as Johnson calls out to Vee Vee. \n",
        "Summary_2": "John Michael Johnson is the Earth's foremost expert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the human body. He has travelled to Venus with a close colleague, Caldwell, to try to find a \u201cfrantic human genius\u201d named Martin at The Dreaming performance. \n\nHe\u2019s intercepted and influenced by a human named Vee Vee during his mission, who appears to have bad intentions towards him that he allows to play out. She may be using him to locate Martin as well, who she had been inquiring about at the club.\n\nJohnson has a drink at the bar and then goes to the dreaming with Vee Vee where she nearly paralyzes him with the Karmer grip that he is fortunately able to break before she gains control of him. During the dreaming performance, Johnson dreams of a ship, but then returns to reality where he catches sight of the Venusian performer, Unger, levitating above the ground in the center of the room. He is astonished at the levitation, and his body is preparing to take action of some means when the room is disrupted by another human - revealed to be Martin. Vee Vee kisses him and rapidly vanishes. The dreaming theatre erupts into violent chaos and the story ends with Johnson and Caldwell shooting their weapons around the room.\n",
        "Summary_3": "John Michael Johnson, Johnny to his friends, is an esteemed scientist from Earth. Presumably, he and his colleague, Caldwell, are developing research or material on Dreamers and what happens when they enter that state of mind. This can be assumed when it is revealed that the man they were searching for on Venus, Martin, knows something about the Dream world that others don\u2019t.\nJohnson makes his way to Venus to chase after Martin and winds up in a dive bar. An attractive young woman attaches herself to his arm after he orders a tarmur, and eventually introduces herself as Vee Vee. Johnson, cautious on this planet due to its unfriendly history with humans, immediately fears for this girl, as he can think of a reason why a human would want her and why a Venusian would want her. \nThey chat and flirt until Caldwell informs Johnson in drunken-code that the girl was inquiring about Martin, the man they were pursuing. Vee Vee expresses interest in visiting the Room of the Dreamer, so Johnson buys tickets for both of them. As they stand to enter the open doors, Vee Vee uses the Karmer nerve block paralysis on him, and it almost works, until Johnson pinches her shoulder and injures her in return. They flirt a little more, then enter the room. As they sit down on their cushioned spot, Vee Vee clings onto him in fear and reveals that his ability to defend himself from the Karmer nerve block proved his identity to her. She knows who he is, Johnny Johnson, and reveals it. \nUnger suddenly appears and promptly goes to sleep. Though they struggle at first with falling asleep, they both do and Johnson sees a spaceship in his dream. Suddenly, he wakes up to Vee Vee grabbing his arm, claiming he woke her up. He hears a strange whirring, which prevents him from falling back into his old dream. He sees Unger begin to float in the air. His body responds, his nerves talking to him, his adrenal gland, his skin. Johnson\u2019s body reacts as his mind does, too. The whole room wakes up thanks to a human\u2019s scream and Unger comes crashing onto the ground. Vee Vee kisses Johnson, as he pulls out his zit gun, a non-lethal weapon. He and Caldwell start shooting at the mass of people attacking the man, who they have discovered is Martin. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Johnson is a well-known scientist from Earth and an expert in electro-magnetic radiations within the human body. He and his associate Caldwell have traveled to Venus to search for a missing scientist named Martin. Their mission is highly secretive; Johnson and Caldwell do not acknowledge each other publicly although they can communicate through finger taps. Johnson is puzzled when a beautiful Earth woman approaches him in a bar and strikes up a conversation. It is odd for her to be there alone because Venus is not safe for unaccompanied women. Johnson suspects Venus authorities might be aware of his mission and might be using the woman to get to him, but he ultimately disregards this thought because he knows that if the Venusians knew his real mission, they would kill him. When Caldwell comes to the bar to order another drink, he finger-taps a message to Johnson to watch out for the woman and tells him that she was asking for Martin earlier. He also says he thinks Martin is or has been there although he hasn\u2019t seen him. Johnson is stunned when the woman uses the Karmer nerve paralysis move on him, and she claims that when he breaks the move, it confirms his identity for her. She knows his full name and that he is a well-known scientist but says she\u2019ll keep his secrets. During the dreaming, Johnson dreams of a spaceship, which is closely associated with his childhood dreams of traveling to the stars. When he awakens from the dream, he senses that something is off. He hears a whirring sound but can\u2019t place what it is, and he is aware his body is producing adrenalin and preparing for action. When everyone is suddenly roused from their dreams, and the Venusians start attacking the human accused of waking them, Caldwell identifies the man as Martin, and Johnson helps him shoot the Venusians with his zit gun to knock them unconscious.\n",

Shall I make ze reservations for ze mightyone? As he was speaking, the headwaiter was deftly conducting Johnsonto the bar.     Not just yet, Johnson said. See me a little later.     But certainly. The headwaiter was gone into the throng. Johnson wasat the bar. Behind it, a Venusian was bowing to him. Tarmur, Johnsonsaid. The green drink was set before him. He held it up to the light,admiring the slow rise of the tiny golden bubbles in it. To him,watching the bubbles rise was perhaps more important than drinkingitself.     Beautiful, aren't they? a soft voice said. He glanced to his right.A girl had slid into the stool beside him. She wore a green dress cutvery low at the throat. Her skin had the pleasant tan recently onEarth. Her hair was a shade of abundant brown and her eyes were blue,the color of the skies of Earth. A necklace circled her throat andbelow the necklace ... Johnson felt his pulse quicken, for two reasons.Women such as this one had been quickening the pulse of men since thedays of Adam. The second reason concerned her presence here in thisplace where no woman in her right mind ever came unescorted. Her eyessmiled up at him unafraid. Didn't she know there were men present herein this space port city who would snatch her bodily from the barstool and carry her away for sleeping purposes? And Venusians werehere who would cut her pretty throat for the sake of the necklace thatcircled it?     They      are     beautiful, he said, smiling.     Thank you.     I was referring to the bubbles.     You were talking about my eyes, she answered, unperturbed.     How did you know? I mean....     I am very knowing, the girl said, smiling.     Are you sufficiently knowing to be here?     For an instant, as if doubt crossed her mind, the smile flickered. Thenit came again, stronger. Aren't you here?     Johnson choked as bubbles from the tarmur seemed to go suddenly up hisnose. My dear child ... he sputtered.     I am not a child, she answered with a firm sureness that left nodoubt in his mind that she knew what she was saying. And my name isVee Vee.     Vee Vee? Um. That is....     Don't you think it's a nice name?     I certainly do. Probably the rest of it is even nicer.     There is no more of it. Just Vee Vee. Like Topsy, I just grew.   <doc-sep> What the devil are you doing here on Venus and here in this place?     Growing. The blue eyes were unafraid.     Sombrely, Johnson regarded her. What was she doing here? Was she inthe employ of the Venusians? If she was being planted on him, thenhis purpose here was suspected. He shrugged the thought aside. If hispurpose here was suspected, there would be no point in planting a womanon him.     There would only be the minor matter of slipping a knife into his back.     In this city, as on all of Venus, humans died easily. No one questionedthe motives of the killer.     You look as if you were considering some very grave matter, Vee Veesaid.     Not any longer, he laughed.     You have decided them?     Yes.     Every last one of them?     Oh, there might be one or two matters undecided somewhere, say out onthe periphery of the galaxy. But we will solve them when we get tothem. He waved vaguely toward the roof and the sky of space hiddenbehind the clouds that lay over the roof, glanced around as a man easedhimself into an empty stool on his left. The man was Caldwell.     Zlock! Caldwell said, to the bartender. Make it snappy. Gotta havezlock. Finest damn drink in the solar system. Caldwell's voice wasthick, his tongue heavy. Johnson's eyes went back to the girl but outof the corner of them he watched Caldwell's hand lying on the bar. Thefingers were beating a quick nervous tattoo on the yellow wood.     I haven't seen him, Caldwell's fingers beat out their tattoo. But Ithink he is, or was, here.     Um, Johnson said, his eyes on Vee Vee. How\u2014     Because that girl was asking for him, Caldwell's fingers answered.Watch that girl! Picking up the zlock, he lurched away from the bar.     Your friend is not as drunk as he seems, Vee Vee said, watchingCaldwell.     My friend? Do you mean that drunk? I never saw him\u2014     Lying is one of the deadly sins. Her eyes twinkled at him. Under themerriment that danced in them there was ice. Johnson felt cold.     The reservations for ze dreaming, great one? The headwaiter wasbowing and scraping in front of him. The great one has decided, yes?     The dreaming! Vee Vee looked suddenly alert. Of course. We must seethe dreaming. Everyone wants to see the dreaming. We will go, won't wedarling? She hooked her hand into Johnson's elbow.     Certainly, Johnson said. The decision was made on the spur of themoment. That there was danger in it, he did not doubt. But there mightbe something else. And      he     might be there.     Oh. But very good. Ze great Unger, you will love him! The headwaiterclutched the gold coins that Johnson extended, bowed himself out ofsight.     Say, I want to know more\u2014 Johnson began. His words were drowned ina blast of trumpets. The band that had been playing went into suddensilence. Waves of perfume began to flow into the place. The perfumeswere blended, but one aroma was prominent among them, the sweet,cloying, soul-stirring perfume of the Dreamer.     In the suddenly hushed place little sounds began to appear as Venusiansand humans began to shift their feet and their bodies in anticipationof what was to happen.     The trumpets flared again.     On one side of the place, a big door began to swing slowly open. Frombeyond that slowly opening door came music, soft, muted strains thatsounded like lutes from heaven.     Vee Vee, her hand on Johnson's elbow, rose. Johnson stood up withher. He got the surprise of his life as her fingers clenched, digginginto his muscles. Pain shot through his arm, paralyzing it and almostparalyzing him. He knew instantly that she was using the Karmer nerveblock paralysis on him. His left hand moved with lightning speed, thetips of his fingers striking savagely against her shoulder.     She gasped, her face whitened as pain shot through her in response tothe thrust of his finger tips. Her hand that had been digging into hiselbow lost its grip, dropped away and hung limp at her side. Grabbingit, she began to massage it.     You\u2014you\u2014 Hot anger and shock were in her voice. You're the firstman I ever knew who could break the Karmer nerve paralysis.     And you're the first woman who ever tried it on me.     But\u2014     Shall we go watch the dreaming? He took the arm that still hung limpat her side and tucked it into his elbow.     If you try to use the Karmer grip on me again I'll break your arm, hesaid. His voice was low but there was a wealth of meaning in it.     I won't do it again, the girl said stoutly. I never make the samemistake twice.     Good, Johnson said.     The second time we break our victim's neck, Vee Vee said.     What a sweet, charming child you\u2014     I told you before, I'm not a child.     Child vampire, Johnson said. Let me finish my sentences before youinterrupt.     She was silent. A smile, struggling to appear on her face, seemed tosay she held no malice. Her fingers tightened on Johnson's arm. Hetensed, expecting the nerve block grip again. Instead with the tips ofher fingers she gently patted his arm.     There, there, darling, relax, she said. I know a better way to getyou than by using the Karmer grip.     What way?     Her eyes sparkled. Eve's way, she answered.     Um! Surprise sounded in his grunt. But apples don't grow on Venus.     Eve's daughters don't use apples any more, darling. Come along.     Moving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming,Johnson saw that Caldwell had risen and was following them. Caldwell'sface was writhing in apprehensive agony and he was making warningsigns. Johnson ignored them. With Vee Vee's fingers lightly patting hisarm, they moved into the Room of the Dreaming.      II     It was a huge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling rampsrising up from an open space at the bottom. There ought to have beena stage there at the bottom, but there wasn't. Instead there was anopen space, a mat, and a head rest. Up at the top of the circling rampsthe room was in darkness, a fit hiding place for ghosts or Venusianwerewolves. Pillows and a thick rug covered the circling ramps.     The soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer was stronger here. Thethrobbing of the lutes was louder. It was Venusian music the lutes wereplaying. Human ears found it inharmonious at first, but as they becameaccustomed to it, they began to detect rhythms and melodies that humanminds had not known existed. The room was pleasantly cool but it hadthe feel of dampness. A world that was rarely without pelting rainwould have the feel of dampness in its dreaming rooms.     The music playing strange harmonies in his ears, the perfume sendingtingling feelings through his nose, Johnson entered the Room of theDreamer. He suspected that other forces, unknown to him, were catchinghold of his senses. He had been in dreaming rooms many times before buthe had not grown accustomed to them. He wondered if any human everdid. A touch of chill always came over him as he crossed the threshold.In entering these places, it was as if some unknown nerve centerinside the human organism was touched by something, some force, someradiation, some subtlety, that quite escaped radiation. He felt thecoldness now.     Vee Vee's fingers left off patting his arm.     Do you feel it, darling?     Yes.     What is it?     How would I know?     Please! Her voice grew sharp. I think Johnny Johnson ought to know.     Johnny! How do you know my name?     Shouldn't I recognize one of Earth's foremost scientists, even if heis incognito on Venus? Her voice had a teasing quality in it.     But\u2014     And who besides Johnny Johnson would recognize the Karmer nerve gripand be able to break it instantly?     Hell\u2014     John Michael Johnson, known as Johnny to his friends, Earth's foremostexpert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the humanbody! Her words were needles of icy fact, each one jabbing deeper anddeeper into him.     And how would I make certain you were Johnny Johnson, except by seeingif you could break the Karmer nerve grip? If you could break it, thenthere was no doubt who you were! Her words went on and on.     Who are you? His words were blasts of sound.     Please, darling, you are making a scene. I am sure this is the lastthing you really want to do.     He looked quickly around them. The Venusians and humans moving intothis room seemed to be paying no attention to him. His gaze came backto her.     Again she patted his arm. Relax, darling. Your secrets are safe withme.     A gray color came up inside his soul. But\u2014but\u2014 His voice wassuddenly weak.     The fingers on his arm were very gentle. No harm will come to you. AmI not with you?     That's what I'm afraid of! he snapped at her. If he had had achoice, he might have drawn back. But with circumstances as theywere\u2014his life, Caldwell's life, possibly Vee Vee's life hung in thebalance. Didn't she know that this was true? And as for Martin\u2014ButCaldwell had said that she had been asking about Martin. Whatconnection did she have with that frantic human genius he sought here?     Johnson felt his skin crawl. He moved toward a nest of cushions ona ramp, found a Venusian was beating him to them, deftly changed toanother nest, found it. Vee Vee flowed to the floor on his right, movedcushions to make him more comfortable. She moved in an easy sort of waythat was all flowing movement. He sat down. Someone bumped him on theleft.     Sorry, bud. Didn't mean to bump into you. Caldwell's voice was stillthick and heavy. He sprawled to the floor on Johnson's left. Underthe man's coat, Johnson caught a glimpse of a slight bulge, the zitgun hidden there. His left arm pressed against his own coat, feelinghis own zit gun. Operating under gas pressure, throwing a charge ofgas-driven corvel, the zit guns were not only almost noiseless inoperation but they knocked out a human or a Venusian in a matter ofseconds.     True, the person they knocked unconscious would be all right the nextday. For this reason, many people did not regard the zit guns aseffective weapons, but Johnson had a fondness for them. The feel of thelittle weapon inside his coat sent a surge of comfort through him.     The music picked up a beat, perfume seemed to flow even more freelythrough the air, the lights dimmed almost to darkness, a single brightspotlight appeared in the ceiling, casting a circle of brilliantillumination on the mat and the headrest at the bottom of the room. Thecurtain rose.   <doc-sep> Joe was still dazed by that monetary vista when he and Harvey carriedthe case of medicine to the saloon. The mayor had already cleared aplace of honor in the cluttered back room, where he told them to put itdown carefully. Then he took the elaborate bottle-opener Harvey gavehim, reverently uncorked a bottle and sampled it. It must have been atleast as good as the first; he gagged.     That's the stuff, all right, he said, swallowing hard. He countedout the money into Harvey's hand, at a moderate rate that precariouslybalanced between his pleasure at getting the fever remedy and his painat paying for it. Then he glanced out to see the position of Jupiter,and asked: You gents eaten yet? The restaurant's open now.     Harvey and Joe looked at each other. They hadn't been thinking aboutfood at all, but suddenly they realized that they were hungry.     It's only water we were short of, Harvey said apprehensively. We'vegot rations back at the ship.           H-mph!      the mayor grunted. Powdered concentrates. Compressed pap.Suit yourselves. We treat our stomachs better here. And you're welcometo our hospitality.     Your hospitality, said Harvey, depends on the prices you charge.     Well, if that's what's worrying you, you can stop worrying, answeredthe mayor promptly. What's more, the kind of dinner I serve here youcan't get anywhere else for any price.     Swiftly, Harvey conned the possibilities of being bilked again. He sawnone.     Let's take a look at the menu, anyhow, Joe, he said guardedly.     Johnson immediately fell into the role of mine host.     Come right in, gents, he invited. Right into the dining room.     He seated them at a table, which a rope tied between posts made more orless private, though nobody else was in the saloon and there was littlechance of company.     Genius, the six-armed native, appeared from the dingy kitchen withtwo menus in one hand, two glasses of water in another, plus napkins,silverware, a pitcher, plates, saucers, cups, and their cocktails,which were on the house. Then he stood by for orders.     Harvey and Joe studied the menu critically. The prices werephenomenally low. When they glanced up at Johnson in perplexity, hegrinned, bowed and asked: Everything satisfactory, gents?     Quite, said Harvey. We shall order.     For an hour they were served amazing dishes, both fresh and canned, theculinary wealth of this planetoid and all the system. And the servicewas as extraordinary as the meal itself. With four hands, Genius playeddeftly upon a pair of mellow Venusian      viotars     , using his other twohands for waiting on the table.     We absolutely must purchase this incredible specimen, Harveywhispered excitedly when Johnson and the native were both in thekitchen, attending to the next course. He would make any societyhostess's season a riotous success, which should be worth a great sumto women like Mrs. van Schuyler-Morgan, merely for his hire.     Think of a fast one fast, Joe agreed. You're right.     But I dislike having to revise my opinion of a man so often,complained Harvey. I wish Johnson would stay either swindler or honestmerchant. This dinner is worth as least twenty buckos, yet I estimateour check at a mere bucko twenty redsents.     The mayor's appearance prevented them from continuing the discussion.     It's been a great honor, gents, he said. Ain't often I havevisitors, and I like the best, like you two gents.     As if on cue, Genius came out and put the check down between Joe andHarvey. Harvey picked it up negligently, but his casual air vanished ina yelp of horror.     What the devil is this? he shouted.\u2014How do you arrive at thisfantastic, idiotic figure\u2014      three hundred and twenty-eight buckos     !  "

        "Query": "What is the role of Vee Vee in The CONJURER of VENUS?",
        "Summary_1": "Vee Vee is a woman described as very beautiful, with auburn hair, blue eyes and tanned skin. She wears a low-cut green dress and necklace and seems out of place at the dream bar, but unafraid. She introduces herself to Johnson and gets him to escort her to the Room of the Dreamer, even after Caldwell warns him that she has been asking for Martin. She attempts to use Karmer\u2019s nerve paralysis on Johnson and he blocks it. Johnson says she is a child vampire and brings her into the Room of Dreaming; she says next time she\u2019ll use Eve\u2019s trick against him. She says his name and when he questions her, it turns out that she knows exactly who he is and what he does. She claims to have tried the paralysis trick to see if he would block it so she would know if it was him. Self-assured though she was before, she becomes quite frightened in the Room of the Dreamer. After Unger falls and chaos breaks out, she kisses Johnson and says she did it because she might not be able to later. Though he calls for her as he and Caldwell make their way towards Martin, Vee Vee\u2019s whereabouts are unknown at the end of the passage. \n",
        "Summary_2": "VeeVee\u2019s origins are mysterious, but from her appearances in the story we know she is a beautiful human female who is capable of manipulating Johnson. She also possesses some spy-like traits with the ability to assess Caldwell\u2019s drunkard act and recognize that he is informing Johnson, as well as performing the paralyzing Karmer grip on Johnson.\n\nShe seeks out Johnson in the bar and manipulates him into going into The Dreaming alongside her. Because she has prior knowledge of Johnson being Earth's foremost expert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the human body, and also shows interest in Martin - the genius Johnson himself is there to find - the reader is left to conclude that VeeVee likely has intentions of gathering expert knowledge about how the dreaming act works. To what end - good or evil - we do not know.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Vee Vee is a human woman, traveling on Venus. She\u2019s wearing a beautiful green dress with a deep neckline and a big necklace. Her blue eyes and brown hair draw Johnson in, along with her cleavage. She is presumably in Venus searching for Martin, the genius that Johnson and Caldwell are also after. She uses the Karmer nerve block on Johnson after flirting with him to determine if he is, in fact, John Michael Johnson, a human scientist. While in the Room of the Dreamer, her demeanor changes, and she suddenly becomes scared. She clings to Johnson as Unger appears and continues latching onto him as they fall asleep. She wakes him up, but she claims he woke her up and then falls back asleep. She is awoken once more when the cry echoes throughout the room. She kisses Johnson, claiming it may be her only chance, then disappears in the night. ",
        "Summary_4": "Vee Vee is a beautiful young woman who somehow knows about Martin, Johnson, and Caldwell. She starts a conversation with Johnson at the bar and identifies Caldwell as his friend. Her unaccompanied presence in the bar is disturbing to Johnson, and Caldwell warns him about her because she has been asking for Martin. It isn\u2019t clear whether she is working for the Venusians, but Johnson suspects she might be. She comes across as strong; she is bold in the way she takes on Johnson, and she uses the Karmer nerve grip on him. After he breaks the hold, she tells him she doesn\u2019t make the same mistake twice; the second time, she breaks the person\u2019s neck. Then she tells him she will get to him Eve\u2019s way. Vee Vee reveals she knows Johnson\u2019s identity but says she\u2019ll keep his secrets and even goes so far as to say no harm will come to him because she is with him. Once they go into the dreaming room, however, Vee Vee begins to act scared. She stays close to Johnson and holds onto him for protection. When the Venusians wake from their dreams, Vee Vee kisses Johnson and then pulls away from him, saying she had to kiss him now because there might not be a later time. Then she disappears as Caldwell identifies Martin, and Johnson and Caldwell begin firing their zit guns as the Venusians. ",
        "Article": "  The CONJURER of VENUS     By CONAN T. TROY       A world-famed Earth scientist had disappeared on Venus.       When Johnson found him, he found too the secret to that       globe-shaking mystery\u2014the fabulous Room of The Dreaming.       [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Planet Stories November 1952.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      The city dripped with rain. Crossing the street toward the dive,Johnson got rain in his eyes, his nose, and his ears. That was the waywith the rain here. It came at you from all directions. There had beenoccasions when Johnson had thought the rain was falling straight up.Otherwise, how had the insides of his pants gotten wet?     On Venus, everything came at you from all directions, it seemed toJohnson. Opening the door of the joint, it was noise instead of rainthat came at him, the wild frantic beat of a Venusian rhumba, thenotes pounding and jumping through the smoke and perfume clouded room.Feeling states came at him, intangible, but to his trained senses,perceptible emotional nuances of hate, love, fear, and rage. But mostlylove. Since this place had been designed to excite the senses of bothhumans and Venusians, the love feelings were heavily tinged withstraight sex. He sniffed at them, feeling them somewhere inside of him,aware of them but aware also that here was apprehension, and plain fear.     Caldwell, sitting in a booth next to the door, glanced up as Johnsonentered but neither Caldwell's facial expression or his eyes revealedthat he had ever seen this human before. Nor did Johnson seem torecognize Caldwell.     Is the mighty human wanting liquor, a woman or dreams? His voicewas all soft syllables of liquid sound. The Venusian equivalent of aheadwaiter was bowing to him.     I'll have a tarmur to start, Johnson said. How are the dreamstonight?     Ze vill be the most wonserful of all sonight. The great Unger hisselfwill be here to do ze dreaming. There is no ozzer one who has quitehis touch at dreaming, mighty one. The headwaiter spread his handsin a gesture indicating ecstasy.

He waved vaguely toward the roof and the sky of space hiddenbehind the clouds that lay over the roof, glanced around as a man easedhimself into an empty stool on his left. The man was Caldwell.     Zlock! Caldwell said, to the bartender. Make it snappy. Gotta havezlock. Finest damn drink in the solar system. Caldwell's voice wasthick, his tongue heavy. Johnson's eyes went back to the girl but outof the corner of them he watched Caldwell's hand lying on the bar. Thefingers were beating a quick nervous tattoo on the yellow wood.

How\u2014     Because that girl was asking for him, Caldwell's fingers answered.Watch that girl! Picking up the zlock, he lurched away from the bar.     Your friend is not as drunk as he seems, Vee Vee said, watchingCaldwell.     My friend? Do you mean that drunk? I never saw him\u2014     Lying is one of the deadly sins. Her eyes twinkled at him.

And      he     might be there.     Oh. But very good. Ze great Unger, you will love him! The headwaiterclutched the gold coins that Johnson extended, bowed himself out ofsight.     Say, I want to know more\u2014 Johnson began. His words were drowned ina blast of trumpets. The band that had been playing went into suddensilence. Waves of perfume began to flow into the place. The perfumeswere blended, but one aroma was prominent among them, the sweet,cloying, soul-stirring perfume of the Dreamer.     In the suddenly hushed place little sounds began to appear as Venusiansand humans began to shift their feet and their bodies in anticipationof what was to happen.     The trumpets flared again.

If you try to use the Karmer grip on me again I'll break your arm, hesaid. His voice was low but there was a wealth of meaning in it.     I won't do it again, the girl said stoutly. I never make the samemistake twice.     Good, Johnson said.     The second time we break our victim's neck, Vee Vee said.     What a sweet, charming child you\u2014     I told you before, I'm not a child.     Child vampire, Johnson said. Let me finish my sentences before youinterrupt.     She was silent. A smile, struggling to appear on her face, seemed tosay she held no malice. Her fingers tightened on Johnson's arm. Hetensed, expecting the nerve block grip again. Instead with the tips ofher fingers she gently patted his arm.     There, there, darling, relax, she said. I know a better way to getyou than by using the Karmer grip.     What way?     Her eyes sparkled. Eve's way, she answered.     Um! Surprise sounded in his grunt. But apples don't grow on Venus.     Eve's daughters don't use apples any more, darling. Come along.     Moving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming,Johnson saw that Caldwell had risen and was following them. Caldwell'sface was writhing in apprehensive agony and he was making warningsigns. Johnson ignored them. With Vee Vee's fingers lightly patting hisarm, they moved into the Room of the Dreaming.      II     It was a huge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling rampsrising up from an open space at the bottom. There ought to have beena stage there at the bottom, but there wasn't. Instead there was anopen space, a mat, and a head rest. Up at the top of the circling rampsthe room was in darkness, a fit hiding place for ghosts or Venusianwerewolves. Pillows and a thick rug covered the circling ramps.     The soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer was stronger here. Thethrobbing of the lutes was louder. It was Venusian music the lutes wereplaying. Human ears found it inharmonious at first, but as they becameaccustomed to it, they began to detect rhythms and melodies that humanminds had not known existed. The room was pleasantly cool but it hadthe feel of dampness. A world that was rarely without pelting rainwould have the feel of dampness in its dreaming rooms.     The music playing strange harmonies in his ears, the perfume sendingtingling feelings through his nose, Johnson entered the Room of theDreamer. He suspected that other forces, unknown to him, were catchinghold of his senses. He had been in dreaming rooms many times before buthe had not grown accustomed to them. He wondered if any human everdid. A touch of chill always came over him as he crossed the threshold.In entering these places, it was as if some unknown nerve centerinside the human organism was touched by something, some force, someradiation, some subtlety, that quite escaped radiation. He felt thecoldness now.     Vee Vee's fingers left off patting his arm.     Do you feel it, darling?     Yes.     What is it?     How would I know?     Please! Her voice grew sharp. I think Johnny Johnson ought to know.     Johnny! How do you know my name?     Shouldn't I recognize one of Earth's foremost scientists, even if heis incognito on Venus? Her voice had a teasing quality in it.     But\u2014     And who besides Johnny Johnson would recognize the Karmer nerve gripand be able to break it instantly?     Hell\u2014     John Michael Johnson, known as Johnny to his friends, Earth's foremostexpert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the humanbody! Her words were needles of icy fact, each one jabbing deeper anddeeper into him.     And how would I make certain you were Johnny Johnson, except by seeingif you could break the Karmer nerve grip? If you could break it, thenthere was no doubt who you were! Her words went on and on.     Who are you? His words were blasts of sound.     Please, darling, you are making a scene. I am sure this is the lastthing you really want to do.     He looked quickly around them. The Venusians and humans moving intothis room seemed to be paying no attention to him. His gaze came backto her.     Again she patted his arm. Relax, darling. Your secrets are safe withme.     A gray color came up inside his soul. But\u2014but\u2014 His voice wassuddenly weak.     The fingers on his arm were very gentle. No harm will come to you. AmI not with you?     That's what I'm afraid of! he snapped at her. If he had had achoice, he might have drawn back. But with circumstances as theywere\u2014his life, Caldwell's life, possibly Vee Vee's life hung in thebalance. Didn't she know that this was true? And as for Martin\u2014ButCaldwell had said that she had been asking about Martin. Whatconnection did she have with that frantic human genius he sought here?     Johnson felt his skin crawl. He moved toward a nest of cushions ona ramp, found a Venusian was beating him to them, deftly changed toanother nest, found it. Vee Vee flowed to the floor on his right, movedcushions to make him more comfortable. She moved in an easy sort of waythat was all flowing movement. He sat down. Someone bumped him on theleft.     Sorry, bud. Didn't mean to bump into you. Caldwell's voice was stillthick and heavy. He sprawled to the floor on Johnson's left. Underthe man's coat, Johnson caught a glimpse of a slight bulge, the zitgun hidden there. His left arm pressed against his own coat, feelinghis own zit gun. Operating under gas pressure, throwing a charge ofgas-driven corvel, the zit guns were not only almost noiseless inoperation but they knocked out a human or a Venusian in a matter ofseconds.     True, the person they knocked unconscious would be all right the nextday. For this reason, many people did not regard the zit guns aseffective weapons, but Johnson had a fondness for them. The feel of thelittle weapon inside his coat sent a surge of comfort through him.     The music picked up a beat, perfume seemed to flow even more freelythrough the air, the lights dimmed almost to darkness, a single brightspotlight appeared in the ceiling, casting a circle of brilliantillumination on the mat and the headrest at the bottom of the room. Thecurtain rose.   <doc-sep> Unger stood in the middle of the spot of light.     Johnson felt his chest muscles contract, then relax. Vee Vee's fingerssought his arm, not to harm him but running to him for protection. Hecaught the flutter of her breathing. On his left, Caldwell stiffenedand became a rock.     Johnson had not seen Unger appear. One second the circle of lighthad been empty, the next second the Venusian, smiling with all theimpassivity of a bland Buddha, was in the light. He weighed threehundred pounds if he weighed an ounce, he was clad in a long robethat would impede movement. He had appeared in the bright beam of thespotlight as if by magic.     Vee Vee's fingers dug deeper into Johnson's arm. How\u2014     Shhh. Nobody knows.     No human knew the answer to that trick. Unless perhaps Martin\u2014     Unger bowed. A little ripple of something that was not quite soundpassed through the audience. Unger bowed again. He stretched himselfflat on the mat, adjusted the rest to support his head, and apparentlywent to sleep. Johnson saw the Dreamer's eyes close, watched the chesttake on the even, regular rhythm of sleep.     The music changed, a slow dreamy tempo crept into it. Vee Vee's fingersdug at Johnson's arm as if they were trying to dig under his hide forprotection. She was shivering. He reached for her hand, patted it. Shedrew closer to him.     A few minutes earlier, she had been a very certain young woman, ableto take care of herself, and handle anyone around her. Now she wassuddenly uncertain, suddenly scared. In the Room of the Dreaming, shehad suddenly become a frightened child looking for protection.     Haven't you ever seen this before? he whispered.     N\u2014o. She shivered again. Oh, Johnny....     Under the circle of light pouring down from the ceiling, the Dreamerlay motionless. Johnson found himself with the tendency to hold hisbreath. He was waiting, waiting, waiting\u2014for what? The whole situationwas senseless, silly, but under its apparent lack of coherence, hesensed a pattern. Perhaps the path to the far-off stars passed thisway, through such scented and musical and impossible places as theseRooms of the Dreamers. Certainly Martin thought so. And Johnson himselfwas not prepared to disagree.     Around him, he saw that the Venusians were already going ... going ...going.... Some of them were already gone. This was an old experienceto them. They went rapidly. Humans went more slowly.     The Venusian watchers had relaxed. They looked as if they were asleep,perhaps in a hypnotic trance, lulled into this state by the musicand the perfume, and by something else. It was this something elsethat sent Johnson's thoughts pounding. The Venusians were like opiumsmokers. But he was not smoking opium. He was not in a hypnotic trance.He was wide awake and very much alert. He was ...       watching a space ship float in an endless void     .     As Unger had come into the spotlight, so the space ship had come intohis vision, out of nowhere, out of nothingness. The room, the Dreamer,the sound of the music, the sweetness of the perfume, Vee Vee andCaldwell were gone. They were no longer in his reality. They were notin the range of his vision. It was as if they did not exist. Yet heknew they did exist, the memory of them, and of other things, was outon the periphery of his universe, perhaps of      the     universe.     All he saw was the space ship.     It was a wonderful thing, perhaps the most beautiful sight he had seenin his life. At the sight of it, a deep glow sprang inside of him.     Back when he had been a kid he had dreamed of flight to the far-offstars. He had made models of space ships. In a way, they had shaped hisdestiny, had made him what he was. They had brought him where he wasthis night, to the Dream Room of a Venusian tavern.     The vision of the space ship floating in the void entranced andthrilled him. Something told him that this was real; that here and nowhe was making contact with a vision that belonged to time.     He started to his feet. Fingers gripped his arm.     Please, darling. You startled me. Don't move. Vee Vee's voice. Whowas Vee Vee?     The fingers dug into his arm. Pain came up in him. The space shipvanished. He looked with startled eyes at Vee Vee, at the Dream Room,at Unger, dreaming on the mat under the spot.     You ... you startled me, Vee Vee whispered. She released the grip onhis arm.     But, didn't you see it?     See what?     The space ship!     No. No. She seemed startled and a little terrified and half asleep.I ... I was watching something else. When you moved I broke contactwith my dream.     Your dream?     He asked a question but she did not answer it. Sit down, darling,and look at your damned space ship. Her voice was a taut whisper ofsound in the darkened room. Johnson settled down. A glance to his lefttold him that Caldwell was still sitting like a chunk of stone.... TheVenusians were quiet. The music had shifted. A slow languorous beatof hidden drums filled the room. There was another sound present, ahigh-speed whirring. It was, somehow, a familiar sound, but Johnson hadnot heard it before in this place.     He thought about the space ship he had seen.     The vision would not come.     He shook his head and tried again.     Beside him, Vee Vee was silent, her face ecstatic, like the face of awoman in love.     He tried again for the space ship.     It would not come.     Anger came up instead.     Somehow he had the impression that the whirring sound which keptintruding into his consciousness was stopping the vision.     So far as he could tell, he was the only one present who was notdreaming, who was not in a state of trance.     His gaze went to Unger, the Dreamer....     Cold flowed over him.     Unger was slowly rising from the mat.     The bland face and the body in the robe were slowly floating upward!      III     An invisible force seemed to twitch at Johnson's skin, nipping it hereand there with a multitude of tiny pinches, like invisible fleas bitinghim.     This is it! a voice whispered in his mind. This is what you came toVenus to see. This ... this.... The first voice went into silence.Another voice took its place.     This is another damned vision! the second voice said. This ...this is something that is not real, that is not possible! No VenusianDreamer, and no one else, can levitate, can defy the laws of gravity,can float upward toward the ceiling. Your damned eyes are tricking you!     We are not tricking you! the eyes hotly insisted. It is happening.We are seeing it. We are reporting accurately to you. That VenusianBuddha is levitating. We, your eyes, do not lie to you!     You lied about the space ship! the second voice said.     We did not lie about the space ship! the eyes insisted. When ourmaster saw that ship we were out of focus, we were not reporting. Someother sense, some other organ, may have lied, but we did not.     I\u2014 Johnson whispered.     I am your skin, another voice whispered. I am covered with sweat.     We are your adrenals. We are pouring forth adrenalin.     I am your pancreas. I am gearing you for action.     I am your thyroid. I....     A multitude of tiny voices seemed to whisper through him. It was as ifthe parts of his body had suddenly found voices and were reporting tohim what they were doing. These were voices out of his training dayswhen he had learned the names of these functions and how to use them.     Be quiet! he said roughly.     The little voices seemed to blend into a single chorus. Action,Master! Do something.     Quiet! Johnson ordered.     But hurry. We are excited.     There is a time to be excited and a time to hurry. In this situation,if action is taken before the time for it\u2014if that time ever comes\u2014wecan all die.     Die? the chorus quavered.     Yes, Johnson said. Now be quiet. When the time goes we will all gotogether.     The chorus went into muted silence. But just under the threshold thelittle voices were a multitude of tiny fretful pressures.     I hear a whirring sound, his ears reported.     Please! Johnson said.     In the front of the room Unger floated ten feet above the floor.     Master, we are not lying! his eyes repeated.     I sweat.... his skin began.     Watch Unger! Johnson said.     The Dreamer floated. If wires suspended him, Johnson could not seethem. If any known force lifted him, Johnson could not detect thatforce. All he could say for certain was that Unger floated.     Yaaah! The silence of a room was broken by the enraged scream of aVenusian being jarred out of his dream.     Damn it! A human voice said.     A wave as sharp as the tip of a sword swept through the room.     Unger fell.     He was ten feet high when he started to fall. With a bone-breaking,body-jarring thud, the Dreamer fell. Hard.     There was a split second of startled silence in the Dreaming Room. Thesilence went. Voices came.     Who did that?     What happened?     That human hidden there did it! He broke the Dreaming! Anger markedthe voices. Although the language was Venusian, Johnson got most of themeaning. His hand dived under his coat for the gun holstered there. Athis left, Caldwell was muttering thickly. What\u2014what happened? I wasback in the lab on Earth\u2014 Caldwell's voice held a plaintive note, asif some pleasant dream had been interrupted.     On Johnson's right, Vee Vee seemed to flow to life. Her arms came uparound his neck. He was instantly prepared for anything. Her lips camehungrily against his lips, pressed very hard, then gently drew away.     What\u2014 he gasped.     I had to do it now, darling, she answered. There may not be a later.     Johnson had no time to ask her what she meant. Somewhere in the backof the room a human screamed. He jerked around. Back there a knot ofVenusians were attacking a man.     It's Martin! Caldwell shouted. He      is     here!     In Johnson's hand as he came to his feet the zit gun throbbed. He firedblindly at the mass of Venusians. Caldwell was firing too. The softthrob of the guns was not audible above the uproar from the crowd.Struck by the gas-driven corvel charges, Venusians were falling. Butthere seemed to be an endless number of them.     Vee Vee? Johnson suddenly realized that she had disappeared. She hadslid out of his sight.     Vee Vee! Johnson's voice became a shout.     To hell with the woman! Caldwell grunted. Martin's the importantone.     Zit, zit, zit, Caldwell moved toward the rear, shooting as he went.Johnson followed.  "

        "Query": "What are the different locations featured in The CONJURER of VENUS?",
        "Summary_1": "The story takes place on Venus at an unspecified point in the future. At the very beginning, the setting is outside on a rainy evening. On Venus, the rain falls in all directions, possibly including straight up. Johnson says that everything on Venus feels like it\u2019s coming at him from all directions. He soon enters the club, a perfumed room with loud Venusian music, a bar that Johnson makes his way to, and \u201cfeeling states\u201d that hit Johnson immediately; specifically feelings of love and sex designed to entice humans and Venusians. When they enter the Room of the Dreamer, the perfume becomes stronger and the music louder, playing harmonies that seem new to the ear. The room is massive and only semi-illuminated, with many tiered, carpet and pillow-lined ramps circling up from an empty space with only a mat and headrest. It feels pleasantly cool but also slightly damp, and guests are greeted by a strange, tangible energy. \n",
        "Summary_2": "The entire story takes place on the very rainy planet of Venus, inside a club in an unnamed Venusian city. The club contains a bar and a special room for The Dreaming, which is a group experience of mental trance led on by a Venusian figure that takes place in a theatre-like seating room within the club. The club itself is filled with loud Venusian rhumba music, smoke and perfume. The dreaming room is dark, damp, and cold with perfumed smells and rhythmic lute music.\n\nThere are some references to the dream locations that characters travel to, like Caldwell dreaming of being back in his lab, but the only physical locations of the story are within the club.\n",
        "Summary_3": "The Conjurer of Venus takes place on Venus, an extremely rainy planet. At first, the characters are in the main room of a bar. Filled with rhythmic music and feelings of desire, fear, and love, the bar feels crowded and full. Headwaiters attend to everyone\u2019s needs, and booths line the walls. There\u2019s a bar where drinks like tarmur may be poured. \nEventually, they enter the Room of the Dreamer. The music is just as strong here, but there\u2019s another feeling to this room, a certain coldness of unknowingness. The room was perfumed and filled with Venusian lute music. A thick rug lined the ground, as well as plenty of cushions. A man and a headrest lie in the center of the room for Unger\u2019s use. \n",
        "Summary_4": "The story is set on Venus where it rains frequently, heavily, and seemingly from all directions. The planet is occupied by Venusians and some Earthmen, and it offers entertainment designed to appeal to emotions, especially love. The society is quite advanced; it provides entertainment venues that offer liquor, women, and dreams to its patrons. The first part of the story takes place at the bar in one of these entertainment venues; the music there is a Venusian rhumba with a strong beat. The atmosphere is clouded with smoke and perfume. A headwaiter greets people at the door and escorts them to the appropriate part of the establishment based on their desires. When it is time for the dreaming, trumpets play, and a different perfume diffuses into the bar. In the dreaming room, there is a mat and a headrest in the center of the floor, and around it, there are tiers of circular ramps covered with thick rugs and groupings of pillow nests. The dreamer\u2019s perfume is stronger in this room, and the air is cool and somewhat damp. Venusian lute music plays louder; this music sounds inharmonious to Earthmen at first, but once they become used to it, they can follow the rhythms and melodies they never knew existed. When it is time for the dreaming to begin, the lights are turned down very low, and a spotlight shines on the mat in the center of the room. A curtain lifts, and the dreamer, in this case, Unger, enters the spotlight. The music, perfume, and something Johnson can\u2019t identify put the dreamer audience into a sort of trance so that they have their own dreams.\n",
        "Article": "  THE SOUL EATERS     By WILLIAM CONOVER     Firebrand Dennis Brooke had one final chance     to redeem himself by capturing Koerber whose     ships were the scourge of the Void. But his     luck had run its course, and now he was     marooned on a rogue planet\u2014fighting to save     himself from a menace weapons could not kill.     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Planet Stories Fall 1944.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]            And so, my dear     , Dennis detected a faint irony in the phrase,       I'mafraid I can offer no competition to the beauties of five planets\u2014oris it six? With regret I bow myself out, and knowing me as you do,you'll understand the futility of trying to convince me again. Anyway,there will be no temptation, for I'm sailing on a new assignment I'veaccepted. I did love you.... Good-by.          Dennis Brooke had lost count of the times he'd read Marla's lastletter, but every time he came to these final, poignant lines, theynever failed to conjure a vision of her tawny loveliness, slender asthe palms of Venus, and of the blue ecstasy of her eyes, wide with aperpetual wonder\u2014limpid as a child's.     The barbaric rhythms of the      Congahua     , were a background of annoyancein Dennis' mind; he frowned slightly as the maneuvers of the Mercuriandancer, who writhed among the guests of the notorious pleasure palace,began to leave no doubt as to her intentions. The girl was beautiful,in a sultry, almost incandescent sort of way, but her open promise lefthim cold. He wanted solitude, somewhere to coordinate his thoughtsin silence and salvage something out of the wreck of his heart, notto speak of his career. But Venus, in the throes of a gigantic boomupon the discovery of radio-active fields, could offer only onesolitude\u2014the fatal one of her swamps and virgin forests.     Dennis Brooke was thirty, the time when youth no longer seems unending.When the minor adventures of the heart begin to pall. If the loss ofMarla left an aching void that all the women of five planets could notfill, the loss of Space, was quite as deadly. For he had been grounded.True, Koerber's escape from the I.S.P. net had not quite been hisfault; but had he not been enjoying the joys of a voluptuous JovianChamber, in Venus' fabulous Inter-planetary Palace, he would have beenready for duty to complete the last link in the net of I.S.P. cruisersthat almost surrounded the space pirate.     A night in the Jovian Chamber, was to be emperor for one night. Everydream of a man's desire was marvelously induced through the skilful useof hypnotics; the rarest viands and most delectable drinks appeared asif by magic; the unearthly peace of an Olympus descended on a man'ssoul, and beauty ... beauty such as men dreamed of was a warm realityunder the ineffable illumination of the Chamber.     It cost a young fortune. But to pleasure mad, boom-ridden Venus, afortune was a bagatelle. Only it had cost Dennis Brooke far more than asheaf of credits\u2014it had cost him the severe rebuff of the I.S.P., andmost of his heart in Marla.     Dennis sighed, he tilted his red, curly head and drank deeply of theinsidious      Verbena     , fragrant as a mint garden, in the tall frostyglass of Martian      Bacca-glas     , and as he did so, his brilliant hazeleyes found themselves gazing into the unwinking, violet stare of ayoung Martian at the next table. There was a smouldering hatred inthose eyes, and something else ... envy, perhaps, or was it jealousy?Dennis couldn't tell. But his senses became instantly alert. Dangerbrought a faint vibration which his superbly trained faculties couldinstantly denote.     His steady, bronzed hand lowered the drink, and his eyes narrowedslightly. Absorbed in trying to puzzle the sudden enmity of thisMartian stranger, he was unaware of the Mercurian Dancer. The latterhad edged closer, whirling in prismatic flashes from the myriadsemi-precious stones that studded her brief gauze skirt. And now, ina final bid for the spacer's favor she flung herself in his lap andtilted back invitingly.     Some of the guests laughed, others stared in plain envy at thehandsome, red-haired spacer, but from the table across, came thetinkling sound of a fragile glass being crushed in a powerful hand,and a muffled Martian curse. Without warning, the Martian was on hisfeet with the speed of an Hellacorium, the table went crashing to oneside as he leaped with deadly intent on the sprawled figure of DennisBrooke. A high-pitched scream brought instant silence as a Terran girlcried out. Then the Martian's hand reached out hungrily. But Dennis wasnot there.   <doc-sep> Seeming to grind her teeth, the Old O Woman turned abruptly to leaveO'Rielly's watch room. Was all O'Rielly could do to keep from bustingout laughing for joy.     Old Woman had been flimflammed for fair! Dear Trillium was saved! Andbetwixt O'Rielly's grand brain and Callahan's great experience she'd behappy forever.     A fine loud thump, however, was now heard. Old Woman whirled back andyanked open the doors under O'Rielly's bunk.     Of all the sappy hiding places! Callahan yelped, in surprise ofcourse.     Trillium? His Excellency bellowed as if stung by one of thesabre-tailed hornets of his native planet. Trillium!     Trillium, O'Rielly pleaded in loving anguish, why do you have tokeep coming out of hiding just when nobody's going to find you?     Her eyes merely became deep pools in which O'Rielly would have gladlydrowned himself if he could.       There are rewards, the Old Woman said with the deadly coldness ofouter space, for Earthmen found in a Venus woman's company, and forher leaving her planet.     Shut up! His Excellency's ear beards were standing straight outsideways. I'll handle this!     May I remind His Excellency, the Old Woman snapped, that I representEarth and her dominion of space gained by right of original flight!     May I remind the Captain, His Excellency declared fit to be heardback to his planet, that I am the Personal Ambassador of the Presidentof Venus and this thing can mean war!     Yes! War in which people will actually die! As His Excellency paledat that grisly remark, the Old Woman spoke through her teeth atO'Rielly, Callahan and Trillium. All right, come along!     O'Rielly joined the death march gladly. He felt the way Callahanlooked: ready to wrap his arms around Trillium's brave loveliness andprotect it to his last breath of life.     Old Woman led the way to her office. Jabbed some buttons on her desk.Panels on opposite walls lit up.     Presidents of Earth and Venus, please, the Old Woman stated evenly.Interplanetary emergency.     Highly groomed flunkies appeared on the panels and were impersonallypleasant.     Madame President's office. She is in a Cabinet meeting.     Mr. President's office. He is in personal command of our glorious warefforts.     Old Woman sighed through her teeth. Venus woman aboard this ship.Stowaway. Rattle that around your belfries.     The flunkies' faces went slack with shock, then were replaced by ablizzard of scrambled faces and torrents of incoherent voices.     Finally on the Earth panel appeared the famous classic features. Thefacts, if you please, Captain Hatwoody.     The Venus panel finally held steady on universally notorious features,that were as fierce as an eagle's, in a fancy war helmet. Trillium! Myown granddaughter? Impossible! Dimdooly, Mr. President roared at hisExcellency, what's this nonsense?     Some loud creature is interfering, Madame President snapped withannoyance.     Blasted fools still have the circuits crossed, Mr. President swore.Some silly female cackling now!     The parties in the panels saw each other now. Each one's left hand on adesk moved toward a big red button marked, ROCKETS.     So, Mr. President said evenly. Another violation by your Earthmen.     By your granddaughter, at least, Madame President replied coolly.     An innocent child, Mr. President snapped, obviously kidnapped bythose two idiotic Earthmen there!     Oh, no, Grandpapa, Trillium said swiftly; I stole away all bymyself, and Mr. O'Rielly and Callahan have been very helpful.     Impossible! Grandpapa President's ear beards stood near straight upas he roared, You couldn't have stolen away by yourself! Trillium,tell the truth!     Very well. Grandmamma told me how.   <doc-sep> Obviously Trillium's poor little brain has been drugged, HisExcellency Dimdooly declared. Grandmamma Berta wouldn't know the firstthing about such things!     Impossible! Grandpapa President agreed. I've been married to herfor a hundred and twenty-four and a half years and she's the finestrattle-brain I ever knew!     She learned, Trillium stated emphatically, a hundred and twenty-fiveyears ago.     Hundred twenty-five, Grandpapa president growled like a boilingvolcano. The year some Earthman....

        "Query": "What can we learn about the culture on Venus from The CONJURER of VENUS?",
        "Summary_1": "The culture on Venus is complex and futuristic, and seems to cater to both Venusians and humans. Women don\u2019t appear to have a particularly high status. A bar like the one the story takes place in is apparently not safe for unaccompanied women, based on Johnson\u2019s initial reaction to her being there alone; he worries that Earth men might abduct her for sex and that Venusians might kill her to steal her jewelry. When Johnson enters, the head waiter asks if he wants liquor, women, or dreams, implying that sex work or some other transactional use of \u201cwomen\u201d is at play there. Through its use of \u201cfeeling states\u201d, the Venusian nightlife appears to have commodified the emotions that people already possess in an attempt to entice, confuse, and manipulate. The popularity of \u201cdreaming\u201d further shows an emphasis on escape and illusion in this culture. The drinks served also seem as much a visual experience as a drinking experience: the bar seems to want to stimulate all senses. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Venusians have a very rich sensory experience in their culture. In the story they are capable of operating at different electromagnetic frequencies than humans - creating trance-like dreams, guided by perfumes and rhythmic music. The humans also experience various feeling states like you would experience smells as they enter the Venusian bar.\n\nVenus is also a place that is dangerous for humans, and although their culture welcomes them to patronize clubs and the dreamings, Venusians are known to harm humans. It\u2019s described that humans die easily where the story takes place and that the motives of human killers are not questioned. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Venus is clearly not very friendly towards humans. According to Johnson, many humans are killed here without so much of an investigation or a worry. Apparently, there were plenty of motives for killing humans, so there was no need to do any sort of investigation. Hence his anxiety when he first met Vee Vee. Her necklace, which he claims Vneusiams would kill her for, and her body, which Earthmen would steal her for, make her a shiny target in Venus. \nBased on the crowdedness of the bar, it seems that Venus has a hedonistic culture. Venusians and humans alike swarm toward the Room of the Dreamer, a way to be able to transport themselves from their present reality to another. \n",
        "Summary_4": "\n\tThe Venusian culture is very centered on feelings and sensations, especially love and the desire for sex. Their entertainment venues are scented with perfumes, and their music has a wild, frantic beat. The different fragrances seem to have different effects. For example, when the dreaming time is near, waves are perfume flow into an area, but the strongest perfume is the one of the dreamer. Their dreaming rooms are designed to provide pleasant feelings with their plush carpets and cozy pillow nests. Venusians in businesses behave in a very patronizing way with humans, referring to them as \u201cmighty humans\u201d and offering them whatever they want. Outside of business dealings, Venusians are less friendly. Single human women are not safe, though, because Venusians are likely to kill a woman to steal a beautiful necklace that she is wearing, and on Venus, no human deaths are investigated, and they happen rather often. There appears to be some antipathy between Venusians and humans; Johnson fears for his life if the Venusians know he is there searching for Martin. And during the dreaming, a Venusian accuses a human of waking him from his dream. The Venusian is enraged, and he and the other Venusians descend on the human and attack him. \n",

But his     luck had run its course, and now he was     marooned on a rogue planet\u2014fighting to save     himself from a menace weapons could not kill.     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Planet Stories Fall 1944.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]            And so, my dear     , Dennis detected a faint irony in the phrase,       I'mafraid I can offer no competition to the beauties of five planets\u2014oris it six? With regret I bow myself out, and knowing me as you do,you'll understand the futility of trying to convince me again. Anyway,there will be no temptation, for I'm sailing on a new assignment I'veaccepted. I did love you.... Good-by.          Dennis Brooke had lost count of the times he'd read Marla's lastletter, but every time he came to these final, poignant lines, theynever failed to conjure a vision of her tawny loveliness, slender asthe palms of Venus, and of the blue ecstasy of her eyes, wide with aperpetual wonder\u2014limpid as a child's.     The barbaric rhythms of the      Congahua     , were a background of annoyancein Dennis' mind; he frowned slightly as the maneuvers of the Mercuriandancer, who writhed among the guests of the notorious pleasure palace,began to leave no doubt as to her intentions. The girl was beautiful,in a sultry, almost incandescent sort of way, but her open promise lefthim cold. He wanted solitude, somewhere to coordinate his thoughtsin silence and salvage something out of the wreck of his heart, notto speak of his career. But Venus, in the throes of a gigantic boomupon the discovery of radio-active fields, could offer only onesolitude\u2014the fatal one of her swamps and virgin forests.     Dennis Brooke was thirty, the time when youth no longer seems unending.When the minor adventures of the heart begin to pall. If the loss ofMarla left an aching void that all the women of five planets could notfill, the loss of Space, was quite as deadly. For he had been grounded.True, Koerber's escape from the I.S.P. net had not quite been hisfault; but had he not been enjoying the joys of a voluptuous JovianChamber, in Venus' fabulous Inter-planetary Palace, he would have beenready for duty to complete the last link in the net of I.S.P. cruisersthat almost surrounded the space pirate.     A night in the Jovian Chamber, was to be emperor for one night. Everydream of a man's desire was marvelously induced through the skilful useof hypnotics; the rarest viands and most delectable drinks appeared asif by magic; the unearthly peace of an Olympus descended on a man'ssoul, and beauty ... beauty such as men dreamed of was a warm realityunder the ineffable illumination of the Chamber.     It cost a young fortune. But to pleasure mad, boom-ridden Venus, afortune was a bagatelle. Only it had cost Dennis Brooke far more than asheaf of credits\u2014it had cost him the severe rebuff of the I.S.P., andmost of his heart in Marla.     Dennis sighed, he tilted his red, curly head and drank deeply of theinsidious      Verbena     , fragrant as a mint garden, in the tall frostyglass of Martian      Bacca-glas     , and as he did so, his brilliant hazeleyes found themselves gazing into the unwinking, violet stare of ayoung Martian at the next table. There was a smouldering hatred inthose eyes, and something else ... envy, perhaps, or was it jealousy?Dennis couldn't tell. But his senses became instantly alert. Dangerbrought a faint vibration which his superbly trained faculties couldinstantly denote.     His steady, bronzed hand lowered the drink, and his eyes narrowedslightly. Absorbed in trying to puzzle the sudden enmity of thisMartian stranger, he was unaware of the Mercurian Dancer. The latterhad edged closer, whirling in prismatic flashes from the myriadsemi-precious stones that studded her brief gauze skirt. And now, ina final bid for the spacer's favor she flung herself in his lap andtilted back invitingly.     Some of the guests laughed, others stared in plain envy at thehandsome, red-haired spacer, but from the table across, came thetinkling sound of a fragile glass being crushed in a powerful hand,and a muffled Martian curse. Without warning, the Martian was on hisfeet with the speed of an Hellacorium, the table went crashing to oneside as he leaped with deadly intent on the sprawled figure of DennisBrooke. A high-pitched scream brought instant silence as a Terran girlcried out. Then the Martian's hand reached out hungrily. But Dennis wasnot there.   <doc-sep>   The CONJURER of VENUS     By CONAN T. TROY       A world-famed Earth scientist had disappeared on Venus.       When Johnson found him, he found too the secret to that       globe-shaking mystery\u2014the fabulous Room of The Dreaming.       [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Planet Stories November 1952.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      The city dripped with rain. Crossing the street toward the dive,Johnson got rain in his eyes, his nose, and his ears. That was the waywith the rain here. It came at you from all directions. There had beenoccasions when Johnson had thought the rain was falling straight up.Otherwise, how had the insides of his pants gotten wet?     On Venus, everything came at you from all directions, it seemed toJohnson. Opening the door of the joint, it was noise instead of rainthat came at him, the wild frantic beat of a Venusian rhumba, thenotes pounding and jumping through the smoke and perfume clouded room.Feeling states came at him, intangible, but to his trained senses,perceptible emotional nuances of hate, love, fear, and rage. But mostlylove. Since this place had been designed to excite the senses of bothhumans and Venusians, the love feelings were heavily tinged withstraight sex. He sniffed at them, feeling them somewhere inside of him,aware of them but aware also that here was apprehension, and plain fear.     Caldwell, sitting in a booth next to the door, glanced up as Johnsonentered but neither Caldwell's facial expression or his eyes revealedthat he had ever seen this human before. Nor did Johnson seem torecognize Caldwell.     Is the mighty human wanting liquor, a woman or dreams? His voicewas all soft syllables of liquid sound. The Venusian equivalent of aheadwaiter was bowing to him.     I'll have a tarmur to start, Johnson said. How are the dreamstonight?     Ze vill be the most wonserful of all sonight. The great Unger hisselfwill be here to do ze dreaming. There is no ozzer one who has quitehis touch at dreaming, mighty one. The headwaiter spread his handsin a gesture indicating ecstasy. It is my great regret that I must doze work tonight instead of being wiz ze dreamers. Ah, ze great Ungerhisself! The headwaiter kissed the tips of his fingers.     Um, Johnson said. The great Unger! His voice expressed surprise,just the right amount of it. I'll have a tarmur to start but when doesthe dreaming commence?     In one zonar or maybe less. Shall I make ze reservations for ze mightyone? As he was speaking, the headwaiter was deftly conducting Johnsonto the bar.     Not just yet, Johnson said. See me a little later.     But certainly. The headwaiter was gone into the throng. Johnson wasat the bar. Behind it, a Venusian was bowing to him. Tarmur, Johnsonsaid. The green drink was set before him. He held it up to the light,admiring the slow rise of the tiny golden bubbles in it. To him,watching the bubbles rise was perhaps more important than drinkingitself.     Beautiful, aren't they? a soft voice said. He glanced to his right.A girl had slid into the stool beside him. She wore a green dress cutvery low at the throat. Her skin had the pleasant tan recently onEarth. Her hair was a shade of abundant brown and her eyes were blue,the color of the skies of Earth. A necklace circled her throat andbelow the necklace ... Johnson felt his pulse quicken, for two reasons.Women such as this one had been quickening the pulse of men since thedays of Adam. The second reason concerned her presence here in thisplace where no woman in her right mind ever came unescorted. Her eyessmiled up at him unafraid. Didn't she know there were men present herein this space port city who would snatch her bodily from the barstool and carry her away for sleeping purposes? And Venusians werehere who would cut her pretty throat for the sake of the necklace thatcircled it?     They      are     beautiful, he said, smiling.     Thank you.     I was referring to the bubbles.     You were talking about my eyes, she answered, unperturbed.     How did you know? I mean....     I am very knowing, the girl said, smiling.     Are you sufficiently knowing to be here?     For an instant, as if doubt crossed her mind, the smile flickered. Thenit came again, stronger. Aren't you here?     Johnson choked as bubbles from the tarmur seemed to go suddenly up hisnose. My dear child ... he sputtered.     I am not a child, she answered with a firm sureness that left nodoubt in his mind that she knew what she was saying. And my name isVee Vee.     Vee Vee? Um. That is....     Don't you think it's a nice name?     I certainly do. Probably the rest of it is even nicer.     There is no more of it. Just Vee Vee. Like Topsy, I just grew.  "

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the story's storyline?",
        "Summary_1": "Ferdinand is a young man accompanying his sister Evelyn on a spaceliner called the Eleanor Roosevelt with 300 hundred other women. The final destination of the spaceship is Venus, where the women hope to find a husband. Although women are in charge, the crew of the ship is all men. Ferdinand decides to explore the ship, and he encounters a large red sign forbidding passengers from entering the next deck. Despite being hesitant at first, he decides to break the law anyway because he is technically not a passenger on the ship. Ferdinand is amazed to see the stars, the moon, and another spaceliner take off in space. Unfazed by the next sign that tells unauthorized personnel to leave, he goes to the porthole and tries to figure out a way to open it by trying various methods. Suddenly, the door opens, and a large man plucks him inside by the throat. The man recognizes him as a brother to one of the Anura, which he defines as a herd of women looking for mates. Ferdinand explains his childhood in the Undersea and his parents, to which the other man listens intently. He also mentions that he and his sister have left Earth because she realized there would be no future there. All men have either died in wars, become negatively affected by radioactivity, or gone off to the planets. Then, the older man explains that there are little to no women on Venus, and he had no idea that women were in charge when he first went to Earth to find a wife. He had been arrested and was charged but decided to become a stowaway instead. The man, who introduces himself as Alberta (Butt) Lee Brown, gives Ferdinand the nickname Ford and talks more about his past. Eventually, he asks more about Evelyn, and Ferdinand does not overthink his intentions when he answers. Later, Evelyn then forces Ferdinand to go to a geography lecture with her, where she continuously asks questions and takes notes. However, she does not write down his answer after he corrects the purser and instead takes him back to the cabin to lecture him. They begin to debate, and Ferdinand begins to use the words and knowledge he learned from Butt. Evelyn is suspicious that somebody has been feeding him rebellious opinions, and she begins to hound him for answers after seeing he has a photo of her in his pocket. He then takes Evelyn to see Butt, and she begins to lecture him about breaking the law. While the both of them debate over Butt\u2019s status as a criminal and stowaway, he suddenly suggests that they should get married. Evelyn is surprised by his proposal, and Ferdinand eagerly urges her to accept it. ",
        "Summary_2": "Ferdinand Sparling is accompanying his older sister, Evelyn, on a trip to Venus. Society on Earth is ruled by women, and there are barely enough men for each, so many women take a trip to Venus, where men are in surplus, to find a husband. Ferdinand and Evelyn are aboard the Eleanor Roosevelt. Ferdinand decides to explore the ship alone, coming across rooms and areas that passengers are not allowed to go past; he notes that he wasn't really a passenger, because men weren't citizens, and explores them anyway. Ferdinand comes across Lifeboat 47, whose doors are voice activated. He tries to open the doors, and is then pulled inside by a strange, large man with long hair. Ferdinand introduces himself, and quickly learns that the man is a Venusian. Ferdinand tells him about Undersea, where he and Evelyn are from, and his family, including the death of his parents and Evelyn's decision to migrate in search of a husband afterwards. The man tells Ferdinand about growing up on Venus, about how there, it was still a man's world. He had visited Earth to find a wife, but unaware of society there, was quickly in trouble and sentenced to prison. To avoid going broke, he stowed away on the ship. The man introduces himself as Butt, his full name being Alberta Lee Brown, and begins calling Ferdinand \"Ford\". Butt continues telling stories of Venus, such as stories of his brothers, Venusian songs and vocabulary, and Butt's blaster, a weapon that he does not allow Ford to touch. Ferdinand begins visiting Butt regularly, bringing him fresh fruit from the dining hall. Butt starts to gain interest in Evelyn, and Ferdinand answers questions about her for him. One day, Ferdinand and Evelyn are in a geography lecture, where Ferdinand discusses dunging, a concept that has been censored by Earth's libraries. This makes Evelyn suspicious, and she interrogates Ferdinand about where he got the information. Ferdinand digs his hole deeper, using Venusian vocabulary and sharing ideas of male dominance. Evelyn then finds a picture of her in Ferdinand's pocket, and demands to know what man he is speaking to. Ferdinand confesses and tells Evelyn about Butt, and he takes her to visit him. There, she yells at Butt, and threatens legal action, and Butt then makes a surprising proposal; he suggests the two get married.",
        "Summary_3": "Ferdinand is on a spaceship with his elder sister. The ship is jam-packed with females going to Venus in search of husband and he exits the cabin while the women are still in their hammocks. The women at his times have all the rights and do all the important things since the Male Desuffrage Act, so the boy is admitted to the ship on behalf of his sister. He explores the empty ship in search of portholes and after some hesitation enters a forbidden area. There he looks at the stars and then tries to open a lock on the lifeboat. A huge scary man appears with a blaster and frighteningly cold gaze. Ferdinand explains that he comes from Undersea, an area on Earth, and tells his family story - his parents being one of the first married couples in Undersea and dying a while ago, leading to his sister's decision to migrate to Venus. The stranger, Butt, tells about the lack of women on Venus and his travel to Earth in search of a wife without any idea \"it's a woman's world\". So he got in trouble with the law and stowed away on this ship. His many brothers were killed in a rising and only one is left. From that day on Ferdinand keeps visiting the stowaway bringing fruits and listening to stories about Venus. Butt teaches the boy to use the blaster without giving it not hold and constantly asks about Evelyn, the sister. Once, Ferdinand attends a geography lecture on the ship with his sister and corrects the lecturer about Venusian geography. Evelyn starts eliciting where the boy learned that and the boy tells about real men working on Venus. Sis gets angry with those masculine ideas and doesn't believe them to come from a little boy. Ferdinand tries to lie but Sis suppresses him into confession and he leads her to Butt. She tells Butt about all the laws he has broken while the least responds with an appeal to sense. Suddenly, Butt simply proposes a mutually beneficial marriage to stop the debate. ",
        "Summary_4": "Ferdinand Sparling is a passenger aboard that spaceship Eleanor Roosavelt. He lives in a future society in which only women are citizens of Earth, and he is traveling to Venus with his sister Evelyn where she is in search of a husband. Women are seen as intellectuals and the only ones fit to work in positions like the government. As everyone sleeps just after the ship has taken off, Ferdinand decides to explore the ship. He comes to the hull of the ship, the crew are still asleep. In the hull are multiple doors leading to lifeboats. Ferdinand manages to open one of them, and is pulled into the lifeboat by a huge, intimidating looking man. He relates to Ferdinand how he is from Venus and had traveled to Earth to find a wife. Once he got to Earth, he realised that the planet was run by women, and when he didn't realise he has to book into a government run hotel for transient males, assaulted a barman and resisted arrest and was held for contempt in court, he decided to escape back to Venus as a stowaway. When Ferdinand attends a geography lecture with his sister, and reveals the knowledge that he has acquired from spending his days with the Venusian Butt Lee Brown, his sister becomes suspicious. He eventually gets the information that he has been spending time with a stowaway out of him. He takes her to see Butt, where she interrogates him. He tells her how he has enough money for a ticket, but doesn't want to get caught and face charges back on Earth. He tells her how he has admired her from the stories that Ferdinand has told of her, and asks her to marry him. THE END. ",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]       Every lonely man tries to make friends.     Manet just didn't know when to stop!      William Manet was alone.     In the beginning, he had seen many advantages to being alone. It wouldgive him an unprecedented opportunity to once and for all correlateloneliness to the point of madness, to see how long it would take himto start slavering and clawing the pin-ups from the magazines, to beginteaching himself classes in philosophy consisting of interminablelectures to a bored and captive audience of one.     He would be able to measure the qualities of peace and decide whetherit was really better than war, he would be able to get as fat and asdirty as he liked, he would be able to live more like an animal andthink more like a god than any man for generations.     But after a shorter time than he expected, it all got to be a tearingbore. Even the waiting to go crazy part of it.     Not that he was going to have any great long wait of it. He was alreadytalking to himself, making verbal notes for his lectures, and he hadcut out a picture of Annie Oakley from an old book. He tacked it up andwinked at it whenever he passed that way.     Lately she was winking back at him.     Loneliness was a physical weight on his skull. It peeled the flesh fromhis arms and legs and sandpapered his self-pity to a fine sensitivity.     No one on Earth was as lonely as William Manet, and even William Manetcould only be this lonely on Mars.     Manet was Atmosphere Seeder Station 131-47's own human.     All Manet had to do was sit in the beating aluminum heart in the middleof the chalk desert and stare out, chin cupped in hands, at the flat,flat pavement of dirty talcum, at the stars gleaming as hard in theblack sky as a starlet's capped teeth ... stars two of which were moonsand one of which was Earth. He had to do nothing else. The wholegimcrack was cybernetically controlled, entirely automatic. No one wasneeded here\u2014no human being, at least.     The Workers' Union was a pretty small pressure group, but it didn'ttake much to pressure the Assembly. Featherbedding had been carefullyspecified, including an Overseer for each of the Seeders to honeycombMars, to prepare its atmosphere for colonization.     They didn't give tests to find well-balanced, well-integrated peoplefor the job. Well-balanced, well-integrated men weren't going toisolate themselves in a useless job. They got, instead, William Manetand his fellows.     The Overseers were to stay as long as the job required. Passenger fareto Mars was about one billion dollars. They weren't providing commuterservice for night shifts. They weren't providing accommodationsfor couples when the law specified only one occupant. They weren'tproviding fuel (at fifty million dollars a gallon) for visits betweenthe various Overseers. They weren't very providential.     But it was two hundred thousand a year in salary, and it offeredwonderful opportunities.     It gave William Manet an opportunity to think he saw a spaceship makinga tailfirst landing on the table of the desert, its tail burning asbright as envy.  "

        "Query": "What are the characteristics of Evelyn Sparling in the story Venus Is a Man's World?",
        "Summary_1": "Evelyn Sparling is the older sister of Ferdinand Sparling. She is seven years older than him and was born in the Undersea. Her parents were one of the first people to get married in the Undersea, and her mom was an Undersea representative in the World Council. Furthermore, her mom was heavily involved in the Male Desuffrage Act and the Maternal Revolution before being blown up in a surfacing boat alongside her husband. Evelyn herself is proficient in operating sub-surface machinery, believes firmly in the ideals of women leading politics, and is also very focused on affairs that other women do not care much about. She is also skilled at detecting lies, seeing past Ferdinand\u2019s lies that he spoke of to protect Butt\u2019s identity. Moreover, she has a very assertive personality. She did not back down from correcting Ferdinand about the opinions he picked up from Butt, which she classifies as masculinist and anti-socialist. Even if Butt is an intimidating man, her righteousness still shines through when she begins to scold him for escaping Earth on the Eleanor Roosevelt and about how he is also implicating Ferdinand in breaking the law by having the younger boy deliver fruit to him. Despite Evelyn\u2019s forceful nature, she does care for her younger brother and tells him what women appreciate in men. ",
        "Summary_2": "Evelyn Sparling is the older sister of Ferdinand by seven years. She watches over Ferdinand and takes on almost a maternal role, scolding him and directing him throughout the story. Evelyn is strong-minded and intelligent, well-versed in politics. She represents the typical woman in the societal structure of Earth, and advises her brother to be the ideal man. Evelyn is extremely cautious and abides by the rules; when she finds out that Ferdinand has been talking to Butt, she panics and tries to put an end to it as soon as possible.",
        "Summary_3": "Evelyn Sparling is Ferdinand's sister. She is migrating to Venus as many other women in search of a husband. She is bossy, lecturing and the head of the family of two - her and her brother. She is described as healthy, she is a careful student who listens and takes notes of every word. She is very serious and concentrated. She follows the law and enjoys politics, she wants to lead. She is a feminist, as most women on Earth, and she is very insistent. ",
        "Summary_4": "Evelyn Sparling is the sister of Ferdinand Sparling. She is on the way to Venus, aboard the spaceship \"Eleanor Roosavelt '', in search of a husband. She is an intellectual woman, constantly reading. She hopes to work in a government position some day, after she has found a husband. She realises that there are only three men to every four women on Earth, so she must look elsewhere. She teaches Ferdinand to be intellectually driven, and well spoken, as women will admire those characteristics when he enters the marriage market. She is the only girl in the geography lecture who takes notes, making sure to keep her mind in shape. To Butt, Ferdinand describes Evelyn as a \"healthy girl\". When she realises what Feridinand was up to, she promises not to turn Butt in, showing her kind side. She interrogates Butt, interrogating him and scorning him for breaking the law. She does seem to let him off in the end though after he has explained his case. She is a very learned, intelligent and fair person. ",
        "Article": "Then I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. Notice! Passengersnot permitted past this point! A big sign in red.     I peeked around the corner. I knew it\u2014the next deck was the hull. Icould see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with thevelvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamedexisted in the Universe.     There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And thisdistance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely.If I just took one quick look....     But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.Then I saw the big red sign again. Passengers not permitted\u2014     Well! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be EarthCitizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. Anddidn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order toget an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in thecareful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that tomen.     Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. Youcan't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an EarthPassport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of thisclause\u2014'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family,this number not to exceed the registered quota of sub-regulationspertaining'\u2014and so on. I want you to understand these matters, so thatyou will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs.No matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men.     Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumbthings. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what      Women     like and appreciate that counts when it comes to people gettingmarried. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like herwouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.     Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to dowith me. I knew what Sis could say to      that     , but at least it was anargument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.     I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off tothe left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in themovies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holdingoff the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured itmust be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my noseagainst the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off,Marsbound. I wished I was on that one!     Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch ofblank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on thewall in glowing red letters were the words, Lifeboat 47. Passengers:Thirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!     Another one of those signs.   <doc-sep> He had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brotherwhen the dinner gong rang. Butt told me to scat. He said I was agrowing tadpole and needed my vitamins. And he mentioned, veryoff-hand, that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some freshfruit. It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboatand Butt was used to a farmer's diet.     Trouble was, he was a special kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit would havebeen pretty easy to sneak into my pockets at meals. I even found a wayto handle the kelp and giant watercress Mr. Brown liked, but thingslike seaweed salt and Venusian mud-grapes just had too strong a smell.Twice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for launderingand I had to wash it myself. But I learned so many wonderful thingsabout Venus every time I visited that stowaway....     I learned three wild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that thenative Venusians hate so much; I learned how you tell the differencebetween a lousy government paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo and theslaptoe slinker who is the planter's friend. After a lot of begging,Butt Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster, explained itso carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did fromthe tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer. But nomatter what, he would never let me hold it.     Sorry, Ford, old tad, he would drawl, spinning around and around inthe control swivel-chair at the nose of the lifeboat. But way I lookat it, a man who lets somebody else handle his blaster is like thegiant whose heart was in an egg that an enemy found. When you've grownenough so's your pop feels you ought to have a weapon, why, then's thetime to learn it and you might's well learn fast. Before then, you'replain too young to be even near it.     I don't have a father to give me one when I come of age. I don't evenhave an older brother as head of my family like your brother Labrador.All I have is Sis. And      she     \u2014     She'll marry some fancy dryhorn who's never been farther South thanthe Polar Coast. And she'll stay head of the family, if I know herbreed of green shata.      Bossy, opinionated.     By the way, Fordie, hesaid, rising and stretching so the fish-leather bounced and rippled offhis biceps, that sister. She ever....     And he'd be off again, cross-examining me about Evelyn. I sat in theswivel chair he'd vacated and tried to answer his questions. But therewas a lot of stuff I didn't know. Evelyn was a healthy girl, forinstance; how healthy, exactly, I had no way of finding out. Yes, I'dtell him, my aunts on both sides of my family each had had more thanthe average number of children. No, we'd never done any farming tospeak of, back in Undersea, but\u2014yes, I'd guess Evelyn knew about asmuch as any girl there when it came to diving equipment and pressurepump regulation.     How would I know that stuff would lead to trouble for me?   <doc-sep> He cocked his head and considered a moment. Look, he said finally,I have more than enough munit to pay for round trip tickets, but Icouldn't get a return visa because of that brinosaur judge and allthe charges she hung on me. Had to stow away. Picked the      EleanorRoosevelt     because a couple of the boys in the crew are friends of mineand they were willing to help. But this lifeboat\u2014don't you know thatevery passenger ship carries four times as many lifeboats as it needs?Not to mention the food I didn't eat because it stuck in my throat?     Yes, she said bitterly. You had this boy steal fresh fruit for you.I suppose you didn't know that under space regulations that makes himequally guilty?     No, Sis, he didn't, I was beginning to argue. All he wanted\u2014     Sure I knew. Also know that if I'm picked up as a stowaway, I'll besent back to Earth to serve out those fancy little sentences.     Well, you're guilty of them, aren't you?     He waved his hands at her impatiently. I'm not talking law, female;I'm talking sense. Listen! I'm in trouble because I went to Earth tolook for a wife. You're standing here right now because you're on yourway to Venus for a husband. So let's.     Sis actually staggered back. Let's? Let's      what     ? Are\u2014are you daringto suggest that\u2014that\u2014     Now, Miss Sparling, no hoopla. I'm saying let's get married, and youknow it. You figured out from what the boy told you that I was chewingon you for a wife. You're healthy and strong, got good heredity, youknow how to operate sub-surface machinery, you've lived underwater, andyour disposition's no worse than most of the anura I've seen. Prolificstock, too.     I was so excited I just had to yell: Gee, Sis, say      yes     !  "

His family also consisted of many brothers, also named after Canadian provinces, Unfortunately, all of his brothers except Saskatchewan and him were murdered  by the MacGregor boys in an incident known as the Blue Chicago Rising. He is not one to usually act brutally, but he has not hesitated to pull the trigger on people who have wronged him. Butt has great knowledge of his blaster and is capable of explaining everything about it to Ferdinant. Additionally, he tells Ferdinand that he has killed twelve people, excluding the five government personnel, and that he considers his brother as someone who is much more willing to resort to violence. Although he is usually level-headed, Butt is also a very blunt person. He is not afraid to tell Ferdinand what he thinks of Earth, and his actions of breaking the law as a criminal on the run show that he is more than willing to take dangerous risks if he disagrees with something. Butt also tends to act rashly, suggesting to Evelyn that they get married during their first meeting despite never having interacted with her before and only having an impression of her based on what Ferdinand told him earlier.

        "Query": "How are the societal structures on Venus distinct from those on Earth in the story Venus Is a Man's World?",
        "Summary_1": "Women are generally given positions of power and have significant influence over political matters on Earth. Most of the hard labor is left to the men instead of the women. Ferdinand mentions that the crews on the spaceliner ships are always men, as women fulfill the more important tasks of running governments. It is also revealed that only women can become Earth Citizens because of the Male Desuffrage Act, which means that men cannot get an interplanetary passport. In many situations, women have the final say as well. When Butt was arrested on Earth, he could only use a female attorney to communicate his thoughts. Compared to the women, the men on Earth face much more restrictions and must follow what they say at all times. The number of men on Earth has greatly diminished, and the population primarily consists of women. \n\nOn the other hand, Venus is primarily male-inhabited, and there is a scarcity of women there. Butt says that he is unused to the saying \"it's a woman's world\" because women do not run Venus, unlike Earth. He also told his attorney that on Venus, a man could speak freely if he wanted to, and a woman's role is to support him. Men can also make a law whenever they wish with their own guns and that they should not wholly be subservient to the rule of women. ",
        "Summary_2": "Earth is a planet where women dominate. There are a surplus of women on Earth, way more than men, and men are not citizens on Earth as a result of the Male Desuffrage Act. Women rule the government and its decisions on Earth. Venus is quite the opposite, where men still remain prominent and in control while women are scarce. Venus is much more primitive than Earth, with the men being skilled in battle. Because of the complementary differences between Earth and Venus, many Earthwomen travel to Venus in search of a husband. ",
        "Summary_3": "After previous political structure had failed, Earth became ruled by women. Women are citizens and have all the rights, they are in every important sphere and they are the majority. They are the leaders and there is even an Act diminishing men and their rights. Men can only move as women's plus ones and are simply needed for reproduction. On Venus, on the opposite, there are more men and they seek for women. Women are searching for mild and steady men to support females in their careers. Men on Venus are in charge, they are building Venus with masculine jobs to start a civilization there, as the conditions on the planet are difficult and require real men. ",
        "Summary_4": "The society on Earth is run by women. The \"Male Suffrage Act\" was put in place after the third atomic war. Men were seen to not be fit to work in positions such as the government anymore. Only women are eligible to be citizens. There aren't as many men anymore on Earth as most of them have died due to various wars. All intellectual and important roles are filled by women. There are also a number of cities which lie under water on Earth, they are mining communities. A lot of women leave Earth in search of a husband, as there are so few left on Earth. \nMars seems to be the opposite to this. Men still hold the power and women, stand by their side, still silent. Venus is also a newer civilisation, and it seems as if it's citizens are freer to partake in violent, criminal acts which would be punished on Earth. ",

Of course, Madame President of Earth was delighted to oblige. Nodoubt Captain Hatwoody knows what reward would satisfy their needsbest.     The Madame Presidents switched to a private circuit, Trillium draggedDimdooly off somewhere and the Old Woman eyed O'Rielly and Callahan.Especially she eyed Callahan, like running chilled drills through hisold conniving brain. I award the pair of you five minutes leisurebefore returning to your stations.     Oh, well, O'Rielly muttered, once he and Callahan were safely beyondearshot, could have been rewarded worse, I suppose.     What you expect for being flimflammed by a foreign dame, the rings ofSaturn? Lucky we ain't programmed to be hung, shot and thrown to thecrows for breakfast. Callahan's old pick-and-shovel face wore a littlegrin like the cat that nobody could prove ate the canary.     You\u2014I mean, that Earth guy a hundred twenty-five years ago, O'Riellysaid in sudden thought. If Venus dames wanted to be loved so bad, whydid Trillium's Grandmamma let him go?     Venus guys wasn't so busy playing war all the time, Callahan mumbled,like to himself, they'd of found out the answer centuries ago. Yep,guess our boy was the only guy on Earth or Venus to find out and live.Dames bossing both planets now, though, his old secret won't be onemuch longer. Venus dames could of let it out centuries ago themselvesbut didn't, just to spite Earth probably. Later, was part of organizingto take over Venus, I guess.     O'Rielly still had memories of the way he had felt about Trilliumbefore her revolution. All right, Callahan, why did 'our boy' leaveGrandmamma?     Yes, ma'am, Callahan sighed like he hadn't heard a word O'Riellysaid, you could sweet-talk 'em, kiss 'em and hold 'em tighter'nBilly-be-damned. And that's all.     I'm not sure, O'Rielly said, what you mean by, 'that's all.'     Anybody ever seen anybody but a Venus guy come built with ear beards?Course not.     But I thought our boy was wearing the best fakes ever.     Ain't nothing can match the natural growed-on variety, no, ma'am.Venus guy kisses a Venus dame, his beards grabs her roundst the ears.     So what?     Tickles 'em, boy, tickles 'em!    <doc-sep> Obviously Trillium's poor little brain has been drugged, HisExcellency Dimdooly declared. Grandmamma Berta wouldn't know the firstthing about such things!     Impossible! Grandpapa President agreed. I've been married to herfor a hundred and twenty-four and a half years and she's the finestrattle-brain I ever knew!     She learned, Trillium stated emphatically, a hundred and twenty-fiveyears ago.     Hundred twenty-five, Grandpapa president growled like a boilingvolcano. The year some Earthman.... Never did catch the devil....Berta? Impossible!     Madame President's shapely finger now rested full on the button thatcould launch the fleets of war rockets that had been pre-aimed for athousand years. I'm afraid your Ambassador is unwelcome now, MadamePresident stated coolly. Your granddaughter's actions have every markof an invasion tactic by your government.     What do you mean, her actions? Grandpapa President's finger now laypoised on the button that had been waiting a thousand years to blowEarth out of the universe. My grandchild was kidnapped by men underyour official command! Weren't you, Trillium dear?     No. One of us stowing away was the only way we Venus women could bringour cause to the attention of Earth's President. If Earth will onlystop buying from Venus, you won't have any money to squander on yourwars any longer no matter what happens to we revolutionaries!     Revolutionaries? Such claptrap! And what's wrong with my wars? Peoplehave to have something to keep their minds off their troubles! Nobodyaround here gets hurt. Oh, maybe a few scratches here and there. Butnobody on Venus dies from the things any more.     But Venus men are so excited all the time about going to war theyhaven't time for us women. That's why we always radiated such a fatalattraction for Earthmen. We want to be loved! We want our own men homedoing useful work!     Well, they do come home and do useful work! Couple weeks every tenmonths. Proven to be a highly efficient arrangement.     More boys to run off to your old wars and more girls to stay home andbe lonely!     Now you just listen to me, Trillium! Grandpapa President was allVenus manhood laying down the law. That's the way things have been onVenus for ten thousand years and all the women in the universe can'tchange it!     I have been in constant contact with my Cabinet during theseconversations, Madame President said crisply. Earth is terminatingall trade agreements with Venus as of this instant.     What? Grandpapa's beards near pulled his ears off. It's not legal!You can't get away with this!     Take your finger off that trigger, boy! a heavenly voice similar toTrillium's advised from the Venus panel.     Whereupon Grandpapa glared to one side. Berta! What are you doinghere? I am deciding matters of the gravest interplanetary nature!     Were. Features more beautifully mature than Trillium's crowded ontothe panel too. From now on I'm doing the deciding.     Nonsense! You're only my wife!     And new President of Venus, elected by unanimous vote of all women.     Impossible! The men run Venus! Nobody's turning this planet intoanother Earth where a man can't even sneeze unless some woman says so!     Take him away, girls, Berta ordered coolly, whereupon her spouse wasyanked from view.     His bellows, however, could be heard yet. Unhand me, you foolcreatures! Guards! Guards!     Save your breath, Berta advised him. And while you're in the cooler,enjoy this latest batch of surrender communiques. We women are incontrol everywhere now.     Dimmy, Trillium was saying firmly to His Excellency, you have beataround the bush with me long enough. Now say it!   <doc-sep> Venus boys rared up and served notice that if Earth ever got any funnynotions, right away there wouldn't be enough Earth left to hide in anatom's eyebrow. Touchy as hornets on a hot griddle, them Venus guys.Crazier than bed bugs about war. Could smell a loose dollar a millionlight years away too. Finagled around until they finally cooked up adeal.     No Venus dames allowed within fifty miles of their port. Earth guysstay inside the high-voltage fence. Any dame caught trying to leaveVenus thrown to the tigers for supper. Same for any Earth guy caughtaround a Venus dame. In return, Earth could buy practically everythingat bargain basement prices.     Oh, I was shown the history films in pre-flight, O'Rielly said, stilldreamily. But not a peek of any Venus dame.     Pray heaven you'll never lay eyes on one nor have one get within tenfoot of you! Even though you'd know she'd be your damnation wouldn'tmake a whit difference\u2014you'd still act sappier than thirty-sevenangels flying on vino. Callahan suddenly stared at O'Rielly. Holyhollering saints!     Now, now, Burner Chief Callahan, sir, O'Rielly responded with an airylaugh. No Earth guy for a hundred twenty-five years been near one andlived to tell it, has he?     So the whispers run, Callahan murmured with a queer flame dancinginto his eyes. So the old whispers still run.     Never a name, though. Never how it was done. O'Rielly snorted.Probably just a goofy tale set loose by some old space bum.     Oh? Callahan bristled up like a bad name had been bandied about.Seen them ditty bags Venus bigwigs have, ain't you? Some big enough tostuff a cow in. Notice how nobody ever dares question a bigwig's bags,even through customs? Just run 'em through the big Geiger that tellswhether there's any fusionable junk inside. Well, our boy got himselfone of them bags, stuffed himself inside and joined a bigwig's pile of'em.     Didn't pull it whilst on the Venus port during a layover either, whena crew check would of turned him up missing. Pulled it on vacation.Started on the Earth end. Made himself a pair of beards to paste on hisears of course. Wove Jupiter wiggle worms in to keep the beards moving.Wasn't like the real thing, but good enough to flimflam Venus guys.     With suddenly enlivened interest O'Rielly looked at Callahan. Hey, howcome you know so much?     Hah? What? Callahan blinked like waking from a trance; even groanedto himself, something that sounded like, Blabbering like I'd hada nip myself\u2014or one of them dillies was radiating nearby. ThenCallahan glared fit to drill holes in O'Rielly's head. Look! I wasa full Burnerman before you was born. Been flying the spaces hundredtwenty-five years now. Had more chances to hear more\u2014just hear more,you hear! Only tried to clear your mind about Venus dames so you couldput your brain on your control mess. So now put it! If you ain't highon vino and ain't been made nuts by a Venus dame, what answer do wefeed the Old Woman?     Search me, Apprentice Burnerman O'Rielly responded cheerfully.     Of all the loony apprentices I ever had to answer the Old Woman for!Awp, lemme out where I can think of something to save me own neck atleast!     Was all O'Rielly could do to keep from rolling on the deck with glee.Old Callahan had been flimflammed for fair! The dear little stowawaywas saved! And O'Rielly would now think of grand ways to save herlovely neck and his own forever.     O'Rielly's shower door, however, opened abruptly. O'Rielly had notopened it. O'Rielly, however, suffered a cruel stab of dismay. Surelyhis dear stowaway had been listening through the door. Why didn't shehave brains enough to stay hid until Callahan was gone!     At sight of her, of course, Callahan's eyes near popped from his oldhead. Berta!     Oh, I'm Trillium, she assured Callahan sweetly. But Grandmamma'sname is Berta and people say I'm just like she was a hundred andtwenty-five years ago.  "

        "Summary_1": "The story is mainly set on the Eleanor Roosevelt spaceliner. The ship is a luxury liner, and there are purple lights in front of the doors that light up when a girl is inside on her hammock. Ferdinand describes the ship as being very large, consisting of smooth black walls and white doors that seem to go on endlessly. There are multiple numbered decks and steam jets. The engines and machinery are all properly oiled. Multiple portholes line the hulls, and there is the feeling of gravity underfoot. Many emergency-use spacesuits in glass cases also line the crossways. Some of the decks also have signs with glowing red letters that warn passengers not to enter further. The portholes are described to have no knobs, switches, or even a button to press to open them. Inside the portholes, there are also bunks for the lifeboats. Some of the other amenities on the ship include a dining salon, library, and numbered lifeboat sections for passengers to go to if there is an emergency. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story takes place aboard the Eleanor Roosevelt, a spaceship leaving from Earth to Venus. The spaceship is large, and Ferdinand explores it throughout the story. The ship contains many decks, including a hull with portholes, where the view of space and stars is visible. From the portholes, Ferdinand can see the Moon and another spaceship headed towards Mars. Ferdinand then finds Lifeboat 47, where he meets Butt, who had been staying there. The ship also contains a dining room, a lecture hall, and a salon.",
        "Summary_3": "The story begins on a huge spaceship packed with over three hundred females traveling to Venus. All of them have their cabins with hammocks along the corridor. Pictures of stars are everywhere in the corridor but no actual portholes. There is an outside level under the hull though and it has portholes, but the  area is prohibited to enter for the passengers. From there opens a great view at the stars and the Moon. There was also a lifeboat. The rest of the story takes place either in the cabin with Sis or in the lifeboat with Butt. Once, the setting moves to a class with a geography lecture. ",
        "Summary_4": "The main setting of the story takes place on the \"Eleanor Roosavelt''. It is a starship headed for the planet Venus. It holds three hundred women, all of whom seem to share cabins. Everyone has their own acceleration hammock. There are lights on the cabin doors, which glow purple when the occupants are sleeping. The corridor that holds all the doors to the cabins curves out of sight, with its black walls and white doors. The ship seems to be huge. There are pictures of stars on the walls. There is a crossway, which leads to various decks , the main engine, the main jets and the gravity helix and the hull. We also know that there is a dining salon and a library. Along the walls are spacesuits cased in glass, in case of emergency. There is a huge notice sign passed deck twelve telling passengers to not go any further. Past this sign is the hull. Every twelve feet is a porthole. Farther down the corridor is the entrance to lifeboat 47, with a voice activated lock. ",
        "Article": "You have done well, announced Torp when Thig had completed his reporton the resources and temperatures of various sections of Terra. We nowhave located three worlds fit for colonization and so we will return toOrtha at once.     I will recommend the conquest of this planet, 72-P-3 at once and thecomplete destruction of all biped life upon it. The mental aberrationsof the barbaric natives might lead to endless complications if theywere permitted to exist outside our ordered way of life. I imagine thatthree circuits of the planet about its primary should prove sufficientfor the purposes of complete liquidation.     But why, asked Thig slowly, could we not disarm all the natives andexile them on one of the less desirable continents, Antarctica forexample or Siberia? They are primitive humans even as our race was oncea race of primitives. It is not our duty to help to attain our owndegree of knowledge and comfort?     Only the good of the Horde matters! shouted Torp angrily. Shall arace of feeble-witted beasts, such as these Earthmen, stand in the wayof a superior race? We want their world, and so we will take it. TheLaw of the Horde states that all the universe is ours for the taking.     Let us get back to Ortha at once, then, gritted out Thig savagely.Never again do I wish to set foot upon the soil of this mad planet.There are forces at work upon Earth that we of Ortha have longforgotten.     Check the blood of Thig for disease, Kam, ordered Torp shortly. Hiswords are highly irrational. Some form of fever perhaps native to thisworld. While you examine him I will blast off for Ortha.     Thig followed Kam into the tiny laboratory and found a seat beside thesquat scientist's desk. His eyes roamed over the familiar instrumentsand gauges, each in its own precise position in the cases along thewalls. His gaze lingered longest on the stubby black ugliness ofa decomposition blaster in its rack close to the deck. A blast ofthe invisible radiations from that weapon's hot throat and flesh orvegetable fiber rotted into flaky ashes.     The ship trembled beneath their feet; it tore free from the feebleclutch of the sand about it, and they were rocketing skyward. Thig'sbroad fingers bit deep into the unyielding metal of his chair. Suddenlyhe knew that he must go back to Earth, back to Ellen and the childrenof the man he had helped destroy. He loved Ellen, and nothing muststand between them! The Hordes of Ortha must find some other world, anempty world\u2014this planet was not for them.     Turn back! he cried wildly. I must go back to Earth. There is awoman there, helpless and alone, who needs me! The Horde does not needthis planet.     Kam eyed him coldly and lifted a shining hypodermic syringe from itscase. He approached Thig warily, aware that disease often made a maniacof the finest members of the Horde.     No human being is more important than the Horde, he stated baldly.This woman of whom you speak is merely one unit of the millions wemust eliminate for the good of the Horde.     Then it was that Thig went berserk. His fists slashed into the thickjaw of the scientist and his fingers ripped at the hard cords overlyingthe Orthan's vital throat tubes. His fingers and thumb gouged deep intoKam's startled throat and choked off any cry for assistance before itcould be uttered.     Kam's hand swept down to the holster swung from his intricate harnessand dragged his blaster from it. Thig's other hand clamped over his andfor long moments they swayed there, locked together in silent deadlystruggle. The fate of a world hung in the balance as Kam's other handfought against that lone arm of Thig.   <doc-sep> The blazing disc of Sol, the minor globes of the planets, the unwinkingpinpoints of the stars, all stared with cosmic disinterest at the tinyfigure crawling along the hull. His spacesuit trapped and amplifiedbreathing and heartbeats into a roaring chaos that was an invitationto blind panic, and all the while there was consciousness of theinsidiously deadly Sigma radiations.     Barry found the debris of the meteorite, an ugly shining splotchagainst the dull superceramic tube, readied his power chisel, startedcutting. Soon it became a tedious, torturingly strenuous manual taskrequiring little conscious thought, and Barry's mind touched briefly onthe events that had brought him here.     First Luna, and that had been murderous. Man had encountered Sigmafor the first time, and many had died before the Kendall-shield wasperfected. And the chemical-fueled rockets of those days had beeninherently poor.     Hoskins semi-atomics had made possible the next step\u2014to Mars. But menhad found Mars barren, swept clear of all life in the cataclysm thathad shattered the trans-Martian planet to form the Asteroid Belt.     Venus, its true surface forever hidden by enshrouding mists, had beenwell within one-way range. But Hoskins fuel requirements for a roundtrip added up to something beyond critical mass. Impossible.     But the Five Ship Plan had evolved, a joint enterprise of governmentand various private groups. Five vessels were to go out, each fueledto within a whiskered neutron of spontaneous detonation, manned byspecialists who, it was hoped, could maintain themselves under alienconditions.     On Venus the leftover fuel from all five would be transferred towhichever ship had survived the outbound voyage in best condition.That one would return to Earth. Permanent base or homeward voyage withcolonists crowded aboard like defeated sardines? Only time would tell.     Barry Barr had volunteered, and because the enlightened guesses of theexperts called for men and women familiar with tropical conditions,he had survived the rigorous weeding-out process. His duties in VenusColony would be to refabricate the discarded ships into whatever formwas most needed\u2014most particularly a launching ramp\u2014and to studynative Venusian materials.     Dorothy Voorhees had signed on as toxicologist and dietician. When thelimited supply of Earth food ran out the Colony would be forced torely upon Venusian plants and animals. She would guard against subtledelayed-action poisons, meanwhile devising ways of preparing Venusianmaterials to suit Earth tastes and digestions.     Barry had met her at Training Base and known at once that his years ofloneliness had come to an end.     She seemed utterly independent, self-contained, completely intellectualdespite her beauty, but Barry had not been deceived. From the momentof first meeting he had sensed within her deep springs of suppressedemotion, and he had understood. He too had come up the hard way, alone,and been forced to develop a shell of hardness and cold, single-mindeddevotion to his work. Gradually, often unwillingly under hisinsistence, her aloofness had begun to melt.     But Robson Hind too had been attracted. He was the only son of thebusiness manager of the great Hoskins Corporation which carrieda considerable share in the Five Ship Plan. Dorothy's failure tovirtually fall into his arms had only piqued his desires.     The man's smooth charm had fascinated the girl and his money had openedto her an entirely new world of lavish nightclubs and extravagantlyexpensive entertainments, but her inborn shrewdness had sensed somefactor in his personality that had made her hesitate.     Barry had felt a distrust of Hind apart from the normal dislike ofrivalry. He had looked forward to being with Dorothy aboard Three, andhad made no secret of his satisfaction when Hind's efforts to havehimself transferred to Three also or the girl to Four had failed.     But then a scaffold had slipped while Three was being readied, and witha fractured ankle he had been forced to miss the ship.     He unclipped the magnetic detector from his belt and ran it inch byinch over the nozzle. He found one spot of metal, pinhead-sized, butenough to cause trouble, and once more swung his power chisel intostuttering action.     Then it was done.     As quickly as possible he inched back to the airlock. Turnover had tostart according to calculations.   <doc-sep>    IT WAS A DULL, ROUTINE LITTLE     WORLD. IT DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A     CITY. EVERYTHING IT HAD WAS     IN THE GARDEN     BY R. A. LAFFERTY     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Worlds of If Science Fiction, March 1961.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      The protozoic recorder chirped like a bird. Not only would there belife traces on that little moon, but it would be a lively place. Sothey skipped several steps in the procedure.     The chordata discerner read      Positive     over most of the surface. Therewas spinal fluid on that orb, rivers of it. So again they omittedseveral tests and went to the cognition scanner. Would it show Thoughton the body?     Naturally they did not get results at once, nor did they expect to; itrequired a fine adjustment. But they were disappointed that they foundnothing for several hours as they hovered high over the rotation. Thenit came\u2014clearly and definitely, but from quite a small location only.     Limited, said Steiner, as though within a pale. As though there werebut one city, if that is its form. Shall we follow the rest of thesurface to find another, or concentrate on this? It'll be twelve hoursbefore it's back in our ken if we let it go now.     Let's lock on this one and finish the scan. Then we can do the rest ofthe world to make sure we've missed nothing, said Stark.     There was one more test to run, one very tricky and difficult ofanalysis, that with the Extraordinary Perception Locator. This wasdesigned simply to locate a source of superior thought. But this mightbe so varied or so unfamiliar that often both the machine and thedesigner of it were puzzled as to how to read the results.     The E. P. Locator had been designed by Glaser. But when the Locatorhad refused to read      Positive     when turned on the inventor himself,bad blood developed between machine and man. Glaser knew that he hadextraordinary perception. He was a much honored man in his field. Hetold the machine so heatedly.     The machine replied, with such warmth that its relays chattered, thatGlaser did      not     have extraordinary perception; he had only ordinaryperception to an extraordinary degree. There is a      difference     , themachine insisted.     It was for this reason that Glaser used that model no more, but builtothers more amenable. And it was for this reason also that the ownersof Little Probe had acquired the original machine so cheaply.     And there was no denying that the Extraordinary Perception Locator (orEppel) was a contrary machine. On Earth it had read      Positive     on anumber of crack-pots, including Waxey Sax, a jazz tootler who could noteven read music. But it had also read      Positive     on ninety per cent ofthe acknowledged superior minds of the Earth. In space it had been asound guide to the unusual intelligences encountered. Yet on Suzuki-Miit had read      Positive     on a two-inch-long worm, only one of them out ofbillions. For the countless identical worms no trace of anything at allwas shown by the test.     So it was with mixed expectations that Steiner locked onto the areaand got a flick. He then narrowed to a smaller area (apparently oneindividual, though this could not be certain) and got very definiteaction. Eppel was busy. The machine had a touch of the ham in it, andassumed an air of importance when it ran these tests.     Finally it signaled the result, the most exasperating result it everproduces: the single orange light. It was the equivalent of the shrugof the shoulders in a man. They called it the You tell      me     light.     So among the intelligences there was at least one that might beextraordinary, though possibly in a crackpot way. It is good to beforewarned.  "

There a supervisor gets suspicious of her transfer but she convinces him in her honesty. After that she meets Perat, Viscount of the Tharn Suns, her main aim, and is forced to shoot her own father not to be uncovered. From that moment she becomes a private dancer for Perat by night, and a spy into the officers\u2019 minds by day. One day Perat showed Evelyn a reel of his father, a boy, and a woman very much alike her. This reel was sent by his father with a greeting from Perat\u2019s wife and son, though he was not married.

        "Summary_3": "Evelyn Kane awakes injured and in pain to the sound of a voice, commanding her to die. She is the daughter of Gordon Kane, the commander of The Defender, a Terran battle globe. The Defender has been in a nine year war with The Invader, its Scythian counterpart, and Evelyn had previously promised her father that she would die on the planet instead of escaping, doing so by pressing a button that would detonate the globe and both empires. As she awakes, she realizes that the time has come to press the button. However, the cell in which she stays in had been damaged by an explosion, the button being beyond repair. Determined to obtain a replacement or repair the button, but unable to do so herself, she decides to set out, using her telepathic abilities to go undercover as a Scythian guard by killing one and wearing his uniform. She then visits the Inquisitor, who questions why she is wearing a Scythian uniform and plans to take her prisoner. Evelyn uses her telepathy on the Inquisitor to make him fill out a visa for her to visit the Occupational Commandant, Perat. Once there, she visits an office, where she is questioned and sent to Perat, who wishes to see her. Evelyn realizes that Perat is even more skilled than her in the realm of telepathy, so she is not able to use her abilities on him and instead must conceal that she possesses them at all. Evelyn's first order from Perat is to execute a final prisoner in the courtyard, who ends up being her father. Reluctantly, she does so to follow orders. For the next month or so, Evelyn dances for Perat every night, using the daytime to gather any information possible to help her construct a new device. One night, Perat shows Evelyn an image of an old man, a boy, and a woman. Perat identifies the man as his father, but the woman looks identical to Evelyn. Perat's father had sent this to him, naming Evelyn as his widow; both Perat and Evelyn have no explanation. Perat then informs Evelyn that he must attend a courtmartial, where he must address a man who let a woman prisoner escape. Evelyn realizes that this man is the Inquisitor, and she must join Perat at the hearing while going unrecognized.",

There was a huge explosion, and if Evelyn gets the chance to survive, she was told to carry the secret of the Terrans. When she comes out from her cubicle, with a few broken ribs, she heard the sound of a low-born Scythe four hundred yards behind her. There, she uses her telepathic skills and avoided being caught or murdered. Instead, the Scythe drops unconscious on the ground. Then at the inquisitor, she was questioned. After having the inquisitor ask the guards to leave, she uses her telepathic skills on him. She is then set free with a visa for woman clerk, and the guards and the inquisitor does not remember a thing about her. Then finally, she gets to meet the Viscount. But then she is shocked to see her father being captured and announced as the last Terran alive in The Defender. She is further horrified by the fact that she has to kill him. Because she knows that there is no other possible way, she indeed shot her father. \n\nLater, we learn that Perat has an image of a woman that has the identical scars as the one on Evelyn\u2019s head, this finding might affect Evelyn\u2019s destruction plan. Later, Perat asks Evelyn to be the clerk for tonight\u2019s coutmartial where some inquisitor did not show proper disposition of a female prisoner. Evelyn is worried, this clearly sounds like her and the inquisitor that she mind controlled. ",

I've just learned you're placing more students abroad, Mr. Gulver. Howmany this time?     Two thousand.     And where will they be going?     Croanie. It's all in the application form I've handed in. Your job isto provide transportation.     Will there be any other students embarking this season?     Why ... perhaps. That's Boge's business. Gulver looked at Retief withpursed lips.

And see if you can get a summary of whatMEDDLE has been shipping lately.     Miss Furkle compressed her lips. If Mr. Magnan were here, I'm surehe wouldn't dream of interfering in the work of other departments.I ... overheard your conversation with the gentleman from the CroanieLegation\u2014     The lists, Miss Furkle.     I'm not accustomed, Miss Furkle said, to intruding in mattersoutside our interest cluster.     That's worse than listening in on phone conversations, eh? But nevermind. I need the information, Miss Furkle.     Loyalty to my Chief\u2014     Loyalty to your pay-check should send you scuttling for the materialI've asked for, Retief said. I'm taking full responsibility. Nowscat.     The buzzer sounded. Retief flipped a key. MUDDLE, Retief speaking....     Arapoulous's brown face appeared on the desk screen.     How-do, Retief. Okay if I come up?     Sure, Hank. I want to talk to you.     In the office, Arapoulous took a chair. Sorry if I'm rushing you,Retief, he said. But have you got anything for me?     Retief waved at the wine bottles. What do you know about Croanie?     Croanie? Not much of a place. Mostly ocean. All right if you likefish, I guess. We import our seafood from there. Nice prawns in monsoontime. Over a foot long.     You on good terms with them?     Sure, I guess so. Course, they're pretty thick with Boge.     So?     Didn't I tell you? Boge was the bunch that tried to take us over herea dozen years back. They'd've made it too, if they hadn't had a lot ofbad luck. Their armor went in the drink, and without armor they're easygame.     Miss Furkle buzzed. I have your lists, she said shortly.     Bring them in, please.   <doc-sep> *** START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK STALEMATE IN SPACE ***    Stalemate In Space     By CHARLES L.

        "Query": "How is Evelyn's relationship with her father portrayed in Stalemate In Space?",
        "Summary_1": "Evelyn was very close with her father as a child and she has a lot of warm memories of their moments together. Her father was the commander of the Defender, a powerful man, Lord Kane. He wanted to save his daughter by putting her on the last ship leaving the Defender, but she decided to stay and die with her people. This decision impressed her father, and after a brief evaluation he decided to make use of her and give her the most important task - explode both ships. Therefore, their relationship is both caring but professional and with the feeling of duty. While resolving to press the button, Evelyn remembered her father and that helped her decision. After her escape and getting to the Viscount she had to end her relationship with her father by shooting him. Trembling, full of emotions and desire to save him, Evelyn was still able to shoot as she didn't see another positive solution for them both. She felt sad and sorry, but she felt she did the right think and would soon join her father in death.",
        "Summary_2": "Along with her father, she watched The Defender grow into a planet-sized battle globe over the course of 20 years. The Defender was commanded by her father, Gordon. Evelyn cares for her father. She is honest and mimics his passion for the war. When she was a little girl her father would play with her and read her bedtime stories, memories that she treasures. While Evelyn and her father had a good relationship and she held no ill will towards him, she eventually kills him with Perat\u2019s gun at his orders. She does so through the justification that she cannot complete her mission if she tries to save him. ",
        "Summary_3": "Evelyn and her father have a strong relationship, primarily bonded by their passion and willingness to die for their planet. Evelyn grew up witnessing Kane's success in expanding the Defender, and she took on a similar duty for the planet,  evident when she promised to die there, destroying the planet and the two at war before doing so. Kane admires his daughter for doing this. Despite Evelyn's good relationship with her father, she ultimately ends up killing him for the sake of her duty, as he becomes a prisoner of the Scythian and Evelyn is ordered to execute him. ",
        "Summary_4": "Evelyn and her father both are fighting for the Terrans. Her father wanted her to board the last ship leaving The Defender, however, Evelyn wants to stay behind to fight. While her father does not want her to stay, he approves it and reminds her that if she is to die, die usefully. Then Evelyn is tasked with pressing the final button of the battle by her father. This will give her a chance to survive, not only because she is Gordon\u2019s father, but also because she will be tasked with the secret of the Terrans. Later when Evelyn finally gets to meet the Viscount on the balcony, he orders her to kill the last Terran living within The Defender, her father. Evelyn did not want to do this, but given the circumstances, she has to, and she says that soon she will join him. ",

The explosion that had crushed her cubiclehad been terrific.     With a gurgle of horror she snapped on her wrist luminar and examinedthe interior of the box.     It was a shattered ruin.   <doc-sep> Her heart was beating faster as she walked down the hall. She felt avery strong probe flooding over her brain casually, palping with mildinterest the artificial memories she supplied: Escapades with officersin the combat areas. Reprimands. Demotion and transfer. Her deceptionof Gorph. Her anticipation of meeting a real Viscount and hoping hewould let her dance for him.     The questing probe withdrew as idly as it had come, and she breatheda sigh of relief. She could not hope to deceive a suspicious telepathfor long. Perat was merely amused at her lie to his under-supervisor.He had accepted her at her own face value, as supplied by her falsememories.     She opened the door to the balcony and saw a man leaning moodily on thebalustrade. He gave no immediate notice of her presence.     The five hundred and sixth heir of Tharn was of uncertain age, as weremost of the men of both globes. Only the left side of his face could beseen. It was gaunt and leathery, and a deep thin scar lifted the cornerof his mouth into a satanic smile. A faint paunch was gathering at hisabdomen, as befitted a warrior turned to boring paper work. His closelycut black hair and the two sparkling red-gemmed rings\u2014apparentlyidentical\u2014on his right hand seemed to denote a certain fastidiousnessand unconscious superiority. To Evelyn the jeweled fingers bespoke anunnatural contrast to the past history of the man and were symptomaticof a personality that could find stimulation only in strange and cruelpleasures.     In alarm she suddenly realized that she had inadvertently let herappraisal penetrate her uncovered conscious mind, and that this probewas there awaiting it.     You are right, he said coldly, still staring into the court below.Now that the long battle is over, there is little left to divert me.     He pushed the Faeg across the coping toward her. Take this.     He had not as yet looked at her.     She crossed the balcony, simultaneously grasping the pistol he offeredher and looking down into the courtyard. There seemed to be nearlytwenty Terrans lying about, in pools of their own blood.     Only one man, a Terran officer of very high rank\u2014was left standing.His arms were folded somberly across his chest, and he studied thekiller above him almost casually. But when the woman came out, theireyes met, and he started imperceptibly.     Evelyn Kane felt a horrid chill creeping over her. The man's hair waswhite, now, and his proud face lined with deep furrows, but there couldbe no mistake. It was Gordon, Lord Kane.     Her father.     The sweat continued to grow on her forehead, and she felt for a momentthat she needed only to wish hard enough, and this would be a dream.A dream of a big, kind, dark-haired man with laugh-wrinkles about hiseyes, who sat her on his knee when she was a little girl and readbedtime stories to her from a great book with many pictures.     An icy, amused voice came through: Our orders are to kill allprisoners. It is entertaining to shoot down helpless men, isn't it? Itwarms me to know that I am cruel and wanton, and worthy of my trust.     Even in the midst of her horror, a cold, analytical part of her wasexplaining why the Commandant had called her to the balcony. Becauseall captured Terrans had to be killed, he hated his superiors, his ownmen, and especially the prisoners. A task so revolting he could notrelegate to his own officers. He must do it himself, but he wanted hisunderlings to know he loathed them for it. She was merely a symbol ofthat contempt. His next words did not surprise her.     It is even more stimulating to require a shuddering female to killthem. You are shuddering you know?     She nodded dumbly. Her palm was so wet that a drop of sweat droppedfrom it to the floor. She was thinking hard. She could kill theCommandant and save her father for a little while. But then theproblem of detonating the pile remained, and it would not be solvedmore quickly by killing the man who controlled the pile area. On thecontrary if she could get him interested in her\u2014     So far as our records indicate, murmured Perat, the man down thereis the last living Terran within      The Defender     . It occurred to me thatour newest clerk would like to start off her duties with a bang. TheFaeg is adjusted to a needle-beam. If you put a bolt between the man'seyes, you may dance for me tonight, and perhaps there will be othernights\u2014     The woman seemed lost in thought for a long time. Slowly, she liftedthe ugly little weapon. The doomed Terran looked up at her peacefully,without expression. She lowered the Faeg, her arm trembling.     Gordon, Lord Kane, frowned faintly, then closed his eyes. She raisedthe gun again, drew cross hairs with a nerveless wrist, and squeezedthe trigger. There was a loud, hollow cough, but no recoil. The Terranofficer, his eyes still closed and arms folded, sank to the ground,face up. Blood was running from a tiny hole in his forehead.     The man leaning on the balustrade turned and looked at Evelyn, at firstwith amused contempt, then with narrowing, questioning eyes.     Come here, he ordered.     The Faeg dropped from her hand. With a titanic effort she activated herlegs and walked toward him.     He was studying her face very carefully.     She felt that she was going to be sick. Her knees were so weak that shehad to lean on the coping.     With a forefinger he lifted up the mass of golden curls that hungover her right forehead and examined the scar hidden there, where thementors had cut into her frontal lobe. The tiny doll they had createdfor her writhed uneasily in her waist-purse, but Perat seemed to bethinking of something else, and missed the significance of the scarcompletely.     He dropped his hand. I'm sorry, he said with a quiet weariness. Ishouldn't have asked you to kill the Terran. It was a sorry joke.Then: Have you ever seen me before?     No, she whispered hoarsely. His mind was in hers, verifying the fact.     Have you ever met my father, Phaen, the old Count of Tharn?     No.     Do you have a son?     No.     His mind was out of hers again, and he had turned moodily back,surveying the courtyard and the dead. Gorph will be wondering whathappened to you. Come to my quarters at the eighth metron tonight.     Apparently he suspected nothing.       Father. Father. I had to do it. But we'll all join you, soon. Soon.        III     Perat lay on his couch, sipping cold purple      terif     and following thethinly-clad dancer with narrowed eyes. Music, soft and subtle, floatedfrom his communications box, illegally tuned to an officer's clubsomewhere. Evelyn made the rhythm part of her as she swayed slowly ontiptoe.     For the last thirty nights\u2014the hours allotted to rest and sleep\u2014ithad been thus. By day she probed furtively into the minds of theoffice staff, memorizing area designations, channels for officialmessages, and the names and authorizations of occupational field crews.By night she danced for Perat, who never took his eyes from her, norhis probe from her mind. While she danced it was not too difficult toelude the probe. There was an odd autohypnosis in dancing that blottedout memory and knowledge.     Enough for now, he ordered. Careful of your rib.     When he had first seen the bandages on her bare chest, that firstnight, she had been ready with a memory of dancing on a freshly waxedfloor, and of falling.     Perat seemed to be debating with himself as she sat down on her owncouch to rest. He got up, unlocked his desk, and drew out a tiny reelof metal wire, which Evelyn recognized as being feed for an amateurstereop projector. He placed the reel in a projector that had beeninstalled in the wall, flicked off the table luminar, and both of themwaited in the dark, breathing rather loudly.     Suddenly the center of the room was bright with a ball of light sometwo feet in diameter, and inside the luminous sphere were an old man, awoman, and a little boy of about four years. They were walking througha luxurious garden, and then they stopped, looked up, and waved gaily.     Evelyn studied the trio with growing wonder. The old man and the boywere complete strangers.      But the woman\u2014!       That is Phaen, my father, said Perat quietly. He stayed at homebecause he hated war. And that is a path in our country estate onTharn-R-VII. The little boy I fail to recognize, beyond a generalresemblance to the Tharn line.     But\u2014      can you deny that you are the woman     ?     The stereop snapped off, and she sat wordless in the dark.     There seemed to be some similarity\u2014 she admitted. Her throat wassuddenly dry. Yet, why should she be alarmed? She really didn't knowthe woman.     The table luminar was on now, and Perat was prowling hungrily about theroom, his scar twisting his otherwise handsome face into a snarlingscowl.     Similarity! Bah! That loop of hair over her right forehead hid a scaridentical to yours. I have had the individual frames analyzed!     Evelyn's hands knotted unconsciously. She forced her body to relax, buther mind was racing. This introduced another variable to be controlledin her plan for destruction. She      must     make it a known quantity.     Did your father send it to you? she asked.     The day before you arrived here. It had been en route for months, ofcourse.     What did he say about it?     He said, 'Your widow and son send greetings. Be of good cheer, andaccept our love.' What nonsense! He knows very well I'm not married andthat\u2014well, if I have ever fathered any children, I don't know aboutthem.     Is that all he said?     That's all, except that he included this ring. He pulled one of theduplicate jewels from his right middle finger and tossed it to her.It's identical to the one he had made for me when I entered on mymajority. For a long time it was thought that it was the only stone ofits kind on all the planets of the Tharn suns, a mineralogical freak,but I guess he found another. But why should I want two of them?     Evelyn crossed the room and returned the ring.     Existence is so full of mysteries, isn't it? murmured Perat.Sometimes it seems unfortunate that we must pass through a sentientphase on our way to death. This foolish, foolish war. Maybe the oldcount was right.     You could be courtmartialed for that.     Speaking of courtmartials, I've got to attend one tonight\u2014an appealfrom a death sentence. He arose, smoothed his hair and clothes, andpoured another glass of      terif     . Some fool inquisitor can't showproper disposition of a woman prisoner.     Evelyn's heart skipped a beat. Indeed?     The wretch insists that he could remember if we would just let himalone. I suppose he took a bribe. You'll find one now and then whotries for a little extra profit.     She must absolutely not be seen by the condemned inquisitor. Thestimulus would almost certainly make him remember.     I'll wait for you, she said indifferently, thrusting her arms out ina languorous yawn.     Very well. Perat stepped to the door, then turned and looked back ather. On the other hand, I may need a clerk. It's way after hours, andthe others have gone.     Beneath a gesture of wry protest, she swallowed rapidly.     Perhaps you'd better come, insisted Perat.     She stood up, unloosed her waist-purse, checked its contents swiftly,and then followed him out.     This might be a very close thing. From the purse she took a bottle ofperfume and rubbed her ear lobes casually.     Odd smell, commented Perat, wrinkling his nose.     Odd scent, corrected Evelyn cryptically. She was thinking aboutthe earnest faces of the mentors as they instructed her carefully inthe use of the perfume. The adrenalin glands, they had explained,provided a useful and powerful stimulant to a man in danger. Adrenalinslowed the heart and digestion, increased the systole and bloodpressure, and increased perspiration to cool the skin. But therecould be too much of a good thing. An overdose of adrenalin, they hadpointed out, caused almost immediate edema. The lungs filled rapidlywith the serum and the victim ... drowned. The perfume she possessedover-stimulated, in some unknown way, the adrenals of frightenedpersons. It had no effect on inactive adrenals.     The question remained\u2014who would be the more frightened, she or thecondemned inquisitor?     She was perspiring freely, and the blonde hair on her arms and neck wasstanding stiffly when Perat opened the door for her and they enteredthe Zone Provost's chambers.   <doc-sep> Once the fact was clear, she composed herself and lay there, breathinghard and thinking. She had no means to construct another key. At best,finding the rare tools and parts would take months, and during theinterval the invaders would be cutting loose from the dead hulk thatclutched their conquering battle globe in a metallic rigor mortis.     She gave herself six weeks to accomplish this stalemate in space.     Within that time she must know whether the prime movers were stillintact, and whether she could safely enter the pile room herself,set the movers in motion, and draw the moderator columns. If it wereunsafe, she must secure the unwitting assistance of her Scythianenemies.     Still prone, she found the first-aid kit and taped her chest expertly.The cold was beginning to make itself felt, so she flicked on thechaudiere she wore as an under-garment to her Scythian woman's uniform.Then she crawled on her elbows and stomach to the tiny door, spun thesealing gear, and was soon outside. Ignoring the pain and pulling onthe side of the imitation rock that contained her cell, she got slowlyto her feet. The air was thin indeed, and frigid. She turned the valveof her portable oxygen bottle almost subconsciously, while exploringthe surrounding blackened forest as far as she could see. Mentally shewas alert for roving alien minds. She had left her weapons inside thecubicle, except for the three things in the little leather bag danglingfrom her waist, for she knew that her greatest weapon in the struggleto come would be her apparent harmlessness.     Four hundred yards behind her she detected the mind of a low-bornScythe, of the Tharn sun group. Very quickly she established it as thatof a tired, brutish corporal, taking a mop-up squad through the blackstumps and forlorn branches of the small forest that for years hadsupplied oxygen to the defenders of this sector.     The corporal could not see her green Scythian uniform clearly, andevidently took her for a Terran woman. In his mind was the question:Should he shoot immediately, or should he capture her? It had been twomonths since he had seen a woman. But then, his orders were to shoot.Yes, he would shoot.     Evelyn turned in profile to the beam-gun and stretched luxuriously,hoping that her grimace of pain could not be detected. Withsatisfaction, she sensed a sudden change of determination in the mindof the Tharn. The gun was lowered, and the man was circling to creep upbehind her. He did not bother to notify his men. He wanted her first.He had seen her uniform, but that deterred him not a whit. Afterwards,he would call up the squad. Finally, they would kill her and move on.Women auxiliaries had no business here, anyway.     Hips dipping, Evelyn sauntered into the shattered copse. The man movedfaster, though still trying to approach quietly. Most of the radions inthe mile-high ceiling had been destroyed, and the light was poor. Hewas not surprised when he lost track of his quarry. He tip-toed rapidlyonward, picking his way through the charred and fallen branches,thinking that she must turn up again soon. He had not gone twenty yardsin this manner when a howl of unbearable fury sounded in his mind, andthe dull light in his brain went out.        She fought for her life under that mile-high ceiling.        Breathing deeply from her mental effort, the woman stepped frombehind a great black tree trunk and hurried to the unconscious man.For I.Q.'s of 100 and less, telepathic cortical paralysis was quiteeffective. With cool efficiency and no trace of distaste she strippedthe odorous uniform from the man, then took his weapon, turned the beampower down very low, and needled a neat slash across his throat. Whilehe bled to death, she slipped deftly into the baggy suit, clasped thebeam gun by the handle, and started up the sooty slope. For a time, atleast, it would be safer to pass as a Tharn soldier than as any kind ofa woman.      II     The inquisitor leaned forward, frowning at the girl before him.     Name?     Evelyn Kane.     The eyes of the inquisitor widened. So you admit to a Terran name.Well, Terran, you are charged with having stolen passage on a supplylorry, and you also seem to be wearing the uniform of an infantrycorporal as well as that of a Scythian woman auxiliary. Incidentally,where is the corporal? Did you kill him?     He was prepared for a last-ditch denial. He would cut it short, havethe guards remove her, and execution would follow immediately. In away, it was unfortunate. The woman was obviously of a high Terranclass. No\u2014he couldn't consider that. His slender means couldn't affordanother woman in his quarters, and besides, he wouldn't feel safe withthis cool murderess.     Do you not understand the master tongue? Why did you kill thecorporal? He leaned impatiently over his desk.     The woman stared frankly back at him with her clear blue eyes. Theguards on either side of her dug their nails into her arms, as wastheir custom with recalcitrant prisoners, but she took no notice.     She had analyzed the minds of the three men. She could handle theinquisitor alone or the two guards alone, but not all three.     If you aren't afraid of me, perhaps you'd be so kind as to send theguards out for a few minutes, she said, placing a hand on her hip. Ihave interesting information.     So that was it. Buy her freedom by betraying fugitive Terrans. Well, hecould take the information and then kill her. He nodded curtly to theguards, and they walked out of the hut, exchanging sly winks with oneanother.     Evelyn Kane crossed her arms across her chest and felt her broken ribgingerly. The inquisitor stared up at her in sadistic admiration. Hewould certainly be on hand for the execution. His anticipation was cutshort with a horrible realization. Under the paralyzing force of a mindgreater than his own, he reached beneath the desk and switched off therecorder.     Who is the Occupational Commandant for this Sector, she askedtersely. This must be done swiftly before the guards returned.     Perat, Viscount of Tharn, replied the man mechanically.     What is the extent of his jurisdiction?     From the center of the Terran globe, outward four hundred milesradius.     Good. Prepare for me the usual visa that a woman clerk needs forpassage to the offices of the Occupational Commandant.     The inquisitor filled in blanks in a stiff sheet of paper and stamped aseal at its bottom.     You will add in the portion reserved for 'comments', the following:'Capable clerk. Others will follow as they are found available.'     The man's pen scratched away obediently.     Evelyn Kane smiled gently at the impotent, inwardly raging inquisitor.She took the paper, folded it, and placed it in a pocket in her blouse.Call the guards, she ordered.     He pressed the button on his desk, and the guards re-entered.     This person is no longer a prisoner, said the inquisitor woodenly.She is to take the next transport to the Occupational Commandant ofZone One.     When the transport had left, neither inquisitor nor guards had anymemory of the woman. However, in the due course of events, therecording was gathered up with many others like it, boxed carefully,and sent to the Office of the Occupational Commandant, Zone One, forauditing.  "

        "Query": "How does Evelyn manage to survive and maintain her freedom in Stalemate In Space?",
        "Summary_1": "First, she decided to appear harmless in the struggle and left her weapon in the cubicle. She took only three things in a small bag with her when exiting her spot. Then she detected a corporal and when facing him, stretched luxuriously to change his mind to shoot her or notify his man. That was a manipulation of a woman using her charm not to get killed. When he didn't expect it, she mentally attacked the corporal to death and put on his clothes. This was her Scythian trick. When Evelyn met the inquisitor and the guards, she analyzed their minds again and with a little use of her feminine charm she pretended to be willing to give some interesting information  to the inquisitor one on one. That way she got rid of the guards, also by challenging the inquisitor asking to stay one on one if he is not afraid. Then she forced his mind to answer her questions and fill the blanks for her passage to the Occupational Commandant as a clerk and set her free. Then his memory and the guards' about her were deleted by her force of mind. When she reached the supervisor of her transfer, she made up a legend about its reasons as another trick. She complained about the men in the fighting zones and appealed to the supervisor's ego by claiming she had been told he was a better boss. When it came to Perat she followed his orders and even killed her father. She was humble and seductive and gained his trust and attention, which was her feminine trick again. In the very end she used a trick of a dangerous perfume given by her mentors. She used it not to be set up by the inquisitor. ",
        "Summary_2": "Evelyn uses many tricks to ensure her safety in precarious situations. She sues her sexual appeal often. In one situation she sues her sexual appeal to distract a man from instantly killing her, giving her the opportunity to stealthy sneak upon him and kill him. \n\nIn addition to sexual appeal, she uses her telepathic capabilities to force people to carry out her wishes. She receives a visa for travel using her telepathic skills. Evelyn is careful with her telepathic capabilities when she reaches the Occupational Commandment as she correctly believes that there will be others that have the ability. \n\nAt the end of the story, Evelyn arms herself with perfume to prevent a prisoner from publicly identifying her at his death execution appeal. The perfume is capable of drowning a person if they have active adrenals. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Evelyn uses a combination of her smarts and her telepathic ability to stay alive and undercover. When she initially steps outside, she lures a Scythian man to her, and uses telepathic paralysis to kill him and take his uniform. She also uses telepathy and mind control on the Inquisitor, who is able to give her information and allow her to travel to the Occupational Commandant. Once there, however, her telepathy skills are less useful because the people she is surrounded by have higher capabilities than her and she must be unassuming. So, to maintain her cover, Evelyn plays along to the commands of the Scythian.",
        "Summary_4": "First, when Evelyn first leaves the cubicle, she detects a low-born Scythe four hundred yards behind her. She uses her telepathic skills and found that the Scythian corporal is taking a mop-up squad through the forest. Knowing that he wondered if he should kill or not, she made him follow her. And then she performs telepathic cortical paralysis on the man which made him drop unconsciously.\n\nLater, when the inquisitor, along with his two guards, were questioning her, she told the inquisitor to ask the guards to leave. Then she paralyzed the mind of the inquisitor to finds out the Occupational Commandant of this Sector. Before she makes them let her go, she controls the inquisitor to give him a visa for a woman clerk. Later, at the personnel office she pretends to be blushed and lies about her reason to transfer here. And when she goes to the balcony, she has to pretend to not know the man she has to kill, her father. ",

Die now\u2014die now\u2014die now     \u2014     Evelyn Kane awoke, breathing slowly and painfully. The top of thecubicle was bulging inward on her chest, and it seemed likely that arib or two was broken. How long ago? Years? Minutes? She had no way ofknowing. Her slender right hand found the oxygen valve and turned it.For a long while she lay, hurting and breathing helplessly.           Die now\u2014die now\u2014die now     \u2014     The votron had awakened her with its heart-breaking code message, andit was her duty to carry out its command. Nine years after the greatbattle globes had crunched together the mentors had sealed her in thistiny cell, dormant, unwaking, to be livened only when it was certainher countrymen had either definitely won\u2014or lost.     The votron's telepathic dirge chronicled the latter fact. She hadexpected nothing else.     She had only to find the relay beside her cot, press the key that wouldset in motion gigantic prime movers in the heart of the great globe,and the conquerors would join the conquered in the wide and namelessgrave of space.     But life, now doled out by the second, was too delicious to abandonimmediately. Her mind, like that of a drowning person, raced hungrilyover the memories of her past.     For twenty years, in company with her great father, she had watched      The Defender     grow from a vast metal skeleton into a planet-sizedbattle globe. But it had not grown fast enough, for when the Scythianglobe,      The Invader     , sprang out of black space to enslave the buddingTerran Confederacy,      The Defender     was unfinished, half-equipped, andundermanned.     The Terrans could only fight for time and hope for a miracle.       The Defender     , commanded by her father, Gordon, Lord Kane, hurleditself from its orbit around Procyon and met      The Invader     with giantfission torpedoes.     And then, in an intergalactic proton storm beyond the Lesser MagellanicCloud, the globes lost their bearings and collided. Hordes of brute-menpoured through the crushed outer armor of the stricken      Defender     .     The prone woman stirred uneasily. Here the images became unrealand terrible, with the recurrent vision of death. It had taken theScythians nine years to conquer      The Defender's     outer shell. Then hadcome that final interview with her father.     In half an hour our last space port will be captured, he hadtelepathed curtly. Only one more messenger ship can leave      TheDefender     . Be on it.     No. I shall die here.     His fine tired eyes had studied her face in enigmatic appraisal. Thendie usefully. The mentors are trying to develop a force that willdestroy both globes in the moment of our inevitable defeat. If they aresuccessful, you will have the task of pressing the final button of thebattle.     There's an off-chance you may survive, countered a mentor. We'realso working on a means for your escape\u2014not only because you areGordon's daughter, but because this great proton storm will preventradio contact with Terra for years, and we want someone to escape withour secret if and when our experiments prove successful.     But you must expect to die, her father had warned with gentlefinality.     She clenched her fingernails vehemently into her palms and wrenchedherself back to the present.     That time had come.     With some effort she worked herself out of the crumpled bed and lay onthe floor of her little cubicle, panting and holding her chest withboth hands. The metal floor was very cold. Evidently the enemy torpedofissionables had finally broken through to the center portions of theship, letting in the icy breath of space. Small matter. Not by freezingwould she die.     She reached out her hand, felt for the all-important key, and gasped indismay. The mahogany box containing the key had burst its metal bondsand was lying on its side. The explosion that had crushed her cubiclehad been terrific.     With a gurgle of horror she snapped on her wrist luminar and examinedthe interior of the box.     It was a shattered ruin.   <doc-sep> Once the fact was clear, she composed herself and lay there, breathinghard and thinking. She had no means to construct another key.

However, in the due course of events, therecording was gathered up with many others like it, boxed carefully,and sent to the Office of the Occupational Commandant, Zone One, forauditing.   <doc-sep> Evelyn was extremely careful with her mental probe as she descendedfrom the transport. The Occupational Commandant would undoubtedlybe high-born and telepathic. He must not have occasion to suspect asimilar ability in a mere clerk.     Fighting had passed this way, too, and recently. Many of the buildingswere still smoking, and many of the radions high above were eithershot out or obscured by slowly drifting dust clouds. The acrid odor ofradiation-remover was everywhere.     She caught the sound of spasmodic small-arm fire.     What is that? she asked the transport attendant.     The Commandant is shooting prisoners, he replied laconically.     Oh.     Where did you want to go?     To the personnel office.     That way. He pointed to the largest building of the group\u2014twostories high, reasonably intact.     She walked off down the gravel path, which was stained here and therewith dark sticky red. She gave her visa to the guard at the door andwas admitted to an improvised waiting room, where another guard eyedher stonily. The firing was much nearer. She recognized the obscenecoughs of a Faeg pistol and began to feel sick.     A woman in the green uniform of the Scythe auxiliary came in, whisperedsomething to the guard, and then told Evelyn to follow her.     In the anteroom a grey cat looked her over curiously, and Evelynfrowned. She might have to get rid of the cat if she stayed here. Undercertain circumstances the animal could prove her deadliest enemy.     The next room held a foppish little man, evidently a supervisor of somesort, who was studying her visa.     I'm very happy to have you here, S'ria\u2014ah\u2014\u2014he looked at the visasuspiciously\u2014S'ria Lyn. Do sit down. But, as I was just remarking toS'ria Gerek, here\u2014he nodded to the other woman, who smiled back\u2014Iwish the field officers would make up their august minds as to whetherthey want you or don't want you. Just why did they transfer you toH.Q.?     She thought quickly. This pompous little ass would have to be givensome answer that would keep him from checking with the inquisitor. Itwould have to be something personal. She looked at the false black inhis eyebrows and sideburns, and the artificial way in which he hadcombed hair over his bald spot. She crossed her knees slowly, ignoringthe narrowing eyes of S'ria Gerek, and smoothed the back of her braidedyellow hair. He was studying her covertly.     The men in the fighting zones are uncouth, S'ria Gorph, she saidsimply. I was told that      you     , that is, I mean\u2014     Yes? he was the soul of graciousness. S'ria Gerek began to dictateloudly into her mechanical transcriber.     Evelyn cleared her throat, averted her eyes, and with some effort,managed a delicate flush. I meant to say, I thought I would be happierworking for\u2014working here. So I asked for a transfer.     S'ria Gorph beamed. Splendid. But the occupation isn't over, yet,you know. There'll be hard work here for several weeks yet, before wecut loose from the enemy globe. But you do your work well\u2014winkingartfully\u2014and I'll see that\u2014     He stopped, and his face took on a hunted look of mingled fear andanxiety. He appeared to listen.     Evelyn tensed her mind to receive and deceive a mental probe. She wascertain now that the Zone Commandant was high-born and telepathic. Thechances were only fifty-fifty that she could delude him for any lengthof time if he became interested in her. He must be avoided if at allpossible. It should not be too difficult. He undoubtedly had a dozenpersonal secretaries and/or concubines and would take small interest inthe lowly employees that amused Gorph.     Gorph looked at her uncertainly. Perat, Viscount of the Tharn Suns,sends you his compliments and wishes to see you on the balcony. Hepointed to a hallway. All the way through there, across to the otherwing.     As she left, she heard all sound in the room stop. The transcribing andcalculating machines trailed off into a watchful silence, and she couldfeel the eyes of the men and women on her back. She noticed then thatthe Faeg had ceased firing.  "

        "Query": "What does it mean that the device given to Evelyn did not detonate in Stalemate In Space?",
        "Summary_1": "If the device exploded and all went according to the plan, both The Defender and The Invader would be destroyed immediately with all the people on board including Evelyn. Due to a technical break, Evelyn stayed alive and had to think of other ways to destroy the ships. The whole rest of the story is a sequence of events and encounters, accompanied by tricks and cunning, leading to this final aim. She is breaking free, gets trust of her enemies, and even kills her father for this great purpose of destroying their enemies. Every her action is carefully controlled in order to get to Perat and spy on the thoughts of his officers. As she doesn't have anyone left and is surrounded by enemies, she need the purpose to live, which is given by this broken exploder and her following inability to fulfill her task. ",
        "Summary_2": "The device that Evelyn is given is meant to destroy both globes at war with each other when Evelyn\u2019s side has undeniably lost. The button will potentially kill her and everyone else fighting. When Evelyn wakes, she realizes the device is broken and she needs to fix it. If the device had worked properly and was not shattered, Evelyn would not have gone to the Occupational Commandment of Zone 1 and seen her father. The device is significant because it is to put an end to the war through severe destruction and death. ",
        "Summary_3": "When Evelyn vowed to stay on the planet until it was time to destroy it, leading to her death, she was given a key that would carry it out when she was commanded to do so. However, when Evelyn finally receives this command, the cubicle where she stays had suffered damage from an explosion. This caused the key that would destroy the planet to be shattered. Evelyn is unable to construct a new key herself, but she knows she must carry out the destruction as it was her final duty. So, Evelyn decides to take the risk of going undercover as a Scythian to find a way to repair or create a new device.",
        "Summary_4": "After Evelyn demands to stay behind when her father asks her to board the last ship leaving The Defender, she will be the person that press the final button of the battle. The mentors are developing some means of escape so that Evelyn, Gordon\u2019s daughter, can survive with the secret of the Terrans. This is because the explosion that will destroy both globes will prevent radio contact with Terra for years. Thus, they needs someone to escape with their secret. But when Evelyn search for the box after the explosion, it becomes shattered ruin, which makes her set to accomplish the stalemate in space. Leading her to paralyze the soldier and escaping from the inquisitor, as well as later killing her father. ",

Nine years after the greatbattle globes had crunched together the mentors had sealed her in thistiny cell, dormant, unwaking, to be livened only when it was certainher countrymen had either definitely won\u2014or lost.     The votron's telepathic dirge chronicled the latter fact. She hadexpected nothing else.     She had only to find the relay beside her cot, press the key that wouldset in motion gigantic prime movers in the heart of the great globe,and the conquerors would join the conquered in the wide and namelessgrave of space.     But life, now doled out by the second, was too delicious to abandonimmediately. Her mind, like that of a drowning person, raced hungrilyover the memories of her past.     For twenty years, in company with her great father, she had watched      The Defender     grow from a vast metal skeleton into a planet-sizedbattle globe. But it had not grown fast enough, for when the Scythianglobe,      The Invader     , sprang out of black space to enslave the buddingTerran Confederacy,      The Defender     was unfinished, half-equipped, andundermanned.     The Terrans could only fight for time and hope for a miracle.       The Defender     , commanded by her father, Gordon, Lord Kane, hurleditself from its orbit around Procyon and met      The Invader     with giantfission torpedoes.     And then, in an intergalactic proton storm beyond the Lesser MagellanicCloud, the globes lost their bearings and collided. Hordes of brute-menpoured through the crushed outer armor of the stricken      Defender     .     The prone woman stirred uneasily. Here the images became unrealand terrible, with the recurrent vision of death. It had taken theScythians nine years to conquer      The Defender's     outer shell. Then hadcome that final interview with her father.     In half an hour our last space port will be captured, he hadtelepathed curtly. Only one more messenger ship can leave      TheDefender     . Be on it.     No. I shall die here.     His fine tired eyes had studied her face in enigmatic appraisal. Thendie usefully. The mentors are trying to develop a force that willdestroy both globes in the moment of our inevitable defeat. If they aresuccessful, you will have the task of pressing the final button of thebattle.     There's an off-chance you may survive, countered a mentor. We'realso working on a means for your escape\u2014not only because you areGordon's daughter, but because this great proton storm will preventradio contact with Terra for years, and we want someone to escape withour secret if and when our experiments prove successful.     But you must expect to die, her father had warned with gentlefinality.     She clenched her fingernails vehemently into her palms and wrenchedherself back to the present.     That time had come.     With some effort she worked herself out of the crumpled bed and lay onthe floor of her little cubicle, panting and holding her chest withboth hands. The metal floor was very cold. Evidently the enemy torpedofissionables had finally broken through to the center portions of theship, letting in the icy breath of space. Small matter. Not by freezingwould she die.     She reached out her hand, felt for the all-important key, and gasped indismay. The mahogany box containing the key had burst its metal bondsand was lying on its side. The explosion that had crushed her cubiclehad been terrific.     With a gurgle of horror she snapped on her wrist luminar and examinedthe interior of the box.     It was a shattered ruin.   <doc-sep> Once the fact was clear, she composed herself and lay there, breathinghard and thinking. She had no means to construct another key. At best,finding the rare tools and parts would take months, and during theinterval the invaders would be cutting loose from the dead hulk thatclutched their conquering battle globe in a metallic rigor mortis.     She gave herself six weeks to accomplish this stalemate in space.     Within that time she must know whether the prime movers were stillintact, and whether she could safely enter the pile room herself,set the movers in motion, and draw the moderator columns. If it wereunsafe, she must secure the unwitting assistance of her Scythianenemies.     Still prone, she found the first-aid kit and taped her chest expertly.The cold was beginning to make itself felt, so she flicked on thechaudiere she wore as an under-garment to her Scythian woman's uniform.Then she crawled on her elbows and stomach to the tiny door, spun thesealing gear, and was soon outside. Ignoring the pain and pulling onthe side of the imitation rock that contained her cell, she got slowlyto her feet. The air was thin indeed, and frigid. She turned the valveof her portable oxygen bottle almost subconsciously, while exploringthe surrounding blackened forest as far as she could see. Mentally shewas alert for roving alien minds. She had left her weapons inside thecubicle, except for the three things in the little leather bag danglingfrom her waist, for she knew that her greatest weapon in the struggleto come would be her apparent harmlessness.     Four hundred yards behind her she detected the mind of a low-bornScythe, of the Tharn sun group. Very quickly she established it as thatof a tired, brutish corporal, taking a mop-up squad through the blackstumps and forlorn branches of the small forest that for years hadsupplied oxygen to the defenders of this sector.     The corporal could not see her green Scythian uniform clearly, andevidently took her for a Terran woman. In his mind was the question:Should he shoot immediately, or should he capture her? It had been twomonths since he had seen a woman. But then, his orders were to shoot.Yes, he would shoot.     Evelyn turned in profile to the beam-gun and stretched luxuriously,hoping that her grimace of pain could not be detected. Withsatisfaction, she sensed a sudden change of determination in the mindof the Tharn. The gun was lowered, and the man was circling to creep upbehind her. He did not bother to notify his men. He wanted her first.He had seen her uniform, but that deterred him not a whit. Afterwards,he would call up the squad. Finally, they would kill her and move on.Women auxiliaries had no business here, anyway.     Hips dipping, Evelyn sauntered into the shattered copse. The man movedfaster, though still trying to approach quietly. Most of the radions inthe mile-high ceiling had been destroyed, and the light was poor. Hewas not surprised when he lost track of his quarry. He tip-toed rapidlyonward, picking his way through the charred and fallen branches,thinking that she must turn up again soon. He had not gone twenty yardsin this manner when a howl of unbearable fury sounded in his mind, andthe dull light in his brain went out.        She fought for her life under that mile-high ceiling.        Breathing deeply from her mental effort, the woman stepped frombehind a great black tree trunk and hurried to the unconscious man.For I.Q.'s of 100 and less, telepathic cortical paralysis was quiteeffective. With cool efficiency and no trace of distaste she strippedthe odorous uniform from the man, then took his weapon, turned the beampower down very low, and needled a neat slash across his throat. Whilehe bled to death, she slipped deftly into the baggy suit, clasped thebeam gun by the handle, and started up the sooty slope. For a time, atleast, it would be safer to pass as a Tharn soldier than as any kind ofa woman.      II     The inquisitor leaned forward, frowning at the girl before him.     Name?     Evelyn Kane.     The eyes of the inquisitor widened. So you admit to a Terran name.Well, Terran, you are charged with having stolen passage on a supplylorry, and you also seem to be wearing the uniform of an infantrycorporal as well as that of a Scythian woman auxiliary. Incidentally,where is the corporal? Did you kill him?     He was prepared for a last-ditch denial. He would cut it short, havethe guards remove her, and execution would follow immediately. In away, it was unfortunate. The woman was obviously of a high Terranclass. No\u2014he couldn't consider that. His slender means couldn't affordanother woman in his quarters, and besides, he wouldn't feel safe withthis cool murderess.     Do you not understand the master tongue? Why did you kill thecorporal? He leaned impatiently over his desk.     The woman stared frankly back at him with her clear blue eyes. Theguards on either side of her dug their nails into her arms, as wastheir custom with recalcitrant prisoners, but she took no notice.     She had analyzed the minds of the three men. She could handle theinquisitor alone or the two guards alone, but not all three.     If you aren't afraid of me, perhaps you'd be so kind as to send theguards out for a few minutes, she said, placing a hand on her hip. Ihave interesting information.     So that was it. Buy her freedom by betraying fugitive Terrans. Well, hecould take the information and then kill her. He nodded curtly to theguards, and they walked out of the hut, exchanging sly winks with oneanother.     Evelyn Kane crossed her arms across her chest and felt her broken ribgingerly. The inquisitor stared up at her in sadistic admiration. Hewould certainly be on hand for the execution. His anticipation was cutshort with a horrible realization. Under the paralyzing force of a mindgreater than his own, he reached beneath the desk and switched off therecorder.     Who is the Occupational Commandant for this Sector, she askedtersely. This must be done swiftly before the guards returned.     Perat, Viscount of Tharn, replied the man mechanically.     What is the extent of his jurisdiction?     From the center of the Terran globe, outward four hundred milesradius.     Good. Prepare for me the usual visa that a woman clerk needs forpassage to the offices of the Occupational Commandant.     The inquisitor filled in blanks in a stiff sheet of paper and stamped aseal at its bottom.     You will add in the portion reserved for 'comments', the following:'Capable clerk. Others will follow as they are found available.'     The man's pen scratched away obediently.     Evelyn Kane smiled gently at the impotent, inwardly raging inquisitor.She took the paper, folded it, and placed it in a pocket in her blouse.Call the guards, she ordered.     He pressed the button on his desk, and the guards re-entered.     This person is no longer a prisoner, said the inquisitor woodenly.She is to take the next transport to the Occupational Commandant ofZone One.     When the transport had left, neither inquisitor nor guards had anymemory of the woman. However, in the due course of events, therecording was gathered up with many others like it, boxed carefully,and sent to the Office of the Occupational Commandant, Zone One, forauditing.   <doc-sep> Evelyn was extremely careful with her mental probe as she descendedfrom the transport. The Occupational Commandant would undoubtedlybe high-born and telepathic. He must not have occasion to suspect asimilar ability in a mere clerk.     Fighting had passed this way, too, and recently. Many of the buildingswere still smoking, and many of the radions high above were eithershot out or obscured by slowly drifting dust clouds. The acrid odor ofradiation-remover was everywhere.     She caught the sound of spasmodic small-arm fire.     What is that? she asked the transport attendant.     The Commandant is shooting prisoners, he replied laconically.     Oh.     Where did you want to go?     To the personnel office.     That way. He pointed to the largest building of the group\u2014twostories high, reasonably intact.     She walked off down the gravel path, which was stained here and therewith dark sticky red. She gave her visa to the guard at the door andwas admitted to an improvised waiting room, where another guard eyedher stonily. The firing was much nearer. She recognized the obscenecoughs of a Faeg pistol and began to feel sick.     A woman in the green uniform of the Scythe auxiliary came in, whisperedsomething to the guard, and then told Evelyn to follow her.     In the anteroom a grey cat looked her over curiously, and Evelynfrowned. She might have to get rid of the cat if she stayed here. Undercertain circumstances the animal could prove her deadliest enemy.     The next room held a foppish little man, evidently a supervisor of somesort, who was studying her visa.     I'm very happy to have you here, S'ria\u2014ah\u2014\u2014he looked at the visasuspiciously\u2014S'ria Lyn. Do sit down. But, as I was just remarking toS'ria Gerek, here\u2014he nodded to the other woman, who smiled back\u2014Iwish the field officers would make up their august minds as to whetherthey want you or don't want you. Just why did they transfer you toH.Q.?     She thought quickly. This pompous little ass would have to be givensome answer that would keep him from checking with the inquisitor. Itwould have to be something personal. She looked at the false black inhis eyebrows and sideburns, and the artificial way in which he hadcombed hair over his bald spot. She crossed her knees slowly, ignoringthe narrowing eyes of S'ria Gerek, and smoothed the back of her braidedyellow hair. He was studying her covertly.     The men in the fighting zones are uncouth, S'ria Gorph, she saidsimply. I was told that      you     , that is, I mean\u2014     Yes? he was the soul of graciousness. S'ria Gerek began to dictateloudly into her mechanical transcriber.     Evelyn cleared her throat, averted her eyes, and with some effort,managed a delicate flush. I meant to say, I thought I would be happierworking for\u2014working here. So I asked for a transfer.     S'ria Gorph beamed. Splendid. But the occupation isn't over, yet,you know. There'll be hard work here for several weeks yet, before wecut loose from the enemy globe. But you do your work well\u2014winkingartfully\u2014and I'll see that\u2014     He stopped, and his face took on a hunted look of mingled fear andanxiety. He appeared to listen.     Evelyn tensed her mind to receive and deceive a mental probe. She wascertain now that the Zone Commandant was high-born and telepathic. Thechances were only fifty-fifty that she could delude him for any lengthof time if he became interested in her. He must be avoided if at allpossible. It should not be too difficult. He undoubtedly had a dozenpersonal secretaries and/or concubines and would take small interest inthe lowly employees that amused Gorph.     Gorph looked at her uncertainly. Perat, Viscount of the Tharn Suns,sends you his compliments and wishes to see you on the balcony. Hepointed to a hallway. All the way through there, across to the otherwing.     As she left, she heard all sound in the room stop. The transcribing andcalculating machines trailed off into a watchful silence, and she couldfeel the eyes of the men and women on her back. She noticed then thatthe Faeg had ceased firing.  "

        "Query": "In what ways is the concept of obligation examined in Stalemate In Space?",
        "Summary_1": "Evelyn, the main character, is an example of a person following and respecting her duty. As a daughter of the commander she was brought up with a role model during the war time. Her father commanded the ship, defending the whole nation, and she witnessed it for years. It taught her to understand the duty and therefore she refused to leave the ship when she had the opportunity and accepted the important task of exploding both ships and herself as well. No matter how scared she was, she was determined to fulfill the duty placed on her by her father and mentors, and for that reason she pressed the button. When it didn't work, she kept feeling the burden of duty on her and started thinking of other means to destroy the enemies to fulfill the task. Following her duty moved her forward through pain and danger, made her find the ways to achieve it. When she shot her father, she did it because she had to, she knew it was the only right way to reach her aim instead of giving up to emotions. ",
        "Summary_2": "Evelyn had an opportunity to save her life by joining the last messenger ship leaving The Defender as her father had originally instructed her to do. However, she does not want to abandon the fight because she possess a sense of duty towards the war and sticking by her father\u2019s side. She chooses to continue fighting with an understanding that it is inevitable that her side will lose the fight. She also accepts controlling a device that will destroy both globes and has a high chance of killing her in the process. She is willing to sacrifice her life to finish the job. The theme of duty is further explored when she is told to shoot her own father. She understands that if she saves her problem she would not be able to complete the detonation that she was assigned. Evelyn shoots her father as she concludes that she has to kill him to not alert anyone of her real identity. ",
        "Summary_3": "Many of the characters in the story have their own duties that they take as a matter of life or death. Kane, Evelyn's father, is the Commander of The Defender and his duty is fighting for its people, even if it ultimately leads to his death. Evelyn has a similar duty, which is to destroy the planet, and thus both the Invaders and Defenders, and sacrifice her life in doing so. Evelyn is aware of this duty and does everything she can to see that it is done, which is why she decides to go undercover when she realizes that the destruct button has been broken. By following this duty, Evelyn does things she never imagined she would have to do, such as killing her father in order to maintain her cover.",
        "Summary_4": "The theme of duty is explored through Evelyn staying behind and refusing to board the last ship to leave The Defender. Duty is seen when she wakes up with broken rib, but still remembers her mission and tries to achieve it. Evelyn and her father both put duty before each other. When Evelyn was ordered to kill her father, she felt very bad and did not want to, but she had to do it. Her father did not express anything about knowing the person who will kill him. ",

The top of thecubicle was bulging inward on her chest, and it seemed likely that arib or two was broken. How long ago? Years? Minutes? She had no way ofknowing. Her slender right hand found the oxygen valve and turned it.For a long while she lay, hurting and breathing helplessly.

The mentors are trying to develop a force that willdestroy both globes in the moment of our inevitable defeat. If they aresuccessful, you will have the task of pressing the final button of thebattle.     There's an off-chance you may survive, countered a mentor. We'realso working on a means for your escape\u2014not only because you areGordon's daughter, but because this great proton storm will preventradio contact with Terra for years, and we want someone to escape withour secret if and when our experiments prove successful.     But you must expect to die, her father had warned with gentlefinality.     She clenched her fingernails vehemently into her palms and wrenchedherself back to the present.     That time had come.     With some effort she worked herself out of the crumpled bed and lay onthe floor of her little cubicle, panting and holding her chest withboth hands. The metal floor was very cold. Evidently the enemy torpedofissionables had finally broken through to the center portions of theship, letting in the icy breath of space. Small matter. Not by freezingwould she die.     She reached out her hand, felt for the all-important key, and gasped indismay. The mahogany box containing the key had burst its metal bondsand was lying on its side. The explosion that had crushed her cubiclehad been terrific.     With a gurgle of horror she snapped on her wrist luminar and examinedthe interior of the box.     It was a shattered ruin.   <doc-sep> Using the technique I had grasped from the Gool itself, I struck,stifling the outcry, invaded the fetid blackness and grappled theobscene gelatinous immensity of the Gool spy as it spasmed in a frenzyof xenophobia\u2014a ton of liver writhing at the bottom of a dark well.     I clamped down control. The Gool mind folded in on itself, gibbering.Not pausing to rest, I followed up, probed along my channel of contact,tracing patterns, scanning the flaccid Gool mind....     I saw a world of yellow seas lapping at endless shores of mud. Therewas a fuming pit, where liquid sulphur bubbled up from some innersource, filling an immense natural basin. The Gool clustered at itsrim, feeding, each monstrous shape heaving against its neighbors for amore favorable position.       I probed farther, saw the great cables of living nervous tissue thatlinked each eating organ with the brain-mass far underground. I tracedthe passages through which tendrils ran out to immense caverns wheresmaller creatures labored over strange devices. These, my host's memorytold me, were the young of the Gool. Here they built the fleets thatwould transport the spawn to the new worlds the Prime Overlord haddiscovered, worlds where food was free for the taking. Not sulphuralone, but potassium, calcium, iron and all the metals\u2014richesbeyond belief in endless profusion. No longer would the Gool tribecluster\u2014those who remained of a once-great race\u2014at a single feedingtrough. They would spread out across a galaxy\u2014and beyond.     But not if I could help it.     The Gool had evolved a plan\u2014but they'd had a stroke of bad luck.     In the past, they had managed to control a man here and there, amongthe fleets, far from home, but only at a superficial level. Enough,perhaps, to wreck a ship, but not the complete control needed to send aman back to Earth under Gool compulsion, to carry out complex sabotage.     Then they had found me, alone, a sole survivor, free from the clutterof the other mind-fields. It had been their misfortune to pick apsychodynamicist. Instead of gaining a patient slave, they had openedthe fortress door to an unseen spy. Now that I was there, I would seewhat I could steal.     A timeless time passed. I wandered among patterns of white light andwhite sound, plumbed the deepest recesses of hidden Gool thoughts,fared along strange ways examining the shapes and colors of theconcepts of an alien mind.     I paused at last, scanning a multi-ordinal structure of pattern withinpattern; the diagrammed circuits of a strange machine.     I followed through its logic-sequence; and, like a bomb-burst, itsmeaning exploded in my mind.     From the vile nest deep under the dark surface of the Gool world inits lonely trans-Plutonian orbit, I had plucked the ultimate secret oftheir kind.     Matter across space.   <doc-sep> Kelburn went to the projector. It would be easier if we knew all thestars in the Milky Way, but though we've explored only a small portionof it, we can reconstruct a fairly accurate representation of the past.     He pressed the controls and stars twinkled on the screen. We'relooking down on the plane of the Galaxy. This is one arm of it as it istoday and here are the human systems. He pressed another control and,for purposes of identification, certain stars became more brilliant.There was no pattern, merely a scattering of stars. The whole MilkyWay is rotating. And while stars in a given region tend to remaintogether, there's also a random motion. Here's what happens when wecalculate the positions of stars in the past.     Flecks of light shifted and flowed across the screen. Kelburn stoppedthe motion.     Two hundred thousand years ago, he said.     There was a pattern of the identified stars. They were spaced at fairlyequal intervals along a regular curve, a horseshoe loop that didn'tclose, though if the ends were extended, the lines would have crossed.     Taphetta rustled. The math is accurate?     As accurate as it can be with a million-plus body problem.     And that's the hypothetical route of the unknown ancestor?     To the best of our knowledge, said Kelburn. And whereas there arehumans who are relatively near and not fertile, they can always matewith those they were adjacent to      two hundred thousand years ago     !     The adjacency mating principle. I've never seen it demonstrated,murmured Taphetta, flexing his ribbons. Is that the only era thatsatisfies the calculations?     Plus or minus a hundred thousand years, we can still get somethingthat might be the path of a spaceship attempting to cover arepresentative section of territory, said Kelburn. However, we haveother ways of dating it. On some worlds on which there are no othermammals, we're able to place the first human fossils chronologically.The evidence is sometimes contradictory, but we believe we've got thetime right.     Taphetta waved a ribbon at the chart. And you think that where the twoends of the curve cross is your original home?     We think so, said Kelburn. We've narrowed it down to several cubiclight-years\u2014then. Now it's far more. And, of course, if it were afast-moving star, it might be completely out of the field of ourexploration. But we're certain we've got a good chance of finding itthis trip.     It seems I must decide quickly. The Ribboneer glanced out thevisionport, where another ship hung motionless in space beside them.Do you mind if I ask other questions?     Go ahead, Kelburn invited sardonically. But if it's not math, you'dbetter ask Halden. He's the leader of the expedition.     Halden flushed; the sarcasm wasn't necessary. It was true that Kelburnwas the most advanced human type present, but while there weredifferences, biological and in the scale of intelligence, it wasn'tas great as once was thought. Anyway, non-humans weren't trained inthe fine distinctions that men made among themselves. And, higher orlower, he was as good a biologist as the other was a mathematician. Andthere was the matter of training; he'd been on several expeditions andthis was Kelburn's first trip. Damn it, he thought, that rated somerespect.     The Ribboneer shifted his attention. Aside from the sudden illness ofyour pilot, why did you ask for me?     We didn't. The man became sick and required treatment we can't givehim. Luckily, a ship was passing and we hailed it because it's fourmonths to the nearest planet. They consented to take him back and toldus that there was a passenger on board who was an experienced pilot. Wehave men who could do the job in a makeshift fashion, but the regionwe're heading for, while mapped, is largely unknown. We'd prefer tohave an expert\u2014and Ribboneers are famous for their navigationalability.     Taphetta crinkled politely at the reference to his skill. I had otherplans, but I can't evade professional obligations, and an emergencysuch as this should cancel out any previous agreements. Still, what arethe incentives?     Sam Halden coughed. The usual, plus a little extra. We've copied theRibboneer's standard nature, simplifying it a little and adding a percent here and there for the crew pilot and scientist's share of theprofits from any discoveries we may make.     I'm complimented that you like our contract so well, said Taphetta,but I really must have our own unsimplified version. If you want me,you'll take my contract. I came prepared. He extended a tightly boundroll that he had kept somewhere on his person.     They glanced at one another as Halden took it.     You can read it if you want, offered Taphetta. But it will takeyou all day\u2014it's micro-printing. However, you needn't be afraid thatI'm defrauding you. It's honored everywhere we go and we go nearlyeverywhere in this sector\u2014places men have never been.     There was no choice if they wanted him, and they did.

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in THE SPICY SOUND OF SUCCESS?",
        "Summary_1": "Captain Gavin and Ordinary Spaceman Quade have an argument about the blank video screen during a space exploration mission. Quade claims it is a transphasia and Captain doubts it. When the dispute gets tense, the two of them go out to find the reason for the blackout. There they smell and taste the beauty. Suddenly, a streak of spice shoots and the captain feels pain. After another short fight the two decide to go back to the spacer. There the captain has a chat with First Officer Nagurski, an ex-captain, about making Gavin's relationship with the crew better. Quade joins, and next steps towards transphasia are discussed with the final decision of the captain to tear apart the ship as it is the only protection. Many disagree again, and Quade goes out somewhere alone without a cable. Gavin blames himself for not seeing Quade's intentions and plans to follow. The crew plans on fighting the noise with music outside and increasing smell and taste by drinking wine. After these preparations, a part of the crew moves out following the cable to search for Quade. Soon they find him lying in the dust with frostbite and heat prostration. Near the ship, lizard-like aliens stand in the crew's way. A short beating occurs, and soon the captain is talking to Quade in the infirmary about the past experience. Turns out the aliens were trying to help and desired to be colonized. Quade acknowledges his mistakes and loses his confidence, for which he is demoted by the captain.",
        "Summary_2": "Gavin is the Captain of a spaceship that is set to explore planets and aliens. However, Transphasia, an electrogravitational disturbance that rechannels incoming sense data to the wrong receptive areas, is affecting the video screen on their ship. Quade, an Ordinary Spaceman on the spaceship, does not believe Gavin\u2019s assumption that the alien race might be interfering with their exploration. Quade argues that, from experience, aliens generally do not even recognize their existence. Gavin asserts that Quade relies too much on tradition and experience that he is becoming careless. But Quade states that Gavin is an outsider. Not able to persuade the other, they decided to find out the reason that lead to this video screen blackout. \n\nGoing onto the desert at where they landed, Gavin started to experience Transphasia, where he tastes the views and smell the colors; while on the other hand, Quade seems to have accustomed to the strange senses. Suddenly, some kind of spice goes pass the two of them along with a second-long pain, and Quade was so curious that he dragged Gavin toward the direction of the spice, mentioning that they are an exploration party after all when Gavin ordered him to stop. After getting back to the spaceship, Nagurski, a former Captain and currently a First Officer, disputes with Gavin about trusting the Spacemen and arguing over the degree of specificity that an order should be. \n\nAfter informing Gavin their only way to escape from Transphasia, Gavin refuses and mentions another way, which is to take the spaceship apart. Nagurski is shocked and commented Gavin as being too cautious and it should not be done this way. But Gavin continued. He was then informed by Wallace, the personnel man, that Quade has left the spaceship alone by himself. Gavin is enraged and starts to plan the rescue. He asks Wallace to bring some light wine to the Spacemen to improve their taste and smell. Then Nagurski, Gavin and a few others, went to find Quade. On their way back, they came into direct contact with aliens, who tried to help the men; realizing that other men can provide better help, the aliens left. ",
        "Summary_3": "Captain Gavin and Ordinary Spacemen Quade are in an argument over transphasia. Gavin tries to demonstrate his superiority and title when Quade tells him he is wrong about the definition of transphasia. After a couple more jabs regarding experience as a spaceman and title, the two of them investigate the problem together. They begin to experience transphasia, and it turns out that Quade is correct about the color. Quade pulls him to explore further, and streaks of spice go past them only to come back and make a bitter rip. Gavin does not want to go further from the spacer, but Quade does not mind because he is an experienced spaceman. However, he stays silent once he sees how deep the freefall is. Later, Gavin has a conversation with First Officer Naguski, who claims that he has lots of experience with transphasia. Nagurski then offers advice on how a captain should treat his crew. Gavin argues that one cannot trust anything in space, while Nagurski argues that it is essential for trust to go both ways. Quade then comes in with a plan, and he explains how they would need to keep physical contact with the spaceship and suggests using a cable. Gavin decides to rip apart the spaceship instead, which Nagurski believes is terrible because it would be impossible to assemble again if there were too many missing parts. While Gavin stubbornly sticks to his plan, the personnel man Wallace informs him that Quade has already gone past the three-mile limit. He decides to go after him, finally recognizing that Quade is an essential member of the crew. Quartermaster Farley tells Gavin that he has nothing to worry about, and they discuss plans to combat transphasia. Gavin tells Farley to prepare music and give the men alcohol for medical purposes when they set off to find Quade. Once they are in the area where Quade is, they see and try to haul him back to the spaceship as soon as they can. On the way back, they run into an alien herd. Quade begins to jog towards it, and the others agree to lend him a hand to catch a specimen. The herd starts to close in on them, which eventually puts the group at a significant disadvantage. Gavin is the only sober person, as everybody else has either become knocked out, passed out, or forced to take cover. Later, Gavin visits Quade in the infirmary and tells him that he is having the spaceship put together again. Gavin explains that the aliens they encountered earlier were friendly and tried to help the spacemen. Furthermore, the aliens want them to colonize the planet. Quade blames his arrogance for his near-death experience, but Gavin tells him that confidence is a spaceman\u2019s most important asset. He then demotes Quade to Acting Executive Officer and says that Quade worries too much about how dangerous space is to explore.",
        "Summary_4": "Captain Gavin and First Officer Quade are on a very strange planet. This planet is very strange and it changes a person's senses, this is known as \"transphasia\" it also affects radar equipment. Gavin and Quade fight over rank, as Quade is more experienced, but Gavin is captain. They go out for a walk on the surface of this strange planet and their senses begin to get muddled. They hear a wailing call that quickly disappears, and then see a flash of light that travels into a canyon. They think this flash is a substance known as \"spice\". They make their way to the canyon to investigate, tasting colours and hearing sight, but once they reach the canyon, they decide they can't go any further. \nBack at the ship, they converse with first officer Naugurski. Gavin can't understand why the crew don't respect him, he explains to Gavin that he would have to earn the crew's respect. Quade mentioned there's only one way to make it through trasplasia, and that's to keep in contact with the ship at all times. They start to break apart the ship, so that they can put it together in a way that the whole crew will be in constant contact with the ship on a second journey together, to make it to the canyon. As they are working, Wallace, one of the personel men, tells Gavin that Quade has gone out on his own. They plan a rescue mission to save him. They think he will go beyond the three mile limit. Gavin comes up with a plan to stay oriented. They will drink wine to sharpen their sense of sight, and they will stay connected to each other through a cable. After some searching on the surface of the planet, and hearing the wailing call again, they find Quade. They haul him back in weak condition. They are met back at the ship by a group of Aliens, one of whom starts to jump on Quade, flattening him. They manage to pull Quade out of there, and when the two men talk about it later in the ship, Gavin says that the Aliens were trying to figure out what was wrong with Quade, and to help him. They let Quade go when they knew that the crew could help him more than they could. Gavin demotes Quade but they build a new sense of comradery. ",

        "Query": "What led to the conflict between the Captain and Quade in THE SPICY SOUND OF SUCCESS?",
        "Summary_1": "Quade holds the captain in low regard, he believes to be much more experienced and knowledgeable and disagrees with Gavin's decisions. Therefore, Quade doesn't want to obey the captain and constantly confronts him. Gavin, in turn, wants to be obeyed and considers his position enough reason to ask for that. The captain is new to the crew and he doesn't try to get closer to it, while all the other members have known each other for a while. Moreover, the captain constantly takes risks and suggests new methods, in which the crew and Quade are not sure. Gavin also feels jealous as the crew respects Quade much more than the captain himself. Quade acts on his own according to what he considers right, and Gavin has to fight him for leadership and make him obey, not to lose charge. Their relationship changes when Gavin starts blaming himself for Quade's leave and possible death, considering his own jealousy the reason of neglect. When he saves Quade, the least also changes his mind because he recognizes the foolishness of his actions and the two come to an agreement. ",
        "Summary_2": "The conflict between Captain and Quade started with Quade mentioning that this is the first trip for the Captain and accused of him being wrong at analyzing the reason that lead to the blackout on the video screen. The Captain argues that Quade has been relying too much on the tradition and the past experiences where he started to become careless; he supposed that Quade was busted to Ordinary Spaceman because of it and he is complacent. Quade repudiated that idea and called Captain an outsider. This conflict leads them to find out the reason that lead to this video screen blackout together. During the trip, Quade was so curious about a spice that passed not far from them that he dragged the Captain toward the direction of the spice, mentioning that they are an exploration party after all when the Captain ordered him to stop.\n\nAfterward, the Captain refuses to comply with Quade\u2019s escape plan from Transphasia; he comes up with a much unusual plan. Later, Quade has left the spaceship alone by himself, which gets the Captain enraged and thought about if he wanted him dead. But he still goes to rescue him fearing of more opinions from the spacemen if Quade is gone. Finally, after Quade is found, they meet some aliens who tried to help them by calling and warning them. They even offered one of their kind for the men to study. Then, Quade realizes that he has been arrogant and blind, and he apologize for his actions. The Captain tells Quade to keep up with his confidence even though he demoted him afterward. And he told Quade that the space isn\u2019t that dangerous. ",
        "Summary_3": "The reason behind Captain Gavin and Quade\u2019s conflict is that the Captain does not trust Quade\u2019s opinions. He believes himself superior to Quade and the rest of the crew because of his higher position as Captain, even though he is very inexperienced compared to many other crew members. He also refuses to compromise for the sake of other crew members, which causes him and Quade to clash constantly because of his stubbornness. This conflict initially develops for the worse, and Quade even goes to defy Gavin\u2019s orders because he believes that his experience will ensure his survival. However, Gavin does choose to rescue Quade, which is a turning point in their conflict. After Quade is rescued, Gavin has a much more positive attitude towards him and even offers words of encouragement. ",
        "Summary_4": "\nThe reason for the Captain and Quade's conflict is because while it is Captain Gavin's first space expedition, Quade has twenty years of experience under his belt. They argue over who is more knowledgeable, the captain obviously feeling threatened by Quade's experience. Quade hates that Gavin has the power to pull rank over him, and he sees him as a cocky newbie that doesn't have half the knowledge he possesses. They insult each other on a number of occasions. Quade tells the captain that he is nothing more than a figurehead to the men of the crew. When they go onto the planet's surface, they bicker about how to deal with the terrain. Their conflict is put to rest though after the captain saves Quade's life, and a sort of comradery is formed between them. \n",

You are plain wrong, Captain. Traditionally, alien races neverinterfere with our explorations. Generally, they are so alien to usthey can't even recognize our existence.   <doc-sep> Looks okay to me, I said. Quade passed a gauntlet over his faceplate.It's real. I can blur it with a smudged visor. When it blurs, it'ssolid.     The landscape beyond the black corona left by our landing rockets wasunimpressive. The rocky desert was made up of silicon and iron oxide,so it looked much the same as a terrestrial location. Yellowish-whitesand ran up to and around reddish brown rock clawing into the pinksunlight.     I don't understand it, Quade admitted. Transphasia hits you a foulas soon as you let it into the airlock.     Apparently, Quade,      this     thing is going to creep up on us.     Don't sound smug, Captain. It's pitty-pattying behind you too.     The keening call across the surface of consciousness postponed my reply.     The wail was ominously forlorn, defiant of description. I turned myhead around slowly inside my helmet, not even sure that I had heard it.     But what else can you do with a wail but      hear     it?     Quade nodded. I've felt this before. It usually hits sooner. Let'strace it.     I don't like this, I admitted. It's not at all what I expected fromwhat you said about transphasia. It must be something else.     It couldn't be anything else. I know what to expect. You don't. Youmay begin smelling sensations, tasting sounds, hearing sights, seeingtastes, touching odors\u2014or any other combination. Don't let it botheryou.     Of course not. I'll soothe my nerves by counting little shocks oflanolin jumping over a loud fence.     Quade grinned behind his faceplate. Good idea.     Then you can have it. I'm going to try keeping my eyes open andstaying alive.     There was no reply.     His expression was tart and greasy despite all his light talk, andI knew mine was the same. I tested the security rope between ourpressure suits. It was a taut and virile bass.     We scaled a staccato of rocks, our suits grinding pepper against ourhides.     The musk summit rose before us, a minor-key horizon with a shiftingtreble for as far as I could smell. It was primitive beauty that madeyou feel shocking pink inside. The most beautiful vista I had evertasted, it couldn't be dulled even by the sensation of beef broth undermy skin.     Is this transphasia? I asked in awe.     It always has been before, Quade remarked. Ready to swallow yourwords about this being something an old hand wouldn't recognize,Captain?     I'm swallowing no words until I find out precisely how they tastehere.     Not a bad taste. They're pretty. Or haven't you noticed?     Quade, you're right! About the colors anyway. This reminds me of anilliscope recording from a cybernetic translator.     It should. I don't suppose we could understand each other if it wasn'tfor our morphistudy courses in reading cross-sense translations ofCentauri blushtalk and the like.     It became difficult to understand him, difficult to try talking in theface of such splendor. You never really appreciate colors until yousmell them for the first time.   <doc-sep> I drew myself up to my full height\u2014and noticed in irritation it wasstill an inch less than Quade's. I don't understand you men. Look atyourself, Quade. You've been busted to Ordinary Spaceman for just thatkind of thinking, for relying on tradition, on things that have workedbefore. Not only your thinking is slipshod, you've grown careless abouteverything else, even your own life.     Just a minute, Captain. I've never been 'busted.' In the ExplorationService, we regard Ordinary Spaceman as our highest rank. With myhazard pay, I get more hard cash than      you     do, and I'm closer toretirement.     That's a shallow excuse for complacency.     Complacency! I've seen ten thousand wonders in twenty years of space,with a million variations. But the patterns repeat themselves. We learnto know what to expect, so maybe we can't maintain the reactionarycaution the service likes in officers.     I resent the word 'reactionary,' Spaceman! In civilian life, I wasa lapidary and I learned the value of deliberation. But I never gottoo cataleptic to tap a million-dollar gem, which is more than mycontemporaries can say, many of 'em.     Captain Gavin, Quade said patiently, you must realize that anoutsider like you, among a crew of skilled spacemen, can never be morethan a figurehead.     Was this the way I was to be treated? Why, this man had deliberatelyinsulted me, his captain. I controlled myself, remembering thefamiliarity that had always existed between members of a crew workingunder close conditions, from the time of the ancient submarines and thefirst orbital ships.     Quade, I said, there's only one way for us to find out which of usis right about the cause of our scanning blackout.     We go out and find the reason.     Exactly. We go. You and me. I hope you can stand my company.     I'm not sure I can, he answered reluctantly. My hazard pay doesn'tcover exploring with rookies. With all due respect, Captain.     I clapped him on the shoulder. But, man, you have just been tellingme all we had to worry about was common transphasia. A man with yourexperience could protect himself and cover even a rookie, under suchfamiliar conditions\u2014right?     Yes, sir, I suppose I could, Quade said, bitterly aware he had lostout somewhere and hoping that it wasn't the start of a trend.  "

        "Query": "How do Gavin and Nagurski's attitudes differ in THE SPICY SOUND OF SUCCESS?",
        "Summary_1": "Nagurski used to be a captain and Gavin is now, though their methods and thoughts about this position differ. Nagurski believes the crew must elect their leader, and if a captain guides the crew, this will happen. Gavin thinks such attitude will lead to anarchy. Moreover, Nagurski learned to trust his men in order to make them trust him. Gavin does not trust anyone in space and doesn't want his crew to trust him as well, simply obey. Gavin tries to adapt to the new conditions, acting creatively and according to situation, while Nagurski sticks to old patterns and rules. Nagurski is afraid to risk, he opposes taking apart the ship, being afraid to lose too many parts. Nagurski is neither afraid for Quade going out alone as he believes in the least, while the captain heads to save the man. ",
        "Summary_2": "Nagurski believes that as Captains, they should ease the reins on the Spacemen. They are very smart and will realize that your advice is the correct one. Thus they will volunteer to have you as their Captain. He trust the men on the ship for making smart decisions, which will in turn make the men trust him as the Captain. On the other hand, this is Gavin\u2019s first mission ever, and he demands the men on the ship to follow his orders. He does not trust anyone in the ship, but only needs them to obey him. Moreover, he believes that the plan Gavin forms to escape the Transphasia is way too cautious, and he is risking the whole party. Gavin sees Nagurski as wanting a safer job. Gavin also thinks that Nagurski is now a First Officer instead of a Captain due to the fact that he trusted his Spacemen. However, Nagurski explains that he wants to relax a bit more and get a better pay than being a captain.  ",
        "Summary_3": "Gavin is much more uptight and suspicious of everyone, whereas Nagurski is more laid back and has considerable trust for his crew. Gavin often says that the rest of the crew must follow his plans, even when they are much riskier and are more of a stupid gamble than the alternative solutions. He also believes that he will always know what's best because he is the captain, no matter his crew's expertise. Gavin and his crew have a lack of trust, and he generally has a much more negative attitude. Even when Nagurski tries to give him advice, he tells the older man that he cannot have lazy, incompetent slobs running the spaceship. On the other hand, Nagurski, due to his experience, has more trust in the crew. Although he says that he was once the same as Gavin, he is now much calmer and more trusting. He believes that the trust between a crew and its captains must go both ways, which ultimately leads to a captain being accepted by his crew.",
        "Summary_4": "Gavin believes that to run a ship, you just need a crew to obey you. They don't have to like you, they don't even have to respect you, but they do have to follow the orders in which you give. Nagurski on the other hand believes that respect, a very important part about working as a captain on a spaceship, is won over. He believes that you must treat your crew with kindness and respect. You must make them see you as their friend, so that they pick you to be their leader, instead of you just being appointed theirs. You must trust them, as they trust you. Gavin thinks that you should trust nothing, especially not people. \n",

But look at that screen, sir, Quade said with an emphatic swing ofhis scarred arm. I've seen blank scanning like that before and youhaven't\u2014it's your first trip. This always means transphasia\u2014cortexdissolution, motor area feedback, the Aitchell Effect\u2014call it anythingyou like, it's still transphasia.     I know what transphasia is, I said moderately. It means anelectrogravitational disturbance of incoming sense data, rechannelingit to the wrong receptive areas. Besides the human brain, it alsoeffects electronic equipment, like radar and television.     Obviously. Quade glanced disgustedly at the screen.     Too obvious. This time it might not be a familiar condition of manyplanetary gravitational fields. On this planet, that blank kinescopemay mean our Big Brother kites were knocked down by hostile natives.     You are plain wrong, Captain. Traditionally, alien races neverinterfere with our explorations. Generally, they are so alien to usthey can't even recognize our existence.   <doc-sep> Nagurski brought out a pipe. He would have a pipe, I decided.     No, not always. I was like you at first. Fresh from the cosmic energytest lab, suspicious of everything, trying to tell the old hands whatto do. But I learned that they are pretty smart boys; they know whatthey are doing. You can rely on them absolutely.     I leaned forward, elbows on knees. Let me tell      you     a thing,Nagurski. Your trust of these damn-fool spacemen is why you are nolonger a captain. You can't trust anything out here in space, much lesshuman nature. Even I know that much!     He was pained. If you don't trust the men, they won't trust you, Gav.     They don't have to trust me. All they have to do is      obey     me or, byJupiter, get frozen stiff and thawed out just in time for court-marshalback home. Listen, I continued earnestly, these men aren't going tothink of me\u2014of      us     , the officers, as their leaders. As far as thecrew is concerned, Ordinary Spaceman Quade is the best man on thisship.     He      is     a good man, Nagurski said. You mustn't be jealous of hisstatus.     The dog growled. He must have sensed what I almost did to Nagurski.     Never mind that for now, I said wearily. What was your idea forgetting our exploration parties through this transphasia?     There's only one idea for that, said Quade, ducking his long headand stepping through the connecting hatch. With the Captain'spermission....     Go ahead, Quade, tell him, Nagurski invited.     There's only one way to wade through transphasia with anyreliability, Quade told me. You keep some kind of physical contactwith the spaceship. Parties are strung out on guide line, like we were,but the cable has to be run back and made fast to the hull.     How far can we run it back?     Quade shrugged. Miles.     How many?     We have three miles of cable. As long as you can feel, taste, see,smell or hear that rope anchoring you to home, you aren't lost.     Three miles isn't good enough. We don't have enough fuel to changesites that often. You can't use the drive in a gravitational field, youknow.     What else can we do, Captain? Nagurski asked puzzledly.     You've said that the spaceship is our only protection fromtransphasia. Is that it?     Quade gave a curt nod.     Then, I told them, we will have to start tearing apart this ship.   <doc-sep> There they are! Nagurski called. Quade's footsteps again, justbeyond that rocky ridge.     The landscape was rich chocolate ice cream smothered with chocolatesyrup, caramel, peanuts and maple syrup, eaten while you smoked an old,mellow Havana. The footsteps were faint traces of whipped cream acrossthe dark, rich taste of the planet.     I splashed some wine from my drinking tube against the roof of my mouthto sharpen my taste. It brought out the footsteps sharper. It also madethe landscape more of a teen-ager's caloric nightmare.     The four of us pulled ourselves closer together by reeling in moreof our safety line. Farley and Hoffman, Nagurski and myself, we werecabled together. It gave us a larger hunk of reality to hold onto. Evenso, things wavered for me during a wisp of time.     We stumbled over the ridge, feeling out the territory. It was a stickyjob crawling over a melting, chunk-style Hershey bar. I was thankfulfor the invigorating Sousa march blasting inside my helmet. Before thetape had cut in, kicked on by the decibel gauge, I had heard or feltsomething dark and ominous in the outside air.     Yes, this is definitely the trail of Quail, Nagurski said soberly.This is serious business. I must ask whoever has been giggling onthis channel to shut up. Pardon me, Captain.      You     weren't giggling,sir?     I have never giggled in my life, Nagurski.     Yes, sir. That's what we all thought.     A moment later, Nagurski added, Anyway, I just noticed it was myshelf\u2014my, that is, self.     The basso profundo performing      Figaro     on my headset climbed to agirlish shriek. A sliver of ice. This was the call Quade and I hadfirst heard as we were about to troop over a cliff. I dug in my heels.     Take a good look around, boys, I said. What do you see?     Quail, Nagurski replied. That's what I see.     You, I said carefully, have been in space a      long     time. Look again.     I see our old buddy, Quail.     I took another slosh of burgundy and peered up ahead. It      was     Quade. Aman in a spacesuit, faceplate in the dust, two hundred yards ahead.       Grudgingly I stepped forward, out of the shadow of the ridge.A hysterically screaming wind rocked me on my toes. We pushedon sluggishly to Quade's side, moving to the tempo of      Pomp andCircumstance     .     Farley lugged Quade over on his back and read his gauges.     The Quartermaster rose with grim deliberation, and hiccuped. Betterget him back to the spaceship fast. I've seen this kind of thingbefore with transphasia. His body cooled down because of the screamingwind\u2014psychosomatic reaction\u2014and his heating circuits compensated forthe cool flesh. The poor devil's got frostbite and heat prostration.  "

        "Query": "How does Quade's character develop throughout THE SPICY SOUND OF SUCCESS?",
        "Summary_1": "In the very beginning, Quade confronts the new captain in a challenging and harsh manner. Quade believes he knows everything better than the captain and neglects the least as he is a rookie. Quade goes out one on one with the captain to prove he was right about transphasia. When the two face it, Quade is trying to drag the captain towards transphasia, but has to follow the orders and return to the ship. He suggests to keep contact with the ship and run back the cable. His idea is declined and he recklessly goes out alone in a suit without the cable. There his senses are deceived and he is found lying in the dust and brought to the ship. Facing the aliens there, Quade approaches them and is beaten. He finds himself in an infirmary then and acknowledges his lack of judgement to the captain. He is demoted after and accepts this punishment. ",
        "Summary_2": "Quade first opposes Gavin\u2019s assumption that the alien race might be interfering with their exploration. Quade argues, from experience, aliens generally do not even recognize their existence. Disagreeing with Quade, Gavin asserts he is relying so much on tradition and experience that he is becoming careless. But Quade states that Gavin is an outsider. Tension is created between the two, and they decided to go and find out what lead to the blackout of the screen. Gavin expected to have Transphasia when they are outside of their spaceship, and explained to Gavin about it. When the spice passes the two, Quade gets curious, but he is stopped by Gavin. Later when he proposes an escape plan, it is refused by Gavin, which then leads to Quade going off alone, only bringing with him a suit and a cartographer unit. He is found, having frostbite and heat prostration, by Gavin and his rescue team.\n\nWhen the team and Quade came across aliens on their way back to the spaceship, Quade decides to show them that aliens cannot be harmful to them. However, he was wrong. After hitting Quade with its tail and injuring some others, the aliens finally left. In the infirmary, Quade is told that the aliens were trying to help, in their own ways, and when they realized that men can provide better help, they left. This makes Quade realize that he was a fool being so arrogant and blind. And he also learns that he has been demoted to Acting Executive Officer.  ",
        "Summary_3": "Throughout the story, Quade almost gets himself killed by the transphasia. He initially tries to propose a plan to Gavin, but the captain vehemently rejects it. After he is fed up with Captain Gavin, he decides to take the initiative and leave the spaceship to investigate on his own. He is confident in his own abilities, but this ends up getting him into trouble. Although he has a lot of experience, he admits that his arrogance and foolhardiness get him into trouble. The transphasia is a lot more dangerous than he initially assumes, and the Quartermaster even diagnoses him with frostbite and heat prostration when the team finds him. Later, he is able to recover in the infirmary.",
        "Summary_4": "Quade starts off the story by arguing with Captain Gavin. They decide to go out and explore the surface of the mysterious planet together. They make their way through the pyschadellic minefield of the planet, all the way down to a gorge, where they spot \"spice\". They decide to turn back at this moment, as the climb down would be too dangerous. Quade walks in on the conversation between Gavin and Nagurski, where he proposes an idea. He says that the only way to get through transphasia would be to keep in constant contact with the ship. all the men would be tied together on a line. Not long after this conversation, he decides to go out onto the terrain of the planet on his own, taking with him a suit and a cartographer unit. After a long time out in the terrain, he comes down with frostbite and heat prostration, and collapses on the ground. The crew find him and drag him back to base. When they see the aliens outside of the ship, Quade walks over to one to convince the men that they're docile. The alien begins to jump on him, flattening him, until the crew pull him away. He goes back to his bunk, where he and Gavin talk. Gavin demotes him, but they begin to become friends. ",

There was nothing showing on the video screen. That was why we werelooking at it so analytically.

This always means transphasia\u2014cortexdissolution, motor area feedback, the Aitchell Effect\u2014call it anythingyou like, it's still transphasia.     I know what transphasia is, I said moderately. It means anelectrogravitational disturbance of incoming sense data, rechannelingit to the wrong receptive areas. Besides the human brain, it alsoeffects electronic equipment, like radar and television.     Obviously. Quade glanced disgustedly at the screen.     Too obvious. This time it might not be a familiar condition of manyplanetary gravitational fields. On this planet, that blank kinescopemay mean our Big Brother kites were knocked down by hostile natives.     You are plain wrong, Captain. Traditionally, alien races neverinterfere with our explorations. Generally, they are so alien to usthey can't even recognize our existence.   <doc-sep> Looks okay to me, I said. Quade passed a gauntlet over his faceplate.It's real. I can blur it with a smudged visor. When it blurs, it'ssolid.     The landscape beyond the black corona left by our landing rockets wasunimpressive. The rocky desert was made up of silicon and iron oxide,so it looked much the same as a terrestrial location. Yellowish-whitesand ran up to and around reddish brown rock clawing into the pinksunlight.     I don't understand it, Quade admitted. Transphasia hits you a foulas soon as you let it into the airlock.     Apparently, Quade,      this     thing is going to creep up on us.     Don't sound smug, Captain. It's pitty-pattying behind you too.     The keening call across the surface of consciousness postponed my reply.     The wail was ominously forlorn, defiant of description. I turned myhead around slowly inside my helmet, not even sure that I had heard it.     But what else can you do with a wail but      hear     it?     Quade nodded. I've felt this before. It usually hits sooner. Let'strace it.     I don't like this, I admitted. It's not at all what I expected fromwhat you said about transphasia. It must be something else.     It couldn't be anything else. I know what to expect. You don't. Youmay begin smelling sensations, tasting sounds, hearing sights, seeingtastes, touching odors\u2014or any other combination. Don't let it botheryou.     Of course not. I'll soothe my nerves by counting little shocks oflanolin jumping over a loud fence.     Quade grinned behind his faceplate. Good idea.     Then you can have it. I'm going to try keeping my eyes open andstaying alive.     There was no reply.     His expression was tart and greasy despite all his light talk, andI knew mine was the same. I tested the security rope between ourpressure suits. It was a taut and virile bass.     We scaled a staccato of rocks, our suits grinding pepper against ourhides.     The musk summit rose before us, a minor-key horizon with a shiftingtreble for as far as I could smell. It was primitive beauty that madeyou feel shocking pink inside. The most beautiful vista I had evertasted, it couldn't be dulled even by the sensation of beef broth undermy skin.     Is this transphasia? I asked in awe.     It always has been before, Quade remarked. Ready to swallow yourwords about this being something an old hand wouldn't recognize,Captain?     I'm swallowing no words until I find out precisely how they tastehere.     Not a bad taste. They're pretty. Or haven't you noticed?     Quade, you're right! About the colors anyway. This reminds me of anilliscope recording from a cybernetic translator.     It should. I don't suppose we could understand each other if it wasn'tfor our morphistudy courses in reading cross-sense translations ofCentauri blushtalk and the like.     It became difficult to understand him, difficult to try talking in theface of such splendor. You never really appreciate colors until yousmell them for the first time.   <doc-sep> Feeling better? I asked Quade in the infirmary.     He punched up his pillow and settled back. I guess so. But when Ithink of all the ways I nearly got myself killed out there.... How farhave you got in the tractors?     I'm having the tractors torn down and the parts put back into thespaceship where they belong. We      shouldn't     risk losing them andgetting stuck here.     Are you settling for a primary exploration?     No. I think I had the right idea on your rescue party. You have tomeet and fight a planet on its own terms. Fighting confused sounds andtastes with music and wine was crude, but it was on the right track.Out there, we understood language because we were familiar with alienlanguages changed to other sense mediums by cybernetic translators.Using the translator, we can learn to recognize all confused data aseasily. I'm starting indoctrination courses.     I doubt that that is necessary, sir, Quade said. Experiencedspacemen are experienced with transphasia. You don't have to worry. Inthe future, I'll be able to resist sensations that tell me I'm freezingto death\u2014if my gauges tell me it's a lie.     I examined his bandisprayed hide. I think my way of gaining experienceis less painful and more efficient.     Quade squirmed. Yes, sir. One thing, sir\u2014I don't understand how yougot me away from those aliens.     The aliens were trying to help. They knew something was wrong and theywere prodding and probing. When the first tractor pulled up and the mengot out, they seemed to realize our own people could help us easierthan they could.     I am not quite convinced that those babies just meant to help us allthe time.     But they did! First, that call of theirs\u2014it wasn't to lead us intodanger, but to warn us of the cliff, the freezing wind. They saw wewere trying to find out things about their world, so they even offeredus one of their own kind to study. Unfortunately, he was too much forus. They didn't give us their top man, of course, only the villageidiot. It's just as well. We aren't allowed to dissect creatures thatfar up the intelligence scale.     But why should they want to help us? Quade demanded suspiciously.     I think it's like Nagurski's dog. The dog came to him when it wantedsomebody to own it, protect it, feed it, love it. These aliens      want     Earthmen to colonize the planet. We came here, you see, same as the dogcame to Nagurski.     Well, I've learned one thing from all of this, Quade said. I've beena blind, arrogant, cocksure fool, following courses that were good on      some     worlds,      most     worlds, but not good on      all     worlds. I'm nevergoing to be that foolhardy again.     But you're losing      confidence     , Quade! You aren't sure of yourself anymore. Isn't confidence a spaceman's most valuable asset?     The hell it is, Quade said grimly. It's his deadliest liability.     In that case, I must inform you that I am demoting you to ActingExecutive Officer.     Huh? Quade gawked. But dammit, Captain, you can't do that to me!I'll lose hazard pay and be that much further from retirement!     That's tough, I sympathized, but in every service a chap gets brokenin rank now and then.     Maybe it's worth it, Quade said heavily. Now maybe I've learned howto stay alive out here. I just hope I don't forget.     I thought about that. I was nearly through with my first mission andI could speak with experience, even if it was the least amount ofexperience aboard.     Quade, I said, space isn't as dangerous as all that. I clapped himon the shoulder fraternally. You worry too much!   "

    {
        "Query": "What role does cohesion play in THE SPICY SOUND OF SUCCESS?",
        "Summary_1": "Every conflict and dangerous mistake throughout the story was caused by the lack of unity among the characters. The confrontation between Gavin and Quade caused the two to go alone towards transphasia and put themselves in danger. Gavin's lack of desire to work on mutual trust with the crew caused their condemnation of his actions and disobedience during such ab dangerous mission. The mutual offenses and tense arguments between the captain and the crew turned the least to Quade's side. All of this led to Quade going out alone and approaching death, for what Gavin and the crew would blame the captain himself. The arguments between the captain and different members of the crew take a lot of time and the job is done unwillingly, making it not as productive as it could be. The final peace and cohesion, on the contrary, lead to saving Quade, dealing with the aliens and coming to an understanding. ",
        "Summary_2": "Firstly, Gavin and Quade dispute over transphasia; not much was accomplished during their trip outside to prove their theories correct. Later, Gavin and Nagurski demonstrate their different opinions on the way of being captains. Clearly, they weren\u2019t content and only believed that they are correct. It was only until Gavin forms the rescue team, do they manage to achieve something. They are able to find Quade, who went off alone. Later, they see aliens. It is interesting to note that even the aliens are able to work as a team, forming a circle to enclose the rescue team and prevent them from escaping. In the end, Quade realizes that he has been arrogant and acted like a fool.",
        "Summary_3": "The significance of cohesion is that it brings together the entire crew. Initially, all of the characters are very disconnected from each other, and there is no teamwork on the spaceship. Instead, there are only conflicts, whether between Gavin and Quade or even Nagurski and Gavin. When they form a rescue team for Quade and initiate the plan, there is finally a sense of unity between the characters. The cohesion is significant because it provides Gavin with positive character development. As it played an important factor in his first mission, it also became an opportunity for him to learn how to be a better captain for the future.",
        "Summary_4": "Cohesion is perhaps the most important underlying theme of the story. At first, Captain Gavin is opposed to cohesion. He believes that he shouldn't trust anyone. He doesn't need the crew to like him, and he is completely fine separating himself emotionally from the rest of the men. Gavin and Quade are not a cohesive pair at the beginning of the story. They argue and try to pull rank on one another, both from intellect and experience. Nagurski explains why cohesion is so important, using his dog as a metaphor, you must win the respect and love of your crew so THEY choose YOU. The crew decide to work as a cohesive unit, working together to save Quade. It is the first time that the Captain can be seen actually working with the team, and not just giving them orders. They enter onto the planet's surface together, working as a team to save their comrade. It is only through cohesion that they overcome the transphasia, and save Quade. This is why cohesion is so significant in this story. ",

You are plain wrong, Captain. Traditionally, alien races neverinterfere with our explorations. Generally, they are so alien to usthey can't even recognize our existence.   <doc-sep> Most of the cousins gasped as the truth began to percolate through.     I knew from the very beginning, Conrad finished, that I didn'thave to do anything at all. I just had to wait and you would destroyyourselves.     I don't understand, Bartholomew protested, searching the faces of thecousins closest to him. What does he mean, we have never existed?We're here, aren't we? What\u2014     Shut up! Raymond snapped. He turned on Martin. You don't seemsurprised.     The old man grinned. I'm not. I figured it all out years ago.     At first, he had wondered what he should do. Would it be better tothrow them into a futile panic by telling them or to do nothing? Hehad decided on the latter; that was the role they had assigned him\u2014towatch and wait and keep out of things\u2014and that was the role he wouldplay.     You knew all the time and you didn't tell us! Raymond spluttered.After we'd been so good to you, making a gentleman out of you insteadof a criminal.... That's right, he snarled, a criminal! An alcoholic,a thief, a derelict! How do you like that?     Sounds like a rich, full life, Martin said wistfully.     What an exciting existence they must have done him out of! But then, hecouldn't help thinking, he\u2014he and Conrad together, of course\u2014had donethem out of      any     kind of existence. It wasn't his responsibility,though; he had done nothing but let matters take whatever course wasdestined for them. If only he could be sure that it was the bettercourse, perhaps he wouldn't feel that nagging sense of guilt insidehim. Strange\u2014where, in his hermetic life, could he possibly havedeveloped such a queer thing as a conscience?     Then we've wasted all this time, Ninian sobbed, all this energy, allthis money, for nothing!     But you were nothing to begin with, Martin told them. And then,after a pause, he added, I only wish I could be sure there had beensome purpose to this.     He didn't know whether it was approaching death that dimmed his sight,or whether the frightened crowd that pressed around him was growingshadowy.     I wish I could feel that some good had been done in letting you bewiped out of existence, he went on voicing his thoughts. But I knowthat the same thing that happened to your worlds and my world willhappen all over again. To other people, in other times, but again. It'sbound to happen. There isn't any hope for humanity.     One man couldn't really change the course of human history, he toldhimself. Two men, that was\u2014one real, one a shadow.     Conrad came close to the old man's bed. He was almost transparent.     No, he said, there is hope. They didn't know the time transmitterworks two ways. I used it for going into the past only once\u2014just thisonce. But I've gone into the future with it many times. And\u2014 hepressed Martin's hand\u2014believe me, what I did\u2014what      we     did, you andI\u2014serves a purpose. It will change things for the better. Everythingis going to be all right.   <doc-sep> Joe was still dazed by that monetary vista when he and Harvey carriedthe case of medicine to the saloon. The mayor had already cleared aplace of honor in the cluttered back room, where he told them to put itdown carefully. Then he took the elaborate bottle-opener Harvey gavehim, reverently uncorked a bottle and sampled it. It must have been atleast as good as the first; he gagged.     That's the stuff, all right, he said, swallowing hard. He countedout the money into Harvey's hand, at a moderate rate that precariouslybalanced between his pleasure at getting the fever remedy and his painat paying for it. Then he glanced out to see the position of Jupiter,and asked: You gents eaten yet? The restaurant's open now.     Harvey and Joe looked at each other. They hadn't been thinking aboutfood at all, but suddenly they realized that they were hungry.     It's only water we were short of, Harvey said apprehensively. We'vegot rations back at the ship.           H-mph!      the mayor grunted. Powdered concentrates. Compressed pap.Suit yourselves. We treat our stomachs better here. And you're welcometo our hospitality.     Your hospitality, said Harvey, depends on the prices you charge.     Well, if that's what's worrying you, you can stop worrying, answeredthe mayor promptly. What's more, the kind of dinner I serve here youcan't get anywhere else for any price.     Swiftly, Harvey conned the possibilities of being bilked again. He sawnone.     Let's take a look at the menu, anyhow, Joe, he said guardedly.     Johnson immediately fell into the role of mine host.     Come right in, gents, he invited. Right into the dining room.     He seated them at a table, which a rope tied between posts made more orless private, though nobody else was in the saloon and there was littlechance of company.     Genius, the six-armed native, appeared from the dingy kitchen withtwo menus in one hand, two glasses of water in another, plus napkins,silverware, a pitcher, plates, saucers, cups, and their cocktails,which were on the house. Then he stood by for orders.     Harvey and Joe studied the menu critically. The prices werephenomenally low. When they glanced up at Johnson in perplexity, hegrinned, bowed and asked: Everything satisfactory, gents?     Quite, said Harvey. We shall order.     For an hour they were served amazing dishes, both fresh and canned, theculinary wealth of this planetoid and all the system. And the servicewas as extraordinary as the meal itself. With four hands, Genius playeddeftly upon a pair of mellow Venusian      viotars     , using his other twohands for waiting on the table.     We absolutely must purchase this incredible specimen, Harveywhispered excitedly when Johnson and the native were both in thekitchen, attending to the next course. He would make any societyhostess's season a riotous success, which should be worth a great sumto women like Mrs. van Schuyler-Morgan, merely for his hire.     Think of a fast one fast, Joe agreed. You're right.     But I dislike having to revise my opinion of a man so often,complained Harvey. I wish Johnson would stay either swindler or honestmerchant. This dinner is worth as least twenty buckos, yet I estimateour check at a mere bucko twenty redsents.     The mayor's appearance prevented them from continuing the discussion.     It's been a great honor, gents, he said. Ain't often I havevisitors, and I like the best, like you two gents.     As if on cue, Genius came out and put the check down between Joe andHarvey. Harvey picked it up negligently, but his casual air vanished ina yelp of horror.     What the devil is this? he shouted.\u2014How do you arrive at thisfantastic, idiotic figure\u2014      three hundred and twenty-eight buckos     !  "

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in END AS A HERO?",
        "Summary_1": "Peter Granthan, a psychodynamicist, wakes up severely injured on a lifeboat after his spaceship \"Belshazzar\" has been mysteriously destroyed. He has no recollection of what has happened to him. He thinks to himself he must have been the first ever survivor to come into contact with a \"Gool\", a fierce alien race who infiltrate and control people's minds. He makes a call to TSA headquarters back on Earth, who control the mission from the ground. On the other end is Ausar Kayle. Kayle asks Granthan what happened to the rest of the crew. Granthan relays how he got out. Kayle thinks that Granthan may be under the control of the Gool, and he may be the one who inadvertently caused the destruction of the ship. Kayle orders Granthan to stay in Orbit around Earth. Granthan knows that if he stays in orbit, there is sure to be a fleet of missiles on their way towards him. He decides to enter his own mind, in search of a Gool spy that may be tampering with it. He dives deep into his sub conscious. He looks into his memory, where he finds a Gool. He sees how it controlled him as he unknowingly made his way onto the lifeboat, escaping the burning ship. \nHe follows the Gool, studying how it infiltrates minds and controls them as it goes. He reaches out to the Gool, infiltrating it's mind. Granthan takes control of the Gool's mind, inside of his own. He see's the Gool's home world. In it he finds the secret to Matter across space. \nHe calls Kayle, explaining the information he has just found. Kayle doesn't believe Granthan, still thinking he is being controlled by the Gool. Granthan plans his course of re-entry. Now knowing the secret to the Gool's mind control, he uses the technique to convince various stations on Earth to allow him to land, and not raise suspicion. He eventually lands in the ocean, some distance outside Key West. \nKayle realises Granthan has landed, and he readies the missiles. Granthan finds the man's mind who controls the missiles, enters it, and forces him to hit the self destruct button. He infiltrates a fisherman's mind, convincing him to take him to shore, while bombs are being dropped around them. He then gets a driver to take him to a rail yard.  \nWhen he arrives at a train yard, he lays down to rest in the empty box car where he just fought a guard. While the train is stopped, he convinces a man to buy him food and water. \nThe train is headed for New Orleans, and his plan is to raid the Delta National Labs. He arrives before dawn, and crawls out of the car.He gets a man to drive him into town, where he buys new clothes and hails a cab, who takes him to the Laboratories. They arrive, Granthan gets out of the car. The taxi driver drives away. ",
        "Summary_2": "Granthan is a psychodynamicist on a mission to end Earth's war with the Gool, a species tribe with the goal to spread an empire throughout the galaxy through tactics of mind control. Granthan awakes on a lifeboat, in immense pain and terrible condition. He presumably came in contact with the Gool and ended up alive, though scathed. However, he has no recollection of what happened or how he managed to escape on the lifeboat. Granthan decides to call TSA headquarters, informing Col. Kayle that he is alive. Kayle is skeptical, aware of the Gool's ability to mind control, and believes that Granthan has been brainwashed due to his inability to recall the events. Kayle decides that he cannot risk a potentially sabotaged Granthan returning to Earth, and Granthan realizes that he is going to be executed. Urgently in need of a solution, Granthan remembers his training before the mission, how he had learned how to access his subconscious to obtain memories. He decides to do so, going back and seeing his mind being probed by the Gool and controlling his actions. Upon seeing how the Gool had taken control of his mind, Granthan realizes that he, too, can replicate the practice, and he probes the mind of a Gool. When he probes the Gool, he finds that they plan to take over the galaxy through matter transmission. Granthan calls Kayle again, explaining what he has seen and begging for him to change his mind. However, Kayle still refuses to let Granthan return. Granthan then decides to take matters into his own hands, using his mind control techniques to make officers allow him through and shut off radar detection. As Granthan lands on the ocean's surface, he calls Kayle again in an effort to convince him. Instead, Kayle tells him it's too late, and General Titus appears through transmission to salute him before his execution. At the last second, though, Granthan uses his mind control on the man controlling the missiles, and detonates them, buying him time to take the escape capsule to shore. Granthan eventually ends up at a trainyard, fending off an attacker before sneaking onto a train car. As the train stops near a store, he overtakes the train conductor and walks in, buying food and water for himself. At dawn, he exits the train car and gets a lift from a driver on the road, asking him to take him to Delta National Laboratories. ",
        "Summary_3": "Peter Granthan is a psychodynamics who was assigned by Colonel Ausar Kayle, an Aerospace Intelligence officer, to go on the Belshazzar to investigate the possibility of hyper-cortical invasion. According to Granthan, they\u2019ve found the Gool, but something has happened to them that the Belshazzar was sabotaged and only Granthan survives this devastation. And the story begins with Granthan in some kind of dream where he is badly burned and really hurt, except, this was not simply a dream. He wakes up realizing that his right leg is broken, his skull is probably fractured, and his left arm was badly burned. Surprisingly, those injuries have been taken care of. There is a walking brace on his leg, stiches on his head, arm is wrapped to the shoulder; to add onto that, he somehow got himself onto a lifeboat. Granthan has no idea how he might be capable of doing any of those given his conditions. \n\nHe quickly contacted Kayle and told him about the disaster, but Kayle is suspicious of the reasons that he is the only survivor. The Gool is known to have telehypnotic abilities that can control men without them being aware of it, thus Granthan\u2019s blackout during the attack seems to be fitting. Kayle refuses to land Granthan on Earth. Granthan decides to figure out what actually happened to him during the blackout. Since he is a psychodynamicist, he can gather the memories of his subconscious and see what has occurred. Going multiple levels deeper within the memory, he finally finds the Gool. He watches the Gool take over his body and his mind, he sees how the Gool managed to get him onto the lifeboat, and he sees how the Gool is able to withdraw from the mind, leaving no marks behind. Then, he learns the way that the Gool controls the mind, which allows him to acknowledge the plan that the Gool has \u2013 to spread out across the galaxy and beyond. Finally, he learns their secret, matter transmission.\n\nAfter grasping the idea of sending matter across space, Granthan tells Kayle that he can build it. Kayle rejects the idea despite Granthan\u2019s effort to explain his training on encephaloscope. Granthan then uses the Gool\u2019s ability that he has just gained to pass the outer defense line, to disappear off the radar, and to avoid the missiles, etc. He is able to get to a train for some sleep, and later he gets off near the New Orleans, where he changed his clothes and goes to Delta National Laboratories. With the ability to control people\u2019s mind, Granthan seems to be able to do things as he wish. ",
        "Summary_4": "The story begins with Granthan waking up on a couch. He recognizes his left arm is heavily injured and the rest of his body is not faring much better either. He ponders whether he is the first survivor of contacting the Gool and even more if he is even alive. He musters his strength to get a call to TSA headquarters where Ausar Kayle answers the emergency call. Kayle accuses Granthan of being mind-controlled by the Gool and Granthan excitedly states that he is not. Nevertheless, Kayle instructs Granthan to go to a waiting post in orbit. Granthan knows that he is to do this so he can be killed. He does not want to go through with that and so he thinks about alternatives to help himself.\n\nGranthan begins to use his training to try to deduce whether he is being controlled by the Gool. He breaks through a hallucinatory third level during this process of discovery. Granthan is seemingly able to successfully enter a Gool\u2019s mind. In the process, he learns more about how they live, where their young reside, and their goals. Granthan believes that he was able to successfully spy on the Gool and that he can safely return to Earth to relay what he has learned. He believes that their ultimate secret is matter across space. Granthan tells Kayle what he has learned and is dismayed that Kayle still refuses to allow him to return to Earth. Kayle is still not convinced and doesn\u2019t trust him. \n\nGranthan decides to use his newfound mind-control technique to get back to Earth by getting his ship cleared to return by an unwitting officer. He heads towards Earth. He lands on the water and contacts Kayle again to convince him. Kayle still does not relent. Granthan continues to insist that he is not a spy, but Kayle does not budge. Granthan begins to use mind control to his advantage to keep himself safe while back on Earth. He is still heavily injured and has trouble keeping himself awake. It is evident that he is learning how to better use the mind control capabilities through his practice on others. Eventually, Granthan ends up at Delta National Laboratories after convincing a cab driver to take him there. \n",

I thought I'd give you a lift.     As Joe dressed, he searched his mind and tried to find some difference.     During the treatment, he had been unconscious or drugged, unable tothink. Now he could think clearly, but he could find no difference inhimself.     He felt more relaxed than he'd ever felt before, but that could be anafter-effect of all the sedatives he'd been given. And, he noticed whenhe looked in the mirror, he was paler. The treatment had taken monthsand he had, between operations, been locked in his room.     Hendricks was standing by the window. Joe stared at the massive back.Deliberately goading his mind, he discovered the biggest change:Before, the mere sight of the man had aroused an intense hatred. Now,even when he tried, he succeeded in arousing only a mild hatred.They had toned down his capacity to hate, but not done away with italtogether.     Come here and take a look at your public, said Hendricks.     Joe went to the window.

He'd waited a long time for this day.But now\u2014another change in him\u2014     He put the emotion into words: I don't feel like a hero. Funny, but Idon't.     Hero! Hendricks laughed and, with his powerful lungs, it soundedlike a bull snorting. You think a successful criminal is a hero?

        "Query": "What is the reason for Kayle's refusal to let Granthan return to Earth in END AS A HERO?",
        "Summary_1": "Kayle does not allow Granthan to re-enter Earth because he has a suspicion that Granthan might be under the control of the Gool. When Grantahn escaped the burning Belshazzar, he blacked out. He has no recollection of the incident. Granthan can also offer no explanation to Kayle as to why the ship was destroyed, or what happened to the rest of his crew. It is mysterious that Granthan was able to escape, especially while being so badly injured. Kayle believes that the Gool might have been the one to infiltrate Granthan's mind, and sabotage the mission, saving Granthan's life so he could return as a host to Earth. This would then allow the Gool to have a spy on Earth during the ongoing war. Even when Granthan tries to explain to Kayle that he has broken into a Gool's mind, and found data that would win them the war, Kayle is not convinced. He believes that the Gool will try anything to allow it's host to land. Kayle readies the missiles in the direction of Granthan's ship. While it is obvious that Kayle likes Granthan, and feels deep sympathy for him, he cannot take the risk of letting a Gool onto planet Earth. Even when Granthan manages to get past initial security on his descent, Kayle orders Granthan to stop. When Granthan lands on Earth, Kayle sends missiles to his location to take him out. Kayle can't let Granthan free on planet Earth, the risk would be too big in the war between mankind and the Gools. ",
        "Summary_2": "Kayle does not allow Granathan to re-enter Earth because he sees it as too much of a risk. He knows that Granthan came in contact with the Gool on his mission, and he is aware that the Gool have mind-controlling and hypnotic powers; when Granthan calls Kayle but is unable to remember the events that occurred, Kayle is sure that he has fallen victim to the Gool's tactics. If Granthan was potentially brainwashed or being controlled, he could risk sabotaging Earth from the inside, so Kayle decides that it is not worth the danger.",
        "Summary_3": "Kayle learns that the Gool may have the ability to somehow telehypnotically control a man\u2019s mind without the man knowing it. And Granthan has told Kayle that he has experienced a period of blackout during the disaster, including not knowing how he ended up on the lifeboat. Moreover, since Granthan is the only one that is left alive after coming in contact with the Gool; no one has survived before. Thus, Kayle assumes that there is a risk of the Gool using the telehypnotical ability on Granthan, which means that Gool can still be in control of Granthan, as well as control him even if he is back on Earth. Since they are at war with the Gool, it seems reasonable, from what he knows, for Kayle to refuse Granthan to re-enter Earth. \n\nWhen Granthan tries to explain matter transmission to Kayle, Kayle states that he does not understand the jargons that he is using, and refuses him again. After Granthan breaks through the planetary defenses, he got in contact with Kayle again. Kayle says that it is too late even if he do want to believe him. ",
        "Summary_4": "Kayle believes that Granthan is being mind-controlled by the Gool and does not want to risk him returning to Earth and decimating them. He cannot trust that Granthan is acting of his own volition and would rather be safe. The Gool are known to use telehypontic abilities to control others without them knowing. Kayle does not want to risk Earth being experiencing hyper-cortical invasion, which would be a possibility if Granthan returned to Earth and was in fact being controlled. Based on the risk, Kayle orders Granthan not to return to Earth. ",
        "Article": "I came out of it clear-headed but weak. My right leg was numb, butreasonably comfortable, clamped tight in a walking brace. I put upa hand and felt a shaved skull, with sutures. It must have been afracture. The left arm\u2014well, it was still there, wrapped to theshoulder and held out stiffly by a power truss that would keep the scartissue from pulling up and crippling me. The steady pressure as thetruss contracted wasn't anything to do a sense-tape on for replaying atleisure moments, but at least the cabinet hadn't amputated. I wasn'tcomplaining.     As far as I knew, I was the first recorded survivor of contact with theGool\u2014if I survived.     I was still a long way from home, and I hadn't yet checked on thecondition of the lifeboat. I glanced toward the entry port. It wasdogged shut. I could see black marks where my burned hand had been atwork.     I fumbled my way into a couch and tried to think. In my condition\u2014witha broken leg and third-degree burns, plus a fractured skull\u2014Ishouldn't have been able to fall out of bed, much less make the tripfrom      Belshazzar's     CCC to the boat; and how had I managed to dog thatport shut? In an emergency a man was capable of great exertions. Butrunning on a broken femur, handling heavy levers with charred fingersand thinking with a cracked head were overdoing it. Still, I washere\u2014and it was time to get a call through to TSA headquarters.     I flipped the switch and gave the emergency call-letters Col. AusarKayle of Aerospace Intelligence had assigned to me a few weeks before.It was almost five minutes before the acknowledge came through fromthe Ganymede relay station, another ten minutes before Kayle's faceswam into view. Even through the blur of the screen I could see thehaggard look.     Granthan! he burst out. Where are the others? What happened outthere? I turned him down to a mutter.     Hold on, I said. I'll tell you. Recorders going? I didn't wait foran answer\u2014not with a fifteen-minute transmission lag. I plowed on:           Belshazzar     was sabotaged. So was      Gilgamesh     \u2014I think. I got out. Ilost a little skin, but the aid cabinet has the case in hand. Tell theMed people the drinks are on me.     I finished talking and flopped back, waiting for Kayle's reply. On thescreen, his flickering image gazed back impatiently, looking as hostileas a swing-shift ward nurse. It would be half an hour before I wouldget his reaction to my report. I dozed off\u2014and awoke with a start.Kayle was talking.     \u2014your report. I won't mince words. They're wondering at your role inthe disaster. How does it happen that you alone survived?     How the hell do I know? I yelled\u2014or croaked. But Kayle's voice wasdroning on:     ... you Psychodynamics people have been telling me the Gool mayhave some kind of long-range telehypnotic ability that might make itpossible for them to subvert a loyal man without his knowledge. You'vetold me yourself that you blacked out during the attack\u2014and came to onthe lifeboat, with no recollection of how you got there.     This is war, Granthan. War against a vicious enemy who strike withoutwarning and without mercy. You were sent out to investigate thepossibility of\u2014what's that term you use?\u2014hyper-cortical invasion. Youknow better than most the risk I'd be running if you were allowed topass the patrol line.     I'm sorry, Granthan. I can't let you land on Earth. I can't acceptthe risk.     What do I do now? I stormed. Go into orbit and eat pills and hopeyou think of something? I need a doctor!     Presently Kayle replied. Yes, he said. You'll have to enter aparking orbit. Perhaps there will be developments soon which will makeit possible to ... ah ... restudy the situation. He didn't meet myeye. I knew what he was thinking. He'd spare me the mental anguish ofknowing what was coming. I couldn't really blame him; he was doingwhat he thought was the right thing. And I'd have to go along andpretend\u2014right up until the warheads struck\u2014that I didn't know I'dbeen condemned to death.      II     I tried to gather my wits and think my way through the situation. Iwas alone and injured, aboard a lifeboat that would be the focus of aconverging flight of missiles as soon as I approached within batteryrange of Earth. I had gotten clear of the Gool, but I wouldn't survivemy next meeting with my own kind. They couldn't take the chance that Iwas acting under Gool orders.     I wasn't, of course. I was still the same Peter Granthan,psychodynamicist, who had started out with Dayan's fleet six weeksearlier. The thoughts I was having weren't brilliant, but they weremine, all mine....     But how could I be sure of that?     Maybe there was something in Kayle's suspicion. If the Gool were asskillful as we thought, they would have left no overt indications oftheir tampering\u2014not at a conscious level.     But this was where psychodynamics training came in. I had been reactinglike any scared casualty, aching to get home and lick his wounds. But Iwasn't just any casualty. I had been trained in the subtleties of themind\u2014and I had been prepared for just such an attack.     Now was the time to make use of that training. It had given me oneresource. I could unlock the memories of my subconscious\u2014and see againwhat had happened.     I lay back, cleared my mind of extraneous thoughts, and concentrated onthe trigger word that would key an auto-hypnotic sequence....     Sense impressions faded. I was alone in the nebulous emptiness of afirst-level trance. I keyed a second word, slipped below the mistysurface into a dreamworld of vague phantasmagoric figures milling intheir limbo of sub-conceptualization. I penetrated deeper, brokethrough into the vividly hallucinatory third level, where images ofmirror-bright immediacy clamored for attention. And deeper....   <doc-sep> You've got to listen to me, Kayle, I shouted. I know you think I'ma Gool robot. But what I have is too big to let you blow it up withouta fight. Matter transmission! You know what that can mean to us. Theconcept is too complex to try to describe in words. You'll have to takemy word for it. I can build it, though, using standard components, plusan infinite-area antenna and a moebius-wound coil\u2014and a few otherthings....     I harangued Kayle for a while, and then sweated out his answer. I wasgetting close now. If he couldn't see the beauty of my proposal, myscreens would start to register the radiation of warheads any time now.     Kayle came back\u2014and his answer boiled down to no.     I tried to reason with him. I reminded him how I had readied myselffor the trip with sessions on the encephaloscope, setting up thecross-networks of conditioned defensive responses, the shunt circuitsto the decoy pseudo-personality, leaving my volitional ego free. Italked about subliminal hypnotics and the resilience quotient of theego-complex.     I might have saved my breath.     I don't understand that psychodynamics jargon, Granthan, he snapped.It smacks of mysticism. But I understand what the Gool have done toyou well enough. I'm sorry.     I leaned back and chewed the inside of my lip and thought unkindthoughts about Colonel Ausar Kayle. Then I settled down to solve theproblem at hand.     I keyed the chart file, flashed pages from the standard index on thereference screen, checking radar coverages, beacon ranges, monitorstations, controller fields. It looked as though a radar-negative boatthe size of mine might possibly get through the defensive net with adaring pilot, and as a condemned spy, I could afford to be daring.     And I had a few ideas.      III     The shrilling of the proximity alarm blasted through the silence. For awild moment I thought Kayle had beaten me to the punch; then I realizedit was the routine DEW line patrol contact.     Z four-oh-two, I am reading your IFF. Decelerate at 1.8 geepreparatory to picking up approach orbit....     The screen went on droning out instructions. I fed them into theautopilot, at the same time running over my approach plan. The scoutwas moving in closer. I licked dry lips. It was time to try.     I closed my eyes, reached out\u2014as the Gool mind had reached out tome\u2014and felt the touch of a Signals Officer's mind, forty thousandmiles distant, aboard the patrol vessel. There was a brief flurry ofstruggle; then I dictated my instructions. The Signals Officer punchedkeys, spoke into his microphone:     As you were, Z four-oh-two. Continue on present course. At Oh-nineteenseconds, pick up planetary for re-entry and let-down.     I blanked out the man's recollection of what had happened, caught hisbelated puzzlement as I broke contact. But I was clear of the DEW linenow, rapidly approaching atmosphere.     Z four-oh-two, the speaker crackled. This is planetary control. I ampicking you up on channel forty-three, for re-entry and let-down.     There was a long pause. Then:     Z four-oh-two, countermand DEW Line clearance! Repeat, clearancecountermanded! Emergency course change to standard hyperbolic codeninety-eight. Do not attempt re-entry. Repeat: do not attempt re-entry!     It hadn't taken Kayle long to see that I'd gotten past the outer lineof defense. A few more minutes' grace would have helped. I'd play itdumb, and hope for a little luck.     Planetary, Z four-oh-two here. Say, I'm afraid I missed part of that,fellows. I'm a little banged up\u2014I guess I switched frequencies on you.What was that after 'pick up channel forty-three'...?     Four-oh-two, sheer off there! You're not cleared for re-entry!     Hey, you birds are mixed up, I protested. I'm cleared all the way. Ichecked in with DEW\u2014     It was time to disappear. I blanked off all transmission, hit thecontrols, following my evasive pattern. And again I reached out\u2014     A radar man at a site in the Pacific, fifteen thousand miles away, rosefrom his chair, crossed the darkened room and threw a switch. The radarscreens blanked off....     For an hour I rode the long orbit down, fending off attack afterattack. Then I was clear, skimming the surface of the ocean a few milessoutheast of Key West. The boat hit hard. I felt the floor rise up,over, buffeting me against the restraining harness.     I hauled at the release lever, felt a long moment of giddydisorientation as the escape capsule separated from the sinkinglifeboat deep under the surface. Then my escape capsule was bobbing onthe water.     I would have to risk calling Kayle now\u2014but by voluntarily giving myposition away, I should convince him I was still on our side\u2014and I wasbadly in need of a pick-up. I flipped the sending key.     This is Z four-oh-two, I said. I have an urgent report for ColonelKayle of Aerospace Intelligence.     Kayle's face appeared. Don't fight it, Granthan, he croaked. Youpenetrated the planetary defenses\u2014God knows how. I\u2014     Later, I snapped. How about calling off your dogs now? And sendsomebody out here to pick me up, before I add sea-sickness to my othercomplaints.     We have you pinpointed, Kayle cut in. It's no use fighting it,Granthan.   <doc-sep> I felt cold sweat pop out on my forehead. You've got to listen,Kayle, I shouted. I suppose you've got missiles on the way already.Call them back! I have information that can win the war\u2014     I'm sorry, Granthan, Kayle said. It's too late\u2014even if I couldtake the chance you were right.     A different face appeared on the screen.     Mr. Granthan, I am General Titus. On behalf of your country, andin the name of the President\u2014who has been apprised of this tragicsituation\u2014it is my privilege to inform you that you will be awardedthe Congressional Medal of Honor\u2014posthumously\u2014for your heroic effort.Although you failed, and have in fact been forced, against your will,to carry out the schemes of the inhuman enemy, this in no way detractsfrom your gallant attempt. Mr. Granthan, I salute you.     The general's arm went up in a rigid gesture.     Stow that, you pompous idiot! I barked. I'm no spy!     Kayle was back, blanking out the startled face of the general.     Goodbye, Granthan. Try to understand....     I flipped the switch, sat gripping the couch, my stomach rising witheach heave of the floating escape capsule. I had perhaps five minutes.The missiles would be from Canaveral.     I closed my eyes, forced myself to relax, reached out....     I sensed the distant shore, the hot buzz of human minds at work in thecities. I followed the coastline, found the Missile Base, flickedthrough the cluster of minds.     \u2014      missile on course; do right, baby. That's it, right in the slot.          I fingered my way through the man's mind and found the control centers.He turned stiffly from the plotting board, tottered to a panel to slamhis hand against the destruct button.     Men fell on him, dragged him back. \u2014      fool, why did you blow it?          I dropped the contact, found another, who leaped to the panel,detonated the remainder of the flight of six missiles. Then I withdrew.I would have a few minutes' stay of execution now.     I was ten miles from shore. The capsule had its own power plant. Istarted it up, switched on the external viewer. I saw dark sea, theglint of star-light on the choppy surface, in the distance a glow onthe horizon that would be Key West. I plugged the course into thepilot, then leaned back and felt outward with my mind for the nextattacker.      IV     It was dark in the trainyard. I moved along the tracks in a stumblingwalk. Just a few more minutes, I was telling myself.      A few moreminutes and you can lie down ... rest....       The shadowed bulk of a box car loomed up, its open door a blackersquare. I leaned against the sill, breathing hard, then reached insidefor a grip with my good hand.     Gravel scrunched nearby. The beam of a flashlight lanced out, slippedalong the weathered car, caught me. There was a startled exclamation.I ducked back, closed my eyes, felt out for his mind. There was aconfused murmur of thought, a random intrusion of impressions from thecity all around. It was hard, too hard. I had to sleep\u2014     I heard the snick of a revolver being cocked, and dropped flat as agout of flame stabbed toward me, the imperative Bam! echoing betweenthe cars. I caught the clear thought:     God-awful looking, shaved head, arm stuck out; him all right\u2014     I reached out to his mind and struck at random. The light fell, wentout, and I heard the unconscious body slam to the ground like a poledsteer.     It was easy\u2014if I could only stay awake.     I gritted my teeth, pulled myself into the car, crawled to a darkcorner behind a crate and slumped down. I tried to evoke a personalityfraction to set as a guard, a part of my mind to stay awake and warnme of danger. It was too much trouble. I relaxed and let it all slidedown into darkness.  "

        "Query": "How does Granthan utilize the Gool's mind control technique to his benefit and gain knowledge in END AS A HERO?",
        "Summary_1": "While searching his mind, Granthan finds a Gool, using this technique on him. He watches as the Gool traces out the pattern in his subconscious, studies and remembers it. He uses this new found skill to infiltrate the Gool's mind. In it he sees the Gool's home world, along with the rest of its colony, and a piece of theory that could win the war for Earth. When Granthan returns to the physical world to share the good news with Kayle, he is dismissed, and sentenced to death. Granthan flies onto Earth, reaches out with his mind, finding a Signal Officer. He convinces the officer to let him pass. He then infiltrates the mind of a radar man, forcing him to switch off the radar screens. When Kayle decides to send a fleet of missiles to Granthan's location in the pacific, Granthan reaches out with his mind, finds two men working in the control centre, and forces them to hit the self-destruct button on the bombs, saving his life. To escape his life boat, Granthan coerces a fisherman into taking him onboard, where they narrowly miss bombs being dropped on them. He then forces a driver to take him into town, convincing him that he was going to buy groceries. Granthan arrives at the train yard and uses his new power to defeat a guard who recognises Granthan, with a gun cocked towards him. While the train is stopped, he orders a man to buy him food, water and cigarettes, which the man delivers to him. When his train arrives in New Orleans, he forces a driver to take him into town, quickly diminishing his curiosity. When the cab driver arrives at the laboratories, Granthan finally convinces the man to drive around the field, leading to an open gate, where Granthan exits the car. ",
        "Summary_2": "Granthan initially tries to use his psychodynamic abilities to go back into his subconscious and find hidden memories of his interaction with the Gool. While in his subconscious, he is able to witness how the Gool probed his mind to control it. By seeing the techniques used by the Gool, Granthan is able to replicate it using his knowledge of psychodynamics, and through this, he probes the mind of the Gool and realizes that he has mastered the practice. Granthan uses this new ability to his advantage, particularly by mind controlling the officers that are ordered to prevent him from entering Earth and execute him. He also uses the ability through his escape route, controlling drivers, train conductors, and other passerby to help advance himself.",
        "Summary_3": "Granthan learns about the mind control techniques by going deeper into his subconscious mind and seeing the Gool withdrawing from him without his consciousness being aware of it. He realizes that he can do the same thing as the Gool. Then he decides to use the mind control to his own advantage by mind controlling people so that he can do things as he wish. \n\nFirstly, Granthan was able to use what he learned to spy on the Gool and learn about matter transmission. Later, he uses the mind control abilities during his escape. He first tries to control the Signal Officer to allow him to pass the outer line of defense. Then, he mind controls the radar man to make his radar disappear so that his location will not be exposed; he controls the  control center man, and he destroys one of the missiles; he prevents many attackers from attacking him while inside the capsule. Later on the train, he controls a man for food. Through practice, Granthan also discovers that the person being controlled can behave rationally once an impulse to act is given; there is no need for complete control over the person. At New Orleans, he controls a taxi driver to take him to the gate of Delta National Laboratories and makes him forget that he ever saw Granthan. ",
        "Summary_4": "Granthan learns how to use the Gool\u2019s mind control technique by watching them and utilizing their own methods. He has previous experience with psychodynamics that helps inform him on how to do so. He notices their patterns and tries to duplicate them. He essentially copies their techniques of probing into tiny planes of existence to reach a black pit where the Gool seem to exist. He does so seemingly successfully and is able to locate and control a Gool\u2019s mind, according to his own analysis. He uses it to learn more about Gool\u2019s and how they live. \n\nGranthan begins to use the mind control technique to allow people to do his bidding for him. He is able to reenter Earth by controlling an officer to grant him entry. He detonates the missiles that are launched to kill him through the same methods. He prevents himself from being attacked or potentially caught while at the train yard by again using mind control. He saves the life of himself and the fisherman helping him by destroying a cruiser\u2019s gunnery crew. He is able to get food for himself by mind-controlling a man to go and buy him goods at a store. He is able to hitch a ride on a truck by influencing the driver. \n",
        "Article": "Using the technique I had grasped from the Gool itself, I struck,stifling the outcry, invaded the fetid blackness and grappled theobscene gelatinous immensity of the Gool spy as it spasmed in a frenzyof xenophobia\u2014a ton of liver writhing at the bottom of a dark well.     I clamped down control. The Gool mind folded in on itself, gibbering.Not pausing to rest, I followed up, probed along my channel of contact,tracing patterns, scanning the flaccid Gool mind....     I saw a world of yellow seas lapping at endless shores of mud. Therewas a fuming pit, where liquid sulphur bubbled up from some innersource, filling an immense natural basin. The Gool clustered at itsrim, feeding, each monstrous shape heaving against its neighbors for amore favorable position.       I probed farther, saw the great cables of living nervous tissue thatlinked each eating organ with the brain-mass far underground. I tracedthe passages through which tendrils ran out to immense caverns wheresmaller creatures labored over strange devices. These, my host's memorytold me, were the young of the Gool. Here they built the fleets thatwould transport the spawn to the new worlds the Prime Overlord haddiscovered, worlds where food was free for the taking. Not sulphuralone, but potassium, calcium, iron and all the metals\u2014richesbeyond belief in endless profusion. No longer would the Gool tribecluster\u2014those who remained of a once-great race\u2014at a single feedingtrough. They would spread out across a galaxy\u2014and beyond.     But not if I could help it.     The Gool had evolved a plan\u2014but they'd had a stroke of bad luck.     In the past, they had managed to control a man here and there, amongthe fleets, far from home, but only at a superficial level. Enough,perhaps, to wreck a ship, but not the complete control needed to send aman back to Earth under Gool compulsion, to carry out complex sabotage.     Then they had found me, alone, a sole survivor, free from the clutterof the other mind-fields. It had been their misfortune to pick apsychodynamicist. Instead of gaining a patient slave, they had openedthe fortress door to an unseen spy. Now that I was there, I would seewhat I could steal.     A timeless time passed. I wandered among patterns of white light andwhite sound, plumbed the deepest recesses of hidden Gool thoughts,fared along strange ways examining the shapes and colors of theconcepts of an alien mind.     I paused at last, scanning a multi-ordinal structure of pattern withinpattern; the diagrammed circuits of a strange machine.     I followed through its logic-sequence; and, like a bomb-burst, itsmeaning exploded in my mind.     From the vile nest deep under the dark surface of the Gool world inits lonely trans-Plutonian orbit, I had plucked the ultimate secret oftheir kind.     Matter across space.   <doc-sep> I came out of it clear-headed but weak. My right leg was numb, butreasonably comfortable, clamped tight in a walking brace. I put upa hand and felt a shaved skull, with sutures. It must have been afracture. The left arm\u2014well, it was still there, wrapped to theshoulder and held out stiffly by a power truss that would keep the scartissue from pulling up and crippling me. The steady pressure as thetruss contracted wasn't anything to do a sense-tape on for replaying atleisure moments, but at least the cabinet hadn't amputated. I wasn'tcomplaining.     As far as I knew, I was the first recorded survivor of contact with theGool\u2014if I survived.     I was still a long way from home, and I hadn't yet checked on thecondition of the lifeboat. I glanced toward the entry port. It wasdogged shut. I could see black marks where my burned hand had been atwork.     I fumbled my way into a couch and tried to think. In my condition\u2014witha broken leg and third-degree burns, plus a fractured skull\u2014Ishouldn't have been able to fall out of bed, much less make the tripfrom      Belshazzar's     CCC to the boat; and how had I managed to dog thatport shut? In an emergency a man was capable of great exertions. Butrunning on a broken femur, handling heavy levers with charred fingersand thinking with a cracked head were overdoing it. Still, I washere\u2014and it was time to get a call through to TSA headquarters.     I flipped the switch and gave the emergency call-letters Col. AusarKayle of Aerospace Intelligence had assigned to me a few weeks before.It was almost five minutes before the acknowledge came through fromthe Ganymede relay station, another ten minutes before Kayle's faceswam into view. Even through the blur of the screen I could see thehaggard look.     Granthan! he burst out. Where are the others? What happened outthere? I turned him down to a mutter.     Hold on, I said. I'll tell you. Recorders going? I didn't wait foran answer\u2014not with a fifteen-minute transmission lag. I plowed on:           Belshazzar     was sabotaged. So was      Gilgamesh     \u2014I think. I got out. Ilost a little skin, but the aid cabinet has the case in hand. Tell theMed people the drinks are on me.     I finished talking and flopped back, waiting for Kayle's reply. On thescreen, his flickering image gazed back impatiently, looking as hostileas a swing-shift ward nurse. It would be half an hour before I wouldget his reaction to my report. I dozed off\u2014and awoke with a start.Kayle was talking.     \u2014your report. I won't mince words. They're wondering at your role inthe disaster. How does it happen that you alone survived?     How the hell do I know? I yelled\u2014or croaked. But Kayle's voice wasdroning on:     ... you Psychodynamics people have been telling me the Gool mayhave some kind of long-range telehypnotic ability that might make itpossible for them to subvert a loyal man without his knowledge. You'vetold me yourself that you blacked out during the attack\u2014and came to onthe lifeboat, with no recollection of how you got there.     This is war, Granthan. War against a vicious enemy who strike withoutwarning and without mercy. You were sent out to investigate thepossibility of\u2014what's that term you use?\u2014hyper-cortical invasion. Youknow better than most the risk I'd be running if you were allowed topass the patrol line.     I'm sorry, Granthan. I can't let you land on Earth. I can't acceptthe risk.     What do I do now? I stormed. Go into orbit and eat pills and hopeyou think of something? I need a doctor!     Presently Kayle replied. Yes, he said. You'll have to enter aparking orbit. Perhaps there will be developments soon which will makeit possible to ... ah ... restudy the situation. He didn't meet myeye. I knew what he was thinking. He'd spare me the mental anguish ofknowing what was coming. I couldn't really blame him; he was doingwhat he thought was the right thing. And I'd have to go along andpretend\u2014right up until the warheads struck\u2014that I didn't know I'dbeen condemned to death.      II     I tried to gather my wits and think my way through the situation. Iwas alone and injured, aboard a lifeboat that would be the focus of aconverging flight of missiles as soon as I approached within batteryrange of Earth. I had gotten clear of the Gool, but I wouldn't survivemy next meeting with my own kind. They couldn't take the chance that Iwas acting under Gool orders.     I wasn't, of course. I was still the same Peter Granthan,psychodynamicist, who had started out with Dayan's fleet six weeksearlier. The thoughts I was having weren't brilliant, but they weremine, all mine....     But how could I be sure of that?     Maybe there was something in Kayle's suspicion. If the Gool were asskillful as we thought, they would have left no overt indications oftheir tampering\u2014not at a conscious level.     But this was where psychodynamics training came in. I had been reactinglike any scared casualty, aching to get home and lick his wounds. But Iwasn't just any casualty. I had been trained in the subtleties of themind\u2014and I had been prepared for just such an attack.     Now was the time to make use of that training. It had given me oneresource. I could unlock the memories of my subconscious\u2014and see againwhat had happened.     I lay back, cleared my mind of extraneous thoughts, and concentrated onthe trigger word that would key an auto-hypnotic sequence....     Sense impressions faded. I was alone in the nebulous emptiness of afirst-level trance. I keyed a second word, slipped below the mistysurface into a dreamworld of vague phantasmagoric figures milling intheir limbo of sub-conceptualization. I penetrated deeper, brokethrough into the vividly hallucinatory third level, where images ofmirror-bright immediacy clamored for attention. And deeper....   <doc-sep> You've got to listen to me, Kayle, I shouted. I know you think I'ma Gool robot. But what I have is too big to let you blow it up withouta fight. Matter transmission! You know what that can mean to us. Theconcept is too complex to try to describe in words. You'll have to takemy word for it. I can build it, though, using standard components, plusan infinite-area antenna and a moebius-wound coil\u2014and a few otherthings....     I harangued Kayle for a while, and then sweated out his answer. I wasgetting close now. If he couldn't see the beauty of my proposal, myscreens would start to register the radiation of warheads any time now.     Kayle came back\u2014and his answer boiled down to no.     I tried to reason with him. I reminded him how I had readied myselffor the trip with sessions on the encephaloscope, setting up thecross-networks of conditioned defensive responses, the shunt circuitsto the decoy pseudo-personality, leaving my volitional ego free. Italked about subliminal hypnotics and the resilience quotient of theego-complex.     I might have saved my breath.     I don't understand that psychodynamics jargon, Granthan, he snapped.It smacks of mysticism. But I understand what the Gool have done toyou well enough. I'm sorry.     I leaned back and chewed the inside of my lip and thought unkindthoughts about Colonel Ausar Kayle. Then I settled down to solve theproblem at hand.     I keyed the chart file, flashed pages from the standard index on thereference screen, checking radar coverages, beacon ranges, monitorstations, controller fields. It looked as though a radar-negative boatthe size of mine might possibly get through the defensive net with adaring pilot, and as a condemned spy, I could afford to be daring.     And I had a few ideas.      III     The shrilling of the proximity alarm blasted through the silence. For awild moment I thought Kayle had beaten me to the punch; then I realizedit was the routine DEW line patrol contact.     Z four-oh-two, I am reading your IFF. Decelerate at 1.8 geepreparatory to picking up approach orbit....     The screen went on droning out instructions. I fed them into theautopilot, at the same time running over my approach plan. The scoutwas moving in closer. I licked dry lips. It was time to try.     I closed my eyes, reached out\u2014as the Gool mind had reached out tome\u2014and felt the touch of a Signals Officer's mind, forty thousandmiles distant, aboard the patrol vessel. There was a brief flurry ofstruggle; then I dictated my instructions. The Signals Officer punchedkeys, spoke into his microphone:     As you were, Z four-oh-two. Continue on present course.

        "Query": "Can you tell me where the story END AS A HERO takes place?",
        "Summary_1": "The setting of this story changes as the plot develops. When we first meet Peter Granthan, he is onboard a lifeboat, which is fleeing the now destroyed starship \"Belshazzar\". He travels within range of planet Earth, where, onboard the lifeboat, he dives into his mind. He enters the setting of his subconscious, which is stark and expansive. Granthan travels through the Gool's mind to its home world. It is described as being filled with yellow seas, reaching out to \"endless shores of mud\". There are great pits, rising with steam, in which the gools feed. Each cable underground connects to a massive brain, which controls the species. After Granthan's trip to the Alien planet, he lands on Earth, in the Pacific ocean, just outside of Key West. He then moves onto a train yard, where he boards a train. The train stops in a rural area, where, using a host, Granthan goes into a local shop to buy food. He travels to New  Orleans, where he arrives the next day. The area is swampy. He forces a driver to take him to a shappy, run down corner of the city, where he goes into a second hand clothes shop. Granthan then makes his way to the Delta National Laboratories, surrounded by a large field. He moves around the field in his taxi, before arriving at open gates to the Labs. ",
        "Summary_2": "The first part of the story takes place on Granthan's lifeboat, which contains a first aid cabinet, a couch, and an escape capsule with an energy plant. At the beginning of the story, Granthan is in space, on his way to Earth. He then ends up in the ocean, near Key West, where he leads his escape capsule to shore. Through the rest of the story, Granthan travels through many different settings, including a fishing camp, a trainyard, and a train car, before ending up at a clothing store and being driven to Delta National Laboratories. ",
        "Summary_3": "The story takes place in a seldom-used lifeboat where there are three couches in the room. There is a screen that allows connection from the Ganymede relay station to be seen in a fifteen-minute transmission lag. Then after Granthan \u00ac\u00ac\u00acgoes into the Gool itself where there are yellow seas with shores of mud, and there is also a fuming pit. He sees the cables of nervous tissue as well as young Gool. Later after Granthan breaks through the barrier, he gets to a trainyard. At the trainyard, there was some tracks that Granthan walks along, he finally gets into a car and walks up later finding a bar across from where he is. There is a linoleum-topped counter behind the door. Finally, Granthan arrives near New Orleans where he gets into a taxi and goes to the Delta National Laboratories after changing his cloths at the marketing district of the city.",
        "Summary_4": "The story begins with Granthan on a couch in an unremarkable room. He is on a lifeboat in space, but still within the same solar system as the Earth. There are transmissions that are sent between Earth and where Granthan is located in space and they take about 15 minutes one way to arrive at either designation. Part of the story takes place in a Gool\u2019s mind where Granthan is exploring through it to understand them. When Granthan returns back to Earth he lands on the water near Key West in Florida. While on Earth, Granthan goes from the ocean to a train yard and to a fisherman\u2019s boat. The story ends with a cab driver dropping Granthan off at Delta National Laboratories, not too far from New Orleans. ",

If your CPA ID says you're aDCT, you're SOL and they tell you there's no openings. Oh, I've hadseveral jobs ... jobs like all DCTs get. I've been a garbage man,street-cleaner, ditch-digger\u2014     On the other side of the room, the jukebox came to life with a roar anda group of teen-agers scrambled to the dance floor.     Feeling safe from hidden microphones because of the uproar, he leanedacross the table and whispered in the girl's ear, That's what Iwant to hire you for. I want you to help me commit a crime. If I getconvicted of a crime, I'll be able to get a good job!     The girl's lips formed a bright red circle. Say! You really got bigplans, don't you?     He smiled at her admiration. It      was     something big to plan a crime.A civilization weary of murder, robbery, kidnapping, counterfeiting,blackmail, rape, arson, and drunkenness had originated the CPA\u2014CrimePrevention Association. There were no longer any prisons\u2014CPA officialshad declared loudly and emphatically that their job was to preventcrime, not punish it. And prevent it they did, with thousands ofingenious crime-prevention devices and methods. They had made crimealmost impossible, and during the previous year, only a few hundred menin the whole country had been convicted of criminal acts.     No crime was ever punished. If a man was smart enough to killsomeone, for instance, he wasn't sent to prison to be punished; hewasn't punished at all. Instead, he was sent to a hospital where allcriminal tendencies were removed from his mind by psychologists, shocktreatments, encephalographic devices, a form of prefrontal lobotomy anda dozen other methods. An expensive operation, but since there were fewcriminals\u2014only ten in New York during the past year\u2014any city couldafford the CPA hospitals.     The CPA system was, actually, cheaper than previous methods becauseit did away with the damage caused by countless crimes; did away withprisons and their guards, large police forces, squad cars and weapons.     And, ironically, a man who      did     commit a crime was a sort of hero. Hewas a hero to the millions of men and women who had suppressed impulsesto kill someone, beat their mates, get drunk, or kick a dog. Not only ahero, but because of the CPA Treatment, he was\u2014when he left one of theCPA hospitals\u2014a thoroughly honest and hard-working individual ... aman who could be trusted with any responsibility, any amount of money.And therefore, an EX (a convicted criminal who received the treatmentwas commonly called an Ex because he was in the strictest sense of theword an Ex-criminal) ... an Ex was always offered the best jobs.     Well, the girl said. I'm honored. Really. But I got a date at ten.Let's get it over with. You said it'd only take a few minutes.     Okay. Let's go.   <doc-sep> He was having a nightmare when he heard the voice, Hey. Wake up. Hey!     He opened his eyes, saw Hendricks' ugly face and thought for a minutehe was still having the nightmare.     I just saw your doctor, Hendricks said. He says your treatment isover. You can go home now. I thought I'd give you a lift.     As Joe dressed, he searched his mind and tried to find some difference.     During the treatment, he had been unconscious or drugged, unable tothink. Now he could think clearly, but he could find no difference inhimself.     He felt more relaxed than he'd ever felt before, but that could be anafter-effect of all the sedatives he'd been given. And, he noticed whenhe looked in the mirror, he was paler. The treatment had taken monthsand he had, between operations, been locked in his room.     Hendricks was standing by the window. Joe stared at the massive back.Deliberately goading his mind, he discovered the biggest change:Before, the mere sight of the man had aroused an intense hatred. Now,even when he tried, he succeeded in arousing only a mild hatred.They had toned down his capacity to hate, but not done away with italtogether.     Come here and take a look at your public, said Hendricks.     Joe went to the window. Three stories below, a large crowd had gatheredon the hospital steps: a band, photographers, television trucks,cameramen and autograph hunters. He'd waited a long time for this day.But now\u2014another change in him\u2014     He put the emotion into words: I don't feel like a hero. Funny, but Idon't.     Hero! Hendricks laughed and, with his powerful lungs, it soundedlike a bull snorting. You think a successful criminal is a hero? Youstupid\u2014     He laughed again and waved a hand at the crowd below them. You thinkthose people are down there because they admire what you did? They'redown there waiting for you because they're curious, because they'reglad the CPA caught you, and because they're glad you're an Ex. You'rean      ex     -criminal now, and because of your treatment, you'll never beable to commit another crime as long as you live. And that's the kindof guy they admire, so they want to see you, shake your hand and getyour autograph.     Joe didn't understand Hendricks completely, but the part he didunderstand he didn't believe. A crowd was waiting for him. He could seethe people with his own eyes. When he left the hospital, they'd cheerand shout and ask for his autograph. If he wasn't a hero,      what washe     ?   <doc-sep> It took half an hour to get through the crowd. Cameras clicked allaround him, a hundred kids asked for his autograph, everyone talked atonce and cheered, smiled, laughed, patted him on the back and cheeredsome more.     Only one thing confused him during all the excitement: a white-hairedold lady with tears in her eyes said, Thank heaven it was only awatch. Thank heaven you didn't kill someone! God bless you, son. Andthen the old lady had handed him a box of fudge and left him in totalconfusion.     What she said didn't make sense. If he had killed someone ratherthan stealing a watch, he would be even more of a hero and the crowdwould have cheered even louder. He knew: he had stood outside the CPAhospitals many times and the crowds always cheered louder when anex-murderer came out.     In Hendricks' robot-chauffeured car, he ate the fudge and consoledhimself with the thought,      People are funny. Who can understand 'em?       Feeling happy for one of the few times in his life, he turned towardHendricks and said, Thanks for what you did. It turned out great. I'llbe able to get a good job now.     That's why I met you at the hospital, Hendricks said. I want toexplain some things. I've known you for a long time and I know you'respectacularly dumb. You can't figure out some things for yourself andI don't want you walking around the rest of your life thinking I didyou a favor.     Joe frowned. Few men had ever done him a favor and he had rarelythanked anyone for anything. And now ... after thanking the man who'ddone him the biggest favor of all, the man was denying it!     You robbed Gralewski's apartment, Hendricks said. Gralewski is a CPAemployee and he doesn't live in the apartment you robbed. The CPA paysthe rent for that one and he lives in another. We have a lot of placeslike that. You see, it gives us a way to get rid of saps like youbefore they do real damage. We use it as a last resort when a DCT FirstClass won't take the free psycho treatment or\u2014     Well, it's still a favor.     Hendricks' face hardened. Favor? You wouldn't know a favor if youstumbled over one. I did it because it's standard procedure for yourtype of case. Anyone can\u2014free of charge\u2014have treatment by the bestpsychologists. Any DCT can stop being a DCT by simply asking for thetreatment and taking it. But you wouldn't do that. You wanted to commita crime, get caught and be a hero ... an      Ex     .  "

        "Query": "What is the objective of the Gool and who are they, as depicted in END AS A HERO?",
        "Summary_1": "The Gool are an evil Alien race, at war with planet Earth. They are a hive mind. Each being is an extension of a greater conscience. This conscience is hidden deep in their home world, a brain that connects to both the planet and its people. They are described as \"organs\u201d to it. They can telepathically communicate with their leader through soundless thought. They have the ability to infiltrate the minds of their enemies, taking control over them and using them as hosts. This allows the species to sabotage missions, and create spies behind enemy lines. Their numbers have dwindled and what was once a great race, is now a mere colony. But they have plans to expand to newly discovered worlds, where they would replenish their numbers, and be mighty once again. They feed on minerals and metals. They could usually only take over certain minds, but never before like Granthan's. His mind was clear, out of the way of all the others, which made it easy for them to get their claws into him. ",
        "Summary_2": "The Gool were previously a great and prominent race in space, now a tribe interested in spreading out and overtaking the galaxy and planting themselves in places where they would have an abundance of food, such as potassium, calcium, and iron. They plan to achieve this using their special mind-control techniques. The Gool are able to probe the minds of individuals, gathering information but also gaining the ability to control their movements and actions; they are also able to erase parts of memory from an individual.",
        "Summary_3": "According to Kayle, the Gool are in war with the men. At first, the Gool was assumed to have the ability to somehow telehypnotically control a man\u2019s mind without the man knowing it. By going into his subconscious mind, Granthan learns that the Gool can engrave their demands onto the subconscious minds of a man. In the past, the Gool has been controlling men at the superficial level. Digging deeper into his subconscious mind, Granthan learns that the Gool are building fleets that transport the spawn to a world where food was for free. And they want to spread out across the galaxy, thus they\u2019ve came up with a plan. Further exploring, Granthan finds out that they have the ability for matter transmission across space. ",
        "Summary_4": "The Gool\u2019s are a group of people that use hyper-cortical invasion to subvert the will of previously loyal people to enact their own wants and desires. They have built fleets of ships meant to transport their young to new worlds that they have discovered. The new worlds were desirable because they had plenty of food that could be acquired from them. In essence, they want to take over planets \u2013 some inhabited, to spread their population and see the continued growth of it. ",
        "Article": "Using the technique I had grasped from the Gool itself, I struck,stifling the outcry, invaded the fetid blackness and grappled theobscene gelatinous immensity of the Gool spy as it spasmed in a frenzyof xenophobia\u2014a ton of liver writhing at the bottom of a dark well.     I clamped down control. The Gool mind folded in on itself, gibbering.Not pausing to rest, I followed up, probed along my channel of contact,tracing patterns, scanning the flaccid Gool mind....     I saw a world of yellow seas lapping at endless shores of mud. Therewas a fuming pit, where liquid sulphur bubbled up from some innersource, filling an immense natural basin. The Gool clustered at itsrim, feeding, each monstrous shape heaving against its neighbors for amore favorable position.       I probed farther, saw the great cables of living nervous tissue thatlinked each eating organ with the brain-mass far underground. I tracedthe passages through which tendrils ran out to immense caverns wheresmaller creatures labored over strange devices. These, my host's memorytold me, were the young of the Gool. Here they built the fleets thatwould transport the spawn to the new worlds the Prime Overlord haddiscovered, worlds where food was free for the taking. Not sulphuralone, but potassium, calcium, iron and all the metals\u2014richesbeyond belief in endless profusion. No longer would the Gool tribecluster\u2014those who remained of a once-great race\u2014at a single feedingtrough. They would spread out across a galaxy\u2014and beyond.     But not if I could help it.     The Gool had evolved a plan\u2014but they'd had a stroke of bad luck.     In the past, they had managed to control a man here and there, amongthe fleets, far from home, but only at a superficial level. Enough,perhaps, to wreck a ship, but not the complete control needed to send aman back to Earth under Gool compulsion, to carry out complex sabotage.     Then they had found me, alone, a sole survivor, free from the clutterof the other mind-fields. It had been their misfortune to pick apsychodynamicist. Instead of gaining a patient slave, they had openedthe fortress door to an unseen spy. Now that I was there, I would seewhat I could steal.     A timeless time passed. I wandered among patterns of white light andwhite sound, plumbed the deepest recesses of hidden Gool thoughts,fared along strange ways examining the shapes and colors of theconcepts of an alien mind.     I paused at last, scanning a multi-ordinal structure of pattern withinpattern; the diagrammed circuits of a strange machine.     I followed through its logic-sequence; and, like a bomb-burst, itsmeaning exploded in my mind.     From the vile nest deep under the dark surface of the Gool world inits lonely trans-Plutonian orbit, I had plucked the ultimate secret oftheir kind.     Matter across space.   <doc-sep> The immense orderly confusion of the basic memory level lay beforeme. Abstracted from it, aloof and observant, the monitoringpersonality-fraction scanned the pattern, searching the polydimensionalcontinuum for evidence of an alien intrusion.     And found it.     As the eye instantaneously detects a flicker of motion amid an infinityof static detail, so my inner eye perceived the subtle traces of theprobing Gool mind, like a whispered touch deftly rearranging my buriedmotivations.     I focused selectively, tuned to the recorded gestalt.           It is a contact, Effulgent One!                Softly, now! Nurture the spark well. It but trembles at thethreshold....                It is elusive, Master! It wriggles like a gorm-worm in the eatingtrough!          A part of my mind watched as the memory unreeled. I listened to thevoices\u2014yet not voices, merely the shape of concepts, indescribablyintricate. I saw how the decoy pseudo-personality which I hadconcretized for the purpose in a hundred training sessions had foughtagainst the intruding stimuli\u2014then yielded under the relentless thrustof the alien probe. I watched as the Gool operator took over the motorcenters, caused me to crawl through the choking smoke of the devastatedcontrol compartment toward the escape hatch. Fire leaped up, blockingthe way. I went on, felt ghostly flames whipping at me\u2014and then thehatch was open and I pulled myself through, forcing the broken leg.My blackened hand fumbled at the locking wheel. Then the blast asthe lifeboat leaped clear of the disintegrating dreadnought\u2014and theworld-ending impact as I fell.     At a level far below the conscious, the embattled pseudo-personalitylashed out again\u2014fighting the invader.           Almost it eluded me then, Effulgent Lord. Link with this lowly one!                Impossible! Do you forget all my teachings? Cling, though you expendthe last filament of your life-force!          Free from all distraction, at a level where comprehension and retentionare instantaneous and total, my monitoring basic personality fractionfollowed the skillful Gool mind as it engraved its commands deep inmy subconscious. Then the touch withdrew, erasing the scars of itspassage, to leave me unaware of its tampering\u2014at a conscious level.     Watching the Gool mind, I learned.     The insinuating probe\u2014a concept regarding which psychodynamicists hadtheorized\u2014was no more than a pattern in emptiness....     But a pattern which I could duplicate, now that I had seen what hadbeen done to me.     Hesitantly, I felt for the immaterial fabric of the continuum, warpingand manipulating it, copying the Gool probe. Like planes of paper-thincrystal, the polyfinite aspects of reality shifted into focus, aligningthemselves.     Abruptly, a channel lay open. As easily as I would stretch out my handto pluck a moth from a night-flower, I reached across the unimaginablevoid\u2014and sensed a pit blacker than the bottom floor of hell, and aglistening dark shape.     There was a soundless shriek.       Effulgence! It reached out\u2014touchedme!        <doc-sep> I came out of it clear-headed but weak. My right leg was numb, butreasonably comfortable, clamped tight in a walking brace. I put upa hand and felt a shaved skull, with sutures. It must have been afracture. The left arm\u2014well, it was still there, wrapped to theshoulder and held out stiffly by a power truss that would keep the scartissue from pulling up and crippling me. The steady pressure as thetruss contracted wasn't anything to do a sense-tape on for replaying atleisure moments, but at least the cabinet hadn't amputated. I wasn'tcomplaining.     As far as I knew, I was the first recorded survivor of contact with theGool\u2014if I survived.     I was still a long way from home, and I hadn't yet checked on thecondition of the lifeboat. I glanced toward the entry port. It wasdogged shut. I could see black marks where my burned hand had been atwork.     I fumbled my way into a couch and tried to think. In my condition\u2014witha broken leg and third-degree burns, plus a fractured skull\u2014Ishouldn't have been able to fall out of bed, much less make the tripfrom      Belshazzar's     CCC to the boat; and how had I managed to dog thatport shut? In an emergency a man was capable of great exertions. Butrunning on a broken femur, handling heavy levers with charred fingersand thinking with a cracked head were overdoing it. Still, I washere\u2014and it was time to get a call through to TSA headquarters.     I flipped the switch and gave the emergency call-letters Col. AusarKayle of Aerospace Intelligence had assigned to me a few weeks before.It was almost five minutes before the acknowledge came through fromthe Ganymede relay station, another ten minutes before Kayle's faceswam into view. Even through the blur of the screen I could see thehaggard look.     Granthan! he burst out. Where are the others? What happened outthere? I turned him down to a mutter.     Hold on, I said. I'll tell you. Recorders going? I didn't wait foran answer\u2014not with a fifteen-minute transmission lag. I plowed on:           Belshazzar     was sabotaged. So was      Gilgamesh     \u2014I think. I got out. Ilost a little skin, but the aid cabinet has the case in hand. Tell theMed people the drinks are on me.     I finished talking and flopped back, waiting for Kayle's reply. On thescreen, his flickering image gazed back impatiently, looking as hostileas a swing-shift ward nurse. It would be half an hour before I wouldget his reaction to my report. I dozed off\u2014and awoke with a start.Kayle was talking.     \u2014your report. I won't mince words. They're wondering at your role inthe disaster. How does it happen that you alone survived?     How the hell do I know? I yelled\u2014or croaked. But Kayle's voice wasdroning on:     ... you Psychodynamics people have been telling me the Gool mayhave some kind of long-range telehypnotic ability that might make itpossible for them to subvert a loyal man without his knowledge. You'vetold me yourself that you blacked out during the attack\u2014and came to onthe lifeboat, with no recollection of how you got there.     This is war, Granthan. War against a vicious enemy who strike withoutwarning and without mercy. You were sent out to investigate thepossibility of\u2014what's that term you use?\u2014hyper-cortical invasion. Youknow better than most the risk I'd be running if you were allowed topass the patrol line.     I'm sorry, Granthan. I can't let you land on Earth. I can't acceptthe risk.     What do I do now? I stormed. Go into orbit and eat pills and hopeyou think of something? I need a doctor!     Presently Kayle replied. Yes, he said. You'll have to enter aparking orbit. Perhaps there will be developments soon which will makeit possible to ... ah ... restudy the situation. He didn't meet myeye. I knew what he was thinking. He'd spare me the mental anguish ofknowing what was coming. I couldn't really blame him; he was doingwhat he thought was the right thing. And I'd have to go along andpretend\u2014right up until the warheads struck\u2014that I didn't know I'dbeen condemned to death.      II     I tried to gather my wits and think my way through the situation. Iwas alone and injured, aboard a lifeboat that would be the focus of aconverging flight of missiles as soon as I approached within batteryrange of Earth. I had gotten clear of the Gool, but I wouldn't survivemy next meeting with my own kind. They couldn't take the chance that Iwas acting under Gool orders.     I wasn't, of course. I was still the same Peter Granthan,psychodynamicist, who had started out with Dayan's fleet six weeksearlier. The thoughts I was having weren't brilliant, but they weremine, all mine....     But how could I be sure of that?     Maybe there was something in Kayle's suspicion. If the Gool were asskillful as we thought, they would have left no overt indications oftheir tampering\u2014not at a conscious level.     But this was where psychodynamics training came in. I had been reactinglike any scared casualty, aching to get home and lick his wounds. But Iwasn't just any casualty. I had been trained in the subtleties of themind\u2014and I had been prepared for just such an attack.     Now was the time to make use of that training. It had given me oneresource. I could unlock the memories of my subconscious\u2014and see againwhat had happened.     I lay back, cleared my mind of extraneous thoughts, and concentrated onthe trigger word that would key an auto-hypnotic sequence....     Sense impressions faded. I was alone in the nebulous emptiness of afirst-level trance. I keyed a second word, slipped below the mistysurface into a dreamworld of vague phantasmagoric figures milling intheir limbo of sub-conceptualization. I penetrated deeper, brokethrough into the vividly hallucinatory third level, where images ofmirror-bright immediacy clamored for attention. And deeper....  "

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in THE SOUL EATERS?",
        "Summary_1": "Dennis Brooke was drinking and watching a dancer along with rereading the last letter of Marla, his fiancee, who accepted a new assignment and left him. At the same time he was regretting being grounded and on bad terms with I.S.P. for a mistake. Suddenly, he felt danger and when the Mercurial dancer approached him, a Martian attempted an attack. After a short fight, Dennis overcame the Martian who turned out to possess a prohibited weapon and supposedly was a space pirate. After capturing the pirate, Dennis was called by I.S.P. commander and told that Marla and her whole spaceship traveling to Terra disappeared, supposedly captured by Koerber, the head of pirates. Dennis begged to be sent for the pirate leader and the commander gave him this chance. They watched a recording of Marla's spaceship zig-zagging and being attacked, which ended with a blank screen. Dennis immediately set out to space on a cruiser. After a long search without success, something appeared on the visa-screen and the crew prepared to board. Nevertheless, no survivors were found and the Captain, Dennis, was out of hope. Everyone left in silence the spot of the tragedy of the attacked spacer. Back on the ship, one of the crew, George Randall, gladly informed that an object was detected. The crew rushed for the object which indeed turned out to be a pirate craft trying to escape the persecutor. Koerber's ship was soon doomed and he caught Dennis' ship with a beam to follow. The ship crashed and the crew found itself in a place without any chance to escape from. The captain ordered to explore the place and see what happened to Koerber for sure, while others will be welding, and the crew reentered the ship.",
        "Summary_2": "Dennis Brooke is recounting the letter Marla has left him and going through the feelings of reading that letter. He goes to the Jovian Chamber, an expensive but pleasure-ridden place. Unfortunately, the Jovian Chamber cost him his relationship with Marla and the rebuff of the I.S.P. He was distracted and not prepared for duty to complete the last link in a net of I.S.P cruisers that were surrounding a space pirate because he was at the Jovian Chamber. While back there, he becomes quite alert because there is a Martian looking at him with pure hatred in his eyes. A dancer flings herself onto his lap and the Martian comes rushing to attack Dennis. Dennis is able to avoid the attack and the police come and take the Martian away. The Martian turns out to be a wanted pirate crew member, and this capture allows Dennis to be positioned in a more favorable view by the commander of the I.S.P. \n\nDennis goes to meet the commander and the commander tells him some troubling news. He states that Marla\u2019s ship is unable to be contacted and is multiple days overdue for contact. The commander tells Dennis that joining the mission would be his opportunity to redeem his reputation and Dennis is readily prepared to accept and wants to leave immediately. They eventually do leave and spend the first couple of days searching in space with no luck. However, they do eventually spot something in the distance and prepare all stations for incoming possibilities. They board a ship finding no survivors and the ship to be without cargo.  When they return to their ship, George excitedly greets them telling them that the radar is picking up a possible trail of a space. Dennis is hopeful that it is Koerber. The crew members hurriedly go to their assigned tasks and their faces are glowing with optimism. The pirate craft they encounter is producing maneuvers to try to lose the cruiser. Dennis is able to avoid attacks from Koerber\u2019s beam for a while. Unfortunately, the I.S.P. ship does get caught in a magnetic beam by Koerber\u2019s ship and is forced to follow the pirate ship\u2019s plunge. \n\nAs they plunge, Dennis is confused by what is beneath them as there is incredible gravity. They eventually fall into a planetoid. When they land, they were questioning whether they are permanently stuck on the unknown planet or if they are able to repair the spacer. \n\nDallas becomes angry because he accuses Randall of them being stranded because Randall did not man his station and act out his orders. Dennis defends Randall asserting that it is no good to feud in a situation as such and that he will not allow it to occur. ",
        "Summary_3": "Dennis Brooke is a captain of the I.S.P who is currently grounded due to his recklessness in capturing Koerber, a deadly space pirate. He spends his days in the Jovian Chamber, a place on Venus where the desires of its men are met constantly; despite this, his mind is only on his fiancee, Marla, whose letter he rereads while she is on a trip to Terra. One night at the chamber, Dennis is suddenly attacked by a strange Martian man, who he fights off and defeats. The police later discover that the Martian man was in possession of a forbidden weapon, inferring that he is part of Koerber's crew. Dennis then meets the I.S.P Commander in his office, where he is informed that a ship, the ship that was supposed to take Marla to Terra, has vanished, and all signs point to Koerber. The Commander gives Dennis a final chance to redeem himself and defeat Koerber for good, equipping him with a crew and an upgraded cruiser that can travel at record speed. Aboard the cruiser, Dennis eventually finds the vanished ship, but unfortunately no hopeful signs of survival from the destruction. Heartbroken by the loss of Marla, Dennis advises his crew to return back, when they notice Koerber's ship approaching. Dennis challenges the ship to a battle, sending cannons and jets to crash into the ship. However, Koerber's ship is quickly approaching the surface of a planet, and Koerber sends a magnetic beam to bring Dennis' cruiser down with him. Dennis panics and orders George Randall, the youngest on the crew, to cut the jets and use magentic repulsion, but Randall does not respond. Another crew member eventually cuts the jets, but not early enough, and the cruiser is stranded on the unknown planet. The crew brainstorms how they can repair the ship and get off the planet, blaming Randall; Dennis scolds the crew for being harsh on Randall as they get to work.",
        "Summary_4": "Dennis Brooke cannot stop reading the final letter he receives from his fiancee Marla Starland. He is at the Jovian Chamber in the Inter-planetary Palace on Venus, where it is highly regarded as an elusive place that costs a fortune to enter. He drinks and makes eye contact with a young martian, who stares at him back with hatred. A Mercurian dancer flings herself onto his lap, and the Martian leaps up to attack him while the other guests are distracted. Dennis manages to knock the Martian, and the international police find out that the Martian is a member of Bren Koerber\u2019s pirate crew. The Police Lieutenant Gillian mentions that they should radio the I.S.P., but Dennis reveals that he is grounded from the organization. The lieutenant still insists that he come to Terra with him. Later, the I.S.P. commander frowns when he sees Dennis walk into the office. He explains that they brought him here for two reasons. The first reason is tracking down Koerber\u2019s orbit of piracy by capturing one of his henchmen. The second reason is about the disappearance of Marla and the loss of contact with the interplanetary spacer that she was on. In his despair, Dennis begs the commander for one more opportunity to bring back Koerber or die trying. He then sees a visual record of the passenger spacer. They later embark on the trip, and the spacer they are in gets attacked by atom shells. The commander tells Dennis that he can use the new cruiser equipped to deal with these dangers. His expedition is the first assignment for many of the crew members. As they are about to give up, the cruiser finds what is left of a passenger cruiser. Everybody wants to be a part of the boarding party except for George Randall because he still feels nauseous about the idea. Tom, Scotty, and Dallas are chosen to go with Dennis. Dennis finishes creating the survey about the liners left, and they leave. Randall tells them that another spacer is somewhere close behind them, and Dennis hopes it is Koerber. He observes Koerber\u2019s cruiser through the viso-screen, but it suddenly maneuvers once it realizes that the I.S.P. cruiser is nearby too. Although it tries to lose Dennis and his crew, Koerber\u2019s cruiser is unsuccessful, and the two cruisers begin fighting. He sees the shadow behind Koerber\u2019s ship and avoids getting hit by a beam that the enemy cruiser fires. Randall is given orders to cut the engines, but he does not follow them. The cruiser is forced to land in the middle of nowhere of unfamiliar territory. They discuss ways to get out of the area, and Dennis asks to see Randall. They talk briefly, and Dennis treats Randall much more kindly after seeing his first trip into the outer orbits. Even though the others are angry at Randall, he tells them there will be no feuds on the ship, and they re-enter the cruiser. \n",

The barbaric rhythms of the      Congahua     , were a background of annoyancein Dennis' mind; he frowned slightly as the maneuvers of the Mercuriandancer, who writhed among the guests of the notorious pleasure palace,began to leave no doubt as to her intentions.

Dennis Brooke was thirty, the time when youth no longer seems unending.When the minor adventures of the heart begin to pall.

A night in the Jovian Chamber, was to be emperor for one night. Everydream of a man's desire was marvelously induced through the skilful useof hypnotics; the rarest viands and most delectable drinks appeared asif by magic; the unearthly peace of an Olympus descended on a man'ssoul, and beauty ... beauty such as men dreamed of was a warm realityunder the ineffable illumination of the Chamber.     It cost a young fortune. But to pleasure mad, boom-ridden Venus, afortune was a bagatelle. Only it had cost Dennis Brooke far more than asheaf of credits\u2014it had cost him the severe rebuff of the I.S.P., andmost of his heart in Marla.

And now, ina final bid for the spacer's favor she flung herself in his lap andtilted back invitingly.     Some of the guests laughed, others stared in plain envy at thehandsome, red-haired spacer, but from the table across, came thetinkling sound of a fragile glass being crushed in a powerful hand,and a muffled Martian curse. Without warning, the Martian was on hisfeet with the speed of an Hellacorium, the table went crashing to oneside as he leaped with deadly intent on the sprawled figure of DennisBrooke.

        "Summary_1": "Marla used to be a fiancee of Dennis, but she broke up with him and left for an assignment. Her poignant last letter pained Dennis, but he kept rereading it, delving into drinks, dancers and images of Marla. This condition even caused him to fail his commander and be grounded. The break up left a huge void in Dennis and he had no desire to see other women. The news of her disappearance made Dennis pale and silent, he felt extreme pain, which was soon accompanied by anger towards Koerber. Dennis desired to rush that very second to search for Marla and bring Koerber, risking his own life. All the time without success Dennis was slowly losing hope, and when he didn't find any survivors, he was silent and devastated with the loss of hope to find Marla.",
        "Summary_2": "Dennis recounts how the loss of Marla has left a void in his heart that hurts him. His repeated reading of a letter that she has left him shows that Dennis longs for Marla and wishes to be reunited with her because of his love for her. Dennis clearly has a great love for Marla because he is willing to risk his life to go and find her, hopefully alive. He is anguished by the idea that Marla could be in danger or did die. \n\n",
        "Summary_3": "Marla is Dennis' fiancee. The two are in love, despite being apart due to business; Marla accepted a mission on the planet Terra, leaving Dennis on Venus. Even though the two are far away from each other, Dennis still cares deeply about Marla and thinks of her often. At the beginning of the story, he is rereading the last letter that Marla wrote him before leaving, and even when at the Jovian Chamber, a palace meant to meet anyone's desires, Dennis can only think of Marla and her beauty. Dennis' feelings towards Marla are also apparent when he gets the news of Marla's ship being seized by Koerber.",
        "Summary_4": "Dennis loves and adores Marla dearly, to the point where he is willing to risk his life to save her. He is heartbroken over the letter that she initially sent him and cannot bring himself to enjoy anything in the Jovian Chamber. When the commander tells him that his wife has potentially fallen into the hands of Koerber, he does not hesitate to hunt the criminal down for her. He is also very determined because of her, effortlessly taking on his duties as captain and giving out fast orders if it means that they will be reunited sooner. Even though Marla\u2019s letter has already expressed her goodbyes, he does not give up and will do anything to see her again. ",

Commander behind the immense Aluminildesk, frowned slightly as Dennis Brooke entered. He eyed the six footfour frame of the Captain before him with a mixture of feelings, asif uncertain how to begin. Finally, he sighed as if, having come to adecision, he were forcing himself to speak:     Sit down, Dennis. I've sent for you, despite your grounding, fortwo reasons. The first one you already know\u2014your capture of one ofKoerber's henchmen\u2014has given us a line as to his present orbit ofpiracy, and the means of a check on his activities. But that's notreally why I've brought you here. He frowned again as if what he hadto say were difficult indeed.     Marla Starland, your fiancee, accepted an assignment we offered her\u2014adelicate piece of work here on Terra that only a very beautiful, andvery clever young lady could perform. And, he paused, grimacing,somewhere between Venus and Terra, the interplanetary spacer bringingher and several other passengers, began to send distress signals.Finally, we couldn't contact the ship any more. It is three daysoverdue. All passengers, a cargo of radium from Venus worth untoldmillions, the spacer itself\u2014seem to have vanished.     Dennis Brooke's space-tanned features had gone pale. His large hazeleyes, fringed with auburn lashes, too long for a man, were bright slitsthat smouldered. He stood silent, his hands clenched at his sides,while something cold and sharp seemed to dig at his heart with cruelprecision.     Marla! He breathed at last. The thought of Marla in the powerof Koerber sent a wave of anguish that seared through him like anatom-blast.     Commander, Dennis said, and his rich baritone voice had depths ofemotion so great that they startled Commander Bertram himself\u2014andthat grizzled veteran of the I.S.P., had at one time or another knownevery change of torture that could possibly be wrung on a human soul.Commander, give me one ...      one     chance at that spawn of unthinkablebegetting! Let me try, and I promise you ... in his torture, Denniswas unconsciously banging a knotted fist on the chaste, satiny surfaceof the priceless desk, I promise you that I will either bring youKoerber, or forfeit my life!     Commander Bertram nodded his head. I brought you here for thatpurpose, son. We have reached a point in our war with Koerber, wherethe last stakes must be played ... and the last stake is death!     He reached over and flipped up the activator on a small telecast seton his desk; instantly the viso-screen lighted up. You'll now seea visual record of all we know about the passenger spacer that leftVenus with passengers and cargo, as far as we could contact the vesselin space. This, Dennis, the Commander emphasized his words, is yourchance to redeem yourself! He fell silent, while the viso-screen beganto show a crowded space port on Venus, and a gigantic passenger spacerup-tilted in its cradle.   <doc-sep> With a wrenching turn that almost threw them out of control, Dennismaneuvered to avoid the beam. Again Koerber's beam lashed out, as hesank lower into the looming mass, and again Dennis anticipating themaneuver avoided it.     George Randall! He shouted desperately into the speaker. Cut alljets in the rocket room! Hurry, man! He banked again and then zoomedout of the increasing gravity trap.     Randall! I've got to use the magnetic repulsion plates.... Cut all thejets! But there was no response. Randall's screen remained blank. ThenKoerber's lashing magnetic beam touched and the I.S.P. ship was caught,forced to follow the pirate ship's plunge like the weight at the end ofa whiplash. Koerber's gunners sent one parting shot, an atom-blast thatshook the trapped cruiser like a leaf.     Beneath them, growing larger by the second, a small world rushed up tomeet them. The readings in the Planetograph seemed to have gone crazy.It showed diameter 1200 miles; composition mineral and radio-active.Gravity seven-eighths of Terra. It couldn't be! Unless perhaps thisunknown planetoid was the legendary core of the world that at one timewas supposed to have existed between Jupiter and Mars. Only that couldpossibly explain the incredible gravity.     And then began another type of battle. Hearing the Captain's orders toRandall, and noting that no result had been obtained, Scotty Byrneshimself cut the jets. The Magnetic Repulsion Plates went into action,too late to save them from being drawn, but at least they could preventa crash. Far in the distance they could see Koerber's ship precedingthem in a free fall, then the Planetoid was rushing up to engulf them.      III     The atmosphere was somewhat tenuous, but it was breathable, provideda man didn't exert himself. To the silent crew of the I.S.P. Cruiser,the strange world to which Koerber's magnetic Beam had drawn them,was anything but reassuring. Towering crags jutted raggedly againstthe sky, and the iridescent soil of the narrow valley that walled inthe cruiser, had a poisonous, deadly look. As far as their eyes couldreach, the desolate, denuded vista stretched to the horizon.     Pretty much of a mess! Dennis Brooke's face was impassive as heturned to Scotty Byrnes. What's your opinion? Think we can patch herup, or are we stuck here indefinitely?     Scotty eyed the damage. The atom-blast had penetrated the hull intothe forward fuel chambers and the armor had blossomed out like flowerpetals. The crash-landing had not helped either.     Well, there's a few beryloid plates in the storage locker, Captain,but, he scratched his head ruminatively and shifted his precious cud.     But what? Speak up man! It was Tom Jeffery, his nerves on edge, hisordinarily gentle voice like a lash.     But, you may as well know it, Scotty replied quietly. That partingshot of Koerber's severed our main rocket feed. I had to use theemergency tank to make it down here!     For a long moment the four men looked at each other in silence. DennisBrooke's face was still impassive but for the flaming hazel eyes. Tomtugged at the torn sleeve of his I.S.P. uniform, while Scotty gazedmournfully at the damaged ship. Dallas Bernan looked at the long,ragged line of cliffs.     I think we got Koerber, though, he said at last. While Tom was doinga job of navigation, I had one last glimpse of him coming down fastand out of control somewhere behind those crags over there!     To hell with Koerber! Tom Jeffery exploded. You mean we're stuck inthis hellish rock-pile?     Easy, Tom! Captain Brooke's tones were like ice. On his pale,impassive face, his eyes were like flaming topaz. Where's Randall?     Probably hiding his head under a bunk! Dallas laughed with scorn. Hiscontemptuous remark voiced the feelings of the entire crew. A man whofailed to be at his battle-station in time of emergency, had no placein the I.S.P.     Considering the gravity of this planetoid, Dennis Brooke saidthoughtfully, it's going to take some blast to get us off!     Maybe we can locate a deposit of anerioum or uranium or something forour atom-busters to chew on! Scotty said hopefully. He was an eternaloptimist.     Better break out those repair plates, Dennis said to Scotty. Tom,you get the welders ready. I've got a few entries to make in the logbook, and then we'll decide on a party to explore the terrain and tryto find out what happened to Koerber's ship. I must know, he said in alow voice, but with such passion that the others were startled.     A figure appeared in the slanting doorway of the ship in time to hearthe last words. It was George Randall, adjusting a bandaged foreheadbumped during the crash landing.     Captain ... I ... I wanted ... he paused unable to continue.     You wanted what? Captain Brooke's voice was terse. Perhaps youwanted to explain why you weren't at your battle station?     Sir, I wanted to know if ... if I might help Scotty with the weldingjob.... That wasn't at all what he'd intended to say. But somehow thewords had stuck in his throat and his face flushed deep scarlet. Hiscandid blue eyes were suspiciously brilliant, and the white bandagewith its crimson stains made an appealing, boyish figure. It softenedthe anger in Brooke's heart. Thinking it over calmly, Dennis realizedthis was the youngster's first trip into the outer orbits, and bettermen than he had cracked in those vast reaches of space. But there hadbeen an instant when he'd found Randall cowering in the rocket-room, inthe grip of paralyzing hysteria, when he could cheerfully have wrunghis neck!     Certainly, Randall, he replied in a much more kindly tone. We'llneed all hands now.     Thank you, sir! Randall seemed to hesitate for a moment, opened hismouth to speak further, but feeling the other's calculating gaze uponhim, he whirled and re-entered the ship.     But for him we wouldn't be here! Dallas exclaimed. Aagh! He shookhis head in disgust until the several folds of flesh under his chinshook like gelatin. Cowards are hell! He spat.     Easy, Dallas, Randall's a kid, give 'im a chance. Dennis observed.     You Captain ... you're defending 'im? Why you had a greater stake inthis than we, and he's spoiled it for you!     Yep, Dennis nodded. But I'm still keeping my senses clear. No feudson my ship. Get it! The last two words cut like a scimitar.     Dallas nodded and lowered his eyes. Scotty shifted his cud and spata thin stream of juice over the iridescent ground. One by one theyre-entered the cruiser.  "

        "Query": "Why did the Martian man target Dennis in THE SOUL EATERS?",
        "Summary_1": "Dennis was forced to fight back and exit his state of stagnation, caused by being grounded at work and left by fiancee. When he overcame the enemy, the least turned out to be a space pirate, bearing a prohibited weapon. That way Dennis stopped and imprisoned a criminal, who turned out to possess useful information about Koerber's present activities. This helpful action, together with Dennis' personal interest in success of the mission and his skills of a spacer, made the commander give Dennis a chance to redeem himself. For that reason Dennis was sent to search for Koerber and he set out for the adventure.",
        "Summary_2": "The Martian fails to successfully attack Dennis as he is able to maneuver out of the way to prevent a painful or deadly attack. The Martian is captured by the police and they tell Dennis that he had a forbidden weapon on him, an atomic disintegrator. That type of weapon is only found on space pirates or criminals. It turns out that the Martian was a member of a pirate crew, specifically Koerber\u2019s pirate crew. Dennis aiding the capture of this Martian is important because it puts him in a more favorable position with the commander of the I.S.P. ",
        "Summary_3": "Though the Martian man who attacks Dennis seems random, it is later revealed by the Police Lieutenant that the Martian was in possession of an atomic-disintegrator, which is a forbidden weapon. This, in addition to the attack, leads them to suspect that the Martian man is part of Koerber's pirate team. Dennis had previously been grounded by the I.S.P, but his brawl with the Martian man gives him the opportunity to be back on the I.S.P's good side. The Police Lieutenant tells Dennis that if the Martian turned out to be one of Koerber's men, he would allow Dennis to take the credit for his capture, which ends up working.",
        "Summary_4": "The Martian man attacking Dennis reveals more critical information about Koerber, the criminal\u2019s whereabouts, and how Dennis later becomes involved. Even though Denis is temporarily not allowed to interact with the I.S.P., the Martian man attacking him creates an opportunity for him to go back to the organization. Furthermore, he is also aware of Marla\u2019s situation from going to I.S.P., and he goes immediately to hunt down Koerber. For the commander, this Martian\u2019s attack also means that the location of their lost passengers and cargo must be found soon. The attack sets up the plot for the majority of the story, and it also helps Dennis become motivated enough to go and rescue Marla. \n",

Dennis Brooke had lost count of the times he'd read Marla's lastletter, but every time he came to these final, poignant lines, theynever failed to conjure a vision of her tawny loveliness, slender asthe palms of Venus, and of the blue ecstasy of her eyes, wide with aperpetual wonder\u2014limpid as a child's.     The barbaric rhythms of the      Congahua     , were a background of annoyancein Dennis' mind; he frowned slightly as the maneuvers of the Mercuriandancer, who writhed among the guests of the notorious pleasure palace,began to leave no doubt as to her intentions. The girl was beautiful,in a sultry, almost incandescent sort of way, but her open promise lefthim cold. He wanted solitude, somewhere to coordinate his thoughtsin silence and salvage something out of the wreck of his heart, notto speak of his career. But Venus, in the throes of a gigantic boomupon the discovery of radio-active fields, could offer only onesolitude\u2014the fatal one of her swamps and virgin forests.     Dennis Brooke was thirty, the time when youth no longer seems unending.When the minor adventures of the heart begin to pall. If the loss ofMarla left an aching void that all the women of five planets could notfill, the loss of Space, was quite as deadly. For he had been grounded.True, Koerber's escape from the I.S.P. net had not quite been hisfault; but had he not been enjoying the joys of a voluptuous JovianChamber, in Venus' fabulous Inter-planetary Palace, he would have beenready for duty to complete the last link in the net of I.S.P. cruisersthat almost surrounded the space pirate.     A night in the Jovian Chamber, was to be emperor for one night. Everydream of a man's desire was marvelously induced through the skilful useof hypnotics; the rarest viands and most delectable drinks appeared asif by magic; the unearthly peace of an Olympus descended on a man'ssoul, and beauty ... beauty such as men dreamed of was a warm realityunder the ineffable illumination of the Chamber.     It cost a young fortune. But to pleasure mad, boom-ridden Venus, afortune was a bagatelle. Only it had cost Dennis Brooke far more than asheaf of credits\u2014it had cost him the severe rebuff of the I.S.P., andmost of his heart in Marla.     Dennis sighed, he tilted his red, curly head and drank deeply of theinsidious      Verbena     , fragrant as a mint garden, in the tall frostyglass of Martian      Bacca-glas     , and as he did so, his brilliant hazeleyes found themselves gazing into the unwinking, violet stare of ayoung Martian at the next table. There was a smouldering hatred inthose eyes, and something else ... envy, perhaps, or was it jealousy?Dennis couldn't tell. But his senses became instantly alert. Dangerbrought a faint vibration which his superbly trained faculties couldinstantly denote.     His steady, bronzed hand lowered the drink, and his eyes narrowedslightly. Absorbed in trying to puzzle the sudden enmity of thisMartian stranger, he was unaware of the Mercurian Dancer. The latterhad edged closer, whirling in prismatic flashes from the myriadsemi-precious stones that studded her brief gauze skirt. And now, ina final bid for the spacer's favor she flung herself in his lap andtilted back invitingly.     Some of the guests laughed, others stared in plain envy at thehandsome, red-haired spacer, but from the table across, came thetinkling sound of a fragile glass being crushed in a powerful hand,and a muffled Martian curse. Without warning, the Martian was on hisfeet with the speed of an Hellacorium, the table went crashing to oneside as he leaped with deadly intent on the sprawled figure of DennisBrooke. A high-pitched scream brought instant silence as a Terran girlcried out. Then the Martian's hand reached out hungrily. But Dennis wasnot there.   <doc-sep> Leaping to one side, impervious to the fall of the dancer, he avoidedthe murderous rush of the Martian youth, then he wheeled swiftly andplanted a sledge-hammer blow in that most vulnerable spot of allMartians, the spot just below their narrow, wasp-like waist, and as theMartian half-doubled over, he lefted him with a short jab to the chinthat staggered and all but dropped him.     The Martian's violet eyes were black with fury now. He staggered backand sucked in air, his face contorted with excruciating pain. But hewas not through. His powerful right shot like a blast straight forDennis' chest, striking like a piston just below the heart. Dennis tookit, flat-footed, without flinching; then he let his right ride overwith all the force at his command. It caught the Martian on the jaw andspun him like a top, the pale, imperious face went crimson as he slowlysagged to his knees and rolled to the impeccable mosaics of the floor.     Dennis, breathing heavily, stood over him until the internationalpolice arrived, and then he had the surprise of his life. Upon search,the police found a tiny, but fatal silvery tube holstered under hisleft arm-pit\u2014an atomic-disintegrator, forbidden throughout theinterplanetary League. Only major criminals and space pirates stillwithout the law were known to possess them.     Looks like your brawl has turned out to be a piece of fool's luck,Brooke! The Police Lieutenant favored Dennis with a wry smile. IfI'm not mistaken this chap's a member of Bren Koerber's pirate crew.Who else could afford to risk his neck at the International, and havein his possession a disintegrator? Pity we have no complete recordson that devil's crew! Anyway, we'll radio the I.S.P., perhaps theyhave details on this dandy! He eyed admiringly the priceless Martianembroideries on the unconscious Martian's tunic, the costly border ofred, ocelandian fur, and the magnificent black      acerine     on his finger.     Dennis Brooke shrugged his shoulders, shoulders that would have put toshame the Athenian statues of another age. A faint, bitter smile curvedhis generous mouth. I'm grounded, Gillian, it'd take the capture ofKoerber himself to set me right with the I.S.P. again\u2014you don't knowBertram! To him an infraction of rules is a major crime. Damn Venus!He reached for his glass of      Verbena     but the table had turned overduring the struggle, and the glass was a shattered mass of gleaming      Bacca-glas     shards. He laughed shortly as he became conscious of thevenomous stare of the Mercurian Dancer, of the excited voices of theguests and the emphatic disapproval of the Venusian proprietor whowas shocked at having a brawl in his ultra-expensive, ultra-exclusivePalace.     Better come to Headquarters with me, Dennis, the lieutenant saidgently. We'll say you captured him, and if he's Koerber's, thecredit's yours. A trip to Terra's what you need, Venus for you is ahoodoo!   <doc-sep> The stern, white haired I.S.P. Commander behind the immense Aluminildesk, frowned slightly as Dennis Brooke entered. He eyed the six footfour frame of the Captain before him with a mixture of feelings, asif uncertain how to begin. Finally, he sighed as if, having come to adecision, he were forcing himself to speak:     Sit down, Dennis. I've sent for you, despite your grounding, fortwo reasons. The first one you already know\u2014your capture of one ofKoerber's henchmen\u2014has given us a line as to his present orbit ofpiracy, and the means of a check on his activities. But that's notreally why I've brought you here. He frowned again as if what he hadto say were difficult indeed.     Marla Starland, your fiancee, accepted an assignment we offered her\u2014adelicate piece of work here on Terra that only a very beautiful, andvery clever young lady could perform. And, he paused, grimacing,somewhere between Venus and Terra, the interplanetary spacer bringingher and several other passengers, began to send distress signals.Finally, we couldn't contact the ship any more. It is three daysoverdue. All passengers, a cargo of radium from Venus worth untoldmillions, the spacer itself\u2014seem to have vanished.     Dennis Brooke's space-tanned features had gone pale. His large hazeleyes, fringed with auburn lashes, too long for a man, were bright slitsthat smouldered. He stood silent, his hands clenched at his sides,while something cold and sharp seemed to dig at his heart with cruelprecision.     Marla! He breathed at last. The thought of Marla in the powerof Koerber sent a wave of anguish that seared through him like anatom-blast.     Commander, Dennis said, and his rich baritone voice had depths ofemotion so great that they startled Commander Bertram himself\u2014andthat grizzled veteran of the I.S.P., had at one time or another knownevery change of torture that could possibly be wrung on a human soul.Commander, give me one ...      one     chance at that spawn of unthinkablebegetting! Let me try, and I promise you ... in his torture, Denniswas unconsciously banging a knotted fist on the chaste, satiny surfaceof the priceless desk, I promise you that I will either bring youKoerber, or forfeit my life!     Commander Bertram nodded his head. I brought you here for thatpurpose, son. We have reached a point in our war with Koerber, wherethe last stakes must be played ... and the last stake is death!     He reached over and flipped up the activator on a small telecast seton his desk; instantly the viso-screen lighted up. You'll now seea visual record of all we know about the passenger spacer that leftVenus with passengers and cargo, as far as we could contact the vesselin space. This, Dennis, the Commander emphasized his words, is yourchance to redeem yourself! He fell silent, while the viso-screen beganto show a crowded space port on Venus, and a gigantic passenger spacerup-tilted in its cradle.  "

        "Query": "\"What is Dennis' profession and how does he experience his treatment in the workplace?\"",
        "Summary_1": "Dennis works as an I.S.P. captain. His commander Bertram calls him son and is compassionate for the los of Marla. The commander values him and estimates as the best spacer. The Police Lieutenant is also friendly towards Dennis and willing to help him redeem, by saying that Dennis captured the pirate. Dennis' crew on the mission after Koerber heard the stories about the Captain and all were curious but silent, as if they were touched by his tragedy. The crew was loyal and trusted the captain. Dennis was sympathetic and full of humanity towards the young George Randall who failed the crew as it was his first mission. This action was a surprise for other members but none protested.\n\n\n",
        "Summary_2": "Dennis is a young captain for the I.S.P. He is able to pilot an I.S.P. patrol ship with great control. While on the rescue mission trip, Dennis is treated with respect and as the authority figure of the ship. He commands Dallas, and the others, to not start conflicts or feuds on his ship because it is necessary to keep the senses clear in such a dire situation. They respond with respect to his leadership and authority. ",
        "Summary_3": "Dennis is a captain for the I.S.P. Before being grounded, he would aid in missions of varying objectives, patrolling space and most recently on the hunt for space pirate Koerber. When he is being welcomed back to the I.S.P for his next mission, Commander Bertram treats him in a playfully reprimanding manner, but for everyone else on the crew, Dennis is a leader and a guide that they look up to. Running the ship, Dennis efficiently orders the crew to do their respective tasks, and the crew admires his leadership and tries their best to be obedient. ",
        "Summary_4": "Dennis works for the I.S.P. as a spacer and captain. He is initially grounded by the organization, where he mentions that Commander Bertram has said that an infraction of rules is considered a major offense. However, when Bertram invites him back to pilot one of the liners, any former prejudices are gone. All of his crew trust him completely, and they are all eager to do whatever he assigns them. Even though Bertram considers him reckless, he considers him one of the best spacers that they have present. The other crew members also value his opinion highly, as they all listened when he told them not to feud amongst each other. ",

        "Query": "In what location does THE SOUL EATERS occur?",
        "Summary_1": "The story starts on Venus, in a pleasure palace where Dennis is trying to distract himself from his ex-fiancee and being grounded on his job. After an attack followed by Dennis' victory, he proceeds Headquarters with the police and soon enters the I.S.P. commander's office. From there he immediately sets off to space on a ship, searching for days through the space for any signs of pirates or the disappeared spaceship. The first stop is the remnants of transport lacking any use. The second is a detected pirate spaceship, which the crew starts to follow. The setting of the chase remains in space, and after being engulfed by a Planetoid, the crew find itself in a strange world. The setting was rocky and looked deadly. Only desolate vista was seen around. ",
        "Summary_2": "Dennis is at the Jovian Chamber which is a place that caters to a man\u2019s desire. Then Dennis is taken to the headquarters for the I.S.P, to talk to the commander. He goes to the office of the commander and learns some troubling news about Marla. The crew, along with Dennis and the commander, spend days on a spaceship searching space for Marla\u2019s ship and a pirate ship. When they spot a trail of a spacer, Dennis notes that they are at the intersection of angles Kp at 39 degrees, for 12 minutes, Fp at 67 degrees of Ceres elliptic plane. They fall into an unknown planetoid where the atmosphere is breathable but does not allow for much exertion. ",
        "Summary_3": "The beginning of the story takes place in the Jovian Chamber within the Inter-planetary Palace on Venus, where Dennis is staying after being grounded by the I.S.P. The chamber is a luxurious, royal place with drinks, dancers, and anything a man could desire. After the brawl with a Martian, Dennis goes to the I.S.P Commander's office, where he is given a new mission and cruiser, which is updated with intense speed. Once the mission begins, Dennis spends days on the cruiser, which despite being efficient, lacks comfortable space and offices like the other cruisers do. Eventually, the cruiser crashes onto an unknown planet, with strong gravity, intimidating soils and valleys, and iridescent ground. ",
        "Summary_4": "The story initially takes place on Venus. The Jovian Chamber is packed, and there is the loud sound of the barbaric rhythms of \"Congahua\" in the background.  There is a beautiful Mercurian dancer who weaves amongst the crowd too. There are also tables to sit and have drinks at. After Venus, the story takes place briefly in Commander Bertram\u2019s office at the I.S.P. There is a large aluminil desk and a small telecast set on it. Then, the story takes place in space as they chase down Koerber's cruiser. The cruiser itself has an engine room, a control room, and bunks for rest. One of the other cruisers they encounter has everything in place, except for a noticeably missing amount of cargo. Finally, when they crash, the place the crew crashes in is very difficult to breathe. There are towering jugs that jut raggedly against the sky and iridescent soil for the narrow valley. The crew is the only people there, and there is just nothing that stretches into the horizon.",

What waswrong with our old culture, anyway?     That was intended as a rhetorical question, but Bbulas answered itanyway. He always answered questions; it had never seemed to penetratehis mind that school-days were long since over.     I've told you a thousand times that our old culture was too much likethe Terrans' own to be of interest to them, he said, with affectedweariness. After all, most civilized societies are basically similar;it is only primitive societies that differ sharply, one from theother\u2014and we have to be different to attract Earthmen. They're prettychoosy. You've got to give them what they want, and that's what theywant. Now take up your post on the edge of the field, try to lookhungry, and remember this isn't for you or for me, but for Snaddra.     For Snaddra, Larhgan said, placing her hand over her anterior heartin a gesture which, though devout on Earth\u2014or so the fictapes seemedto indicate\u2014was obscene on Snaddra, owing to the fact that certainessential organs were located in different areas in the Snaddrath thanin the corresponding Terrestrial life-form. Already the Terrestrialinfluence was corrupting her, Skkiru thought mournfully. She had beensuch a nice girl, too.     We may never meet on equal terms again, Skkiru, she told him, with along, soulful glance that made his hearts sink down to his quiveringtoes, but I promise you there will never be anyone else for me\u2014andI hope that knowledge will inspire you to complete cooperation withBbulas.     If that doesn't, Bbulas said, I have other methods of inspiration.     All right, Skkiru answered sulkily. I'll go to the edge of thefield, and I'll speak broken Inter-galactic, and I'll forsake my normalhabits and customs, and I'll even      beg     . But I don't have to like doingit, and I don't intend to like doing it.     All three of Larhgan's eyes fuzzed with emotion. I'm proud of you,Skkiru, she said brokenly.     Bbulas sniffed. The three of them floated up to ground level in atriple silence.   <doc-sep> III     From a billion miles away, from a bourne unguessable thousands oflight-years distant, came the faint, far whisper of a voice. Nearer andnearer it came, and ever faster, till it throbbed upon Chip's eardrumswith booming savagery.     \u2014coming to, now. Good! We'll soon find out\u2014     Chip opened his eyes, too dazed, at first, to understand the situationin which he found himself. Gone was the familiar control-turret of the      Chickadee     , gone the bulger into which he had so hastily clambered. Helay on the parched, rocky soil of a\u2014a something. A planetoid, perhaps.And he was surrounded by a motley crew of strangers: scum of all theplanets that circle the Sun....     Then recollection flooded back upon him, sudden and complete. Thechase ... the call of the fateful Lorelei ... the crash! New strength,born of anger, surged through him. He lifted his head.     My\u2014my companions? he demanded weakly.     The leader of those who encircled him, a mighty hulk of a man, massiveof shoulder and thigh, black-haired, with an unshaven blue jaw,raven-bright eyes and a jutting, aquiline nose like the beak of a hawk,loosed a satisfied grunt.     Ah! Back to normal, eh, sailor? Damn near time!     Climbing to his feet sent a swift wave of giddiness through Chip\u2014buthe managed it. He fought down the vertigo which threatened to overwhelmhim, and confronted the big man boldly.     What, he stormed, is the meaning of this?     The giant stared at him for a moment, his jaw slack. Then hisraven-bright eyes glittered; he slapped a trunklike thigh and guffawedin boisterous mirth.     Hear that? he roared to his companions. Quite a guy, ain't he?'What's the meanin' o' this?' he asks! Game little fightin' cock, hey?Then he sobered abruptly, and a grim light replaced the amusement inhis eyes. Here was not a man to be trifled with, Chip realized. Histone assumed a biting edge. The meanin' is, my bucko, he answeredmirthlessly, that you've run afoul o' your last reef. Unless you havea sane head on your shoulders, and you're willing to talk fast andstraight!     Talk?     Don't stall. We've already unloaded your bins. We found it. And a nicehaul, too. Thanks for lettin' us know it was on the way. The burly onechuckled coarsely. We'd have took it, anyway, but you helped mattersout by comin' to us.     Johnny Haldane had been right, then. Chip remembered his friend'sominous warning. \u2014if your message was intercepted, you may haveplayed into the hands of\u2014 He said slowly, Then you      are     theLorelei's men?     The who? Never mind that, bucko, just talk. That ekalastron\u2014where didit come from?     And it occurred to Warren suddenly that although the big man      did     holdthe whip hand, he was still not in possession of the most importantsecret of all! While the location of the ekalastron mine remained asecret, a deadlock existed.     And if I won't tell\u2014? he countered shrewdly.     Why, then, sailor\u2014 The pirate leader's hamlike fists tightened, anda cold light glinted in his eyes\u2014why, then I guess maybe I'll have tobeat it out o' you!  "

        "Query": "Can you give me a brief summary of HOW TO MAKE FRIENDS?",
        "Summary_1": "William Manet is working in atmosphere seeder station 131-47 on Mars. He is completely alone, but doesn't fear loneliness, he welcomes it, and the idea that it might drive him mad one day. His job is to wait, looking out at the expanse of nothingness around him. He is an overseer, to prepare the atmosphere for colonization. One day, Manet thinks he sees a spaceship land near his station. He puts on his pressure suit and heads out to see what it is. As he walks towards it, he finds himself in a rustic log cabin, where a lean, tall man stands, waiting for him. The man calls himself \"Trader Tom\", and offers him a very interesting service. He tells Manet that he will give him a special credit card that will allow him to purchase anything he can think of. Manet's estate would cover the cost, and when Manet asks the man what would happen if he had no estate, Trader Tom simply says that this is a risk that he, and his business, take. Trader Tom asks what would Manet like, to which he replies: to not be alone. Manet signs some paperwork and is given the credit card. \nManet is given a box, it is called \"LIFO, the socialisation kit\". The box contains various items from a person's lifetime. On top is a book entitled \"The Making Of Friends and Others''. It orders the user to find the modifier, which Manet cannot locate. He goes to work anyway, on making his first friend with the tools inside the kit. \nHis first friend he creates is named Ronald. He seems sweet at first but his incessant optimism and lack of intelligence finally becomes too much for Manet. Manet decides to lock Ronald in a room away from him. He is stuck on this planet for the next eighteen years, and will need some kind of company. He goes to work on creating his second companion, a girl. \nVeronica is sweet, she talks kindly to Manet, and throws herself at him, which he swerves. Manet thinks her to be even more stupid than Ronald, and ends up striking her, which he finds he enjoys. He locks her in the same room as Ronald. \nManet once again goes back to the box, and goes to the last page of the handbook, entitled, \"The Final Model\". He creates this new being, whom he calls Victor. Victor jumps to life, and into the kit, destroying the item that Manet now realises was the modifier. Vitor explains to Manet that he is his enemy. He is just as intelligent as Manet, and is his designated adversary. Now that the modifier is destroyed, Manet will have no way to ever alter Veronica or Ronald, and will be stuck with the same silly, innocent people as he grows old. Manet will be bored for eighteen years. Manet replies to Victor, explaining, now that he has an enemy, he will never be bored. ",
        "Summary_2": "William Manet is an extremely lonely man and is the only human who works at his station. He is part of a small pressure group called the Workers\u2019 Union and works as an Overseer that focuses on the colonization of Mars. He cannot leave his job, but it has a high salary and good future opportunities. Manet sees a spaceship land nearby, and he begins to think he is hallucinating. He goes out to meet the spaceship, and the other man introduces himself as Trader Tom. He says that he serves the wants of spacemen and represents free enterprise. When Manet is suspicious, Tom explains that his businessmen have gone back to the barter system. Furthermore, Manet can also apply for the Trader Tom\u2019s Credit Card and have charges deducted from his estate as payment. He tells Tom that he wants to be alone, and Tom lets him sign a card. He is then given a socialization kit, to which Tom tells him that there have been no complaints about it so far. Manet ignores the box for as long as possible, but he eventually gives in and opens it. There is a collection of junk inside the box and a book titled The Making of Friends and Others. The book gives him instructions on how to create his friend. He then begins to play games with his new friend Ronald. He makes Ronald as somebody with opposite traits as him and enjoys knowing more than his new friend. After a while, however, Manet gets annoyed by Ronald, and the two of them fight. The time then skips to Spring, and Manet has locked Ronald away hoping that he will shut down by himself. He then gets a transmission from the B.B.C, explaining that the estimated time of departure for the Overseers was now eighteen years. Manet then goes back to the box, where he tries to find the Modifier amongst the many parts to shut down or change Ronald. Instead, he creates a girl named Veronica to keep him company. Veronica\u2019s personality is very shallow, and she constantly speaks of things that Manet considers stupid. He locks her up in the same place where he keeps Ronald, and both try to persuade him to let them out. Manet tries to find the Modifier again but instead finds the steps to create one final model. He does so and names it Victor. Suddenly, Victor destroys the Modifier and proclaims himself as Manet\u2019s enemy. He tells Manet that he will do everything he can to defeat him and. Victor says that his biggest accomplishment is destroying the Modifier, so Veronica, Ronald, and himself will continue to exist in the same way forever. Manet, however, is not afraid or concerned about Victor at all. He sees the \u201cenemy\u201d as an obstacle who must be triumphed and exclaims that he does not need friends if he has Victor as an enemy. ",
        "Summary_3": "William Manet is a man stranded alone on Mars. He has taken a job as an Overseer, hired to monitor several Seeders scattered on the planet in order to prepare Earth for colonization of the planet. Though the job is well-paying, Manet is to be at his station indefinitely, alone. Initially, Manet liked the idea of being alone, but he quickly became bored and lonely, and anticipated his madness. One day, Manet sees a ship landing on the surface of Mars outside; he is wary of his own mind and wonders if it is a hallucination, but he approaches the ship anyway, where he enters a cabin and meets a strange man, who refers to himself as Trader Tom. Trader Tom introduces himself and his business, which aims to serve spacemen through a bartering system. Manet is skeptical as to how such a business could exist, and how he would be able to afford whatever services are provided. Trader Tom asks Manet what it is that he wants, to which Manet expresses his loneliness. He gives Manet a Socialization Kit, which is meant to replicate human interaction. Manet makes the deal, but waits a while to open the box. When he finally decides to, he comes across a manual, which advises Manet to find the Modifier inside the kit, which is critical. However, Manet is unable to find the Modifier, as he does not know what it looks like. He ends up creating Ronald, meant to be a companion who is cheerful, pleasant, yet not as smart as Manet. Manet soon becomes tired and irritated with Ronald's repetitive nature, wearing out the same dialogue and topics of conversation. Eventually, Manet locks Ronald in his file room. He later gets a message from the B.B.C, explaining that though his estimated stay time had previously been longer, it has lowered to 18 years. Still unable to locate the Modifier, Manet creates a woman, Veronica, who also ends up being too submissive and repetitive for his taste, and he locks her in with Ronald. Manet comes across instructions for creating \"The Final Model\", which spawns Victor, who immediately destroys what must have been the Modifier. Victor explains that he is not a friend for Manet, but an enemy, meant to challenge and defeat him. Manet realizes that Victor will cure his boredom by presenting obstacles for him to work around every day.",

He has accepted a useless position of an overseer of a station on Mars, all alone in the desert. The salary is high but nothing is provided regarding the overseer having some human interactions or commodities. One day Manet sees a spaceship and is unsure whether it is a hallucination. Nevertheless, he enters a strange cabin and a man offers him a good whiskey. To Manet's astonishment, it turns out the spaceship is created by a free enterprise to serve the spacemen. Manet says to the service that he wants not to be alone and gets a box, the cost is unknown. He doesn't open the box until he decides he is mad. In the box there is a socialization kit with instructions. Then a game follows between Manet and someone called Ronald and a dialogue about war takes place. Very soon, Manet gets bored and tired of his companion, turns out Ronald was a copy of a human with features Manet himself picked. One day Manet listens to BBC and hears that his time left on Mars is 18 years for now. He tries to find the modifier and change Ronald, in the next scene a girl called Veronica appears. She is a submissive and seductive human copy who took the place of Ronald. She is even more stupid and backward in knowledge than her predecessor, Ronald, who has been locked this whole time which was months. Now Veronica joins Ronald in the locked room. In a while the final model pages open up in the instructions and Manet creates Victor. Victor possesses all the knowledge Manet has and is created to defeat Manet, Victor destroys the modifier and wants to make the overseer upset by that.

But thequestions fell into a pattern that was far from casual, and Ish couldsee the small button-mike of a portable tape-recorder nestling under theman's lapel.     Been working your own way for the last seventeen years, haven't you?MacKenzie seemed to mumble in a perfectly clear voice.     Ish nodded.     How's that?     The corners of Isherwood's mouth twitched, and he said Yes for therecorder's benefit.     Odd jobs, first of all?     Something like that. Anything I could get, the first few months. AfterI was halfway set up, I stuck to garages and repair shops.     Out at the airports around Miami, mostly, wasn't it?     Ahuh.     Took some of your pay in flying lessons.     Right.     MacKenzie's face passed no judgements\u2014he simply hunched in his chair,seemingly dwarfed by the shoulders of his perfectly tailored suit, hisstubby fingers twiddling a Phi Beta Kappa key. He was a spare man\u2014onlya step or two away from emaciation. Occasionally, he pushed a tiredstrand of washed-out hair away from his forehead.     Ish answered him truthfully, without more than ordinary reservations.This was the man who could ground him He was dangerous\u2014red-letterdangerous\u2014because of it.     No family.     Ish shrugged. Not that I know of. Cut out at seventeen. My father wasmaking good money. He had a pension plan, insurance policies. No need toworry about them.     Ish knew the normal reaction a statement like that should have brought.MacKenzie's face did not go into a blank of repression\u2014but it stillpassed no judgements.     How's things between you and the opposite sex?     About normal.     No wife\u2014no steady girl.     Not a very good idea, in my racket.     MacKenzie grunted.

Ish was on his feet, his fists clenched, the blood throbbing in histemple veins. What! he roared.     MacKenzie seemed to collapse in his chair.

Well, your professional lingo's slipping, Doc.They did put      some     learning in my head at college, you know. Therapy,hell! Testing maybe, but you sure didn't do anything to help me!

Twelvehours, twenty-two minutes, and four days to go.     Damn! He was late for the briefing. Odd\u2014that fool psychiatrist hadn'tseemed to take up that much of his time.     He shrugged. What difference did it make? As he strode down the hall, helost his momentary puzzlement under the flood of realization thatnothing could stop him now, that the last hurdle was beaten. He wasgoing. He was going, and if there were faint echoes of Marty! ringingin the dark background of his mind, they only served to push him faster,as they always had. Nothing but death could stop him now.     <doc-sep> By chance, a mobile television unit was at that moment on the BeltParkway, returning from having seen off a prime minister at IdlewildAirport. This unit was at once diverted to Canarsie, where it took up aposition across the street from the scene of carnage and went to workwith a Zoomar lens.     In the meantime, Mister Higgins had barricaded himself in his house,firing at anything that moved.     The two cameramen in the mobile unit worked their hearts out. Oneconcentrated on the movements of the police and firemen and neighborsand ambulance attendants, while the other used the Zoomar lens tosearch for Mr. Higgins. He found him occasionally, offering the at-homeaudience brief glimpses of a stocky balding man in brown trousers andundershirt, stalking from window to window on the second floor of thehouse.     The show lasted for nearly an hour. There were policemen everywhere,and firemen everywhere, and neighbors milling around down at thecorner, where the police had roped the block off, and occasionally Mr.Higgins would stick his rifle out a window and shoot at somebody. Thepolice used loudspeakers to tell Higgins he might as well give up, theyhad the place surrounded and could eventually starve him out anyway.Higgins used his own good lungs to shout obscenities back and challengeanyone present to hand-to-hand combat.     The police fired tear gas shells at the house, but it was a windy dayand all the windows in the Higgins house were either open or broken.Higgins was able to throw all the shells back out of the house again.     The show lasted for nearly an hour. Then it ended, suddenly anddramatically.     Higgins had showed himself to the Zoomar lens again, for the purpose ofshooting either the camera or its operator. All at once he yelped andthrew the rifle away. The rifle bounced onto the porch roof, slithereddown to the edge, hung for a second against the drain, and finally fellbarrel first onto the lawn.     Meanwhile, Higgins was running through the house, shouting like awounded bull. He thundered down the stairs and out, hollering, to fallinto the arms of the waiting police.     They had trouble holding him. At first they thought he was actuallytrying to get away, but then one of them heard what it was he wasshouting: My hands! My hands!     They looked at his hands. The palms and the palm-side of the fingerswere red and blistering, from what looked like severe burns. There wasanother burn on his right cheek and another one on his right shoulder.     Higgins, thoroughly chastened and bewildered, was led away for burnointment and jail. The television crew went on back to Manhattan. Theneighbors went home and telephoned their friends.     On-duty policemen had been called in from practically all of theprecincts in Brooklyn. Among them was Detective-Sergeant WilliamStevenson. Stevenson frowned thoughtfully at Higgins as that unhappyindividual was led away, and then strolled over to look at the rifle.He touched the stock, and it was somewhat warm but that was all.     He picked it up and turned it around. There, on the other side of thestock, burned into the wood, were the crudely-shaped letters, TheScorpion.  "

        "Summary_1": "The story takes place on Mars. Manet is the sole occupant of the Atmosphere Seeder Station 131-47. There is nothing to be seen in any direction far beyond the horizon. Mars is described like a blank canvas. It is a boring, desolate place, which only adds to Manet's feelings of loneliness and boredom. Manet crosses from his station to Trader Tom's starship at the beginning of the story. The inner compartment of the ship is like that of a log cabin. There is a slate fireplace with black and orange log charring. The fireplace holds a crackling fire. Manet moves through different rooms in his station throughout the story. When Manet first gets the box, he puts it by a transparent wall in one of the rooms of the station. He moves from his bedroom, the file room, the tube way, to communication, to an area where he plays chess with Ronald, to the solarium,  to another room where he eventually locks both Ronald and Veronica.",

The station itself is all cybernetically controlled, and all Manet has to do is sit there to monitor everything as the Overseer. The station itself is located in the middle of a chalk desert, and it is always completely barren with miles of white sand. There are many amenities at the station, including a File Room and a radio to receive transmissions from. Apart from the File Room, there is also a solarium where Manet keeps the box from Trader Tom.

LAFFERTY     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Worlds of If Science Fiction, March 1961.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      The protozoic recorder chirped like a bird. Not only would there belife traces on that little moon, but it would be a lively place. Sothey skipped several steps in the procedure.     The chordata discerner read      Positive     over most of the surface. Therewas spinal fluid on that orb, rivers of it. So again they omittedseveral tests and went to the cognition scanner. Would it show Thoughton the body?     Naturally they did not get results at once, nor did they expect to; itrequired a fine adjustment. But they were disappointed that they foundnothing for several hours as they hovered high over the rotation. Thenit came\u2014clearly and definitely, but from quite a small location only.     Limited, said Steiner, as though within a pale. As though there werebut one city, if that is its form. Shall we follow the rest of thesurface to find another, or concentrate on this? It'll be twelve hoursbefore it's back in our ken if we let it go now.     Let's lock on this one and finish the scan. Then we can do the rest ofthe world to make sure we've missed nothing, said Stark.     There was one more test to run, one very tricky and difficult ofanalysis, that with the Extraordinary Perception Locator. This wasdesigned simply to locate a source of superior thought. But this mightbe so varied or so unfamiliar that often both the machine and thedesigner of it were puzzled as to how to read the results.     The E. P. Locator had been designed by Glaser. But when the Locatorhad refused to read      Positive     when turned on the inventor himself,bad blood developed between machine and man. Glaser knew that he hadextraordinary perception. He was a much honored man in his field. Hetold the machine so heatedly.     The machine replied, with such warmth that its relays chattered, thatGlaser did      not     have extraordinary perception; he had only ordinaryperception to an extraordinary degree. There is a      difference     , themachine insisted.     It was for this reason that Glaser used that model no more, but builtothers more amenable. And it was for this reason also that the ownersof Little Probe had acquired the original machine so cheaply.     And there was no denying that the Extraordinary Perception Locator (orEppel) was a contrary machine. On Earth it had read      Positive     on anumber of crack-pots, including Waxey Sax, a jazz tootler who could noteven read music. But it had also read      Positive     on ninety per cent ofthe acknowledged superior minds of the Earth. In space it had been asound guide to the unusual intelligences encountered. Yet on Suzuki-Miit had read      Positive     on a two-inch-long worm, only one of them out ofbillions. For the countless identical worms no trace of anything at allwas shown by the test.     So it was with mixed expectations that Steiner locked onto the areaand got a flick. He then narrowed to a smaller area (apparently oneindividual, though this could not be certain) and got very definiteaction. Eppel was busy. The machine had a touch of the ham in it, andassumed an air of importance when it ran these tests.     Finally it signaled the result, the most exasperating result it everproduces: the single orange light. It was the equivalent of the shrugof the shoulders in a man. They called it the You tell      me     light.     So among the intelligences there was at least one that might beextraordinary, though possibly in a crackpot way. It is good to beforewarned.   <doc-sep> She was not only trying to get me to commit nonconformity, but makingheretical remarks besides. I awoke that time and half-expected a Deaconto pop out of the tube and turn his electric club upon me.     And I heard the voice nearly every night.     It hammered away.           What if you do fail? Almost anything would be better than themiserable existence you're leading now!          One morning I even caught myself wondering just how I'd go about thisidea of hers. Wondering what the first step might be.     She seemed to read my thoughts. That night she said,       Consult the cybsin the Govpub office. If you look hard enough and long enough, you'llfind a way.          Now, on this morning of the seventeenth day in the ninth month,I ate my boiled egg slowly and actually toyed with the idea. Ithought of being on productive status again. I had almost lost myfanatical craving to be useful to the State, but I did want to bebusy\u2014desperately. I didn't want to be despised any more. I didn'twant to be lonely. I wanted to reproduce myself.     I made my decision suddenly. Waves of emotion carried me along. I gotup, crossed the room to the directory, and pushbuttoned to find thelocation of the nearest Govpub office.     I didn't know what would happen and almost didn't care.      II     Like most important places, the Govpub Office in Center Four wasunderground. I could have taken a tunnelcar more quickly, but it seemedpleasanter to travel topside. Or maybe I just wanted to put this off abit. Think about it. Compose myself.     At the entrance to the Govpub warren there was a big director cyb, aplate with a speaker and switch. The sign on it said to switch it onand get close to the speaker and I did.     The cyb's mechanical voice\u2014they never seem to get the th soundsright\u2014said, This is Branch Four of the Office of GovernmentPublications. Say, 'Publications,' and/or, 'Information desired,' asthoroughly and concisely as possible. Use approved voice and standardphraseology.     Well, simple enough so far. I had always rather prided myself on myknack for approved voice, those flat, emotionless tones that indicateefficiency. And I would never forget how to speak Statese. I said,Applicant desires all pertinent information relative assignment,change or amendment of State Serial designations, otherwise generallyreferred to as nomenclature.     There was a second's delay while the audio patterns tripped relays andbrought the memory tubes in.     Then the cyb said, Proceed to Numbering and Identity section. Consultalphabetical list and diagram on your left for location of same.     Thanks, I said absent-mindedly.     I started to turn away and the cyb said, Information on tanks ismilitary information and classified. State authorization for\u2014     I switched it off.   <doc-sep> She didn't answer; she kept her eyes straight ahead and I saw the faintspot of color on her cheek.     I had a sudden impulse to ask her to meet me after hours at oneof the rec centers. If it had been my danger alone, I might have,but I couldn't very well ask her to risk discovery of a haphazard,unauthorized arrangement like that and the possibility of going to thepsycho-scan.     We came to a turn in the corridor and something happened; I'm not surejust how it happened. I keep telling myself that my movements were notactually deliberate. I was to the right of her. The turn was to theleft. She turned quickly, and I didn't, so that I bumped into her,knocking her off balance. I grabbed her to keep her from falling.     For a moment we stood there, face to face, touching each other lightly.I held her by the arms. I felt the primitive warmth of her breath. Oureyes held together ... proton ... electron ... I felt her tremble.     She broke from my grip suddenly and started off again.     After that she was very business-like.     We came finally to the controls of Bank 29 and she stood before themand began to press button combinations. I watched her work; I watchedher move. I had almost forgotten why I'd come here. The lights blinkedon and off and the typers clacked softly as the machine sorted outinformation.     She had a long printed sheet from the roll presently. She frowned atit and turned to me. You can take this along and study it, she said,but I'm afraid what you have in mind may be\u2014a little difficult.     She must have guessed what I had in mind. I said, I didn't think itwould be easy.     It seems that the only agency authorized to change a State Serialunder any circumstances is Opsych.     Opsych? You can't keep up with all these departments.     The Office of Psychological Adjustment. They can change you if you gofrom a lower to higher E.A.C.     I don't get it, exactly.     As she spoke I had the idea that there was sympathy in her voice. Justan overtone. Well, she said, as you know, the post a person isqualified to hold often depends largely on his Emotional AdjustmentCategory. Now if he improves and passes from, let us say, Grade 3 toGrade 4, he will probably change his place of work. In order to protecthim from any associative maladjustments developed under the old E.A.C,he is permitted a new number.     I groaned. But I'm already in the highest E.A.C.!     It looks very uncertain then.     Sometimes I think I'd be better off in the mines, or onMarscol\u2014or\u2014in the hell of the pre-atomics!     She looked amused. What did you say your E.A.C. was?     Oh, all right. Sorry. I controlled myself and grinned. I guess thiswhole thing has been just a little too much for me. Maybe my E.A.C.'seven gone down.     That might be your chance then.     How do you mean?     If you could get to the top man in Opsych and demonstrate that yournumber has inadvertently changed your E.A.C., he might be able tojustify a change.     By the State, he might! I punched my palm. Only how do I get to him?     I can find his location on the cyb here. Center One, the capital, fora guess. You'll have to get a travel permit to go there, of course.Just a moment.     She worked at the machine again, trying it on general data. The printedslip came out a moment later and she read it to me. Chief, Opsych, wasin the capital all right. It didn't give the exact location of hisoffice, but it did tell how to find the underground bay in Center Onecontaining the Opsych offices.     We headed back through the passageway then and she kept well ahead ofme. I couldn't keep my eyes from her walk, from the way she walked witheverything below her shoulders. My blood was pounding at my templesagain.     I tried to keep the conversation going. Do you think it'll be hard toget a travel permit?     Not impossible. My guess is that you'll be at Travbur all daytomorrow, maybe even the next day. But you ought to be able to swing itif you hold out long enough.     I sighed. I know. It's that way everywhere in Northem. Our motto oughtto be, 'Why make it difficult when with just a little more effort youcan make it impossible?'  "

        "Query": "What kind of connection exists between Ronald and Manet in the story of HOW TO MAKE FRIENDS?",
        "Summary_1": "Ronald is Manet's first self-made friend. He constructs him using the parts he finds in the LIFO kit, and follows the manual to put him together properly. Their relationship seems jovial enough at first. They play chess together. Ronald eliminates the loneliness that Manet feels for a short time. Manet had purposely made Ronald to be cheerful, submissive and co-operative. Manet wanted Ronald to be as different to himself as he could be. Manet enjoys the fact that Ronald is not as intelligent as him. They talk about various wars, and Daniel Boone. After a while though, Manet becomes incensed by Ronalds endless, mindless droning about these same topics. Manet begins to fight Ronald, to which Ronald participates, only to please his creator. He is so fed up with Ronald eventually that he locks him in a room, and doesn't let him out. ",
        "Summary_2": "Ronald and Manet have a relationship that is initially friendly but later becomes very one-sided. Since Manet created Ronald from The Making of Friends and Others manual, all of his traits were chosen by his creator. He is cheerful, cooperative, and submissive. All of these traits make him the polar opposite of Manet. He is also suppressed in terms of intelligence, aggressiveness, and a sense of perfection. Manet and he start off playing games together, most of which almost always end in a tie. They also talk about topics such as the Korean War, Daniel Boone, New York swing, and the painting of Norman Rockwell, amongst a few other topics. Manet initially enjoys being smarter, but he is later sick of Ronald constantly talking about the same subjects. Although he knows that Ronald is only a copy of a human, he still cannot help but want to beat up his self-made friend after calling him a jerk. Manet is furious at the fact that Ronald would stupidly do anything to avoid any trouble with him. This eventually escalates to the point where Ronald is locked away and practically discarded by Manet despite being able to exist forever. ",
        "Summary_3": "Ronald is originally a companion for Manet. He is friendly, obedient, and peaceful, though purposefully not as intelligent as Manet. The two initially get along, their quality time mainly consisting of chess games and conversations about the Korean War and Daniel Boone. Manet eventually becomes irritated with Ronald, but Ronald still attempts to cater to his needs, even getting into a fistfight with Manet. Even when Manet locks Ronald into the file cabinet, Ronald remains cheerful through his pleading. He is oblivious to Manet's hatred and aims to please him no matter what, which enrages Manet even more.",
        "Summary_4": "Manet felt extremely lonely and desired communication, he created Ronald, a copy of a human from the socialization kit, as totally opposed to himself. Ronald's features were to be cheerful, submissive, cooperative, peaceful, not as intelligent and aggressive as Manet. The two play, talk and fight, but Manet gets bored and intimidated by Ronald very soon. Ronald's narrow interests make Manet angry and he wants to change Ronald all the way but can not find the modifier. Eventually, Manet is so tired of Ronald constantly talking about the same stupid things that he locks the creation in a room for months. ",

Manet puttered around the spawning monster, trying to brush the coppertaste of the station out of his mouth in the mornings, talking tohimself, winking at Annie Oakley, and waiting to go mad.     Finally, Manet woke up one morning. He lay in the sheets of his bunk,suppressing the urge to go wash his hands, and came at last to theconclusion that, after all the delay, he was mad.     So he went to open the box.     The cardboard lid seemed to have become both brittle and rotten. Itcrumbled as easily as ideals. But Manet was old enough to remember theboxes Japanese toys came in when he was a boy, and was not alarmed.

The edges were ridged as if there were pages tothis section, but they could only be the tracks of lame ants.     Manet flipped back to page one.     First find the      Modifier     in your kit. This is      vital     to your entireexperiment in socialization. The      Modifier is Part #A-1     on the MasterChart.     He prowled through the box looking for some kind of a chart. Therewas nothing that looked like a chart inside. He retrieved the lid andlooked at its inside. Nothing. He tipped the box and looked at itsoutside. Not a thing. There was always something missing from kits.Maybe even the      Modifier     itself.     He read on, and probed and scattered the parts in the long box. Hestudied the manual intently and groped out with his free hand.     The toe bone was connected to the foot bone....       The Red King sat smugly in his diagonal corner.     The Black King stood two places away, his top half tipsy in frustration.     The Red King crabbed sideways one square.     The Black King pounced forward one space.     The Red King advanced backwards to face the enemy.     The Black King shuffled sideways.     The Red King followed....     Uselessly.     Tie game, Ronald said.     Tie game, Manet said.     Let's talk, Ronald said cheerfully. He was always cheerful.     Cheerfulness was a personality trait Manet had thumbed out for him.Cheerful. Submissive. Co-operative. Manet had selected these factors inorder to make Ronald as different a person from himself as possible.     The Korean-American War was the greatest of all wars, Ronald saidpontifically.     Only in the air, Manet corrected him.     Intelligence was one of the factors Manet had punched to suppress.Intelligence. Aggressiveness. Sense of perfection. Ronald couldn't knowany more than Manet, but he could (and did) know less. He had seen tothat when his own encephalograph matrix had programmed Ronald's feeder.     There were no dogfights in Korea, Ronald said.     I know.     The dogfight was a combat of hundreds of planes in a tight area, thelast of which took place near the end of the First World War. Theaerial duel, sometimes inaccurately referred to as a 'dogfight' was notseen in Korea either. The pilots at supersonic speeds only had time forsingle passes at the enemy. Still, I believe, contrary to all experts,that this took greater skill, man more wedded to machine, than theleisurely combats of World War One.     I know.     Daniel Boone was still a crack shot at eight-five. He was said to bewarm, sincere, modest, truthful, respected and rheumatic.     I know.   <doc-sep> Ronald's cries grew louder as Manet marched Veronica through thecorridor.     Hear that? he inquired, smiling with clenched teeth.     No, darling.     Well, that was all right. He remembered he had once told her to ignorethe noise. She was still following orders.     Come on, Bill, open up the hatch for old Ronald, the voice carriedthrough sepulchrally.     Shut up! Manet yelled.     The voice dwindled stubbornly, then cut off.     A silence with a whisper of metallic ring to it.     Why hadn't he thought of that before? Maybe because he secretly tookcomfort in the sound of an almost human voice echoing through thestation.     Manet threw back the bolt and wheeled back the hatch.     Ronald looked just the same as had when Manet had seen him last. Hishands didn't seem to have been worn away in the least. Ronald's lipsseemed a trifle chapped. But that probably came not from all theshouting but from having nothing to drink for some months.     Ronald didn't say anything to Manet.     But he looked offended.     You, Manet said to Veronica with a shove in the small of the back,inside, inside.     Ronald sidestepped the lurching girl.     Do you know what I'm going to do with you? Manet demanded. I'm goingto lock you up in here, and leave you for a day, a month, a year,forever! Now what do you think about that?     If you think it's the      right     thing, dear, Veronica said hesitantly.     You know best, Willy, Ronald said uncertainly.     Manet slammed the hatch in disgust.     Manet walked carefully down the corridor, watching streamers ofhis reflection corkscrewing into the curved walls. He had to walkcarefully, else the artery would roll up tight and squash him. But hewalked too carefully for this to happen.     As he passed the File Room, Ronald's voice said: In my opinion,William, you should let us out.     I, Veronica said, honestly feel that you should let me out, Bill,dearest.     Manet giggled. What? What was that? Do you suggest that I take youback after you've been behind a locked door with my best friend?     He went down the corridor, giggling.     He giggled and thought: This will never do.   <doc-sep> Manet knew it all. He had heard it all before.     He was so damned sick of hearing about Korean air battles, DanielBoone, the literary qualities of ancient sports fiction magazines,the painting of Norman Rockwell, New York swing,      ad nauseum     . What anarrow band of interests! With the whole universe to explore in thoughtand concept, why did he have to be trapped with such an unoriginalhuman being?     Of course, Ronald wasn't an original human being. He was a copy.     Manet had been interested in the Fabulous Forties\u2014Lt. Hoot Gibson,Sam Merwin tennis stories,      Saturday Evening Post     covers\u2014when he hadfirst learned of them, and he had learned all about them. He had firmopinions on all these.     He yearned for someone to challenge him\u2014to say that      Dime Sports     hadbeen nothing but a cheap yellow rag and, why,      Sewanee Review     , therehad been a magazine for you.     Manet's only consolidation was that Ronald's tastes were lower than hisown. He patriotically insisted that the American Sabre Jet was superiorto the Mig. He maintained with a straight face that Tommy Dorsey was abetter band man than Benny Goodman. Ronald was a terrific jerk.     Ronald, Manet said, you are a terrific jerk.     Ronald leaped up immediately and led with his right.     Manet blocked it deftly and threw a right cross.     Ronald blocked it deftly, and drove in a right to the navel.     The two men separated and, puffing like steam locomotives passing thediesel works, closed again.     Ronald leaped forward and led with his right.     Manet stepped inside the swing and lifted an uppercut to the ledge ofRonald's jaw.     Ronald pinwheeled to the floor.     He lifted his bruised head from the deck and worked his reddened mouth.Had enough? he asked Manet.     Manet dropped his fists to his sides and turned away. Yes.     Ronald hopped up lightly. Another checkers, Billy Boy?     No.     Okay. Anything you want, William, old conquerer.     Manet scrunched up inside himself in impotent fury.     Ronald was maddeningly co-operative and peaceful. He would even get ina fist fight to avoid trouble between them. He would do anything Manetwanted him to do. He was so utterly damned stupid.     Manet's eyes orbitted towards the checkerboard.     But if he were so much more stupid than he, Manet, why was it thattheir checker games always ended in a tie?  "

        "Query": "What is the function of the modifier in HOW TO MAKE FRIENDS?",
        "Summary_1": "When Manet first looks into the LIFO kit, there are a number of strange objects inside. On the top of the box is a manual on how to create these new beings, designed for companionship. In the manual, it clearly states that it is of the utmost importance to first find the modifier in the kit. It could be seen in the first part of the master chart. The only problem was, the master chart is missing. Without the master chart, Manet has no way of knowing what the modifier looked like. He decides to create these companions without it regardless. It only becomes clear what the modifier is used for towards the end of the story. When Victor is created, he immediately leaps inside the box, smashing up something Manet thinks to be a flesh sprayer. When it is destroyed, Manet finally realises that it is in fact, the Modifier. Victor explains the modifier's purpose. The modifier is used to change the artificial beings. They are created based on the creator's likes and dislikes. But, as Manet matures, and he grows out of his initial preferences, he would have the modifier to change his companions to fit his new preferences. With this gone, he is stuck with the same Ronald, Veronica and Victor for the next eighteen years. ",
        "Summary_2": "The purpose of the Modifier is for the user to remove or change whatever type of companion they create. It is an essential part of the socialization experiment, and the manual recommends that finding it is a vital step. Since Manet\u2019s Master Chart is lost, he has no idea what the Modifier looks like and cannot locate it until the very end when Victor destroys it. The Modifier is what Manet needs to disable or change the companions he created, which would undo his dissatisfaction with them. To Victor, the purpose of the Modifier is an object that he must destroy as Manet\u2019s enemy. Since the Modifier is essentially the solution, Victor destroys it in an attempt to defeat Manet. ",
        "Summary_3": "The Modifier is a part of the Socialization Kit that is described as its most vital element. However, it is indistinguishable from the rest of the kit, causing it to be unrecognizable. The Modifier is used to make amends to the people Manet creates from the kit, or to shut the people off altogether. In Manet's case, the Modifier would be helpful in solving his issues with both Manet and Veronica, and allow him to create new people that would appeal to him more. Without the Modifier, which Victor destroys at the end of the story, Manet is stuck with Ronald and Veronica indefinitely, unable to change them.",
        "Summary_4": "Modifier is vital for the socialization experiment and it is in the kit. It is needed to change or to turn off the created human copy, Ronald in this case. In the very end, it turns out to be one of the flesh-sprayers. With the modifier, Manet is the creator, he is in charge, he can do whatever he pleases with all those he has created. Without it he is powerless to change something or destroy the human copies. The modifier is vital because it is the key to the whole kit, the remote controller. ",
        "Article": "Pouring and tumbling through the Lifo kit, consulting the manualdiligently, Manet concluded that there weren't enough parts left in thebox to go around.     The book gave instructions for The Model Mother, The Model Father, TheModel Sibling and others. Yet there weren't parts enough in the kit.     He would have to take parts from Ronald or Veronica in order to makeany one of the others. And he could not do that without the Modifier.     He wished Trader Tom would return and extract some higher price fromhim for the Modifier, which was clearly missing from the kit.     Or to get even more for simply repossessing the kit.     But Trader Tom would not be back. He came this way only once.     Manet thumbed through the manual in mechanical frustration. As he didso, the solid piece of the last section parted sheet by sheet.     He glanced forward and found the headings:      The Final Model     .     There seemed something ominous about that finality. But he had paida price for the kit, hadn't he? Who knew what price, when it came tothat? He had every right to get everything out of the kit that hecould.     He read the unfolding page critically. The odd assortment ofill-matched parts left in the box took a new shape in his mind andunder his fingers....     Manet gave one final spurt from the flesh-sprayer and stood back.     Victor was finished. Perfect.     Manet stepped forward, lifted the model's left eyelid, tweaked his nose.     Move!     Victor leaped back into the Lifo kit and did a jig on one of theflesh-sprayers.     As the device twisted as handily as good intentions, Manet realizedthat it was not a flesh-sprayer but the Modifier.     It's finished! were Victor's first words. It's done!     Manet stared at the tiny wreck. To say the least.     Victor stepped out of the oblong box. There is something you shouldunderstand. I am different from the others.     They all say that.     I am not your friend.     No?     No. You have made yourself an enemy.     Manet felt nothing more at this information than an esthetic pleasureat the symmetry of the situation.     It completes the final course in socialization, Victor continued. Iam your adversary. I will do everything I can to defeat you. I have      all     your knowledge.      You     do not have all your knowledge. If you letyourself know some of the things, it could be used against you. It ismy function to use everything I possibly can against you.     When do you start?     I've finished. I've done my worst. I have destroyed the Modifier.     What's so bad about that? Manet asked with some interest.     You'll have Veronica and Ronald and me forever now. We'll neverchange. You'll get older, and we'll never change. You'll lose yourinterest in New York swing and jet combat and Daniel Boone, and we'llnever change. We don't change and you can't change us for others. I'vemade the worst thing happen to you that can happen to any man.      I'veseen that you will always keep your friends.        <doc-sep> Manet didn't open the box.

Let's talk, Ronald said cheerfully. He was always cheerful.     Cheerfulness was a personality trait Manet had thumbed out for him.Cheerful. Submissive. Co-operative.

Now you will have but to lean back, as it were, so to speak, and seeme suffer?           Yes.          No. Can't do it, old man. Can't.      I     know. You're too human, toolike me. The one thing a man can't accept is a passive state, a stateof uselessness. Not if he can possibly avoid it. Something has to behappening to him. He has to be happening to something. You didn't killme because then you would have nothing left to do. You'll never killme.     Of course not! Victor stormed. Fundamental safety cut-off!     Rationalization. You don't      want     to kill me. And you can't stopchallenging me at every turn. That's your function.     Stop talking and just think about your miserable life, Victor saidmeanly. Your friends won't grow and mature with you. You won't makeany new friends. You'll have me to constantly remind you of youruselessness, your constant unrelenting sterility of purpose. How's thatfor boredom, for passiveness?     That's what I'm trying to tell you, Manet said irritably, his socialmanners rusty. I won't be bored. You will see to that. It's yourpurpose. You'll be a challenge, an obstacle, a source of triumph everyfoot of the way. Don't you see? With you for an enemy, I don't need afriend!   "

        "Query": "In what way is Manet's insanity depicted in the narrative of HOW TO MAKE FRIENDS?",
        "Summary_1": "When we first meet William Manet, he thinks it is inevitable that he will go insane, and even welcomes it. He would get \"fat and dirty\" and he would become animalistic and create a god complex for himself. He quickly slips into madness in his isolation, making notes for lectures to give to no one in particular, a picture of Annie Oakley, winking at him on more than one occasion. The idea of madness is also brought up in the illusive character of \"Trader Tom\". It is not clear whether he or his spaceship are real at all, when it is said that Manet \"Thinks\" he sees the ship one day. There is no definitive answer as to how he gets onto the ship, or who or what Trader Tom works for. When Manet finishes the glass of whiskey, it becomes instantly clean, like he had never drank from it. His ship is also very strange, with a fireplace in it. We can later see Manet's madness in his violent outbursts. We first see him beat up Ronald, and then Veronica. His madness is truly shown when he exclaims that he should have started beating women much sooner. It is unclear throughout the whole story whether any of this took place in the real world, or whether it was all in Manet's head. ",
        "Summary_2": "Manet\u2019s madness is portrayed in the story as his continuous creations of friends and treatment towards Victor. Instead of being satisfied with his ideal friend, he ends up creating three companions, all of whom he immensely dislikes after some time. Furthermore, when Victor tells him that he has trapped Manet with the three copies forever, the other man does not seem to be frightened or fazed. Manet only says that Victor is too human-like and that a man cannot accept being in a passive state. He also says that Victor will never kill him because it means that there will be nothing for him to do after. Even though Victor tries to insult his life, Manet\u2019s madness has prevented him from caring and only finds his presence as entertainment that will never make him bored. Manet\u2019s madness grows throughout the socialization experiment, and it becomes extremely apparent when the confrontation with Victor happens. ",
        "Summary_3": "Manet's madness starts out as an inevitable concept, which he is aware of himself when he takes the job as an Overseer. He anticipates going mad from loneliness and boredom, but the madness comes sooner than expected. He begins to talk to himself and interact with inanimate objects, such as the photo of Annie Oakley he keeps on his wall. Eventually, his madness progresses, which he embraces, such as how he pretends that the machine will destroy him from the inside. Manet then begins to question his own madness and its abilities to make him hallucinate, specifically when Trader Tom's ship lands in front of him. Later on in the story, Manet's madness is not from loneliness, but from rage and irritation, which is then manifested through violence taken out on Ronald and Veronica.",
        "Summary_4": "The story starts with Manet's curiosity as some sort of an experiment regarding how fast will he go crazy. He even desires this madness to come because he is bored and lonely, and this thoughts about madness keep him interested at least. He talks to himself and to a portrait, sometimes believing it talks back. When a ship arrives neither he nor the readers can be sure whether it is a hallucination or not. He starts believing in aliens and even when he thinks of the spaceship as a hallucination, he likes the thought of dementia in this loneliness, which is not a healthy thought, but rather a sign of madness.

        "Article": "Manet didn't open the box. He let it fade quietly in the filtered butstill brilliant sunlight near a transparent wall.     Manet puttered around the spawning monster, trying to brush the coppertaste of the station out of his mouth in the mornings, talking tohimself, winking at Annie Oakley, and waiting to go mad.     Finally, Manet woke up one morning. He lay in the sheets of his bunk,suppressing the urge to go wash his hands, and came at last to theconclusion that, after all the delay, he was mad.     So he went to open the box.     The cardboard lid seemed to have become both brittle and rotten. Itcrumbled as easily as ideals. But Manet was old enough to remember theboxes Japanese toys came in when he was a boy, and was not alarmed.     The contents were such a glorious pile of junk, of bottles from oldchemistry sets, of pieces from old Erector sets, of nameless things andunremembered antiques from neglected places, that it seemed too good tohave been assembled commercially. It was the collection of lifetime.     On top of everything was a paperbound book, the size of the      Reader'sDigest     , covered in rippled gray flexiboard. The title was stamped inblack on the spine and cover:      The Making of Friends     .     Manet opened the book and, turning one blank page, found the titlein larger print and slightly amplified:      The Making of Friends andOthers     . There was no author listed.

He quickly riffled through the pages.      Other Friends, Authority, ACompanion     .... Then      The Final Model     . Manet tried to flip past thissection, but the pages after the sheet labeled      The Final Model     werestuck together. More than stuck. There was a thick slab of plastic inthe back of the book. The edges were ridged as if there were pages tothis section, but they could only be the tracks of lame ants.     Manet flipped back to page one.     First find the      Modifier     in your kit.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]       Every lonely man tries to make friends.     Manet just didn't know when to stop!      William Manet was alone.     In the beginning, he had seen many advantages to being alone. It wouldgive him an unprecedented opportunity to once and for all correlateloneliness to the point of madness, to see how long it would take himto start slavering and clawing the pin-ups from the magazines, to beginteaching himself classes in philosophy consisting of interminablelectures to a bored and captive audience of one.     He would be able to measure the qualities of peace and decide whetherit was really better than war, he would be able to get as fat and asdirty as he liked, he would be able to live more like an animal andthink more like a god than any man for generations.     But after a shorter time than he expected, it all got to be a tearingbore. Even the waiting to go crazy part of it.     Not that he was going to have any great long wait of it. He was alreadytalking to himself, making verbal notes for his lectures, and he hadcut out a picture of Annie Oakley from an old book. He tacked it up andwinked at it whenever he passed that way.     Lately she was winking back at him.     Loneliness was a physical weight on his skull. It peeled the flesh fromhis arms and legs and sandpapered his self-pity to a fine sensitivity.     No one on Earth was as lonely as William Manet, and even William Manetcould only be this lonely on Mars.     Manet was Atmosphere Seeder Station 131-47's own human.     All Manet had to do was sit in the beating aluminum heart in the middleof the chalk desert and stare out, chin cupped in hands, at the flat,flat pavement of dirty talcum, at the stars gleaming as hard in theblack sky as a starlet's capped teeth ... stars two of which were moonsand one of which was Earth. He had to do nothing else. The wholegimcrack was cybernetically controlled, entirely automatic. No one wasneeded here\u2014no human being, at least.     The Workers' Union was a pretty small pressure group, but it didn'ttake much to pressure the Assembly. Featherbedding had been carefullyspecified, including an Overseer for each of the Seeders to honeycombMars, to prepare its atmosphere for colonization.     They didn't give tests to find well-balanced, well-integrated peoplefor the job. Well-balanced, well-integrated men weren't going toisolate themselves in a useless job. They got, instead, William Manetand his fellows.     The Overseers were to stay as long as the job required. Passenger fareto Mars was about one billion dollars. They weren't providing commuterservice for night shifts. They weren't providing accommodationsfor couples when the law specified only one occupant. They weren'tproviding fuel (at fifty million dollars a gallon) for visits betweenthe various Overseers. They weren't very providential.     But it was two hundred thousand a year in salary, and it offeredwonderful opportunities.     It gave William Manet an opportunity to think he saw a spaceship makinga tailfirst landing on the table of the desert, its tail burning asbright as envy.   <doc-sep> Pouring and tumbling through the Lifo kit, consulting the manualdiligently, Manet concluded that there weren't enough parts left in thebox to go around.     The book gave instructions for The Model Mother, The Model Father, TheModel Sibling and others. Yet there weren't parts enough in the kit.     He would have to take parts from Ronald or Veronica in order to makeany one of the others. And he could not do that without the Modifier.     He wished Trader Tom would return and extract some higher price fromhim for the Modifier, which was clearly missing from the kit.     Or to get even more for simply repossessing the kit.     But Trader Tom would not be back. He came this way only once.     Manet thumbed through the manual in mechanical frustration. As he didso, the solid piece of the last section parted sheet by sheet.     He glanced forward and found the headings:      The Final Model     .     There seemed something ominous about that finality. But he had paida price for the kit, hadn't he? Who knew what price, when it came tothat? He had every right to get everything out of the kit that hecould.     He read the unfolding page critically. The odd assortment ofill-matched parts left in the box took a new shape in his mind andunder his fingers....     Manet gave one final spurt from the flesh-sprayer and stood back.     Victor was finished. Perfect.     Manet stepped forward, lifted the model's left eyelid, tweaked his nose.     Move!     Victor leaped back into the Lifo kit and did a jig on one of theflesh-sprayers.     As the device twisted as handily as good intentions, Manet realizedthat it was not a flesh-sprayer but the Modifier.     It's finished! were Victor's first words. It's done!     Manet stared at the tiny wreck. To say the least.     Victor stepped out of the oblong box. There is something you shouldunderstand. I am different from the others.     They all say that.     I am not your friend.     No?     No. You have made yourself an enemy.     Manet felt nothing more at this information than an esthetic pleasureat the symmetry of the situation.     It completes the final course in socialization, Victor continued. Iam your adversary. I will do everything I can to defeat you. I have      all     your knowledge.      You     do not have all your knowledge. If you letyourself know some of the things, it could be used against you. It ismy function to use everything I possibly can against you.     When do you start?     I've finished. I've done my worst. I have destroyed the Modifier.     What's so bad about that? Manet asked with some interest.     You'll have Veronica and Ronald and me forever now. We'll neverchange. You'll get older, and we'll never change. You'll lose yourinterest in New York swing and jet combat and Daniel Boone, and we'llnever change. We don't change and you can't change us for others. I'vemade the worst thing happen to you that can happen to any man.      I'veseen that you will always keep your friends.       "

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in AMBITION?",
        "Summary_1": "Maitland, a militant engineer specialized in atomic rocket motors, awakes one night to a strange sound in his room. He blacks out and awakes again, this time in a room that isn't his. He takes in his surroundings and notices a prairie and a river outside his window, and within his room a door to exit which he cannot open. As Maitland wonders helplessly, a man by the name of Swarts enters his room. Swarts tells Maitland that he is here to participate in a series of psychological tests, assuring him that he is not interested in any secret intelligence related to his career. Swarts leads Maitland to his laboratory, where a cot stands in the center of the room under a ceiling of electric cables. Maitland resists initially, wary of the extent Swarts would go to in order for him to comply; however, Swarts manages to get Maitland onto the cot by force. He then reveals his main objective, which is figuring out why Maitland has a passion and longing to go to the Moon. Later that evening, Maitland meets a girl, later referred to as Ingrid Ching, who silently brings him a meal. He stares outside his window, trying to piece together where he could be, when he notices the presence of Venus in the sky as an evening star and comes to the realization that he has traveled to the future. Bewildered, Maitland is eager to learn more about the advancements of society, namely the status of man's trip to space. He asks Ching, who refuses to answer, and is then brought back to Swarts' lab. Maitland, determined to have his questions answered, rebels against Swarts' following tests through mental resistance. Becoming frustrated, Swarts tells Maitland that they are in the year A.D 2634, and that Ching would answer remaining questions if he complied with the tests. Agreeing, Ching visits Maitland that evening, and indulges him in the history of the human race up to this point, including stories of the Afrikanders, who dominated technological advancements and ruled the global empire, and how the world eventually transformed into one race. Maitland asks Ching whether humans have been able to go to space yet, and she is perplexed. She tells him that though she doesn't think it would be impossible, it has not been done, and she wonders why such a thing would be desired. Ching explains that the world is no longer in an age of technology, but an age of understanding humans and cultures within their world. Maitland is defeated; he cannot comprehend how there is no interest in traveling to space, realizing that his lifelong goal has become unattainable. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story starts with Maitland waking up from a loud thump but quickly goes back to sleep. Later he realizes that he is not in his room. This is not the Reservation. Then he remembers that something has happened during the night. He believes that whoever captures him must want information about the rocket motor. He gets up to inspect the room but only find a door leading to the bathroom. The other door cannot be opened and the view from the window is unfamiliar. About half an hour later, the other door opens and a man named Swarts explains that he will perform some psychological tests on Maitland for about a week and does not want any information regarding the rocket motor. Even though Swarts made it clear that he can obtain the results he want with or without Maitland\u2019s cooperation, Maitland still protests. He puts up a fight but ends up on the cot that will record his body changes. Swarts notes that the question regarding traveling to the moon seems to have created involuntary responses, and he wants to know why. \n\nBack at the cell, dinner is brought by an Oriental looking girl. Maitland watches the sunset and suddenly realizes that Venus was a morning star, but now he sees it after sunset. He becomes excited after learning that he has time travelled and is determined to ask Swarts which year he is in. He assumes that there are spaceports in the space to reach the starts. The next day Maitland asks the girl what year they\u2019re in, but she refuses to tell him. Swarts also refuses to tell him anything, thus he does not cooperate in the labs. Finally, Swarts yields and tells him that they are in A.D. 2634. He assures Maitland that the girl, Ingrid Ching, will answer his questions. Then Maitland cooperates. Later Maitland learns about the \u2018history\u2019 that has happened since his time. And he learns that they have no interest in going to outer space. Instead of the age of technology, they are in the age of man.   ",
        "Summary_3": "Maitland wakes up in his room in the residential section of the Reservation. He thinks he sees a man in the corner of his room, and just then, he is knocked unconscious. He awakens again the next morning, soon realising that he is not in his room anymore, and he is not in the Reservation either. He must have been abducted in the night and taken to this strange place that is steeped in beautiful nature. Through the window of his room he sees a man and a woman coming up a hill towards the building he is in. Half an hour later, the man he had seen earlier arrives in his room. He tells Maitland his name is Swarts. He isn't going to tell him where he is, and that even though Maitland works in the engineering of rocket motors, he has no interest in extracting secrets from his job. He will be performing a series of tests on Maitland. He takes him to his lab, where Maitland refuses to participate in Swarts' test, so Swarts beats him up and pins him down. He asks Maitland if he wants to go to the moon, then telling him that he wants to understand why. In the evening, a girl enters Maitland's room, bringing him dinner. He notices how beautiful she is. He wonders what this is all about. He watches the sun set, and the stars come out. He notices Venus in the sky, his favourite planet. He then realises that Venus was just a morning star, and it is now an evening star. He must've traveled into the future. Maitland is determined to get the truth about what year it is from Swarts. After great resistance to the tests that Swarts puts him through the next day, the man finally gives into Maitlands question, telling him it is the year 2634. He tells him that the girl who had brought him food, named Ingrid Ching, would answer any questions he might have. Maitland is overcome with excitement at the idea that he might find a place in this society, and be able to use their technology to travel in space. He is quickly brought down though when Ching tells him that there is no such thing as space travel, as the population of Earth, which is now only 300 million, have no interest in such a thing. She tells him a bit about the history of Earth since the 20th century and Maitland is devastated to learn that he will never realise his dream of traveling to space. ",
        "Summary_4": "Maitland wakes up in a strange room in an unexpected location. He thinks to himself where he might be and starts to feel scared and helpless because he is unsure. Suddenly, a man, Swarts, appears at the now opened entrance to his room. Swarts tells Maitland that he will be there for a week and be fed 3 meals a day. Swarts continues to say that he will not tell Maitland where he is and that the purpose of his stay is to undergo psychological tests. \n\nSwarts leads Maitland into the laboratory room tells Maitland to lie down on the surgical cot at the center of the room. The first test will be similar to a lie detector test. He warns Maitland that he should cooperate, but Maitland becomes purposefully defiant. Swarts then forces Maitland onto the cot and straps him into it. Maitland begins to think about what the tests might be as Swarts sets up the different instruments. Swarts then begins the experiment and asks Maitland to explain why he wants to go to the moon. Maitland is intrigued by the question as it was unexpected.\n\nAfter returning to his cell and eating the meal that Ching brought him, Maitland begins to think about the situation. After making some observations about the sky, Maitland realizes where he is. He notices that Venus is suddenly an evening star. He becomes full of excitement and thinks about all the possible implications. Energized by his new knowledge, he thinks of a plan to get Swarts to be more open with him and then goes to sleep. After conversing with Ching during his breakfast, Maitland waits in his room until Swarts walks in and then promptly asks Swarts the year. Swarts avoid answering the question and takes Maitland to the laboratory for more testing. \n\nMaitland tries to fight against the new machine hoping Swarts will answer his question and his efforts are successful. Swarts tells him that it is the year 2634, and Maitland responds with a grin. He agrees to cooperate with Swarts as long as Ching answers his questions after the experiments. Back in his cell, Ching tells Maitland a quick history of the world of the last 500 years. She explains the deadly war that occurred and the response to it. Maitland then excitedly asks about space innovation but Ching seems confused by the question. Ching asks Maitland why he or anyone else during his time wants to travel in space. Maitland finds it incredulous that with all of the technology at hand people have not traveled to space. Ching explains that her time is the Age of Man and as long as machines work, humans don\u2019t want to think about them, while Maitland\u2019s time is the Age of Technology. Maitland is very discouraged upon learning that in the present time there is not a familiar interest in space travel and asks to be alone in his room in reaction to the upsetting news. \n",

        "Query": "What is the backdrop of the story AMBITION?",
        "Summary_1": "The majority of the story takes place in the cell that Maitland is kept in by Swarts. The room is unconventional, according to Maitland, with no sharp edges, lines, or corners. Instead, the room is rounded, mostly made of smooth metal and plastic. There is no knob or latch on his door, and his window is made of a plastic so transparent it looks invisible. Because Maitland cannot leave his room, his observation of the outside is limited to what is through his window; the land outside is lush, with a rich prairie, an ocean, and a river. He has a view of the vast sky, and at night is able to see the stars. The other location that Maitland experiences in the story is Swarts' lab, which looks similar to an ordinary lab, with familiar electronics and machinery. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story first takes place in Maitland\u2019s room which has an open window at the side of his bed. Later when Maitland wakes up, he is not in his room anymore. This room is no straight lines or sharp corners; there are blue and featureless walls made from plastic, smooth doors made from metals, chair and table from aluminum alloy. Interestingly, the doors does not have any knob, but there is a button on the wall that controls one of the two doors. The door opens to the bathroom. The other one cannot be controlled from the inside. The window is made of strong transparent plastics. Outside the window, there are deep prairie grass and the ocean stretches to the horizon. Instead of the oxygen plant in the California desert, there is a river down the hill covered by huge ancient trees. Outside the other door is a laboratory which has a surgical cot and a bench at the side of the room. It supports a few electronics cabinets. There are cables from the ceiling, going to a focus above the cot. ",
        "Summary_3": "The story takes place in two time periods. The first setting of the story is in Maitland's room in the residential section of the reservation in 1950. He is then taken to the year 2634. In the room that he wakes up in, there is a palpable sense of uneasiness. There are no straight lines anywhere, and every surface is smooth. There are two doors in the room, one of which has a button beside it, when pressed leading to a bathroom. The other door has no way to open it from the inside. In Swarts' lab in the same building is a surgical cot, a bench, some screens, cables, pilot lights and switches. The outside of the building presents a beautiful, open landscape. There is a lawn directly outside the building which leads to a green ocean. Down a hill is a benign river, underneath a patch of huge trees. ",
        "Summary_4": "The story begins with Maitland waking up believing that he\u2019s in the residential section of the Reservation and then realizing that he\u2019s not. Where he is, he\u2019s not sure but he can see dark green pastoral grass and ocean stretching to the horizon. The room that he is in appears strange to him. He notes that it gives him access to a bathroom but not the ability to leave the room of his own volition. \n\nWhen a man enters Maitland\u2019s room, the man leads Maitland from his strange cell into a laboratory. The laboratory has a surgical cot at the center of the room with a bench on the wall that holds different electronics. Maitland is put on the cot and the experiment begins. \n\nOnce the experiment, is over, Maitland returns to his cell where he is given food and falls asleep for the night. \n\nAccording to Maitland he is from the 20th century but believes that he was brought into the future. His hypothesis is based upon that Venus is now an evening star when it was a morning star before he was brought to the facility. After asking Swarts to confirm his theory and being ignored, Maitland is brought back to the laboratory for more testing. After another finished day of testing, Maitland is brought to his cell where he talks with Ching and asks her questions about the current period of time. \n",

        "Query": "What role does space play in the narrative of AMBITION?",
        "Summary_1": "Throughout the story, Maitland shows his passion and knowledge for space; it defines him as a character and helps him in figuring out certain aspects of his situation. Maitland's passion for space is first introduced when Swarts asks him about going to the Moon. Maitland is taken aback by this question, and Swarts knows that the idea is extremely important to him; in fact, Maitland's dream of going to the Moon is the whole reason why he is experiencing these tests. Later on, space is significant in helping Maitland come to a realization. As he stares out the window trying to gauge where in the world he is located, he notices that Venus, his favorite planet, is in the sky during the evening, when back at the Reservation, it was a morning star. Maitland's knowledge of constellations and planets leads him to realize that he must have traveled into the future. Once Maitland realizes this, his main question is about space travel, and whether humans have achieved it. Once he learns that it has not been attempted or achieved, Maitland's motivation is lost; space was the driving force in his life and career, and space travel not being possible left him hopeless.",
        "Summary_2": "Firstly, Swarts asks Maitland a question regarding Moon and he wants to know why Maitland wants to travel to the Moon. Moreover, space and the stars in space helped Maitland realize that they are not in his time anymore. The morning star Venus has become an evening star. Understanding that the people in the future are capable of time travel, Maitland was sure that they are also space travelling. However, when he asks Ching about their interstellar flights, she gets confused. Apparently, there has not been any desire to go to other planets. Even when they have the technology, there is no interest in exploring the space. But they do like to go to the past, they consider this an adventure while space travel is not. ",
        "Summary_3": "Space is very significant in the story. Maitland is a man who wishes to one day travel to mars. Swarts asks him if he wants to go to the moon. The reasoning behind Swarts testing Maitland is in an effort to discover why someone from the 20th century would want to go to the moon at all. In the year 2634, they have no interest or need for space travel. Ching doesn't even know what Mars is. They have the capability to travel to space, but don't care to. Their population is only 300 million, meaning that they're not going to run out of resources or space on Earth. They also see no need to travel to space in the name of adventure, as they have time travel, which according to Ching, is the greatest adventure of all. Maitland is devastated to discover that he will not travel to space. He wants to see the sun as a smaller star on mars, he wants to walk on Venus, he wants to see the rings of Saturn from only 200,000 miles away.",
        "Summary_4": "Maitland works in the speciality of heat transfer in relation to its application to rocket motors. He has a great and undeniable interest in space. He is able to discern his real location in time using his knowledge of space and the solar system to understand that he is not in the same time as he was before being at the facility. \n\nSpace seems to be of relevance to Swarts and his psychological tests as during the first experiment Swarts tells Maitland that he was brought because of his interest in the moon. One of the first questions Swarts asks Maitland is for his reasoning of why he wants to go to the moon. So, it is clear that Swarts is interested in studying Maitland\u2019s passion and desire for space travel.\n\nWhen discussing with Ching the history and advances that the human race has made since his generation, he excitedly asks about what other planets have been visited and other general information on space travel. His question confuses Ching because she does not understand why he is interested in traveling to space. Maitland finds it incredulously that they have so much technology but have not traveled to space. It shows the dichotomy of their viewpoints because Maitland sees space travel as a solution to population control and as an interesting prospect because space invites and feeds an adventurous spirit. On the other hand, Ching and the rest of the world have no desire for space innovation or travel because it is unnecessary to further interaction with technology. \n",
        "Article": "Most of the cousins gasped as the truth began to percolate through.     I knew from the very beginning, Conrad finished, that I didn'thave to do anything at all.

As the story progresses, and Ching is able to answer Maitland's questions about the world they are in, she shares a bit about herself. Trust is built between the two as Ching shares her knowledge of global history, and Maitland learns that like his passion for space travel, Ching has a passion for time travel, specifically back to the 20th century, where Maitland is from. Though Ching has to break the news to Maitland that space travel has not been done, she attempts to comfort him through explanations and consolation. While by the end of the story, Ching and Maitland are not exactly friends, they have both confided in each other and have learned a lot about the other.",

Ching tells Maitland about the \u2018history\u2019 that has happened since the time that Maitland is from, the 20th century. Later Maitland acknowledges that the people in this era do not desire space travel. He is sad, but Ching soothes him.

Ching tells him how special she thinks he is, smiling at him. She tells him how she wishes to travel back to the 20th century, because she is a romantic. Ching explains to Maitland the history of Earth since the 20th century, and how most of the population were wiped out, and the rise and fall of empires with robot armies.

After a while he noticed that he was whistling the same themeover and over: a minute's thought identified it as that exuberantmounting phrase which recurs in the finale of Beethoven's NinthSymphony.     He forgot about it and went on whistling. He was picturing himselfaboard a ship dropping in toward Mars, making planetfall at SyrtisMajor; he was seeing visions of Venus and the awesome beauty of Saturn.In his mind, he circled the Moon, and viewed the Earth as a huge brightglobe against the constellations....     Finally the door slid aside and she appeared, carrying the usual trayof food.

There was a thump. Maitland stirred, came half awake, and opened hiseyes. The room was dark except where a broad shaft of moonlight fromthe open window fell on the foot of his bed. Outside, the residentialsection of the Reservation slept silently under the pale illuminationof the full Moon. He guessed sleepily that it was about three o'clock.     What had he heard? He had a definite impression that the sound had comefrom within the room. It had sounded like someone stumbling into achair, or\u2014     Something moved in the darkness on the other side of the room.

He opened his eyes, looked throughthe window at a section of azure sky, listened to the singing of birdssomewhere outside. A beautiful day. In the middle of the process ofstretching his rested muscles, arms extended back, legs tensed, hefroze, looking up\u2014for the first time really seeing the ceiling.

These include heart monitors, blood pressure recorders, and measurements of brain activity. Swarts uses similar technology in the next test to record Maitland's reactions, with a few additions. Firstly, he introduces gadgets attached to Maitland's eyelashes that keep him from closing his eyes. He also attaches lenses and a projector to Maitland's eyes to display different scenes to him.",
        "Summary_2": "Firstly, Swarts or his men probably used some kinds of gadgets and brought Maitland from the heavily guarded Reservation. At the lab, Swarts tells Maitland to lay on the surgical cot, where cables run from the ceiling to the focus above the cot in the center of the room. When Maitland refuses to corporate, Swarts uses his fist to hit Maitland\u2019s solar plexus and put him onto the cot, where he is forced to remain still. The tiny electrodes are placed at his temples and other parts of his body, minute microphone placed on the skin over his heart, and a sphygmomanometer on his arm. Those gadgets are used to record his involuntary responses. When Maitland realizes that he is in the future, he refuses to corporate. Then, Swarts places two cylindrical tubes over Maitland\u2019s head, there are lenses at the end of the tubes. The tiny clamps on Maitland\u2019s eyelashes prevent his eyelids from closing for a long time. Earphones are placed in his ears. A video is played through the lenses. ",
        "Summary_3": "Swarts uses many different gadgets throughout the story. Along the wall of Swarts' laboratory are several electronic cabinets holding cathode ray tube screens. He uses a lie detector on Maitland made up of a multitude of tiny electrodes and a sphygmomanometer sleeve. He then uses an apparatus which he lowers over Maitland's head, with two cylindrical tubes with lenses at the end, and clamps to keep his eyelids open. It has a screen inside that projects videos. ",
        "Summary_4": "The first machine used by Swarts on Maitland when conducting the psychological tests is similar to a lie detector. The machine is meant to record Maitland\u2019s reactions to the different tests that he is given. It operates by attaching electrodes to Maitland\u2019s temples and other parts of his body and then putting a tiny microphone on his skin near his heart. In addition, a sphygmomanometer sleeve is wrapped around one of his arms. The different instruments on this machine are used to record the changes in Maitland\u2019s skin potential, blood pressure, and heartbeat. Thus, it measures his natural reaction to the stimuli he will be exposed to during the tests. \n\nThe next time he is tested, it is a new machine that has two cylindrical tubes similar to a binocular microscope that is placed over his head. Tiny clamps are attached to his eyelashes to keep his eyes from shutting. Earphones are also used to further the immersive experience of the new test. The new machine shows Maitland different clips, some disturbing, to gauge his various reactions. \n",
        "Article": "After that outlandish cell, Swarts' laboratory looked rathercommonplace. There was something like a surgical cot in the center, anda bench along one wall supported several electronics cabinets. A coupleof them had cathode ray tube screens, and they all presented a normalcomplement of meters, pilot lights, and switches. Cables from them ranacross the ceiling and came to a focus above the high flat cot in thecenter of the room.     Lie down, Swarts said. When Maitland hesitated, Swarts added,Understand one thing\u2014the more you cooperate, the easier things willbe for you. If necessary, I will use coercion. I can get all my resultsagainst your will, if I must. I would prefer not to. Please don't makeme.     What's the idea? Maitland asked. What is all this?     Swarts hesitated, though not, Maitland astonishedly felt, to evade ananswer, but to find the proper words. You can think of it as a liedetector. These instruments will record your reactions to the tests Igive you. That is as much as you need to know. Now lie down.     Maitland stood there for a moment, deliberately relaxing his tensedmuscles. Make me.     If Swarts was irritated, he didn't show it. That was the first test,he said. Let me put it another way. I would appreciate it a lot ifyou'd lie down on this cot. I would like to test my apparatus.     Maitland shook his head stubbornly.     I see, Swarts said. You want to find out what you're up against.     He moved so fast that Maitland couldn't block the blow. It was to thesolar plexus, just hard enough to double him up, fighting for breath.He felt an arm under his back, another behind his knees. Then he was onthe cot. When he was able to breathe again, there were straps acrosshis chest, hips, knees, ankles, and arms, and Swarts was tightening aclamp that held his head immovable.       Presently, a number of tiny electrodes were adhering to his temples andto other portions of his body, and a minute microphone was clinging tothe skin over his heart. These devices terminated in cables that hungfrom the ceiling. A sphygmomanometer sleeve was wrapped tightly aroundhis left upper arm, its rubber tube trailing to a small black boxclamped to the frame of the cot. Another cable left the box and joinedthe others.     So\u2014Maitland thought\u2014Swarts could record changes in his skinpotential, heartbeat, and blood pressure: the involuntary responses ofthe body to stimuli.     The question was, what were the stimuli to be?     Your name, said Swarts, is Robert Lee Maitland. You are thirty-fouryears old. You are an engineer, specialty heat transfer, particularlyas applied to rocket motors.... No, Mr. Maitland, I'm not going toquestion you about your work; just forget about it. Your home town isMadison, Wisconsin....     You seem to know everything about me, Maitland said defiantly,looking up into the hanging forest of cabling. Why this recital?     I do not know everything about you\u2014yet. And I'm testing theequipment, calibrating it to your reactions. He went on, Yourfavorite recreations are chess and reading what you term sciencefiction. Maitland,      how would you like to go to the Moon     ?     Something eager leaped in Maitland's breast at the abrupt question, andhe tried to turn his head. Then he forced himself to relax. What doyou mean?     Swarts was chuckling. I really hit a semantic push-button there,didn't I? Maitland, I brought you here because you're a man who wantsto go to the Moon. I'm interested in finding out      why     .   <doc-sep> Lexington stared at his cup without touching it for a long while. Thenhe continued with his narrative. I suppose it's all my own fault. Ididn't detect the symptoms soon enough. After this plant got workingproperly, I started living here. It wasn't a question of saving money.I hated to waste two hours a day driving to and from my house, and Ialso wanted to be on hand in case anything should go wrong that themachine couldn't fix for itself.     Handling the cup as if it were going to shatter at any moment, he tooka gulp. I began to see that the machine could understand the writtenword, and I tried hooking a teletype directly into the logic circuits.It was like uncorking a seltzer bottle. The machine had a funnyvocabulary\u2014all of it gleaned from letters it had seen coming in, andreplies it had seen leaving. But it was intelligible. It even displayedsome traces of the personality the machine was acquiring.     It had chosen a name for itself, for instance\u2014'Lex.' That shook me.You might think Lex Industries was named through an abbreviation ofthe name Lexington, but it wasn't. My wife's name was Alexis, and itwas named after the nickname she always used. I objected, of course,but how can you object on a point like that to a machine? Bear in mindthat I had to be careful to behave reasonably at all times, because themachine was still learning from me, and I was afraid that any tantrumsI threw might be imitated.     It sounds pretty awkward, Peter put in.     You don't know the half of it! As time went on, I had less and less todo, and business-wise I found that the entire control of the operationwas slipping from my grasp. Many times I discovered\u2014too late\u2014thatthe machine had taken the damnedest risks you ever saw on bids andcontracts for supply. It was quoting impossible delivery times onsome orders, and charging pirate's prices on others, all without anyobvious reason. Inexplicably, we always came out on top. It would turnout that on the short-delivery-time quotations, we'd been up againststiff competition, and cutting the production time was the only way wecould get the order. On the high-priced quotes, I'd find that no oneelse was bidding. We were making more money than I'd ever dreamed of,and to make it still better, I'd find that for months I had virtuallynothing to do.     It sounds wonderful, sir, said Peter, feeling dazzled.     It was, in a way. I remember one day I was especially pleased withsomething, and I went to the control console to give the kicker buttona long, hard push. The button, much to my amazement, had been removed,and a blank plate had been installed to cover the opening in the board.I went over to the teletype and punched in the shortest message I hadever sent. 'LEX\u2014WHAT THE HELL?' I typed.     The answer came back in the jargon it had learned from letters it hadseen, and I remember it as if it just happened. 'MR. A LEXINGTON, LEXINDUSTRIES, DEAR SIR: RE YOUR LETTER OF THE THIRTEENTH INST., I AMPLEASED TO ADVISE YOU THAT I AM ABLE TO DISCERN WHETHER OR NOT YOU AREPLEASED WITH MY SERVICE WITHOUT THE USE OF THE EQUIPMENT PREVIOUSLYUSED FOR THIS PURPOSE. RESPECTFULLY, I MIGHT SUGGEST THAT IF THEPUSHBUTTON ARRANGEMENT WERE NECESSARY, I COULD PUSH THE BUTTON MYSELF.I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS WOULD MEET WITH YOUR APPROVAL, AND HAVE TAKENSTEPS TO RELIEVE YOU OF THE BURDEN INVOLVED IN REMEMBERING TO PUSH THEBUTTON EACH TIME YOU ARE ESPECIALLY PLEASED. I SHOULD LIKE TO TAKE THISOPPORTUNITY TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR INQUIRY, AND LOOK FORWARD TO SERVINGYOU IN THE FUTURE AS I HAVE IN THE PAST. YOURS FAITHFULLY, LEX'.   <doc-sep> Swarts came half an hour later, and Maitland began his plannedoffensive.     What year is this?     Swarts' steely eyes locked with his. You know what the date is, hestated.     No, I don't. Not since yesterday.     Come on, Swarts said patiently, let's get going. We have a lot toget through this morning.     I      know     this isn't 1950. It's probably not even the 20th Century.Venus was a morning star before you brought me here. Now it's anevening star.     Never mind that. Come.     Wordlessly, Maitland climbed to his feet, preceded Swarts to thelaboratory, lay down and allowed him to fasten the straps and attachthe instruments, making no resistance at all. When Swarts startedsaying a list of words\u2014doubtlessly some sort of semantic reactiontest\u2014Maitland began the job of integrating csc  3  x dx in his head.It was a calculation which required great concentration and frequenttracing back of steps. After several minutes, he noticed that Swartshad stopped calling words. He opened his eyes to find the other manstanding over him, looking somewhat exasperated and a little baffled.     What year is this? Maitland asked in a conversational tone.     We'll try another series of tests.     It took Swarts nearly twenty minutes to set up the new apparatus. Helowered a bulky affair with two cylindrical tubes like the twin stacksof a binocular microscope over Maitland's head, so that the lenses atthe ends of the tubes were about half an inch from the engineer'seyes. He attached tiny clamps to Maitland's eyelashes.     These will keep you from holding your eyes shut, he said. You canblink, but the springs are too strong for you to hold your eyelids downagainst the tension.     He inserted button earphones into Maitland's ears\u2014     And then the show began.     He was looking at a door in a partly darkened room, and there werefootsteps outside, a peremptory knocking. The door flew open,and outlined against the light of the hall, he saw a man with atwelve-gauge shotgun. The man shouted, Now I've got you, youwife-stealer! He swung the shotgun around and pulled the trigger.There was a terrible blast of sound and the flash of smokelesspowder\u2014then blackness.     With a deliberate effort, Maitland unclenched his fists and tried toslow his breathing. Some kind of emotional reaction test\u2014what was thecountermove? He closed his eyes, but shortly the muscles around themdeclared excruciatingly that they couldn't keep that up.     Now he was looking at a girl. She....     Maitland gritted his teeth and fought to use his brain; then he had it.     He thought of a fat slob of a bully who had beaten him up one dayafter school. He remembered a talk he had heard by a politician who hadall the intelligent social responsibility of a rogue gorilla, but nomore. He brooded over the damnable stupidity and short-sightedness ofSwarts in standing by his silly rules and not telling him about thisnew world.     Within a minute, he was in an ungovernable rage. His muscles tightenedagainst the restraining straps. He panted, sweat came out on hisforehead, and he began to curse. Swarts! How he hated....     The scene was suddenly a flock of sheep spread over a green hillside.There was blood hammering in Maitland's temples. His face felt hot andswollen and he writhed against the restraint of the straps.     The scene disappeared, the lenses of the projector retreated from hiseyes and Swarts was standing over him, white-lipped. Maitland swore athim for a few seconds, then relaxed and smiled weakly. His head wasstarting to ache from the effort of blinking.     What year is this? he asked.     All right, Swarts said. A.D. 2634.     Maitland's smile became a grin.  "

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the Morgue Ship's storyline?",
        "Summary_1": "Sam Burnett hears the familiar sounds that indicate another dead body has been retrieved and collected onto the Morgue ship where he works. Burnett is a coroner that works to retrieve dead bodies from space lost in war and bring them back to Earth. He thinks of how his job has emotionally drained him. Rice interrupts his thoughts and yells for Sam to meet with him. Sam climbs up to the control room of the rocket. When he meets Rice, he realizes that the recovered body is an enemy official. Sam is suspicious of the condition of the body when Rice excitedly exclaims that it is the body of Lethla, Kriere\u2019s majordomo. Burnett is indifferent to the revelation. Yet, Rice is excited for the possibility of a high enemy official being dead and the possibility of the war coming to an end; Sam is still jaded. \n\nLethla moves and they realize that he is not dead.  Lethla was able to survive in the void of space with the usage of a well-hidden face mask made of glassite. Lethla threatens the two to not make any moves and communicates his intent to control the ship. Rice tells Lethla to leave because it is against Interplanetary law to mess with a morgue ship. Lethla rebuffs that defense. All the while, Sam is observing the two interact. Lethla lets the two know that Kriere is still alive and is also wearing the same mask that Lethla had worn. He explains that they were attacked near Mars while they were on their way to Venus. They were running out of supplies and decided to trick the morgue ship to continue their trip to Venus. After Lethla explains why and how he got to the morgue ship, he commands them to go pick up Kriere. Sam smiles and complies with Lethla\u2019s orders. \n\nSam thinks over his options and considers getting Lethla and Kriere to Venus so that he can peacefully return to Earth. They spot Kriere in space floating as if he is dead. Sam continues thinking about his options to overpower both Kriere and Lethla and experiences some fear over the possible success of his plan. He begins to sweat nervously but becomes more confident as he puts the plan into action. Sam activates the ship\u2019s claw mechanism to pick up Kriere\u2019s body. As Lethla watches him he mentions a saying about how the ship is meant for dead men and then unexpectedly begins to crush Kriere\u2019s body with the claw, killing Kriere. Lethla is caught off guard but manages to fire his gun at Sam before Rice attacks him. Lethla screams in horror for a time while Burnett uncontrollably laughs. Rice expresses how he doesn\u2019t believe Sam should have killed Kriere. Sam argues that it didn\u2019t matter as long as it was his last trip somehow. Sam dies and becomes the 100 body on the ship, filling it and allowing the ship to return back to Earth fulfilling Sam\u2019s last desire. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Sam Burnett works on the morgue ship called the Constellation. His job involves collecting bodies floating in the void, and he desperately wants to quit after ten long years. He works alongside Rice on the morgue ship. Burnett declares that this mission will be his last, or he will find a reason for it. He is wary about the nature of his job since it is so involved with death. Rice calls him over and explains that the body they just brought in is Lethla, Kriere\u2019s majordomo. Burnett is not very interested, but Rice takes this as a sign that Kriere must be somewhere near too. Rice talks about radioing for help if there is a warship, but Burnett does not care because he is tired of seeing all these bodies. Just before they can continue arguing, it turns out that Lethla is actually alive and reveals that he survived through the use of a face-moulded mask of glassite. Lethla knows they are weaponless and finds the radio, which upsets Rice because only dead men are supposed to be on their ship. Lethla reveals that Kriere is out there too, and he plans to use the morgue ship to rescue him. Rice does not move, but Burnett agrees to the request and goes up to drive the ship. He ponders his plan, thinking how cooperating with Venusians will help him and Rice survive. He also thinks about capturing Kriere and ending the war. They find Kriere floating in space, and Burnett drives the ship up to him. However, he knows that with both Lethla and Kriere on board, they have no chance of overpowering them. Burnett tells Rice to take the controls as he moves to the star-port, and he begins to feel the spot on his back where a bullet will hit him. Kriere is outside, reaching towards the Constellation and smiling. The claw lever is extended and retrieves Kriere, while Burnett tells Lethla that only dead men come aboard the ship. The claw crushes Kriere, leaving only his head preserved for identification. Lethla fires the gun that hits Burnett, but he and Rice retaliate. Soon, Lethla is dead too. Rice tells him that he shouldn\u2019t have done it, but Burnett tells him that he is determined to make this his last trip. He asks Rice if he is one hell of a patriot and dies shortly after. Rice softly declares that Burnett\u2019s body is one-hundred. ",
        "Summary_3": "Sam Burnett and his partner, Rice, are aboard the morgue ship Constellation with the goal of retrieving one hundred bodies from space before returning to Earth. They have been working for ten years, and Burnett has become frustrated with the job. He is sick of the repetition and dealing with dead bodies every day, and it has caused him to lose motivation in the war and returning home. The two are at their ninety-seventh body, only needing three more before being able to go home. One day, Burnett and Rice collect a soldier from the void, who they identify as Lethla, the right hand man of Kriere, the head enemy. Rice is excited, noting that Lethla's death indicates an end to the war, but Burnett remains unfazed, when Lethla's body suddenly jumps to life. Lethla had faked his death after an accident in order to board the morgue ship, and he takes Burnett and Rice hostage in an effort to rescue Kriere and go to Venus. Burnett agrees while Rice hesitates; he sees this as an opportunity to catch up with the war and end the trip once and for all. The Constellation reaches Kriere, and Burnett catches Lethla off guard by crushing Kriere with the claw, killing him. Burnett and Rice then fight off Lethla, eventually killing him too. Rice reprimands Burnett, noting that their cargo is not full and is still missing a body. Burnett, still lying down, watches Rice without protest, and Rice kills him for the final body.",
        "Summary_4": "Three new dead bodies lie before Sam Burnett aboard the Constellation. They add up to a hundred dead warriors aboard,  part of a much greater amount the crew picked up in ten years. Now, the spaceship is going back to Earth to bury them properly, with only two living people making up its crew - Rice and Sam. Sam suddenly starts feeling bad about his job, about all the similar dead bodies, tired of his job. Soon, a new body appears which looks different - \"too dead\". Turns out the dead is Lethla, Kriere's majordomo, signifying the war is somewhere near to the ship with more bodies. Sam and Rice have a short argument then: Rice wants to take advantage of Kriere, the enemy's leader, being on their territory. Sam argues that they should stay away as they are not a battle-cruiser, he is tired of his job, sentimental about the young warriors and willing to go back to Earth. The dispute stops when it turns out that Lethla is alive and aims his gun. Rice is shocked - no one can live in the void, but Lethla did with the help of glassite. The intruder breaks the radio and announces the purpose of his visit: to rescue Kriere. Turns out their ship was attacked and the two escaped in the same life- boat, wearing chrysali-helmets, and headed towards the morgue ship, the only thing nearby, knowing they would be taken in and considered dead. The morgue rocket was the best cover possible to get safely to Venus, but Kriere was still in the void, while Lethla was picked up. \"Constellation\" starts searching for Kriere as Lethla orders with Sam feeling finally alive and happily agreeing. He has a plan for the two to fill the empty shelves in his morgue. Various plans on how to kill the two enemies and end the war keep appearing in Sam's head while he picks up the body. As in slow-motion, the claw picking up the bodies crushes Kriere and Sam is shot by Lethla. Rice beats the least and rushes to Sam, who is happy to stop the war and save many more young warriors at any price. Sam's last though is that he is number one-hundred in this morgue filling an empty shelf.  ",

I want to talk to you.     In the office, Arapoulous took a chair. Sorry if I'm rushing you,Retief, he said. But have you got anything for me?     Retief waved at the wine bottles.

Bring them in, please.   <doc-sep> Lethla half-crouched in the midst of the smell of death and thechugging of blood-pumps below. In the silence he reached up with quickfingers, tapped a tiny crystal stud upon the back of his head, and thehalves of a microscopically thin chrysalis parted transparently offof his face. He shucked it off, trailing air-tendrils that had beeninserted, hidden in the uniform, ending in thin globules of oxygen.     He spoke. Triumph warmed his crystal-thin voice. That's how I did it,Earthman.     Glassite! said Rice. A face-moulded mask of glassite!     Lethla nodded. His milk-blue eyes dilated. Very marvelously pared toan unbreakable thickness of one-thirtieth of an inch; worn only on thehead. You have to look quickly to notice it, and, unfortunately, viewedas you saw it, outside the ship, floating in the void, not discernibleat all.     Prickles of sweat appeared on Rice's face. He swore at the Venusian andthe Venusian laughed like some sort of stringed instrument, high andquick.     Burnett laughed, too. Ironically. First time in years a man ever cameaboard the Constellation alive. It's a welcome change.     Lethla showed his needle-like teeth. I thought it might be. Where'syour radio?     Go find it! snapped Rice, hotly.     I will. One hand, blue-veined, on the ladder-rungs, Lethla paused.I know you're weaponless; Purple Cross regulations. And this air-lockis safe. Don't move. Whispering, his naked feet padded white up theladder. Two long breaths later something crashed; metal and glass andcoils. The radio.     Burnett put his shoulder blades against the wall-metal, looking at hisfeet. When he glanced up, Rice's fresh, animated face was spoiled bythe new bitterness in it.     Lethla came down. Like a breath of air on the rungs.     He smiled. That's better. Now. We can talk\u2014     Rice said it, slow:     Interplanetary law declares it straight, Lethla! Get out! Only deadmen belong here.     Lethla's gun grip tightened. More talk of that nature, and only deadmen there will be. He blinked. But first\u2014we must rescue Kriere....     Kriere! Rice acted as if he had been hit in the jaw.     Burnett moved his tongue back and forth on his lips silently, his eyeslidded, listening to the two of them as if they were a radio drama.Lethla's voice came next:     Rather unfortunately, yes. He's still alive, heading toward Venusat an orbital velocity of two thousand m.p.h., wearing one of theseair-chrysali. Enough air for two more hours. Our flag ship was attackedunexpectedly yesterday near Mars. We were forced to take to thelife-boats, scattering, Kriere and I in one, the others sacrificingtheir lives to cover our escape. We were lucky. We got through theEarth cordon unseen. But luck can't last forever.     We saw your morgue ship an hour ago. It's a long, long way to Venus.We were running out of fuel, food, water. Radio was broken. Capturewas certain. You were coming our way; we took the chance. We set asmall time-bomb to destroy the life-rocket, and cast off, wearing ourchrysali-helmets. It was the first time we had ever tried using them totrick anyone. We knew you wouldn't know we were alive until it was toolate and we controlled your ship. We knew you picked up all bodies forbrief exams, returning alien corpses to space later.     Rice's voice was sullen. A set-up for you, huh? Traveling under theprotection of the Purple Cross you can get your damned All-Mighty safeto Venus.     Lethla bowed slightly. Who would suspect a Morgue Rocket of providingsafe hiding for precious Venusian cargo?     Precious is the word for you, brother! said Rice.     Enough! Lethla moved his gun several inches.     Accelerate toward Venus, mote-detectors wide open. Kriere must bepicked up\u2014      now!        <doc-sep>   Morgue Ship     By RAY BRADBURY     This was Burnett's last trip. Three more     shelves to fill with space-slain warriors\u2014and     he would be among the living again.     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Planet Stories Summer 1944.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      He heard the star-port grind open, and the movement of the metal clawsgroping into space, and then the star-port closed.     There was another dead man aboard the      Constellation     .     Sam Burnett shook his long head, trying to think clearly. Pallid andquiet, three bodies lay on the cold transparent tables around him;machines stirred, revolved, hummed. He didn't see them. He didn't seeanything but a red haze over his mind. It blotted out the far wall ofthe laboratory where the shelves went up and down, numbered in scarlet,keeping the bodies of soldiers from all further harm.     Burnett didn't move. He stood there in his rumpled white surgicalgown, staring at his fingers gloved in bone-white rubber; feeling alltight and wild inside himself. It went on for days. Moving the ship.Opening the star-port. Extending the retriever claw. Plucking some poorwarrior's body out of the void.     He didn't like it any more. Ten years is too long to go back andforth from Earth to nowhere. You came out empty and you went backfull-cargoed with a lot of warriors who didn't laugh or talk or smoke,who just lay on their shelves, all one hundred of them, waiting for adecent burial.

        "Query": "What is Sam Burnett's occupation on the Morgue Ship?",
        "Summary_1": "Sam Burnett is a coroner on the morgue ship Constellation. His job is to go to space and pick up 100 dead warriors and then return to Earth for them to be given a proper burial. When the ship has filled its capacity it returns specifically to New York. Sam has been working at this job for the past ten years. He uses a machine with metal claws to pick the dead bodies from space and then bring them in through the star-port grind. After the bodies are brought onto the ship, if they are not enemy warriors, the bodies are prepared for return to Earth. The bodies are prepared by Sam in a drainage-preservative lab. ",
        "Summary_2": "Sam Burnett works on a morgue ship, collecting and preparing bodies of spacemen to bring back to Earth for burials. His duties involve driving the ship, opening the star-port to extend the retriever claw, and plucking dead bodies from the void. The morgue ship is always filled with dead men on the way back to Earth and returns empty to find more soldiers. Burnett is also responsible for the drainage-preservative lab, where the bodies are drained and pumped with preservatives for burial. The bodies are then stored on the shelves, where they are lined up and returned to Earth once there is a full cargo. ",
        "Summary_3": "Sam Burnett works on the Constellation, which is a morgue ship designed to collect one hundred space soldiers. Sam Burnett works in the laboratory and is responsible for preparing the bodies after they have died, which consists of any necessary surgeries, pumping out blood, and injecting preservatives. Burnett and his partner, Rice, must meet a certain body count for the Constellation before returning to Earth. The job is a long term one; Burnett is on his tenth year of working on the Constellation.",
        "Summary_4": "Sam Burnett is one of the two crew members aboard Constellation. For the last ten years he has been traveling in this morgue ship, picking up dead bodies in between Venus and Earth. He moves the ship, stops it at the sight of bodies, picks them up with the ship's extending claw, puts them on the table and inspects, then stocks them on the shelves to take back to Earth when the space is filled and give them a proper burial. The two planets are at war at the moment, so there are plenty of bodies in the void, coming from the crashed ships. Sam also does surgery and helps the bodies preserve. ",

Burnett stared at the tabled bodies as if they would leap tolife, even while preservative was being pumped into their veins.     Sam! On the double! Up the rungs!     Burnett closed his eyes and said a couple of words, firmly. Nothing wasworth running for any more. Another body. There had been one hundredthousand bodies preceding it. Nothing unusual about a body with bloodcooling in it.   <doc-sep> Sam! Rice turned swiftly as Burnett dragged himself up the ladder.Red and warm, Rice's face hovered over the body of a sprawled enemyofficial. Take a look at this!     Burnett caught his breath. His eyes narrowed. There was something wrongwith the body; his experienced glance knew that. He didn't know what itwas.     Maybe it was because the body looked a little      too     dead.     Burnett didn't say anything, but he climbed the rest of the way,stood quietly in the grey-metal air-lock. The enemy official was asdelicately made as a fine white spider. Eyelids, closed, were faintlyblue. The hair was thin silken strands of pale gold, waved and pressedclose to a veined skull. Where the thin-lipped mouth fell open acluster of needle-tipped teeth glittered. The fragile body was enclosedcompletely in milk-pale syntha-silk, a holstered gun at the middle.     Burnett rubbed his jaw. Well?     Rice exploded. His eyes were hot in his young, sharp-cut face, hot andblack. Good Lord, Sam, do you know who this is?     Burnett scowled uneasily and said no.     It's Lethla! Rice retorted.     Burnett said, Lethla? And then: Oh, yes! Kriere's majordomo. Thatright?     Don't say it calm, Sam. Say it big. Say it big! If Lethla is here inspace, then Kriere's not far away from him!     Burnett shrugged. More bodies, more people, more war. What the hell.What the hell. He was tired. Talk about bodies and rulers to someoneelse.     Rice grabbed him by the shoulders. Snap out of it, Sam. Think!Kriere\u2014The All-Mighty\u2014in our territory. His right hand man dead. Thatmeans Kriere was in an accident, too!     Sam opened his thin lips and the words fell out all by themselves.Look, Rice, you're new at this game. I've been at it ever since theVenus-Earth mess started. It's been see-sawing back and forth since theday you played hookey in the tenth grade, and I've been in the thickof it. When there's nothing left but seared memories, I'll be prowlingthrough the void picking up warriors and taking them back to the goodgreen Earth. Grisly, yes, but it's routine.     As for Kriere\u2014if he's anywhere around, he's smart. Every precautionis taken to protect that one.     But Lethla! His body must mean something!     And if it does? Have we got guns aboard this morgue-ship? Are we abattle-cuiser to go against him?     We'll radio for help?     Yeah? If there's a warship within our radio range, seven hundredthousand miles, we'll get it. Unfortunately, the tide of battle hasswept out past Earth in a new war concerning Io. That's out, Rice.     Rice stood about three inches below Sam Burnett's six-foot-one. Jawhard and determined, he stared at Sam, a funny light in his eyes. Hisfingers twitched all by themselves at his sides. His mouth twisted,You're one hell of a patriot, Sam Burnett!     Burnett reached out with one long finger, tapped it quietly on Rice'sbarrel-chest. Haul a cargo of corpses for three thousand nights anddays and see how patriotic you feel. All those fine muscled ladsbloated and crushed by space pressures and heat-blasts. Fine lads whostart out smiling and get the smile burned off down to the bone\u2014     Burnett swallowed and didn't say anything more, but he closed his eyes.He stood there, smelling the death-odor in the hot air of the ship,hearing the chug-chug-chug of the blood pumps down below, and his ownheart waiting warm and heavy at the base of his throat.     This is my last cargo, Rice. I can't take it any longer. And I don'tcare much how I go back to earth. This Venusian here\u2014what's his name?Lethla. He's number ninety-eight. Shove me into shelf ninety-ninebeside him and get the hell home. That's how I feel!     Rice was going to say something, but he didn't have time.     Lethla was alive.     He rose from the floor with slow, easy movements, almost like a dream.He didn't say anything. The heat-blast in his white fingers did all thenecessary talking. It didn't say anything either, but Burnett knew whatlanguage it would use if it had to.     Burnett swallowed hard. The body had looked funny. Too dead. Now heknew why. Involuntarily, Burnett moved forward. Lethla moved like apale spider, flicking his fragile arm to cover Burnett, the gun in itlike a dead cold star.     Rice sucked in his breath. Burnett forced himself to take it easy. Fromthe corners of his eyes he saw Rice's expression go deep and tight,biting lines into his sharp face.     Rice got it out, finally. How'd you do it? he demanded, bitterly.How'd you live in the void? It's impossible!     A crazy thought came ramming down and exploded in Burnett's head.      Younever catch up with the war!       But what if the war catches up with you?     What in hell would Lethla be wanting aboard a morgue ship?   <doc-sep> And the claw closed as Burnett spoke, closed slowly and certainly, allaround Kriere, crushing him into a ridiculous posture of silence. Therewas blood running on the claw, and the only recognizable part was thehead, which was carefully preserved for identification.     That was the only way to draw Lethla off guard.     Burnett spun about and leaped.     The horror on Lethla's face didn't go away as he fired his gun.     Rice came in fighting, too, but not before something like a red-hotramrod stabbed Sam Burnett, catching him in the ribs, spinning him backlike a drunken idiot to fall in a corner.     Fists made blunt flesh noises. Lethla went down, weaponless andscreaming. Rice kicked. After awhile Lethla quit screaming, and theroom swam around in Burnett's eyes, and he closed them tight andstarted laughing.     He didn't finish laughing for maybe ten minutes. He heard the retrieverclaws come inside, and the star-port grind shut.     Out of the red darkness, Rice's voice came and then he could see Rice'syoung face over him. Burnett groaned.     Rice said, Sam, you shouldn't have done it. You shouldn't have, Sam.     To hell with it. Burnett winced, and fought to keep his eyes open.Something wet and sticky covered his chest. I said this was my lasttrip and I meant it. One way or the other, I'd have quit!     This is the hard way\u2014     Maybe. I dunno. Kind of nice to think of all those kids who'll neverhave to come aboard the      Constellation     , though, Rice. His voicetrailed off. You watch the shelves fill up and you never know who'llbe next. Who'd have thought, four days ago\u2014     Something happened to his tongue so it felt like hard ice blocking hismouth. He had a lot more words to say, but only time to get a few ofthem out:     Rice?     Yeah, Sam?     We haven't got a full cargo, boy.     Full enough for me, sir.     But still not full. If we went back to Center Base without fillingthe shelves, it wouldn't be right. Look there\u2014number ninety-eight isLethla\u2014number ninety-nine is Kriere. Three thousand days of rollingthis rocket, and not once come back without a bunch of the kids whowant to sleep easy on the good green earth. Not right to be going backany way\u2014but\u2014the way\u2014we used to\u2014     His voice got all full of fog. As thick as the fists of a dozenwarriors. Rice was going away from him. Rice was standing still, andBurnett was lying down, not moving, but somehow Rice was going away amillion miles.     Ain't I one hell of a patriot, Rice?     Then everything got dark except Rice's face. And that was starting todissolve.     Ninety-eight: Lethla. Ninety-nine: Kriere.     He could still see Rice standing over him for a long time, breathingout and in. Down under the tables the blood-pumps pulsed and pulsed,thick and slow. Rice looked down at Burnett and then at the empty shelfat the far end of the room, and then back at Burnett again.     And then he said softly:           One hundred.        "

        "Query": "What are Sam Burnett's thoughts on his occupation while working on the Morgue Ship?",
        "Summary_1": "Sam Burnett is very jaded by his job. He has spent years returning dead bodies to Earth, lost in a seemingly endless war. He suggests that he began the job with less of a sullen view, but that opinion is forever lost. He no longer has the emotional capacity to acknowledge the individual lives of each lost warrior. Sam feels as if his job is rotting him from the inside and starving him from real life and action. He has no energy or excitement in his actions anymore because of his job causing him to complete it in an almost mechanical way. He becomes numb to the bodies; seeing them and preparing them to be stored is just a regular part of his routine. All Sam wants to do is return back to Earth, dead or alive. ",
        "Summary_2": "Sam Burnett is tired of his job and plans to quit. He thinks that ten years is too long to go from Earth to nowhere and that each hour ate him up like maggots inside. Burnett is starved for action, as his only company are the dead soldiers who can no longer speak and Rice. Although he has built up a mental defense by doing his job with mechanical hands, he still has emotions that haunt him. When Rice asks him about Lethla, he has no interest and grows instantly tired. However, Burnett is determined to get out of this job one way or another. This is what motivates him to act out against Lethla and Kriere, even though they are two highly dangerous and important Venusian figures. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Sam Burnett despises his job, noting several times throughout the story that he is eager to end his last trip. Working in a morgue is morbid enough, but being stuck in a ship for ten years has added to it. Burnett no longer sees motivation for much anymore, becoming desensitized to seeing dead body after dead body. He no longer holds excitement about the war because he can only witness its aftermath. Burnett's feelings towards his job are expressed when he blows up at Rice, claiming that he wouldn't care if he returned to Earth as one of the dead bodies on their shelves. ",
        "Summary_4": "Sam Burnett is tired of his job - it's monotonous and all the bodies seem the same to him. He is also sympathetic to the young warriors being dead. Every new corpse makes him more upset and he can't handle it any longer, he is tired of the war and doesn't want anyone else dead. He wants to return to Earth. He used to be a 'machine' and do his job automatically, but he broke, now he can't handle those corpses. He doesn't feel alive as well, Lethra's arrival, the possibility to end the war, spark life in Sam, they bring some action in. He wants to save all the rest warriors by ending the war not to see more corpses. He is willing to retire no matter which way, even death is a way. ",

        "Summary_1": "The story begins on the morgue ship named Constellation. Sam Burnett is mentally exhausted standing in his white gown in the laboratory room of the ship. In the laboratory there are many shelves stacked upon each other, each numbered with a scarlet color. The shelves are meant to hold the 100 dead bodies that the ship is capable of storing. Once the shelves are filled, the ship is able to return back to New York. The lab is meant for performing the work of draining and preserving the dead bodies for them to then be stored. Sam leaves the laboratory at the request of Rice\u2019s calls. After they realize that Lethla is alive, Lethla orders the two to go find Kriere. They head to the control room full of levers and audio and visual plates where Sam begins to maneuver the ship. It is in the control room that Sam dies on the ship. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story is set in space, onboard the Constellation. There are controls to drive the ship, a star-port, and claws that extend out from the ship. There is also a radio for communication and no weapons. There is also a drainage-preservative lab, transparent tables, glass retorts, and refrigerator shelves. The control-room sector of the room has an air-lock and a ladder that goes up to the area where Rice first examines Lethla. The ship also has metal walls and numbered shelves for the dead body. Outside, there is just the void where dead bodies float. However, Kriere and Lethla were able to survive using their masks of glasslite after destroying their life-boat. ",
        "Summary_3": "The story takes place aboard the Constellation, a morgue ship following the path of the war between Earth and Venus. The bottom of the ship is a laboratory with a wall full of shelves, one hundred to be exact, each for a body collected from space. The laboratory has a ladder that leads up to the air lock control room, where the rest of space is visible. The ship has a large claw attached on its exterior that is used to retrieve bodies from the void.",
        "Summary_4": "The story takes places on a space ship which is a morgue called Constellation. It travels back and forth in space between Venus and Earth where war takes place. On the ship there are only two men alive making up its crew and ninety-seven dead bodies filling the designated shelves. The ship has a star-port which opens to let a metal claw pick up bodies in the void and take them inside. There is a table to put the dead on for inspection and surgery. Sam calls the ship 'cozy', it's small. The rungs lead to control-room. There is a radio to maintain connection with Earth. There are no weapons aboard. The enemy corpse is alive and Sam follows him to the visual-screen in. search of Kriere. The ship stops at detecting the body. It's crushed before being taken in, a fight takes place, and the empty shelves are filled, making Rice the only one live aboard. ",
        "Article": "  Morgue Ship     By RAY BRADBURY     This was Burnett's last trip. Three more     shelves to fill with space-slain warriors\u2014and     he would be among the living again.     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Planet Stories Summer 1944.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      He heard the star-port grind open, and the movement of the metal clawsgroping into space, and then the star-port closed.     There was another dead man aboard the      Constellation     .     Sam Burnett shook his long head, trying to think clearly. Pallid andquiet, three bodies lay on the cold transparent tables around him;machines stirred, revolved, hummed. He didn't see them. He didn't seeanything but a red haze over his mind. It blotted out the far wall ofthe laboratory where the shelves went up and down, numbered in scarlet,keeping the bodies of soldiers from all further harm.     Burnett didn't move. He stood there in his rumpled white surgicalgown, staring at his fingers gloved in bone-white rubber; feeling alltight and wild inside himself. It went on for days. Moving the ship.Opening the star-port. Extending the retriever claw. Plucking some poorwarrior's body out of the void.     He didn't like it any more. Ten years is too long to go back andforth from Earth to nowhere. You came out empty and you went backfull-cargoed with a lot of warriors who didn't laugh or talk or smoke,who just lay on their shelves, all one hundred of them, waiting for adecent burial.     Number ninety-eight. Coming matter of fact and slow, Rice's voicefrom the ceiling radio hit Burnett.     Number ninety-eight, Burnett repeated. Working on ninety-five,ninety-six and ninety-seven now. Blood-pumps, preservative, slightsurgery. Off a million miles away his voice was talking. It soundeddeep. It didn't belong to him anymore.     Rice said:     Boyohbody! Two more pick-ups and back to New York. Me for a ten-daydrunk!     Burnett peeled the gloves off his huge, red, soft hands, slapped theminto a floor incinerator mouth. Back to Earth. Then spin around andshoot right out again in the trail of the war-rockets that blasted oneanother in galactic fury, to sidle up behind gutted wrecks of ships,salvaging any bodies still intact after the conflict.     Two men. Rice and himself. Sharing a cozy morgue ship with a hundredother men who had forgotten, quite suddenly, however, to talk again.     Ten years of it. Every hour of those ten years eating like maggotsinside, working out to the surface of Burnett's face, working under thehusk of his starved eyes and starved limbs. Starved for life. Starvedfor action.     This would be his last trip, or he'd know the reason why!     Sam!     Burnett jerked. Rice's voice clipped through the drainage-preservativelab, bounded against glassite retorts, echoed from the refrigeratorshelves. Burnett stared at the tabled bodies as if they would leap tolife, even while preservative was being pumped into their veins.     Sam! On the double! Up the rungs!     Burnett closed his eyes and said a couple of words, firmly. Nothing wasworth running for any more. Another body. There had been one hundredthousand bodies preceding it. Nothing unusual about a body with bloodcooling in it.   <doc-sep> Lethla half-crouched in the midst of the smell of death and thechugging of blood-pumps below. In the silence he reached up with quickfingers, tapped a tiny crystal stud upon the back of his head, and thehalves of a microscopically thin chrysalis parted transparently offof his face. He shucked it off, trailing air-tendrils that had beeninserted, hidden in the uniform, ending in thin globules of oxygen.     He spoke. Triumph warmed his crystal-thin voice. That's how I did it,Earthman.     Glassite! said Rice. A face-moulded mask of glassite!     Lethla nodded. His milk-blue eyes dilated. Very marvelously pared toan unbreakable thickness of one-thirtieth of an inch; worn only on thehead. You have to look quickly to notice it, and, unfortunately, viewedas you saw it, outside the ship, floating in the void, not discernibleat all.     Prickles of sweat appeared on Rice's face. He swore at the Venusian andthe Venusian laughed like some sort of stringed instrument, high andquick.     Burnett laughed, too. Ironically. First time in years a man ever cameaboard the Constellation alive. It's a welcome change.     Lethla showed his needle-like teeth. I thought it might be. Where'syour radio?     Go find it! snapped Rice, hotly.     I will. One hand, blue-veined, on the ladder-rungs, Lethla paused.I know you're weaponless; Purple Cross regulations. And this air-lockis safe. Don't move. Whispering, his naked feet padded white up theladder. Two long breaths later something crashed; metal and glass andcoils. The radio.     Burnett put his shoulder blades against the wall-metal, looking at hisfeet. When he glanced up, Rice's fresh, animated face was spoiled bythe new bitterness in it.     Lethla came down. Like a breath of air on the rungs.     He smiled. That's better. Now. We can talk\u2014     Rice said it, slow:     Interplanetary law declares it straight, Lethla! Get out! Only deadmen belong here.     Lethla's gun grip tightened. More talk of that nature, and only deadmen there will be. He blinked. But first\u2014we must rescue Kriere....     Kriere! Rice acted as if he had been hit in the jaw.     Burnett moved his tongue back and forth on his lips silently, his eyeslidded, listening to the two of them as if they were a radio drama.Lethla's voice came next:     Rather unfortunately, yes. He's still alive, heading toward Venusat an orbital velocity of two thousand m.p.h., wearing one of theseair-chrysali. Enough air for two more hours. Our flag ship was attackedunexpectedly yesterday near Mars. We were forced to take to thelife-boats, scattering, Kriere and I in one, the others sacrificingtheir lives to cover our escape. We were lucky. We got through theEarth cordon unseen. But luck can't last forever.     We saw your morgue ship an hour ago. It's a long, long way to Venus.We were running out of fuel, food, water. Radio was broken. Capturewas certain. You were coming our way; we took the chance. We set asmall time-bomb to destroy the life-rocket, and cast off, wearing ourchrysali-helmets. It was the first time we had ever tried using them totrick anyone. We knew you wouldn't know we were alive until it was toolate and we controlled your ship. We knew you picked up all bodies forbrief exams, returning alien corpses to space later.     Rice's voice was sullen. A set-up for you, huh? Traveling under theprotection of the Purple Cross you can get your damned All-Mighty safeto Venus.     Lethla bowed slightly. Who would suspect a Morgue Rocket of providingsafe hiding for precious Venusian cargo?     Precious is the word for you, brother! said Rice.     Enough! Lethla moved his gun several inches.     Accelerate toward Venus, mote-detectors wide open. Kriere must bepicked up\u2014      now!        <doc-sep> The officer picked up the dollar bill and fingered it with evidentinterest. He turned it over and studied the printing. United States ofAmerica, he read aloud. What are those?     It's the name of the country I come from, Jeff said carefully.I\u2014uh\u2014got on the wrong train, apparently, and must have come furtherthan I thought. What's the name of this place?     This is Costa, West Goodland, in the Continental Federation. Say, youmust come from an umpty remote part of the world if you don't knowabout this country. His eyes narrowed. Where'd you learn to speakFederal, if you come from so far?     Jeff said helplessly, I can't explain, if you don't know about theUnited States. Listen, can you take me to a bank, or some place wherethey know about foreign exchange?     The policeman scowled. How'd you get into this country, anyway? Yougot immigrate clearance?     An angry muttering started among the bystanders.     The policeman made up his mind. You come with me.     At the police station, Jeff put his elbows dejectedly on the highcounter while the policeman talked to an officer in charge. Some menwhom Jeff took for reporters got up from a table and eased over tolisten.     I don't know whether to charge them with fakemake, bumsy, peekage orlunate, the policeman said as he finished.     His superior gave Jeff a long puzzled stare.     Jeff sighed. I know it sounds impossible, but a man brought me insomething he claimed was a time traveler. You speak the same language Ido\u2014more or less\u2014but everything else is kind of unfamiliar. I belongin the United States, a country in North America. I can't believe I'mso far in the future that the United States has been forgotten.     There ensued a long, confused, inconclusive interrogation.     The man behind the desk asked questions which seemed stupid to Jeff andgot answers which probably seemed stupid to him.     The reporters quizzed Jeff gleefully. Come out, what are youadvertising? they kept asking. Who got you up to this?     The police puzzled over his driver's license and the other cards in hiswallet. They asked repeatedly about the lack of a Work License, whichJeff took to be some sort of union card. Evidently there was gravedoubt that he had any legal right to be in the country.     In the end, Jeff and Ann were locked in separate cells for the night.Jeff groaned and pounded the bars as he thought of his wife, imprisonedand alone in a smelly jail. After hours of pacing the cell, he lay downin the cot and reached automatically for his silver pillbox. Then hehesitated.     In past weeks, his insomnia had grown worse and worse, so that latelyhe had begun taking stronger pills. After a longing glance at thebig red and yellow capsules, he put the box away. Whatever tomorrowbrought, it wouldn't find him slow and drowsy.      IV     He passed a wakeful night. In the early morning, he looked up to see alittle man with a briefcase at his cell door.     Wish joy, Mr. Elliott, the man said coolly. I am one of Mr. Bullen'sbarmen. You know, represent at law? He sent me to arrange your release,if you are ready to be reasonable.     Jeff lay there and put his hands behind his head. I doubt if I'mready. I'm comfortable here. By the way, how did you know where I was?     No problem. When we read in this morning's newspapers about a manclaiming to be a time traveler, we knew.     All right. Now start explaining. Until I understand where I am, Bullenisn't getting me out of here.     The lawyer smiled and sat down. Mr. Kersey told you yesterday\u2014you'vegone back six years. But you'll need some mental gymnastics tounderstand. Time is a dimension, not a stream of events like a moviefilm. A film never changes. Space does\u2014and time does. For example, ifa movie showed a burning house at Sixth and Main, would you expect tofind a house burning whenever you returned to that corner?     You mean to say that if I went back to 1865, I wouldn't find the CivilWar was over and Lincoln had been assassinated?     If you go back to the time you call 1865\u2014which is most easilydone\u2014you will find that the people there know nothing of a Lincoln orthat war.     Jeff looked blank. What are they doing then?     The little man spread his hands. What are the people doing now atSixth and Main? Certainly not the same things they were doing the dayof the fire. We're talking about a dimension, not an event. Don't yougrasp the difference between the two?     Nope. To me, 1865 means the end of the Civil War. How else can youspeak of a point in time except by the events that happened then?     Well, if you go to a place in three-dimensional space\u2014say, a lakein the mountains\u2014how do you identify that place? By looking forlandmarks. It doesn't matter that an eagle is soaring over a mountainpeak. That's only an event. The peak is the landmark. You follow me?     So far. Keep talking.  "

        "Query": "What does the phrase \"You can never catch up with war\" mean in Morgue Ship?",
        "Summary_1": "At the beginning of the story, Sam Burnett makes note of the phrase to dictate the endless feeling that he associates with the conflict. He suggests that there is always going to be more bodies no matter how long or how many he retrieves. Even as victory may seem near, there is always another obstacle to face and the war never truly ends. \n\nDuring the middle of the story, Burnett questions whether it is possible for war to catch up on someone. He and Rice work on a non-combative ship and yet have found themselves thrust into a pivotal moment in the conflict that should theoretically not have ever involved them. Sam sticks to his conviction that one can still not catch up with war. \n\nWhile Sam is taking the ship towards Kriere, he thinks about whether he should fully comply with Lethla and Kriere or not to comply with their orders. He realizes that the situation as convoluted as it was, meant that he had unintentionally caught up with the war. That it was a rare and singular opportunity. While one may not be able to purposefully catch up with war, because war is unable to be controlled or predicted, it is possible for one\u2019s path to cross with war. That presents an opportunity to greatly influence the war. \n",
        "Summary_2": "The phrase \u201cyou can never catch up with war\u201d means that for Burnett\u2019s job, the war will always leave more casualties for him to clean up. Although he and the Constellation can retrieve as many bodies as they find, there will always be more bodies for them to collect. Even though many ships wave the flags of glory are ahead, Burnett\u2019s job will only ever let him go on the dark, quiet trail of death to examine the wreckage. This wreckage is almost always dead bodies that need to be brought back to Earth. As long as there is war, then the job will never end, and Burnett will never catch up to the growing pile of bodies. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Burnett repeats the phrase \"you can never catch up with the war\" in his mind as a reminder of the mundaneness and somberness of his job. His collection of bodies seems infinite, and the morgue ship follows the path of the war, but never close enough to witness it, only close enough to see the aftermath and pick up after it. Burnett is not able to experience the victories, thrills, or challenges of war. Instead, he sees its destruction and is forced to clean the mess. This phrase holds significance when Burnett decides to seize the opportunity to capture Lethla and Kriere, viewing this as a chance to finally catch up with the war.",
        "Summary_4": "This phrase is repeated several times which makes it important and emphasized. The phrase reflects Sam's feelings and attitude towards war and his job. He is overwhelmed with constant arrival of dead young bodies and feels bad about the war, he dream about its ending and return home. The phrase reflects on the amount of bodies - there are so many, that it's impossible to catch up. The horrors of war are so intense and they have such a strong impression on Sam that he can't catch up anymore. Later, the phrase gets a different meaning - the morgue ship stayed away from real war dealing with the dead only. Lethra's arrival changes it and brings war to the ship, making it caught up by war without intention. ",
        "Article": "Sam! Rice turned swiftly as Burnett dragged himself up the ladder.Red and warm, Rice's face hovered over the body of a sprawled enemyofficial. Take a look at this!     Burnett caught his breath. His eyes narrowed. There was something wrongwith the body; his experienced glance knew that. He didn't know what itwas.     Maybe it was because the body looked a little      too     dead.     Burnett didn't say anything, but he climbed the rest of the way,stood quietly in the grey-metal air-lock. The enemy official was asdelicately made as a fine white spider. Eyelids, closed, were faintlyblue. The hair was thin silken strands of pale gold, waved and pressedclose to a veined skull. Where the thin-lipped mouth fell open acluster of needle-tipped teeth glittered. The fragile body was enclosedcompletely in milk-pale syntha-silk, a holstered gun at the middle.     Burnett rubbed his jaw. Well?     Rice exploded. His eyes were hot in his young, sharp-cut face, hot andblack. Good Lord, Sam, do you know who this is?     Burnett scowled uneasily and said no.     It's Lethla! Rice retorted.     Burnett said, Lethla? And then: Oh, yes! Kriere's majordomo. Thatright?     Don't say it calm, Sam. Say it big. Say it big! If Lethla is here inspace, then Kriere's not far away from him!     Burnett shrugged. More bodies, more people, more war. What the hell.What the hell. He was tired. Talk about bodies and rulers to someoneelse.     Rice grabbed him by the shoulders. Snap out of it, Sam. Think!Kriere\u2014The All-Mighty\u2014in our territory. His right hand man dead. Thatmeans Kriere was in an accident, too!     Sam opened his thin lips and the words fell out all by themselves.Look, Rice, you're new at this game. I've been at it ever since theVenus-Earth mess started. It's been see-sawing back and forth since theday you played hookey in the tenth grade, and I've been in the thickof it. When there's nothing left but seared memories, I'll be prowlingthrough the void picking up warriors and taking them back to the goodgreen Earth. Grisly, yes, but it's routine.     As for Kriere\u2014if he's anywhere around, he's smart. Every precautionis taken to protect that one.     But Lethla! His body must mean something!     And if it does? Have we got guns aboard this morgue-ship? Are we abattle-cuiser to go against him?     We'll radio for help?     Yeah? If there's a warship within our radio range, seven hundredthousand miles, we'll get it. Unfortunately, the tide of battle hasswept out past Earth in a new war concerning Io. That's out, Rice.     Rice stood about three inches below Sam Burnett's six-foot-one. Jawhard and determined, he stared at Sam, a funny light in his eyes. Hisfingers twitched all by themselves at his sides. His mouth twisted,You're one hell of a patriot, Sam Burnett!     Burnett reached out with one long finger, tapped it quietly on Rice'sbarrel-chest. Haul a cargo of corpses for three thousand nights anddays and see how patriotic you feel. All those fine muscled ladsbloated and crushed by space pressures and heat-blasts. Fine lads whostart out smiling and get the smile burned off down to the bone\u2014     Burnett swallowed and didn't say anything more, but he closed his eyes.He stood there, smelling the death-odor in the hot air of the ship,hearing the chug-chug-chug of the blood pumps down below, and his ownheart waiting warm and heavy at the base of his throat.     This is my last cargo, Rice. I can't take it any longer. And I don'tcare much how I go back to earth. This Venusian here\u2014what's his name?Lethla. He's number ninety-eight. Shove me into shelf ninety-ninebeside him and get the hell home. That's how I feel!     Rice was going to say something, but he didn't have time.     Lethla was alive.     He rose from the floor with slow, easy movements, almost like a dream.He didn't say anything. The heat-blast in his white fingers did all thenecessary talking. It didn't say anything either, but Burnett knew whatlanguage it would use if it had to.     Burnett swallowed hard. The body had looked funny. Too dead. Now heknew why. Involuntarily, Burnett moved forward. Lethla moved like apale spider, flicking his fragile arm to cover Burnett, the gun in itlike a dead cold star.     Rice sucked in his breath. Burnett forced himself to take it easy. Fromthe corners of his eyes he saw Rice's expression go deep and tight,biting lines into his sharp face.     Rice got it out, finally. How'd you do it? he demanded, bitterly.How'd you live in the void? It's impossible!     A crazy thought came ramming down and exploded in Burnett's head.      Younever catch up with the war!       But what if the war catches up with you?     What in hell would Lethla be wanting aboard a morgue ship?   <doc-sep> Shaking his head, he walked unsteadily toward the rungs that gleamedup into the air-lock, control-room sector of the rocket. He climbedwithout making any noise on the rungs.     He kept thinking the one thing he couldn't forget.       You never catch up with the war.       All the color is ahead of you. The drive of orange rocket traces acrossstars, the whamming of steel-nosed bombs into elusive targets, thetitanic explosions and breathless pursuits, the flags and the excitedglory are always a million miles ahead.     He bit his teeth together.       You never catch up with the war.       You come along when space has settled back, when the vacuum has stoppedtrembling from unleashed forces between worlds. You come along in thedark quiet of death to find the wreckage plunging with all the fury ofits original acceleration in no particular direction. You can only seeit; you don't hear anything in space but your own heart kicking yourribs.     You see bodies, each in its own terrific orbit, given impetus bygrinding collisions, tossed from mother ships and dancing head overfeet forever and forever with no goal. Bits of flesh in ruptured spacesuits, mouths open for air that had never been there in a hundredbillion centuries. And they kept dancing without music until youextended the retriever-claw and culled them into the air-lock.     That was all the war-glory he got. Nothing but the stunned, shiveringsilence, the memory of rockets long gone, and the shelves filling upall too quickly with men who had once loved laughing.     You wondered who all the men were; and who the next ones would be.After ten years you made yourself blind to them. You went around doingyour job with mechanical hands.     But even a machine breaks down....   <doc-sep> It isn't so much our defense that worries me, my mother muttered, aslack of adequate medical machinery. War is bound to mean casualtiesand there aren't enough cure-alls on the planet to take care of them.It's useless to expect the government to build more right now; they'llbe too busy producing weapons. Sylvia, you'd better take a leave ofabsence from your job and come down to Psycho Center to learn first-aidtechniques. And you too, Kevin, she added, obviously a littlesurprised herself at what she was saying. Probably you'd be evenbetter at it than Sylvia since you aren't sensitive to other people'spain.     I looked at her.     It      is     an ill wind, she agreed, smiling wryly, but don't let mecatch you thinking that way, Kevin. Can't you see it would be betterthat there should be no war and you should remain useless?     I couldn't see it, of course, and she knew that, with her wretchedtalent for stripping away my feeble attempts at privacy. Psi-powersusually included some ability to form a mental shield; being withoutone, I was necessarily devoid of the other.     My attitude didn't matter, though, because it was definitely war. Thealiens came back with a fleet clearly bent on our annihilation\u2014eventhe 'paths couldn't figure out their motives, for the thought patternwas entirely different from ours\u2014and the war was on.     I had enjoyed learning first-aid; it was the first time I had everworked with people as an equal. And I was good at it because psi-powersaren't much of an advantage there. Telekinesis maybe a little, butI was big enough to lift anybody without needing any superhumanabilities\u2014normal human abilities, rather.     Gee, Mr. Faraday, one of the other students breathed, you're sostrong. And without 'kinesis or anything.     I looked at her and liked what I saw. She was blonde and pretty. Myname's not Mr. Faraday, I said. It's Kevin.     My name's Lucy, she giggled.     No girl had ever giggled at me in that way before. Immediately Istarted to envision a beautiful future for the two of us, then flushedwhen I realized that she might be a telepath. But she was winding atourniquet around the arm of another member of the class with apparentunconcern.     Hey, quit that! the windee yelled. You're making it too tight! I'llbe mortified!     So Lucy was obviously not a telepath. Later I found out she was onlya low-grade telesensitive\u2014just a poetess\u2014so I had nothing to worryabout as far as having my thoughts read went. I was a little afraid ofSylvia's kidding me about my first romance, but, as it happened, shegot interested in one of the guys who was taking the class with us, andshe was not only too busy to be bothered with me, but in too vulnerablea position herself.     However, when the actual bombs\u2014or their alien equivalent\u2014struck nearour town, I wasn't nearly so happy, especially after they startedcarrying the wounded into the Psycho Center, which had been turned intoa hospital for the duration. I took one look at the gory scene\u2014I hadnever seen anybody really injured before; few people had, as a matterof fact\u2014and started for the door. But Mother was already blocking theway. It was easy to see from which side of the family Tim had got histalent for prognostication.     If the telepaths who can pick up all the pain can stand this, Kevin,she said,       you     certainly can. And there was no kindness at all inthe      you     .     She gave me a shove toward the nearest stretcher. Go on\u2014now's yourchance to show you're of some use in this world.  "

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in LEX?",
        "Summary_1": "Peter Manners is awaiting his job interview at Lex Industries. He is very nervous but also has to worry about still being unemployed with barely any money saved. Since he is fifteen minutes early, he decides to look around the manufacturing plant. Peter then goes to his interview, and a voice from a loudspeaker directs him down to the hall where Mr. Lexington is waiting. He goes in through the multiple doors, where Mr. Lexington greets him roughly and looks over his qualifications. The other man begins asking Peter questions, to which Peter responds but is confused about how they have any relation to his job application. Mr. Lexington tells Peter that he has been stockpiled at his last company, given skills that will only ever help that specific company and nowhere else. Mr. Lexington then tells Peter that he had just proven that he has fewer skills than when he was in school, but he is pleased by Peter\u2019s performance in the interview so far nonetheless. He tells Peter that he is the only person in the building and makes Peter follow him. They go through the machinery, and they reach the inside of a loading truck. Mr. Lexington explains that this area is where raw materials are delivered and that he has small machines, part of a bigger machine, all working together to operate the factory. They go to the office section of the building, where there is a small typewriter working. A central control mechanism operates everything, and Mr. Lexington does not even have to deal with much mail at all each week. Mr. Lexington explains his own history working as an engineer and how he spent most of his time developing his machinery. Peter is amazed by all of the machinery, and he continues to discuss machine parts such as the kicker button with Mr. Lexington. Just as they keep talking, the door opens, and a self-propelled cart asks if he would like cream and sugar with his coffee. Mr. Lexington is angry about the cup, and he insults them as being impractical. He also further clarifies that Lex Industries is named after his wife Alexis\u2019 nickname. The company continues to earn a lot of money, and he also does not need to monitor progress constantly. Mr. Lexington also mentions that when he was extremely pleased with progress one day, he went to the kicker button and found it removed. He asked the machine what was going on, and the machine sent him a long message detailing how it was aware of when he was pleased with the progress made and had relieved him of the burden of having to press it every time.",
        "Summary_2": "Peter Manners is nervous about an interview that is about to begin. He tries to waste time so as not to appear too eager for the interview so he walks around the building to entertain himself. When he looks around the building he finds the building construction strange. He keeps going around the building growing more curious about its construction. He then frantically returns to the entrance after he realizes the time. Peter walks through the entrance and eventually makes it to Mr. Lexington\u2019s office where he is commanded to enter and sit down. The interview begins and Peter starts off the interview well to Mr. Lexington\u2019s acknowledgement. Peter tries to avoid being intimidated by Mr. Lexington\u2019s quick and blunt questioning to prove himself worthy of receiving the job offer. As the interview continues, Peter begins to get frustrated and angry with Mr. Lexington\u2019s line of questioning. During the interview, Mr. Lexington lets Peter know that he is the only worker in the building much to Peter\u2019s amazement. \n\nMr. Lexington begins to lead Peter out of the office and they walk to the manufacturing area as the interview continues. He explains to Peter that he uses machines to unload the trucks. He continues to lead Peter to a large bay area where different materials are stored. While Mr. Lexington is enthusiastic about the machines, Peter seems to be very wary about them. He stops to ask what Mr. Lexington does if the machines take care of the job duties. Peter is shocked to learn that he does basically nothing. \n\nMr. Lexington then sits down and explains to Peter how the machines were created. He tells Peter that he created a new company with the single unit machinery that was more successful than his original company that focused on specialized machines. His new company was able to buy out his old company. He goes on to say that to help the single unit machine learn he created an incentive for it. The incentive was based on whether Mr. Lexington was happy with the performance of the machine or not. The machine eventually learned by watching what Mr. Lexington did and focuses on taking over more responsibilities to continue to give Mr. Lexington pleasure. The machine continued to increase its abilities and made risky decisions that proved to be very beneficial to the company. The story ends with Mr. Lexington relaying a story to Peter about how the machine eventually grew so savvy that it removed Mr. Lexington\u2019s indicator for the machine that he was happy with its performance because the machine stated that it was able to discern his happiness without the button and thus no longer needed it. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Peter Manners is an engineer in search of a job. He arrives at Lex Industries for an interview set up for him by the Association of Professional Engineers. Peter arrives early, so to kill time, he walks around the exterior of the building. He is perplexed by the building, namely due to the lack of windows, abundance of electricity, and no side entrance. As he enters through automatic doors for his interview, he is led to a large office where Mr. Lexington is waiting for him. Mr. Lexington first interrogates Peter with questions that all seem to have hidden traps, including questions about his previous job, where he suggests that Peter had been stockpiled. Mr. Lexington then reveals to Peter the true operations of Lex Industries; he is the only person in the factory, and the rest are machines. Mr. Lexington takes Peter on a tour of the factory, where he sees robots, called \"manipulators\", perform manufacturing, loading, and other business tasks. Mr. Lexington explains his journey with the machinery, telling Peter about his origins in engineering, including his late wife Alexis and his devotion to his work. Mr. Lexington had opened the current factory to be run by machinery, eventually overtaking his original company. A key piece of his success had been the use of a kicker button, which signaled pleasure to the robots and eventually got them to develop a sort of conscious. The robots had chosen the name \"Lex\" for themselves. Mr. Lexington then tells Peter that one day, he found the kicker button to be removed, and received a message from Lex that said they had learned to tell whether or not they were doing a good job without the button, and declared their faith and loyalty to him.",
        "Summary_4": "Peter Manners nervously awaits his job interview in front of the office's weird building. Finally, he enters a place with everything being automated and approaches Mr. Lexington, a huge man at a huge desk, the interviewer. The dialogue is hard, Mr. Lexington is straightforward and harsh in his questions, Peter thinks well and answers with caution but gets angry in the end. Eventually, he is accepted as he is found \"teachable\". Lexington gives Peter a tour around the manufacturing area, where everything is automated and done by machines. The building is filled with robots doing every kind of job, their abundance scares Peter and reminds of the articles about the future. Lexington tells the story of his business - without education in this field, he created the business and was expanding it, replacing people by robots. Eventually, he created a system without specialization controlling the whole process, with him being the only employee and doing almost nothing. The system called itself Lex in honor of Lexington's late wife Alexis, removed the kicker button and take charge of some things, making Lexington scared to lose control. ",
        "Article": "What is it you wish? he barked. I understood in my discussions withthe other ... ah ... civilian there'd be no further need for theseirritating conferences.     I've just learned you're placing more students abroad, Mr. Gulver. Howmany this time?     Two thousand.     And where will they be going?     Croanie. It's all in the application form I've handed in. Your job isto provide transportation.     Will there be any other students embarking this season?     Why ... perhaps. That's Boge's business. Gulver looked at Retief withpursed lips. As a matter of fact, we had in mind dispatching anothertwo thousand to Featherweight.     Another under-populated world\u2014and in the same cluster, I believe,Retief said. Your people must be unusually interested in that regionof space.     If that's all you wanted to know, I'll be on my way. I have matters ofimportance to see to.     After Gulver left, Retief called Miss Furkle in. I'd like to have abreak-out of all the student movements that have been planned under thepresent program, he said. And see if you can get a summary of whatMEDDLE has been shipping lately.     Miss Furkle compressed her lips. If Mr. Magnan were here, I'm surehe wouldn't dream of interfering in the work of other departments.I ... overheard your conversation with the gentleman from the CroanieLegation\u2014     The lists, Miss Furkle.     I'm not accustomed, Miss Furkle said, to intruding in mattersoutside our interest cluster.     That's worse than listening in on phone conversations, eh? But nevermind. I need the information, Miss Furkle.     Loyalty to my Chief\u2014     Loyalty to your pay-check should send you scuttling for the materialI've asked for, Retief said. I'm taking full responsibility. Nowscat.     The buzzer sounded. Retief flipped a key. MUDDLE, Retief speaking....     Arapoulous's brown face appeared on the desk screen.     How-do, Retief. Okay if I come up?     Sure, Hank. I want to talk to you.     In the office, Arapoulous took a chair. Sorry if I'm rushing you,Retief, he said. But have you got anything for me?     Retief waved at the wine bottles. What do you know about Croanie?     Croanie? Not much of a place. Mostly ocean. All right if you likefish, I guess. We import our seafood from there. Nice prawns in monsoontime. Over a foot long.     You on good terms with them?     Sure, I guess so. Course, they're pretty thick with Boge.     So?     Didn't I tell you? Boge was the bunch that tried to take us over herea dozen years back. They'd've made it too, if they hadn't had a lot ofbad luck. Their armor went in the drink, and without armor they're easygame.     Miss Furkle buzzed. I have your lists, she said shortly.     Bring them in, please.   <doc-sep> Lexington stared at his cup without touching it for a long while. Thenhe continued with his narrative. I suppose it's all my own fault. Ididn't detect the symptoms soon enough. After this plant got workingproperly, I started living here. It wasn't a question of saving money.I hated to waste two hours a day driving to and from my house, and Ialso wanted to be on hand in case anything should go wrong that themachine couldn't fix for itself.     Handling the cup as if it were going to shatter at any moment, he tooka gulp. I began to see that the machine could understand the writtenword, and I tried hooking a teletype directly into the logic circuits.It was like uncorking a seltzer bottle. The machine had a funnyvocabulary\u2014all of it gleaned from letters it had seen coming in, andreplies it had seen leaving. But it was intelligible. It even displayedsome traces of the personality the machine was acquiring.     It had chosen a name for itself, for instance\u2014'Lex.' That shook me.You might think Lex Industries was named through an abbreviation ofthe name Lexington, but it wasn't. My wife's name was Alexis, and itwas named after the nickname she always used. I objected, of course,but how can you object on a point like that to a machine? Bear in mindthat I had to be careful to behave reasonably at all times, because themachine was still learning from me, and I was afraid that any tantrumsI threw might be imitated.     It sounds pretty awkward, Peter put in.     You don't know the half of it! As time went on, I had less and less todo, and business-wise I found that the entire control of the operationwas slipping from my grasp. Many times I discovered\u2014too late\u2014thatthe machine had taken the damnedest risks you ever saw on bids andcontracts for supply. It was quoting impossible delivery times onsome orders, and charging pirate's prices on others, all without anyobvious reason. Inexplicably, we always came out on top. It would turnout that on the short-delivery-time quotations, we'd been up againststiff competition, and cutting the production time was the only way wecould get the order. On the high-priced quotes, I'd find that no oneelse was bidding. We were making more money than I'd ever dreamed of,and to make it still better, I'd find that for months I had virtuallynothing to do.     It sounds wonderful, sir, said Peter, feeling dazzled.     It was, in a way. I remember one day I was especially pleased withsomething, and I went to the control console to give the kicker buttona long, hard push. The button, much to my amazement, had been removed,and a blank plate had been installed to cover the opening in the board.I went over to the teletype and punched in the shortest message I hadever sent. 'LEX\u2014WHAT THE HELL?' I typed.     The answer came back in the jargon it had learned from letters it hadseen, and I remember it as if it just happened. 'MR.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]        Nothing in the world could be happier and       mere serene than a man who loves his work\u2014but       what happens when it loves him back?        Keep your nerve, Peter Manners told himself; it's only a job. But nervehas to rest on a sturdier foundation than cash reserves just above zeroand eviction if he came away from this interview still unemployed.Clay, at the Association of Professional Engineers, who had set up theappointment, hadn't eased Peter's nervousness by admitting, I don'tknow what in hell he's looking for. He's turned down every man we'vesent him.     The interview was at three. Fifteen minutes to go. Coming early wouldbetray overeagerness. Peter stood in front of the Lex Industries plantand studied it to kill time. Plain, featureless concrete walls, notlarge for a manufacturing plant\u2014it took a scant minute to exhaust itssightseeing potential. If he walked around the building, he could, ifhe ambled, come back to the front entrance just before three.     He turned the corner, stopped, frowned, wondering what there was aboutthe building that seemed so puzzling. It could not have been plainer,more ordinary. It was in fact, he only gradually realized, so plain andordinary that it was like no other building he had ever seen.     There had been windows at the front. There were none at the side, andnone at the rear. Then how were the working areas lit? He looked forthe electric service lines and found them at one of the rear corners.They jolted him. The distribution transformers were ten times as largeas they should have been for a plant this size.     Something else was wrong. Peter looked for minutes before he found outwhat it was. Factories usually have large side doorways for employeeschanging shifts. This building had one small office entrance facing thestreet, and the only other door was at the loading bay\u2014big enough tohandle employee traffic, but four feet above the ground. Without anystairs, it could be used only by trucks backing up to it. Maybe theemployees' entrance was on the third side.     It wasn't.  "

        "Query": "What are the characteristics exhibited by Mr. Lexington?",
        "Summary_1": "Mr. Lexington is the owner of Lex Industries. He is the only person in the manufacturing plant. He is an eccentric but genius man who is surrounded by his machinery. Lexington started his business twenty years ago, and he never went through university despite having many interests. He gave up arts and biology, later re-entering through engineering. He also went through many stages, including commerce, accounting, and even working for a competitor. Lexington is especially interested in machine parts, which led him to begin firing employees and replacing them with automatic machines. His wife died in a car accident earlier, so he focused all of his attention on the machinery. By creating the central control system, he could give up his old company and build this new one. Although he is very rough towards Peter, he is also somewhat sympathetic to Peter\u2019s past experiences and skills. He is very proud of his machinery and does not hesitate to show all of it to Peter.",
        "Summary_2": "Mr. Lexington is the founder of Lex Industries. Peter describes him as having a large frame accompanied with large muscles. The first time that Peter meets Mr. Lexington, Mr. Lexington angrily yells for him to enter the office. It shows that Mr. Lexington can be very commanding. During the interview, Mr. Lexington asks questions trying in an attempt to be intimidating and trick Peter. He is quick to be angered and embarrassed, quickly showing his displeasure at any slightly upsetting situation. Besides his emotions, Mr. Lexington appears to tire easily after the walk through the building and his face shows his elderly age.  ",
        "Summary_3": "Mr. Lexington is the owner of Lex Industries, an electrical company. He is the overseer of all operations in the plant, and because of his success, incredibly wealthy. He is described as a large man, initially seeming to be unbreakable but then noted to have a somber, fragile expression. Mr. Lexington is confident and intimidating, evident in his interview with Peter Manners. He is knowledgable, not just about electrical engineering, but about biology, specifically cell structure and the foundations of living. Though Mr. Lexington approves of Peter, his temper is short, demonstrated when one of the robots adjusts his handkerchief as well as when he is brought coffee.",
        "Summary_4": "Mr. Lexington is a huge man of around 65 years. He is rich - his office is extremely modern and automated. He is very straightforward and harsh, he is also clever and strict, he makes others afraid of him. He loves machines and made everything automated in his office and manufacturing area. He is very demanding from employees. He criticizes the world system around. - the specialization, the stockpiling of graduates. He created the multi-purpose control circuit in his business as he wanted to replace all the workers with robots easily controlled, and he built the whole business by himself without education in the field. He has always been very concentrated on his job, paying it even more attention than to his late wife. He is very rational and practical, and he wants everything to be logical and perfect, even the coffee cups. He hates losing time so he started living at his work - very practical. ",
        "Article": "Staring back at the last blank wall, Peter suddenly remembered the timehe had set out to kill. He looked at his watch and gasped. At a run,set to straight-arm the door, he almost fell on his face. The door hadopened by itself. He stopped and looked for a photo-electric eye, buta soft voice said through a loudspeaker in the anteroom wall: Mr.Manners?     What? he panted. Who\u2014?     You      are     Mr. Manners? the voice asked.     He nodded, then realized he had to answer aloud if there was amicrophone around; but the soft voice said: Follow the open doors downthe hall. Mr. Lexington is expecting you.     Thanks, Peter said, and a door at one side of the anteroom swung openfor him.     He went through it with his composure slipping still further from hisgrip. This was no way to go into an interview, but doors kept openingbefore and shutting after him, until only one was left, and the last ofhis calm was blasted away by a bellow from within.     Don't stand out there like a jackass! Either come in or go away!     Peter found himself leaping obediently toward the doorway. He stoppedjust short of it, took a deep breath and huffed it out, took another,all the while thinking, Hold on now; you're in no shape for aninterview\u2014and it's not your fault\u2014this whole setup is geared tounnerve you: the kindergarten kid called in to see the principal.     He let another bellow bounce off him as he blew out the second breath,straightened his jacket and tie, and walked in as an engineer applyingfor a position should.     Mr. Lexington? he said. I'm Peter Manners. The Association\u2014     Sit down, said the man at the desk. Let's look you over.     He was a huge man behind an even huger desk. Peter took a chair infront of the desk and let himself be inspected. It wasn't comfortable.He did some looking over of his own to ease the tension.     The room was more than merely large, carpeted throughout witha high-pile, rich, sound-deadening rug. The oversized desk andmassive leather chairs, heavy patterned drapes, ornately framedpaintings\u2014by God, even a glass-brick manteled fireplace and bowls withflowers!\u2014made him feel as if he had walked down a hospital corridorinto Hollywood's idea of an office.     His eyes eventually had to move to Lexington, and they were dauntedfor another instant. This was a citadel of a man\u2014great girders offrame supporting buttresses of muscle\u2014with a vaulting head anddrawbridge chin and a steel gaze that defied any attempt to storm it.     But then Peter came out of his momentary flinch, and there was an ageto the man, about 65, and he saw the muscles had turned to fat, thecomplexion ashen, the eyes set deep as though retreating from pain, andthis was a citadel of a man, yes, but beginning to crumble.     What can you do? asked Lexington abruptly.   <doc-sep> The little Regulan was as good as hired. Only the formalities remained.You understand our terms, Mr. Fitzgerald?     I'll be placed on exhibition at your Institute on Earth. You'll payfor my services, transportation and expenses. I'll be required toremain on exhibit no more than one-third of each Terran sidereal day.     And the pay will be\u2014ah\u2014$50 Galactic a week, plus expenses andtransportation.     The spherical creature clapped his hands in joy, three hands clappingon one side, two on the other. Wonderful! I will see Earth at last! Iaccept the terms!     I buzzed for Ludlow and gave him the fast signal that meant we weresigning this alien up at half the usual pay, and Ludlow took him intothe other office to sign him up.     I grinned, pleased with myself. We needed a green Regulan in our show;the last one had quit four years ago. But just because we needed himdidn't mean we had to be extravagant in hiring him. A Terraphile alienwho goes to the extent of rechristening himself with a Terran monickerwould work for nothing, or even pay us, just so long as we let him getto Earth. My conscience won't let me really      exploit     a being, but Idon't believe in throwing money away, either.     The next applicant was a beefy ursinoid from Aldebaran IX. Our outfithas all the ursinoids it needs or is likely to need in the next fewdecades, and so I got rid of him in a couple of minutes. He wasfollowed by a roly-poly blue-skinned humanoid from Donovan's Planet,four feet high and five hundred pounds heavy. We already had a coupleof his species in the show, but they made good crowd-pleasers, beingso plump and cheerful. I passed him along to Auchinleck to sign atanything short of top rate.     Next came a bedraggled Sirian spider who was more interested in ahandout than a job. If there's any species we have a real over-supplyof, it's those silver-colored spiders, but this seedy specimen gave ita try anyway. He got the gate in half a minute, and he didn't even getthe handout he was angling for. I don't approve of begging.     The flora of applicants was steady. Ghryne is in the heart of theCaledonia Cluster, where the interstellar crossroads meet. We hadfigured to pick up plenty of new exhibits here and we were right.   <doc-sep> Save the protests, Fith. You have some explaining to do. And I don'tthink your story will be good enough.     It is for you to explain! This person who was beaten\u2014     Not beaten. Just rapped a few times to loosen his memory.     Then you admit\u2014     It worked, too. He remembered lots of things, once he put his mind toit.     Fith rose; Shluh followed suit.     I shall ask for your immediate recall, Mr. Consul. Were it not foryour diplomatic immunity, I should do more\u2014     Why did the government fall, Fith? It was just after the task forcepaid its visit, and before the arrival of the first Terrestrialdiplomatic mission.     This is an internal matter! Fith cried, in his faint Groacian voice.The new regime has shown itself most amiable to you Terrestrials. Ithas outdone itself\u2014     \u2014to keep the Terrestrial consul and his staff in the dark, Retiefsaid. And the same goes for the few terrestrial businessmen you'vevisaed. This continual round of culture; no social contacts outside thediplomatic circle; no travel permits to visit out-lying districts, oryour satellite\u2014     Enough! Fith's mandibles quivered in distress. I can talk no more ofthis matter\u2014     You'll talk to me, or there'll be a task force here in five days to dothe talking, Retief said.     You can't! Miss Meuhl gasped.     Retief turned a steady look on Miss Meuhl. She closed her mouth. TheGroaci sat down.     Answer me this one, Retief said, looking at Shluh. A few yearsback\u2014about nine, I think\u2014there was a little parade held here. Somecurious looking creatures were captured. After being securely caged,they were exhibited to the gentle Groaci public. Hauled through thestreets. Very educational, no doubt. A highly cultural show.     Funny thing about these animals. They wore clothes. They seemed tocommunicate with each other. Altogether it was a very amusing exhibit.     Tell me, Shluh, what happened to those six Terrestrials after theparade was over?  "

They had seen many such stars come near out of the galaxy's glitteringbackdrop, and had seen them dwindle, turn red and go out as the      QuestIII     drove on its way once more, lashed by despair toward the speed oflight, leaving behind the mockery of yet another solitary and lifelessluminary unaccompanied by worlds where men might dwell.

        "Query": "What is the importance of the machinery in LEX?",
        "Summary_1": "The machinery is what keeps Lex Industries running and for Mr. Lexington to earn astronomical amounts of money continuously. It replaces the need for human workers and saves much of the costs that would have had to be distributed to workers. It is also the lifeline of Mr. Lexington\u2019s work and the breakthrough of his research career. Peter considers the machinery to be ideas that are planned for ten to twenty years into the future. This makes the machinery even more impressive. The fact that an entire business can be operated with the central control system makes it even more significant in helping Mr. Lexington get ahead of his competitors.",
        "Summary_2": "The machinery is very important to Mr. Lexington\u2019s company. He uses them for all of the tasks necessary to run the company, such as unloading the trucks and the supply chain department. The machines helped Mr. Lexington grow his business and make more money. He didn\u2019t like the specialization that many people focused on when creating machines to replace humans which is why he created a single unit taking inspiration from biology. They are modelled by the behavior of biology as Mr. Lexington is very fascinated by the subject. The machinery was able to increase its intelligence by learning from watching what Mr. Lexington did and taking over those responsibilities. The machine proved to become increasingly self-aware and intelligent to Mr. Lexington\u2019s surprise. ",
        "Summary_3": "The machinery used at Lex Industries is the product of years of trial and error by Mr. Lexington to create the most profitable business model. He has designed the machinery to operate on one multi-purpose control circuit, and gradually taught the machines to remember, detect patters, and define success. The latter was accomplished using a \"kicker button\", which Mr. Lexington would press when he was pleased with the factory's operations. The machinery and its efficiency is what has made Lex Industries so successful; the short production time, fast shipping, and little labor. ",
        "Summary_4": "Machines are doing everything in Lex Industries, they replace every human job. Doors are opening by themselves, the lights turn on and off on their own as people go by. An automatic voice meets the visitors instead of a secretary. Bookkeeping, mail sorting, unloading trucks, checking the cargo, sorting it, and all other parts of production are made by robots. They are controlled by one main system of the plant, making it one automatic system. The machines fill the building and make it lonely, they scare Peter, while Lexington loves them. Such structure reminds Peter of the plans for the future, as other such offices do not exist. Machines deprive Lexington of any job at all for months and even take control sometimes, they even threaten his authority. ",
        "Article": "Lexington stared at his cup without touching it for a long while. Thenhe continued with his narrative. I suppose it's all my own fault. Ididn't detect the symptoms soon enough. After this plant got workingproperly, I started living here. It wasn't a question of saving money.I hated to waste two hours a day driving to and from my house, and Ialso wanted to be on hand in case anything should go wrong that themachine couldn't fix for itself.     Handling the cup as if it were going to shatter at any moment, he tooka gulp. I began to see that the machine could understand the writtenword, and I tried hooking a teletype directly into the logic circuits.It was like uncorking a seltzer bottle. The machine had a funnyvocabulary\u2014all of it gleaned from letters it had seen coming in, andreplies it had seen leaving. But it was intelligible. It even displayedsome traces of the personality the machine was acquiring.     It had chosen a name for itself, for instance\u2014'Lex.' That shook me.You might think Lex Industries was named through an abbreviation ofthe name Lexington, but it wasn't. My wife's name was Alexis, and itwas named after the nickname she always used. I objected, of course,but how can you object on a point like that to a machine? Bear in mindthat I had to be careful to behave reasonably at all times, because themachine was still learning from me, and I was afraid that any tantrumsI threw might be imitated.     It sounds pretty awkward, Peter put in.     You don't know the half of it! As time went on, I had less and less todo, and business-wise I found that the entire control of the operationwas slipping from my grasp. Many times I discovered\u2014too late\u2014thatthe machine had taken the damnedest risks you ever saw on bids andcontracts for supply. It was quoting impossible delivery times onsome orders, and charging pirate's prices on others, all without anyobvious reason. Inexplicably, we always came out on top. It would turnout that on the short-delivery-time quotations, we'd been up againststiff competition, and cutting the production time was the only way wecould get the order. On the high-priced quotes, I'd find that no oneelse was bidding. We were making more money than I'd ever dreamed of,and to make it still better, I'd find that for months I had virtuallynothing to do.     It sounds wonderful, sir, said Peter, feeling dazzled.     It was, in a way. I remember one day I was especially pleased withsomething, and I went to the control console to give the kicker buttona long, hard push. The button, much to my amazement, had been removed,and a blank plate had been installed to cover the opening in the board.I went over to the teletype and punched in the shortest message I hadever sent.

It wasn't.   <doc-sep> They wouldn't even know, he told himself, squirming through theemergency exit into the engine room, and sealing it after him. And theywouldn't understand if they did. Pink mist swirled about him. Toxiagas. Shano coughed.     He squinted around at the massive, incomprehensible machinery. The gutsof the space ship.     Then he saw the shattered, gold-gleaming cylinder, gas hissing froma fine nozzle, and filaments glowing bluish inside it, still workingaway. He saw five heavy Carrsteel rods hanging useless, on melted-downpins, and the slots their pronged ends hooked into. He looked at hishands, and shook his head.     One try, he said to himself. One try, Shano. One important thing inyour life. Here's your opportunity. The toxia gas will get you. It'llkill you at this concentration. But you'll last for maybe twelve hours.Another man wouldn't last a minute. Another man's lungs aren't cloggedwith Juno gum.     He grasped a rod and lifted it, sweating under the weight, and slippedthe forked end into its slot. Going home to die, he thought. Well,maybe not going home. Couldn't remember what Earth looked like anyway.     What was that again? Oh yeah\u2014just lift them up, and when they dropoff, lift them up again.     Shano coughed, and lifted the heavy rods into position. One jerked backsuddenly and smoothly, and something went, Pop, pop, behind him andmachinery whirred. He lifted the rod and slipped it back on. Anotherjerked, pulled open a large valve, and dropped off. Shano bent, andlifted, coughing and coughing. He forgot what he was doing, mind blankthe way it went when he worked. Just rhythmically fell into the job,the way a laborer does. He waited for a rod to slip and fall, thenlifted it up and slipped it in place, skin sweating, joints shootingpain along his limbs. He heard the machinery working. He heard thehigh, howling whine of cosmic jets. He, Shano, was making the machinerygo. He was running the cosmic drive.     A bell clanged somewhere. Engine room! Engine room! We're under way!What happened?     Silence, while Shano coughed and made the machinery go, thinking aboutthe Earth he hadn't seen for many years.     Captain! the speaker bawled. There's a man in there! Working thevalve rods! Somebody is in the engine room and the gas isn't....     Shano grinned, feeling good. Feeling happy. Lifting the heavy steelrods, driving the ship. Keeping the jets screaming and hurtling theliner      Stardust     toward Venus. He wondered if they'd found Rourke yet.If he could keep going for twelve hours they would get to Venus. Afterthat....     Home, he coughed. Hell! Who wants to go home?     He plucked at his agitated chest, thinking of a whole damn Uranianfleet swooping down on a spot in space, expecting to find a crippledship there with a spy inside it. And finding nothing. Because of Shano.A useless old man.     Coughing came out all mixed up with laughing.   "

        "Query": "What is the connection between Peter and Mr. Lexington in the story of LEX?",
        "Summary_1": "Peter first meets Mr. Lexington at his interview. He finds the other man strange from the seemingly random questions that he asks. Mr. Lexington, however, becomes more interested in Peter when he is satisfied with the responses given. While the two of them are not close, Mr. Lexington does not dismiss him on the spot and instead takes him to tour the entire factory. He also elaborates on his life story to Peter, and he does have a certain degree of trust for the other man. On the other hand, Peter is very impressed by Mr. Lexington\u2019s work and becomes more interested in how he has accomplished all of this in the time since he first began working on his business.",
        "Summary_2": "Mr. Lexington is the owner of Lex Industries and is interviewing Peter who is seeking a job. Mr. Lexington has the power of being in control of the situation because his decision is what will give Peter a job or not. Peter is initially intimidated by Mr. Lexington but as the interview continues, Peter begins to no longer be intimidated by Mr. Lexington and is able to match his challenging gaze. As the interview continues, the two settle into a friendly conversation with Mr. Lexington relaying stories about the growth of the machine\u2019s intelligence. ",
        "Summary_3": "Peter is intimidated by Mr. Lexington throughout the story; he views him as a powerful, wealthy, angry man, though he warms up to him gradually. Peter makes several remarks throughout the interview to win Mr. Lexington's approval. First, he doesn't answer when Mr. Lexington asks him what he can do. He additionally notes his observations of the outside of the building. Peter presents himself as a man capable of learning the ways of Lex Industries, which Mr. Lexington likes. However, despite this approval, Mr. Lexington still challenges Peter's thinking and statements, assuring himself as the superior.",
        "Summary_4": "Peter is willing to work for Mr. Lexington's company. Getting the job is vital for him, he will be evicted if he doesn't get it. After what he has heard, Peter is scared of the man, he is cautious in his words, though sometimes he can't control his anger and confusion. Lexington sees Peter as a teachable young man and prefers him to previous ones, though he doesn't like people that much overall. Nevertheless, Lexington tells Peter the story of his business and shows around, putting a start to their co-work. ",

YOURS FAITHFULLY, LEX'.   <doc-sep> Staring back at the last blank wall, Peter suddenly remembered the timehe had set out to kill. He looked at his watch and gasped. At a run,set to straight-arm the door, he almost fell on his face. The door hadopened by itself. He stopped and looked for a photo-electric eye, buta soft voice said through a loudspeaker in the anteroom wall: Mr.Manners?     What? he panted. Who\u2014?     You      are     Mr. Manners? the voice asked.     He nodded, then realized he had to answer aloud if there was amicrophone around; but the soft voice said: Follow the open doors downthe hall. Mr. Lexington is expecting you.     Thanks, Peter said, and a door at one side of the anteroom swung openfor him.     He went through it with his composure slipping still further from hisgrip. This was no way to go into an interview, but doors kept openingbefore and shutting after him, until only one was left, and the last ofhis calm was blasted away by a bellow from within.     Don't stand out there like a jackass! Either come in or go away!     Peter found himself leaping obediently toward the doorway. He stoppedjust short of it, took a deep breath and huffed it out, took another,all the while thinking, Hold on now; you're in no shape for aninterview\u2014and it's not your fault\u2014this whole setup is geared tounnerve you: the kindergarten kid called in to see the principal.     He let another bellow bounce off him as he blew out the second breath,straightened his jacket and tie, and walked in as an engineer applyingfor a position should.     Mr. Lexington? he said. I'm Peter Manners. The Association\u2014     Sit down, said the man at the desk. Let's look you over.     He was a huge man behind an even huger desk. Peter took a chair infront of the desk and let himself be inspected. It wasn't comfortable.He did some looking over of his own to ease the tension.     The room was more than merely large, carpeted throughout witha high-pile, rich, sound-deadening rug. The oversized desk andmassive leather chairs, heavy patterned drapes, ornately framedpaintings\u2014by God, even a glass-brick manteled fireplace and bowls withflowers!\u2014made him feel as if he had walked down a hospital corridorinto Hollywood's idea of an office.     His eyes eventually had to move to Lexington, and they were dauntedfor another instant. This was a citadel of a man\u2014great girders offrame supporting buttresses of muscle\u2014with a vaulting head anddrawbridge chin and a steel gaze that defied any attempt to storm it.     But then Peter came out of his momentary flinch, and there was an ageto the man, about 65, and he saw the muscles had turned to fat, thecomplexion ashen, the eyes set deep as though retreating from pain, andthis was a citadel of a man, yes, but beginning to crumble.     What can you do? asked Lexington abruptly.   <doc-sep> It made Peter feel he had been suckered, but he had decided to playthis straight all the way. He nodded.     Why'd you leave? Lexington pursued, unrelenting.     I finished the course and the increase they offered on a permanentbasis wasn't enough, so I went elsewhere\u2014     With your head full of this nonsense about a shortage of engineers.     Peter swallowed. I thought it would be easier to get a job than it hasbeen, yes.     They start the talk about a shortage and then they keep it going. Why?So youngsters will take up engineering thinking they'll wind up among ahighly paid minority. You did, didn't you?     Yes, sir.     And so did all the others there with you, at school and in thisstockpiling outfit?     That's right.     Well, said Lexington unexpectedly, there      is     a shortage! And thestockpiles are the ones who made it, and who keep it going! And thehell of it is that they can't stop\u2014when one does it, they all haveto, or their costs get out of line and they can't compete. What's thesolution?     I don't know, Peter said.     Lexington leaned back. That's quite a lot of admissions you've made.What makes you think you're qualified for the job I'm offering?     You said you wanted an engineer.     And I've just proved you're less of an engineer than when you leftschool. I have, haven't I?     All right, you have, Peter said angrily.     And now you're wondering why I don't get somebody fresh out of school.Right?     Peter straightened up and met the old man's challenging gaze. That andwhether you're giving me a hard time just for the hell of it.     Well, am I? Lexington demanded.     Looking at him squarely, seeing the intensity of the pain-drawn eyes,Peter had the startling feeling that Lexington was rooting for him!No, you're not.     Then what am I after?     Suppose you tell me.     So suddenly that it was almost like a collapse, the tension went outof the old man's face and shoulders. He nodded with inexpressibletiredness. Good again. The man I want doesn't exist. He has tobe made\u2014the same as I was. You qualify, so far. You've lost yourillusions, but haven't had time yet to replace them with dogma orcynicism or bitterness. You saw immediately that fake humilityor cockiness wouldn't get you anywhere here, and you were right.Those were the important things. The background data I got from theAssociation on you counted, of course, but only if you were teachable.I think you are. Am I right?     At least I can face knowing how much I don't know, said Peter, ifthat answers the question.     It does. Partly. What did you notice about this plant?     In precis form, Peter listed his observations: the absence of windowsat sides and rear, the unusual amount of power, the automatic doors,the lack of employees' entrances.     Very good, said Lexington. Most people only notice the automaticdoors. Anything else?     Yes, Peter said. You're the only person I've seen in the building.     I'm the only one there is.     Peter stared his disbelief. Automated plants were nothing new, butthey all had their limitations. Either they dealt with exactly similarproducts or things that could be handled on a flow basis, like oil orwater-soluble chemicals. Even these had no more to do than process thegoods.     Come on, said Lexington, getting massively to his feet. I'll showyou.  "

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in Hagerty's Enzymes?",
        "Summary_1": "Harper Breen is exhausted. His business worries are keeping him up at night, and he hasn't had a proper night's sleep in too long. His brother in law, Scribney , suggests paying a visit to a hotel on mars, where they have equatorial wells which cure people's ailments.  There is also a fungus that grows there that breaks down crude oil, a financial gold mine! \nHarper decides to go to this hotel, both for rest and the opportunity of getting into this new fungi business. After what seems like a mere number of hours, the rocket comes into land, and Harper goes directly to the lobby of the Emerald Star Hotel. \nHarper notices the beauty of his surroundings, and how the entire hotel is staffed by very efficient, silent robots. He goes over to the desk, where a woman is complaining to the clerk about the treatment she is receiving from these robots. Harper decides to go over and interrupt the conversation, asking for his room key. \nA large man walks over, also asking for service. In a panic, the clerk hastily gives a room key to Harper, and hands him off to a robot to show him to his room. \nHarper arrives in his room where he gets settled, and then makes his way to the restaurant. Suddenly, Harper wakes up to see two robots bending over him. They take him by force and wheel him away into surgery. \nHarper wakes up to find the same man from the clerk desk knocking at his door. The man introduces himself as Jake Ellis, of Hagerty's Enzymes. He works on the tundra in the fungus \nplants. Two more robots enter and take Harper away again. Hey put him through a rigorous amount of detoxing procedures that wipe him out. \nHe speaks with Ellis again, who complains that he hasn't received any treatments yet. Harper proposes that the clerk probably mixed up their room keys. They decide to switch rooms and clothes to see what happens.  \nHarper goes to Ellis' room, puts on his clothes, and walks down to the lobby, where he meets the clerk once again.

",
        "Summary_2": "Harper Breen is nervous, he has troubles sleeping and eating, his business and employees drive him crazy. His sister is urging him to follow Dr. Franz's instructions to go on vacation. Harp's brother-in-law, Scribney, intervenes and shows a picture of the most luxurious hotel on Mars with curative springs. Scribney also hints Harper about a business opportunity in the hotel. It convinces Harper and he decides to combine rest with business after all. He soon boards on the rocket that is filled with soporific gas, so Harper arrives at the hotel lobby relaxed. The hotel is gorgeous indeed and the robots are offering all kinds of services throughout the place. The least impresses Harp as his human employees are the source of his irritation, so his new goal is to introduce the robots to his office later. Then he hears a woman at the front desk demanding a human nurse as the robots are too good and she wants to be heard. Harper proceeds to his room with a beautiful view and enjoys the silent robots' company. Then he dines in the rooftop restaurant and returns to his room in a good mood, willing to relax. Suddenly, he is bundled onto the stretcher and wheeled out by two robots, though he asked for no nursing. Harper is outraged with the robots pumping out all of his meal and at his own helplessness, he is disappointed in the machines. He tells all of this to his unexpected visitor, Jake Ellis, who, on the contrary, desperately wants treatment. Turns out the man works in severe conditions in tundra with fungus plants. His owner is soon going to be broke, as the workers quit the hard job which better fits robots. For the next couple days Harper is forced to go through various procedures which make him look and feel better, but also make him angry with being helpless. He believes there is a mistake and offers to switch rooms with Jake, who still desperately wants his treatment. Harper puts on Jake's huge clothes and goes to the lobby looking ridiculous. When a clerk orders the robot guards to take the patient away, Harper starts fighting back, and the clerk, scared the system would break, calls them off. Harper is led to the manager and after a brief outburst of his rage the manager tells that the hotel is going broke anyway, because people can't mix with robots, so he doesn't care what Harper can do to him. Now the hotel can't hire humans as it has spent all the money on robots and Harper offers to buy them. When he returns to Earth, he is met by Bella, his sister, and Scribney. Harper says he bought both the robots and the enzymes and switched the workers, saving both firms from bankruptcy. He also mentions never wanting even one robot around and starts appreciating his employees. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Harper Breen is constantly stressed out and tries to relax in his new Relaxo-Lounge. However, he quickly hurries out of the chair, making his sister Bella despair. He angrily calls out Dr. Franz for another useless method. Bella insists on a vacation, but Harper vehemently denies the idea because he is busy. His brother-in-law brings up his involvement in the sinking of Martian equatorial wells twenty years ago, making him even angrier. Scribney shows Harper a hotel completely staffed by robots. Bella mentions that the Durants came back from that place in much better shape after resting in the Martian springs. Scribney also brings up the possibility for great fortune because of the discovery breakthrough involving enzymes and Martian fungi. Harper agrees to the vacation because he can rest and do business. Once he arrives at the Emerald Star hotel, he observes how the robots work at perfect efficiency and silently. He then sees a woman arguing with the human desk clerk about seeing a real human nurse. Harper concludes that she wants somebody to boss around and strides confidently to check himself in. She is offended by his intrusion, but he reminds her that civility is not a normal human trait. As the clerk checks him in, another newcomer comes to complain. Harper goes to his beautiful room and begins to enjoy his vacation. After lunch and smoking a cigar, two robots come to his room for treatment. Later, the newcomer returns and asks Harper about the service he received from the robots earlier. The man introduces himself as Jake Ellis of Hagerty\u2019s Enzymes. Harper becomes interested in the company he works at, but three robots come inside to take him away on a wheelchair before he can say more. They also ignore Jake Ellis, who continuously pleads for treatment. The robots put him through similar ordeals for the next five days, and he is sick of it the next time he sees Jake Ellis. They theorize that the clerk initially mixed the keys up and plans to find the manager. Wearing Ellis\u2019 clothes, he goes down to the lobby and shocks the other guests. The clerk is shocked and tries to get the robots to treat him. Harper furiously denies it and threatens to destroy the switchboard. The manager greets him, and he voices all of his complaints. Hayes, the manager, gives up with a sigh and tells Harper that they are about to go bankrupt from the robots. Harper calms down, and he asks to speak to the owners about a potential business deal forming in his head. Afterwards, he returns to Bella and Scribney, looking much fitter and younger. He tells them he has bought Hagerty\u2019s Enzymes and staffed it with robots. When Scribney asks about using them in the office capacity, Harper says he wants nothing to do with them. He then goes off with his secretary Smythe while Scibney and Bella are happy about their rise to a position in the syndicate. ",
        "Summary_4": "Harper Breen, a business man is about to make a trip. At the beginning of the story, Harper Breen did not sleep and eat well for weeks, and was irritable. Since he does not listen to the healer, Franz\u2019s advices, his sister and brother-in-law suggest that he has to make a trip to receive a rest-cure at the Emerald Star Hotel on Mars. Attracts by robot servants and potential value of Martian fungus, Harper goes on the trip immediately. However, the life in the hotel is not completely as Harper expected. Harper thinks that the robots are efficient, so he considers about having the robots worker in his office. However, living in the hotel and coming into direct contact with the robots makes him change his mind. The robots simply cannot communicate with humans. They are determined to follow what they are programmed to do. Though his sleep problem is largely improved, and his appetite is much better than before, he is forced by robots to stay in stinking mud-baths, and consume weird concoctions. These robots even take away his cloths. His yelling and protests does not work with the robots. Harper\u2019s neighbor, Jake Ellis, who works in Hagerty\u2019s Enzymes, desires Harper\u2019s treatment. As a result, Harper and Jake agree to exchanged their rooms. Then, Harper finally gets the chance to wear Jake\u2019s clothes and go down to the lobby of the hotel. After talking with the manager of the hotel, and combining Jake\u2019s description of his job, Harper thinks that it is a good idea for business. The hotel wishes to get rid of these robots because humans and robots simply cannot get along with each other. The hotel is going bankrupt because of the robot workers. At the same time, The Hagerty\u2019s Enzymes\u2019 human workers are leaving because the job did not have satisfying working conditions. Thus, both companies are in the danger of bankruptcy, so Harper buys both companies and switches the workers with the robots. When he comes back to the earth, he looks much happier than before.",

It was thefirst pleasant expression they had seen on his face in years.     Well, you old dog! exclaimed Scribney affectionately. So you did itagain!     Harper smirked.

Aren't they efficient and all that?     Harper's smile vanished. Don't even mention such a thing! he yelped.You don't know what you're saying! I lived with those things forweeks. I wouldn't have one around! Keep 'em in the factory where theybelong!     He glimpsed the composed, wonderfully human face of his secretary,waiting patiently in the background. Oh there you are, Smythe. Heturned to his relatives. Busy day ahead. See you later, folks\u2014     Same old Harp, observed Scribney. Then he thought of the block ofstock.

She squeezed his arm, and smiling at each other, they leftthe port.    <doc-sep> There was a tentative knock on the door. Come in, called Harperbleakly. As soon as the door opened he regretted his invitation, forthe opening framed the large untidy man who had noisily pounded on thedesk demanding service while he, Harp, was being registered.     Say, pardner, he said hoarsely, you haven't seen any of them robotsaround here, have you?     Harper scowled. Oh, haven't I? he grated. Robots! Do you know whatthey did to me. Indignation lit fires in his pale eyes. Came in herewhile I was lying down peacefully digesting the first meal I've enjoyedin months, dragged me off to the surgery, and pumped it all out! Theonly meal I've enjoyed in months! Blackly he sank his chin onto hisfist and contemplated the outrage.     Why didn't you stop 'em? reasonably asked the visitor.     Stop a robot? Harper glared pityingly. How? You can't reason withthe blasted things. And as for using force\u2014it's man against metal. Youtry it! He ground his teeth together in futile rage. And to think Ihad the insane notion that robots were the last word! Why, I was readyto staff my offices with the things!     The big man placed his large hands on his own capacious stomach andgroaned. I'm sure sorry it was you and not me, pardner. I could usesome of that treatment right now. Musta been that steak and onions Iate after all that tundra dope I've been livin' on.     Tundra? A faint spark of alertness lightened Harper's dull rage. Youmean you work out here on the tundra?     That's right. How'd you think I got in such a helluva shape? I'msuperintendent of one of the fungus plants. I'm Jake Ellis of Hagerty'sEnzymes. There's good money in it, but man, what a job! No air worthmentionin'. Temperature always freezin' or below. Pressure suits. Huts.Factory. Processed food. Nothin' else. Just nothin'. That's where theycould use some robots. It sure ain't no job for a real live man. And infact, there ain't many men left there. If old man Hagerty only knew it,he's about out of business.     Harper sat up as if he'd been needled. He opened his mouth to speak.But just then the door opened briskly and two robots entered. With ahorrified stare, Harper clutched his maltreated stomach. He saw a thirdrobot enter, wheeling a chair.     A wheel chair! squeaked the victim. I tell you, there's nothingwrong with me! Take it away! I'm only here for a rest-cure! Believe me!Take it away!     The robots ignored him. For the first time in his spectacular andruthless career Harper was up against creatures that he could neitherbribe, persuade nor browbeat, inveigle nor ignore. It shattered hisebbing self-confidence. He began waving his hands helplessly.     The robots not only ignored Harper. They paid no attention at all toJake Ellis, who was plucking at their metallic arms pleading, Takeme, boys. I need the treatment bad, whatever it is. I need all thetreatment I can get. Take me! I'm just a wreck, fellers\u2014     Stolidly they picked Harper up, plunked him into the chair, strappedhim down and marched out with him.       Dejectedly Ellis returned to his own room. Again he lifted the receiverof the room phone; but as usual a robot voice answered sweetly,mechanically, and meaninglessly.

        "Summary_1": "The main setting of the story in the Emerald Star Hotel. The half acre wide floor is covered with grey carpeting. There are glass walls which tint the light from the sun green. Outside are stunning domed gardens in a dozen acre lot. The lobby which holds the clerks desk is huge. Harper's room inside the hotel is stunning. The walls are made from the same green glass, which are accentuated with windows which look out onto the Martian hinterland. On the top of the skyscraper hotel is a domed roof restaurant, which is furnished with cushioned chairs. In another area of the hotel is a hospital, where it treats patients.

The husband, Scribney, is reading a magazine, he is bored with Harp's anger and lack of harmony in the house due to the least. The magazine shows a luxurious extraterrestrial hotel in the shape of a circular skyscraper surrounded with lovely pools and gardens. Soon, Harper leaves the house and heads towards the hotel via a rocket with soporific gas on board, which relaxes the passengers. From the rocket, Harper gets to the lobby of the Emerald Star Hotel by a tube. Everything is green there, the walls are made from glass, the gardens are framed with arches, and perfectly developed robots are offering various services all around. A robot escorts Harper to his room from the lobby. The room is beautiful and with stunning views. Harper goes up to the restaurant on the roof with the view of the dark blue sky. When he returns to the room, he is taken away by the robots in a wheelchair. This happens every day:  Harper deliberately goes through baths, massages, eating weird food, etc. Then he switches rooms with Jake, puts on his huge clothes, and watches Jack being taken to the procedures.  From there Harper is able to call the elevator and go to the lobby. The lobby is full of guests surprised at Harper's appearance. He is then led to the manager's office through an inconspicuous door. The manager is sitting at his metal desk. Then Harper returns to his room and soon back to Earth and to work. ",
        "Summary_3": "The story is initially set in an undisclosed location. There is a Relaxo-Lounge chair set up for Harper to relax in. Later, the Emerald Star Hotel is described as a star-shaped structure made out of bottle-green glass. The structure also rests jewel-like on the rough surface of Mars. The main portion consists of a circular skyscraper with a glass-domed roof. Between its star-shaped annexes, other domes cover the pools and landscaped gardens. The lobby of the hotel is filled with a half-acre of moss-gray carpeting, walls of Martian copper glass, and beautiful gardens at the vistas framed by a dozen arches.

        "Query": "What makes robots unsuitable for working in hotels according to the story of Hagerty's Enzymes?",
        "Summary_1": "The robots do not make good hotel staff because they are so efficient, they lack any comprehension that humans inherently possess. When Harper first arrives in the hotel, he notices that a woman named Mrs. Jacobsen is giving out about her treatment by the robots. She thinks that the service they provide is too good. She isn't able to change her mind because the robots won't listen, they will just follow orders. They don't listen to Harper when he tries to tell them that he did not book into the hotel for treatment, as they are simply following orders. They don't reason with him when he tries to get out of the treatment, and force him to undergo the procedures. The manager knows that the robots aren't working, and he tells Harper that guest reservations have already declined because of it. ",
        "Summary_2": "The robots are logical and people are not, so the two do not mix. People can't coexist with robots for that reason. Some people want human stuff while in a hotel to shout at, to argue with, to be able to change minds and to hear them out. Moreover, robots are impossible to convince or fight back, so they make the visitors feel like helpless prisoners. If a mistake happens, it's impossible to explain it to the robots. They are even more annoying with their indifference than people are. ",
        "Summary_3": "The robots do not make good hotel staff because they cannot connect to humans emotionally. They do all of the tasks perfectly and quickly, but it is too logical for the current feelings of humans. Many guests are dissatisfied with the service, not from a technical standpoint, but because they cannot change their minds once the initial order has been issued. The robots can also not listen to what any human says, only following what is programmed into them. This is evident in Harper\u2019s experience later, when he insists that the robots do not give him any treatment because he does not need it. However, the robots have taken all of his items and left him with no choice but to comply. On the other hand, Ellis has been requesting treatment since he arrived at the hotel and has received none because the robots were not issued any commands to give him treatment. ",
        "Summary_4": "Robots simply cannot communicate with humans. In the story, Mrs. Jacobsen is angry and asks for a real woman as a nurse instead of a robot. The reason is not because robots did works not good enough, instead, it was because she wanted someone to hear what she says. Also, when robots come into Harper\u2019s room to bring him to the mud-bath. Harper did not have the chance and the ability to talk to robots. They are determined to follow what they are programmed to do. He is forced by robots to stay in stinking mud-baths, and consume weird concoctions. These robots even take away his cloths. His yelling and protests does not work with the robots. Though Harper\u2019s sleep problem is largely improved, and his appetite is much better than before, he feels angry about it because he never wanted it in the first place. ",
        "Article": "Back on Earth it was a warm, misty spring day\u2014the kind of day unknownto the planet Mars. Bella and Scribney, superb in new spring outfits,waited restlessly while the rocket cooled and the passengers recoveredfrom deceleration.     Look, Scrib! Bella clutched Scribney's substantial arm. It's finallyopening.     They watched the airlock open and the platform wheel into place. Theywatched the passengers descend, looking a trifle dazed.     There he is! cried Bella. Why, doesn't he look wonderful! Scrib,it's amazing! Look at him!     And indeed, Harper was stepping briskly downward, looking spry and fitand years younger. He came across to them actually beaming. It was thefirst pleasant expression they had seen on his face in years.     Well, you old dog! exclaimed Scribney affectionately. So you did itagain!     Harper smirked. Yep, I turned a neat little deal. I bought outHagerty's Enzymes and staffed the plant with the hotel's robots. Gotboth of 'em dirt cheap. Both concerns going bankrupt because theydidn't have sense enough to swap their workers. Feel I owe you a bitfor that tip about enzymes, Scrib, so I made out a block of stock toyou. All right?     All right? Scribney gulped. Why, the dried-up little turnip was humanafter all. All right! Yes, sir! But aren't you going to use some ofthose robots for office help? Aren't they efficient and all that?     Harper's smile vanished. Don't even mention such a thing! he yelped.You don't know what you're saying! I lived with those things forweeks. I wouldn't have one around! Keep 'em in the factory where theybelong!     He glimpsed the composed, wonderfully human face of his secretary,waiting patiently in the background. Oh there you are, Smythe. Heturned to his relatives. Busy day ahead. See you later, folks\u2014     Same old Harp, observed Scribney. Then he thought of the block ofstock. What say we celebrate our rise to a position in the syndicate,honey?     Wonderful! She squeezed his arm, and smiling at each other, they leftthe port.    <doc-sep> There was a tentative knock on the door. Come in, called Harperbleakly. As soon as the door opened he regretted his invitation, forthe opening framed the large untidy man who had noisily pounded on thedesk demanding service while he, Harp, was being registered.     Say, pardner, he said hoarsely, you haven't seen any of them robotsaround here, have you?     Harper scowled. Oh, haven't I? he grated. Robots! Do you know whatthey did to me. Indignation lit fires in his pale eyes. Came in herewhile I was lying down peacefully digesting the first meal I've enjoyedin months, dragged me off to the surgery, and pumped it all out! Theonly meal I've enjoyed in months! Blackly he sank his chin onto hisfist and contemplated the outrage.     Why didn't you stop 'em? reasonably asked the visitor.     Stop a robot? Harper glared pityingly. How? You can't reason withthe blasted things. And as for using force\u2014it's man against metal. Youtry it! He ground his teeth together in futile rage. And to think Ihad the insane notion that robots were the last word! Why, I was readyto staff my offices with the things!     The big man placed his large hands on his own capacious stomach andgroaned. I'm sure sorry it was you and not me, pardner. I could usesome of that treatment right now. Musta been that steak and onions Iate after all that tundra dope I've been livin' on.     Tundra? A faint spark of alertness lightened Harper's dull rage. Youmean you work out here on the tundra?     That's right. How'd you think I got in such a helluva shape? I'msuperintendent of one of the fungus plants. I'm Jake Ellis of Hagerty'sEnzymes. There's good money in it, but man, what a job! No air worthmentionin'. Temperature always freezin' or below. Pressure suits. Huts.Factory. Processed food. Nothin' else. Just nothin'. That's where theycould use some robots. It sure ain't no job for a real live man. And infact, there ain't many men left there. If old man Hagerty only knew it,he's about out of business.     Harper sat up as if he'd been needled. He opened his mouth to speak.But just then the door opened briskly and two robots entered. With ahorrified stare, Harper clutched his maltreated stomach. He saw a thirdrobot enter, wheeling a chair.     A wheel chair! squeaked the victim. I tell you, there's nothingwrong with me! Take it away! I'm only here for a rest-cure! Believe me!Take it away!     The robots ignored him. For the first time in his spectacular andruthless career Harper was up against creatures that he could neitherbribe, persuade nor browbeat, inveigle nor ignore. It shattered hisebbing self-confidence. He began waving his hands helplessly.     The robots not only ignored Harper. They paid no attention at all toJake Ellis, who was plucking at their metallic arms pleading, Takeme, boys. I need the treatment bad, whatever it is. I need all thetreatment I can get. Take me! I'm just a wreck, fellers\u2014     Stolidly they picked Harper up, plunked him into the chair, strappedhim down and marched out with him.       Dejectedly Ellis returned to his own room. Again he lifted the receiverof the room phone; but as usual a robot voice answered sweetly,mechanically, and meaninglessly. He hung up and went miserably to bed.   <doc-sep> Scribney, whose large, phlegmatic person and calm professorial brainwere the complete antithesis of Harper's picked-crow physique andscheming financier's wits, looked severely over his glasses. Harp'snervous tribulations were beginning to bore him, as well as interferewith the harmony of his home.     You're away behind the times, Harp, he declared. Don't you knowthat those have proved to be the most astoundingly curative springsever discovered anywhere? Don't you know that a syndicate has builtthe largest extra-terrestial hotel of the solar system there and thatpeople are flocking to it to get cured of whatever ails 'em? Old man,you missed a bet!     Leaping from the sofa, Harper rudely snatched the magazine fromScribney's hands. He glared at the spread which depicted a star-shapedstructure of bottle-green glass resting jewel-like on the rufous rockof Mars. The main portion of the building consisted of a circularskyscraper with a glass-domed roof. Between its star-shaped annexes,other domes covered landscaped gardens and noxious pools which in thedrawing looked lovely and enticing.     Why, I remember now! exclaimed Bella. That's where the Durants wenttwo years ago! He was about dead and she looked like a hag. They cameback in wonderful shape. Don't you remember, Scrib?     Dutifully Scribney remembered and commented on the change the Martiansprings had effected in the Durants. It's the very thing for you,Harp, he advised. You'd get a good rest on the way out. This gasthey use in the rockets nowadays is as good as a rest-cure; it sort offloats you along the time-track in a pleasant daze, they tell me. Andyou can finish the cure at the hotel while looking it over. And notonly that. Confidentially he leaned toward his insignificant lookingbrother-in-law. The chemists over at Dade McCann have just isolated anenzyme from one species of Martian fungus that breaks down crude oilinto its components without the need for chemical processing. There's afortune waiting for the man who corners that fungus market and learnsto process the stuff!     Scribney had gauged his victim's mental processes accurately. Themagazine sagged in Harp's hands, and his sharp eyes became shrewd andcalculating. He even forgot to twitch. Maybe you're right, Scrib, heacknowledged. Combine a rest-cure with business, eh?     Raising the magazine, he began reading the advertisement. And thatwas when he saw the line about the robots. \u2014the only hotel staffedentirely with robot servants\u2014     Robots! he shrilled. You mean they've developed the things to thatpoint? Why hasn't somebody told me? I'll have Jackson's hide! I'lldisfranchise him! I'll\u2014     Harp! exploded Bella. Stop it! Maybe Jackson doesn't know a thingabout it, whatever it is! If it's something at the Emerald Star Hotel,why don't you just go and find out for yourself instead of throwing atantrum? That's the only sensible way!     You're right, Bella, agreed Harper incisively. I'll go and find outfor myself. Immediately! Scooping up his hat, he left at his usuallope.     Well! remarked his sister. All I can say is that they'd better turnthat happy-gas on extra strong for Harp's trip out!  "

        "Query": "What were the different therapies Harper received and what impact did they have?",
        "Summary_1": "Against his will, Harper is subject to a number of treatments at the hotel. He is dunked into mud baths for extensive periods of time. He is held in rancid smelling irradiated hot water. He is made to eat and drink strange concoctions. His stomach is pumped with food. They massage and exercise him. Harper hates all of this. It does do him good though. He notices that his skin which was once yellow, is now returning to a flesh colour. He can finally sleep well again also. When he returns to Earth, he is happy and energised for the first time in years. He looks fitter, and younger than he did before he left. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Harper was planning to simply relax, the hotel was beautiful and his appetite even returned. Due to a mistake he was put on a diet, being forced to eat some weird food and pumped out sometimes. He also goes through various mud baths, exercises, massages, and other tiresome procedures which make him sleep a lot. This resulted in his healthy skin color and appetite returning, but he was tired and angry at his helplessness. Those treatments made him so desperate that Harper switched rooms with another guest, took his huge clothes and went to the lobby to talk to the manager. That also results in his genius business idea and realization that he doesn't want robots around after all. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Harper first goes through a surgery that pumps all of the food he eats out. Then, as the days go by, they take him to a stinking mud-bath and hold him there until he thinks that he is well-done to the bone. After, they soak him in foul, steaming irradiated water until he gags. He is also made to eat and drink weird concoctions under the watch of the robots. Harper also goes through rounds of purging, massaging, and exercise. The robots even take his phone, announcing that he would have no service for two weeks and give him a busy signal. The treatments leave him looking younger, but he is noticeably angrier. His anger and frustration mainly stems from the fact that he did not request any treatment in the first place. Many of these treatments have been done against his own will, and he desperately wants it to stop even though the robots do not listen. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Robots first brought Harper to mud-baths by a wheel chair and held him there until he was well-done. Next, the robots soak him in foul, steaming irradiated water until he gags. Then, they brings concoctions for Harper to eat and drink, and they stands over him until he finishes consuming these concoctions. Lastly, they purge and massage and exercise him. Harper indeed begins to look flesh-colored. He starts to sleep for hours and get a better appetite than before.",

HALEY       There's a place for every man and a man for       every place, but on robot-harried Mars the       situation was just a little different.       [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Planet Stories Spring 1955.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      Harper Breen sank down gingerly into the new Relaxo-Lounge. He placedtwitching hands on the arm-rests and laid his head back stiffly. Heclosed his fluttering eyelids and clamped his mouth to keep the cornerfrom jumping.     Just lie back, Harp, droned his sister soothingly. Just give in andlet go of everything.     Harper tried to let go of everything. He gave in to the chair. Andgently the chair went to work. It rocked rhythmically, it vibratedtenderly. With velvety cushions it massaged his back and arms and legs.     For all of five minutes Harper stood it. Then with a frenzied lungehe escaped the embrace of the Relaxo-Lounge and fled to a gloriouslystationary sofa.     Harp! His sister, Bella, was ready to weep with exasperation. Dr.Franz said it would be just the thing for you! Why won't you give it atrial?     Harper glared at the preposterous chair. Franz! he snarled. Thatprize fathead! I've paid him a fortune in fees. I haven't slept forweeks. I can't eat anything but soup. My nerves are jangling likea four-alarm fire. And what does he prescribe? A blasted jigglingbaby carriage! Why, I ought to send him the bill for it! Completelyoutraged, he lay back on the couch and closed his eyes.     Now, Harp, you know you've never obeyed his orders. He told youlast year that you'd have to ease up. Why do you have to try to runthe whole world? It's the strain of all your business worries that'scausing your trouble. He told you to take a long vacation or you'dcrack up. Don't blame him for your own stubbornness.     Harper snorted. His large nose developed the sound magnificently.Vacation! he snorted. Batting a silly ball around or dragging a hookafter a stupid fish! Fine activities for an intelligent middle-agedman! And let me correct you. It isn't business worries that are drivingme to a crack-up. It's the strain of trying to get some sensible,reasonable co\u00f6peration from the nincompoops I have to hire! It's theidiocy of the human race that's got me whipped! It's the\u2014     Hey, Harp, old man! His brother-in-law, turning the pages of thenew colorama magazine, INTERPLANETARY, had paused at a double-spread.Didn't you have a finger in those Martian equatorial wells they sunktwenty years ago?     Harper's hands twitched violently. Don't mention that fiasco! herasped. That deal nearly cost me my shirt! Water, hell! Those wellsspewed up the craziest conglomeration of liquids ever tapped!   <doc-sep> Only the robots were immune to Harper Breen's progress across the hugesuave lobby.     He was a blot on its rich beauty, a grotesque enigma that rooted theother visitors into paralyzed staring groups. Stepping out of theelevator, he had laid a course for the desk which loomed like an islandin a moss-gray lake, and now he strode manfully toward it, ignoring theoversize trousers slapping around his stocking feet. Only the robotsshared his self control.     The clerk was the first to recover from the collective stupor.Frantically he pushed the button that would summon the robot guard.With a gasp of relief he saw the two massive manlike machines movinginexorably forward. He pointed to Harper. Get that patient! heordered. Take him to the\u2014to the mud-baths!     No you don't! yelled Harper. I want to see the manager! Nimbly hecircled the guard and leaped behind the desk. He began to throw thingsat the robots. Things like inkwells and typewriters and card indexes.Especially, card indexes.     Stop it! begged the clerk. You'll wreck the system! We'll never getit straight again! Stop it!     Call them off! snarled Harper. Call them off or I'll ruin yourswitchboard! He put a shoulder against it and prepared to heave.     With one last appalled glare at the madman, the clerk picked up anelectric finger and pointed it at the approaching robots. They becameoddly inanimate.     That's better! Harper straightened up and meticulously smoothed thecollar of his flapping coat. Now\u2014the manager, please.     This\u2014this way, sir. With shrinking steps the clerk led Harper acrossthe width of the lobby among the fascinated guests. He was beyondspeech. Opening the inconspicuous door, he waved Harper inside andreturned doggedly to his desk, where he began to pick up things and atthe same time phrase his resignation in his mind.     Brushing aside the startled secretary in the outer cubicle, Harperflapped and shuffled straight into the inner sanctum. The manager, whowas busy chewing a cigar to shreds behind his fortress of gun metaldesk, jerked hastily upright and glared at the intruder. My goodman\u2014 he began.     Don't 'my-good-man' me! snapped Harper. He glared back at themanager. Reaching as far across the expanse of desktop as he couldstretch, he shook his puny fist. Do you know who I am? I'm HarperS. Breen, of Breen and Helgart, Incorporated! And do you know why Ihaven't even a card to prove it? Do you know why I have to make my waydownstairs in garb that makes a laughing stock of me? Do you know why?Because that assinine clerk of yours put me in the wrong room and thosedamnable robots of yours then proceeded to make a prisoner of me! Me,Harper S. Breen! Why, I'll sue you until you'll be lucky if you have asheet of writing-paper left in this idiot's retreat!     Hayes, the manager, blanched. Then he began to mottle in an apoplecticpattern. And suddenly with a gusty sigh, he collapsed into his chair.With a shaking hand he mopped his forehead.       My     robots! he muttered.As if I invented the damned things!     Despondently he looked at Harper. Go ahead and sue, Mr. Breen. If youdon't, somebody else will. And if nobody sues, we'll go broke anyway,at the rate our guest list is declining. I'm ready to hand in myresignation.     Again he sighed. The trouble, he explained, is that those foolrobots are completely logical, and people aren't. There's no way to mixthe two. It's dynamite. Maybe people can gradually learn to live withrobots, but they haven't yet. Only we had to find it out the hard way.We\u2014 he grimaced disgustedly\u2014had to pioneer in the use of robots.And it cost us so much that we can't afford to reconvert to human help.So\u2014Operation Robot is about to bankrupt the syndicate.     Listening, an amazing calm settled on Harper. Thoughtfully now hehooked a chair to the desk with his stockinged foot, sat down andreached for the cigar that Hayes automatically offered him. Oh, Idon't know, he said mildly.     Hayes leaned forward like a drowning man sighting a liferaft. Whatdo you mean, you don't know? You're threatening to take our shirts,aren't you?     Meticulously Harper clipped and lit his cigar. It seems to me thatthese robots might be useful in quite another capacity. I might evenmake a deal with your syndicate to take them off your hands\u2014at areasonable price, of course\u2014and forget the outrages I've suffered atyour establishment.     Hayes leaned toward him incredulous. You mean you want these robotsafter what you've seen and experienced?     Placidly Harper puffed a smoke ring. Of course, you'd have to takeinto consideration that it would be an experiment for me, too. Andthere's the suit I'm clearly justified in instituting. However, I'mwilling to discuss the matter with your superiors.     With hope burgeoning for the first time in weeks, Hayes lifted hishead. My dear Mr. Breen, to get rid of these pestiferous robots, I'llback you to the hilt! I'll notify the owners at once. At once, Mr.Breen! And while we wait for them, allow me to put you up as a guest ofthe hotel. Coming around to Harper, he effusively shook Harp's scrawnyhand, and then personally escorted him not merely to the door butacross the lobby to the elevator.     Harper gazed out at the stunned audience. This was more like thetreatment he was accustomed to! Haughtily he squared his bony shouldersinside the immense jacket and stepped into the elevator. He was readyfor the second step of his private Operation Robot.  "

He booked into the hotel as his health has been on a decline because of his working conditions. The temperature in the factories are usually below freezing, he has to wear a pressure suit, the air quality is terrible and he has to live on processed food. He hoped to get treatment at the hotel, but since his arrival, he has been practically ignored by the staff, and left in his room. This is because the clerk switched his room key with Ellis'. When he meets Ellis and they decide to switch rooms, he finally gets his first treatment. ",
        "Summary_2": "Ellis has been working in tundra with fungus plants. The job is extremely hard, the food is awful, the temperature is very low, impossible for a human to work at, but pays well. He booked the hotel to get treatment and he wants it badly, but he is stuck.  He feels bad after his work and needs treatment, his health in the tundra became weak, as he ate the bad food and was freezing and working bad. He needs a diet and warm baths now. The robots are unable to hear people and see the mistake, and the phone operator is a robot, so Ellis has no chance to get his treatment. Eventually, he is extremely happy as he switches rooms with Harper and gets what he wants.",
        "Summary_3": "Ellis books the hotel to receive treatment for himself. He lives on a constant diet of steak and turnips at the factory, which leads him to book the hotel in hopes of receiving treatment for his stomach. He also says that the air in the factory area is bad, the temperature is always freezing, pressure suits, huts, and processed food. He wants to relax after working in these harsh conditions for so long. However, his experience at the hotel has not been good so far. Ellis is constantly asking for treatment, but all of the robots ignore him. He even brings it down to the clerk to complain, but it is possible that they mixed his treatment information up with Harper. He is desperate, but none of the robots can change their programming to accommodate him\n",
        "Summary_4": "Ellis booked into the hotel because he feels uncomfortable with his stomach. He thinks that was because of the steak and onions he ate after all that tundra dope he has been living on. While he does not feel well at all, he does not receive any treatments, and he is simply ignored by robots no matter what he does. When he is in the same room as Harper, the robot does not even acknowledge his existence. Every time he lifts the receiver of the room phone, only a robot voice answering, meaninglessly.

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of The Ignoble Savages' storyline?",
        "Summary_1": "qds-lb-writing-099be7bcf434f75d.elb.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/?uid=fbb302599a4a417fbc34eb1b65558c19\nThe Ignoble Savages by Evelyn E. Smith details the tale of a race on the brink of extinction and their strange attempt to save themselves. Snaddra is a rainy planet with a mud surface. Due to the harsh weather, the Snaddrath chose to build their cities underground. Their civilized culture allowed for excellence in the metal industry and architecture, however, their isolation caused for poor education and expensive trade deals. In the face of crisis, the Bbulas Plan emerged, a plot to move their capital aboveground to convince visiting Terrans of their primitive nature and need for help. \nIt begins with Skirru, an architect-turned-beggar, arguing with his former fiance, Larhgan, who is now the High Priestess. Their new jobs forbid marriage between the two, so Larhgan returns his grimpatch with regret. Bbulas, the new High Priest, watches gleefully, as he was in love with Larhgan all along. After much fighting, they levitate to the surface of the planet and wait for the Terrans to arrive. Now covered with huts, the new caste system emerges. Skirru is upset about his current position and feels ill. The woven metal clothes he was given to wear did not shield him from the light, so his green skin starts fading to yellow. \nThe Terrans arrive, Raoul and Cyril, to analyze the planet. Skirru begs in front of them, and they give him a chocolate bar, a delicacy on Snaddra. He eats it quickly, grateful for the treat as it restores health to sick Snaddrath. He remembers a pair of shoes he once got and dashes belowground to get them, returning with booted feet. Able to walk easier now, he follows the Terrans to the temple, where Bbulas and Larhgan are waiting. \nRaoul eyes the female Snaddrath hungrily. Cyril reminds him that they are there to investigate, not fraternize with the natives. Once there, Larhgan welcomes them with a long speech Bbulas wrote. Bbulas invites the Terrans to a rain dance, which they laugh at seeing as the planet is covered in mud. Bbulas recovers quickly and claims it\u2019s a ceremony to stop the rain. Already, his plot to save his planet is falling apart. Raoul quickly notices that the beggar, Skkiru, is wearing mudshoes, which makes no sense. \nBbulas changes the subject and points them towards their hut, evidently the nicest one on Snaddra. He runs to Skkiru and angrily confronts him about his footwear. \n",
        "Summary_2": "\n\tThe beings of Snaddra are hosting two Terrans who are coming to study their culture. The interest of the Terrans is extremely important because the planet\u2019s population and natural resources are wasting away; they need the attention and resources that an anthropological study can provide. Bbulas, the Planetary Diletantte went to a Terran university on another planet after being selected for his highest intelligence score in the group tested with him. As Diletantte, he has been called upon to help solve the planet\u2019s dilemma of saving itself. His plan, accepted because there were no better plans, involves restructuring the society and culture of the planet into one that he says the Terran anthropologists will find more intriguing than their real culture. He explains that this is because Terrans are most interested in societies that are different from their own, rather than like their own as Snaddrath really society is. He uses lots to assign roles in the society and ends up as the high priest, and the high priestess is Larhgan, a female he has been interested in for a long time but who was engaged to Skkiru. Skkiru has drawn the lot of a beggar and can no longer be engaged to Larhgan, and at the beginning of the story, he finds out that the changes Bbulas has instituted are actually going to be permanent. Bbulas threatens to make Skkiru a metal worker, the lowest position in the social hierarchy, if he doesn\u2019t cooperate. Larhgan is sad that she will not be able to marry Skkiru and says she will not marry anyone at all but just devote her life to religion. \n\tWhen the Earth ship arrives with the Terrans, everyone goes to the surface to welcome them even though it is cold and raining. There is a reminder for everyone except beggars to wear shoes. They hold a welcoming ceremony, and the Terrans notice Skkiru, the beggar, so he begs from them. They aren\u2019t sure what to give him, so they give him chocolate which is a real treat because Bbulas has closed all the chocolate shops. One Terran, Raoul, notices how beautiful Larhgan is, and the other, Cyril, reminds him they cannot establish friendships with the native females because it would prevent them from being objective. The Terrans thank the Shadds for their welcome and tell them they hope their stay will be pleasant and profitable. They intend to study the Shadds without doing anything to disturb their culture.\n\tThe Shadds desperately need the Terrans\u2019 interest. The Shadds\u2019 natural resources are nearly depleted, and their population is decreasing. The culture is getting close to being unsustainable. It can grow rice and catch fish but has to purchase all other food and fiber products from other planets, which is very expensive. Shadd doesn\u2019t attract any tourists, so they are banking on the Terrans to help.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Skkiru, who was once a great architect of Snaddra, must now pretend to be a beggar. His fiance, Larhgan, will play the role of High Priestess, and she must separate herself from him. In this make-believe world created by Bbulas, the Planetary Dilettante, the couple will never be able to see each other again. Bbulas has given out roles to each citizen of Snaddra, and the entire planet is depending on the scheme. Two anthropologists from Terran (Earth) have been invited to research the fake society in hopes that their attention will bring good fortune. Snaddra\u2019s various life forms are nearing extinction, and they have few natural resources left. The planet is not attractive to tourists, and it\u2019s too far out of the way to make trade routes profitable. \n\nSkkiru blames Bbulas for his breakup with Larhgran. Bbulas has always had feelings for Larhgan, so Skirru believes he put them in different castes on purpose. Bbula defends his choices as necessary for society\u2019s survival, and Larhgan agrees. She loves Skkiru, but she cannot put her own relationship before her people. \n\nSkkiru hates the Terrans and has zero interest in living above ground like they do. He has never stepped foot on the surface of Snaddra, but everyone is being forced above ground. The Terrans\u2019 ship comes into view, and everyone rushes to put shoes on. Although beggars are not allowed to wear shoes, Skkiru puts some on anyway. The underground city must be kept a secret from the Terrans. Bbulas\u2019s plan involves looking primitive in order to gain sympathy.\n\nSkkiru is instructed to go to the field and look hungry. Two Terrans, Raoul and Cyril, leave their ship and approach a group of Snaddrath dressed in costumes singing songs. As soon as Raoul sees the female Snaddraths, Cyril sees a change in his face, and warns him that they must maintain objectivity. Then, Raoul and Cyril point their attention towards Skkiru. They would like to offer the poor beggar man something, but they\u2019re not sure what. Raoul suggests a chocolate bar, and Skkiru eagerly accepts. His joy is fleeting, however, when he lays eyes on Larhgan, standing in her beautiful high priestess outfit, welcoming the Terrans with a speech written by Bbulas. He has never felt so lowly in his life. Skkiru hopes that he will have a chance to make something of himself and demonstrate his worthiness to Larhgan. The Terrans are infatuated with romance, after all. \n\nThe Terrans thank the Snaddrath for welcoming them, and they learn that they are invited to view a rain dance. Raoul questions why the Snaddrath would ever want more rain when it\u2019s already muddy, and Bbulas changes the plan and explains that the rain dance is to make the rain stop. When Raoul and Cyril are led to their huts, Bbulas finds Skkiru and yells at him for putting on shoes. He reminds Skkiru to let him do all of the thinking. \n",
        "Summary_4": "The story begins in the middle of a discussion amongst Bbulas, Larhgan, and Skkiru. The three are Snaddrath of the planet Snaddra, and were preparing for the arrival of Terrans. Skkiru is upset; he is a beggar, but only by Bbulas' design: the society had been restructured to be more primitive for the sake of the eyes of the Terrans. Skkiru had been engaged to Larhgan, who would now serve as high priestess, but this difference in social status meant they could no longer be affiliated. They discuss some of the confusion and issues surrounding the plan, and all head outside when they hear the announcement that the Earthmen had arrived. It turned out that the Snaddrath lived in underground cities, but built some buildings above-ground where they would convince the Earthmen they actually lived. When they got to the surface, they saw the procession greeting the visitors, and started trying to navigate the huge amounts of mud on the surface. The Snaddrath could self-levitate, but didn't want to give this ability away so they made slow progress walking. Skkiru ran off to find his mud-shoes, and met everyone else at the ship. The Earthmen (the cultural ruling race) were talking about previous situations on other planets, not knowing that the Snaddrath could actually understand them. They offer Skkiru some chocolate, which he takes (it increases the body's resistance to weather, and was a delicacy). As this continues, Skkiru reflected on the rapid loss of population and resources on the planet and how the Terran visit has affected his planet. For instance, metal-working was the largest industry, so Bbulas made them the lowest caste when reorganizing the society, which Skkiru thought was an easy way out of a chance to be more creative. Eventually interacting with Larhgan, the Terrans express gratitude for the welcome they have received and expresses interest in learning from the Snaddrath, enjoying their stay, and to not affect the society as much as possible. Skkiru found humor in this, as the presence of the Earthmen is the only reason their society is structured the way it is currently. The Terrans are invited to a raindance, which confuses them, until Bbulas catches himself and says it's to stop the rain, not to get more. Skkiru continued to reflect: he hadn\u2019t been able to live well and to save, so he didn't have savings. He was willing to play this game to avoid discovery of the truth by the Earthmen, with the careful systems of tabus to keep the visitors from discovering the underground cities, in part because he didn't want to leave Larhgan. The story ends with Bbulas yelling at Skkiru for having retrieved mudshoes and tells him not to think. ",

Go Away from me, Skkiru, Larhgan said, pushing his hand off her arm.A beggar does not associate with the high priestess of Snaddra.     But the Earthmen aren't due for another fifteen minutes, Skkiruprotested.     Of what importance are fifteen minutes compared to eternity! sheexclaimed. Her lovely eyes fuzzed softly with emotion. You don't seemto realize, Skkiru, that this isn't just a matter of minutes or hours.It's forever.       Forever! He looked at her incredulously. You mean we're going tokeep this up as a permanent thing? You're joking!     Bbulas groaned, but Skkiru didn't care about that. The sad, sweet wayLarhgan shook her beautiful head disturbed him much more, and whenshe said, No, Skkiru, I am not joking, a tiny pang of doubt andapprehension began to quiver in his second smallest left toe.     This is, in effect, good-by, she continued. We shall see each otheragain, of course, but only from a distance. On feast days, perhaps youmay be permitted to kiss the hem of my robe ... but that will be all.     Skkiru turned to the third person present in the council chamber.Bbulas, this is your fault! It was all your idea!     There was regret on the Dilettante's thin face\u2014an obviously insincereregret, the younger man knew, since he was well aware how Bbulas hadalways felt about the girl.     I am sorry, Skkiru, Bbulas intoned. I had fancied you understood.This is not a game we are playing, but a new way of life we areadopting. A necessary way of life, if we of Snaddra are to keep onliving at all.     It's not that I don't love you, Skkiru, Larhgan put in gently, butthe welfare of our planet comes first.   <doc-sep> What is it you wish? he barked.

I want to talk to you.     In the office, Arapoulous took a chair. Sorry if I'm rushing you,Retief, he said. But have you got anything for me?     Retief waved at the wine bottles. What do you know about Croanie?     Croanie? Not much of a place. Mostly ocean. All right if you likefish, I guess. We import our seafood from there. Nice prawns in monsoontime. Over a foot long.

        "Query": "What is the purpose of the Terrans' presence on Snaddra and what does it signify?",
        "Summary_1": "The visiting Terrans, Cyril and Raoul, are visiting Snaddra to survey and analyze the native culture. Evidently, Terrans do this on planets across the universe, immersing themselves in the culture only to leave however many days, months, or years later with a full-fledged report. Their visit is significant because it may give the Snaddrath a chance to revitalize their economy and people. Due to their current lack of resources, muddy surface, and planetary isolation, the Snaddrath are facing extinction. They hope that by presenting themselves as a primitive civilization, the Terrans will be more inclined to establish trade with them and give them an economic boost. ",
        "Summary_2": "The Terran visit is of great significance to the Snaddrans. The Snaddran population is dying, and most of its resources are depleted. So Snaddra needs Terrans to be interested in their planet and civilization in order to secure assistance that will help them survive. The Terran anthropologists are coming to Snaddra to study the culture and ways of life of the natives. Bbulas believes that the Terrans will not be interested in the Snaddrans\u2019 real society because it is too much like their own; therefore, he has orchestrated a plan that completely changes the society and the way they live in hopes of attracting the interest of the Earthmen who are visiting. The Terrans, on the other hand, believe that they will enjoy their stay and profit from their study of the Snaddrans and claim they can do so without disturbing their culture. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The Terrans are on Snaddra to get a better understanding of the planet\u2019s culture. Raoul and Cyril are anthropologists, and they have previously studied primitive cultures on other planets. They are not interested in studying societies that are very similar to their own. Instead, they prefer to look at cultures that are less advanced than the Terrans\u2019. \n\nThe Terrans came to Snaddra after they were invited by Bbulas. Bbulas is the Planetary Dilettante, and he has been tasked with the difficult job of saving the planet. Snaddra is struggling without resources and no way of attracting tourists. Rice is the only vegetable that will grow there. Bbulas\u2019s plan is to hide the Snaddrath\u2019s underground cities and force the citizens to play roles in a caste system. They hide their technology and wear costumes and make up ceremonies in order to give the Terrans what Bbulas believes they want to see. Raoul and Cyril promise to be objective observers who do not meddle in the Snaddrath\u2019s daily routines. \n\nBbulas has prepared for the Terrans\u2019 visit by building a hut for them and forcing some of the citizens to learn a rain dance. When Raoul questions why they would ever want more rain because it\u2019s already very wet and muddy outside, Bbulas thinks quickly and explains that the rain dance has the power to make the rain stop. In truth, the Snaddrath have never lived on the surface of the planet, so they understand very little about weather patterns. \n",
        "Summary_4": "\nThe Terrans are visiting Snaddra as part of a research mission. They are the \"cultural ruling race\", which means they have a lot of social influence in the sector, but they have not learned from many of the other races in the area. They want to enjoy their stay but also to gain something from it, but are careful to note that they have to be cautious in their relationships with the women who are native to the planet. It was apparently a long journey for them, and quite an expensive one at that, so they hope to make the most of their stay, even though they are not aware that they have walked into a fake version of the society they intend to study. They do not intend to affect the society they are visiting, but do not realize that they have done so in large ways already: in cultural influence, exports, and rice as a plant grown there to begin with. Perhaps one of the biggest influences is that of the restructuring of part of the Snaddrath society so that the Snaddrath think they will be more appealing to the Terrans as a focus of study. ",
        "Article": "The traditional office of Planetary Dilettante was a civil-servicejob, awarded by competitive examination whenever it fell vacant tothe person who scored highest in intelligence, character and generalgloonatz. However, the tests were inadequate when it came to measuringsense of proportion, adaptiveness and charm\u2014and there, Skkiru felt,was where the essential flaw lay. After all, no really effective testwould have let a person like Bbulas come out on top.     The winner was sent to Gambrell, the nearest planet with a TerranLeague University, to be given a thorough Terran-type education. Noindividual on Snaddra could afford such schooling, no matter howgreat his personal fortune, because the transportation costs were soimmense that only a government could afford them. That was the reasonwhy only one person in each generation could be chosen to go abroad atthe planet's expense and acquire enough finish to cover the rest of thepopulation.     The Dilettante's official function had always been, in theory, to servethe planet when an emergency came\u2014and this, old Luccar, the formerPresident, had decided, when he and the Parliament had awakened to thefact that Snaddra was falling into ruin, was an emergency. So he had,after considerable soul-searching, called upon Bbulas to plan a methodof saving Snaddra\u2014and Bbulas, happy to be in the limelight at last,had come up with this program.     It was not one Skkiru himself would have chosen. It was not one, hefelt, that any reasonable person would have chosen. Nevertheless, theBbulas Plan had been adopted by a majority vote of the Snaddrath,largely because no one had come up with a feasible alternative and,as a patriotic citizen, Skkiru would abide by it. He would accept thestatus of beggar; it was his duty to do so. Moreover, as in the case ofthe planet, there was no choice.     But all was not necessarily lost, he told himself. Had he not, in hisanthropological viewings\u2014though Bbulas might have been the only oneprivileged to go on ethnological field trips to other planets, he wasnot the only one who could use a library\u2014seen accounts of societieswhere beggarhood could be a rewarding and even responsible station inlife? There was no reason why, within the framework of the primitivesociety Bbulas had created to allure Terran anthropologists, Skkirushould not make something of himself and show that a beggar was worthyof the high priestess's hand\u2014which would be entirely in the Terranprimitive tradition of romance.     Skkiru! Bbulas was screaming, as he spun, now that the Terrans wereout of ear- and eye-shot Skkiru, you idiot, listen to me! What arethose ridiculous things you are wearing on your silly feet?     Skkiru protruded all of his eyes in innocent surprise. Just someold pontoons I took from a wrecked air-car once. I have a habit ofcollecting junk and I thought\u2014     Bbulas twirled madly in the air. You are not supposed to think. Leaveall the thinking to me!     Yes, Bbulas, Skkiru said meekly.   <doc-sep> She had been seeing too many of the Terrestrial fictapes from thelibrary, Skkiru thought resentfully. There was too damn much Terraninfluence on this planet. And this new project was the last straw.     No longer able to control his rage and grief, he turned a triplesomersault in the air with rage. Then why was I made a beggar and shethe high priestess? You arranged that purposely, Bbulas. You\u2014     Now, Skkiru, Bbulas said wearily, for they had been through all thisbefore, you know that all the ranks and positions were distributedby impartial lot, except for mine, and, of course, such jobs as couldcarry over from the civilized into the primitive.     Bbulas breathed on the spectacles he was wearing, as contact lenseswere not considered backward enough for the kind of planet Snaddrawas now supposed to be, and attempted to wipe them dry on his robe.However, the thick, jewel-studded embroidery got in his way and so hewas forced to lift the robe and wipe all three of the lenses on thesmooth, soft, spun metal of his top underskirt.     After all, he went on speaking as he wiped, I have to be highpriest, since I organized this culture and am the only one herequalified to administer it. And, as the president himself concurred inthese arrangements, I hardly think you\u2014a mere private citizen\u2014havethe right to question them.     Just because you went to school in another solar system, Skkiru said,whirling with anger, you think you're so smart!     I won't deny that I do have educational and cultural advantageswhich were, unfortunately, not available to the general populace ofthis planet. However, even under the old system, I was always glad toutilize my superior attainments as Official Dilettante for the good ofall and now\u2014     Sure, glad to have a chance to rig this whole setup so you could breakup things between Larhgan and me. You've had your eye on her for sometime.     Skkiru coiled his antennae at Bbulas, hoping the insult would provokehim into an unbecoming whirl, but the Dilettante remained calm. One ofthe chief outward signs of Terran-type training was self-control andBbulas had been thoroughly terranized.       I hate Terrestrials     , Skkiru said to himself.      I hate Terra.     Thequiver of anxiety had risen up his leg and was coiling and uncoilingin his stomach. He hoped it wouldn't reach his antennae\u2014if he wereto break down and psonk in front of Larhgan, it would be the finalhumiliation.     Skkiru! the girl exclaimed, rotating gently, for she, like herfiance\u2014her erstwhile fiance, that was, for the new regime had causedall such ties to be severed\u2014and every other literate person on theplanet, had received her education at the local university. Althoughsound, the school was admittedly provincial in outlook and very poorin the emotional department. One would almost think that the lots hadsome sort of divine intelligence behind them, because you certainly arebehaving in a beggarly manner!     And I have already explained to you, Skkiru, Bbulas said, with apatience much more infuriating than the girl's anger, that I had noidea of who was to become my high priestess. The lots chose Larhgan. Itis, as the Earthmen say, kismet.   <doc-sep> Unfortunately, the fees that he'd received in the past had not enabledhim both to live well and to save, and now that his fortunes had beenso drastically reduced, he seemed in a fair way of starving to death.It gave him a gentle, moody pleasure to envisage his own funeral,although, at the same time, he realized that Bbulas would probably haveto arrange some sort of pension for him; he could not expect Skkiru'spatriotism to extend to abnormal limits. A man might be willing to diefor his planet in many ways\u2014but wantonly starving to death as theresult of a primitive affectation was hardly one of them.     All the same, Skkiru reflected as he watched the visitors being led offto the native hut prepared for them, how ignominious it would be forone of the brightest young architects on the planet to have to subsistmiserably on the dole just because the world had gone aboveground. Thecapital had risen to the surface and the other cities would soon followsuit. Meanwhile, a careful system of tabus had been designed to keepthe Earthmen from discovering the existence of those other cities.     He could, of course, emigrate to another part of the planet, to one ofthem, and stave off his doom for a while\u2014but that would not be playingthe game. Besides, in such a case, he wouldn't be able to see Larhgan.     As if all this weren't bad enough, he had been done an injury whichstruck directly at his professional pride. He hadn't even been allowedto help in planning the huts. Bbulas and some workmen had done all thatthemselves with the aid of some antique blueprints that had been putout centuries before by a Terrestrial magazine and had been acquiredfrom a rare tape-and-book dealer on Gambrell, for, Skkiru thought, fartoo high a price. He could have designed them himself just as badly andmuch more cheaply.     It wasn't that Skkiru didn't understand well enough that Snaddra hadbeen forced into making such a drastic change in its way of life.What resources it once possessed had been depleted and\u2014aside fromminerals\u2014they had never been very extensive to begin with. Alllife-forms on the planet were on the point of extinction, save fish andrice\u2014the only vegetable that would grow on Snaddra, and originally aTerran import at that. So food and fiber had to be brought from theother planets, at fabulous expense, for Snaddra was not on any ofthe direct trade routes and was too unattractive to lure the touristbusiness.     Something definitely had to be done, if it were not to decayaltogether. And that was where the Planetary Dilettante came in.  "

        "Query": "What can you tell me about the inhabitants of Snaddra, as mentioned in The Ignoble Savages?",
        "Summary_1": "The natives of Snaddra are a very civilized race, progressing beyond what life on Earth is like now. They live underground, due to the terrible weather on the surface of the planet, and have built extensive cities and tunnels. They designed flying cars to use on the surface, and they have the capability to levitate. \nTheir outward appearance is somewhat humanoid, though there are some very distinct and different features. For one, the natives have antennae, as well as green skin. When healthy, their skin is a beautiful emerald green color, but if they grow ill it will become more yellow. The Snaddrath also have three eyes, requiring spectacles to have three individual lenses. When upset, anxious, or provoked, they have a tendency to twirl mid-air. If a Snaddrath falls in love with another, they give their lover their grimpatch, a beautiful bauble, to indicate their dedication. Many Snaddrath work in the metal industry since some of the few resources left on the planet are minerals. \n",
        "Summary_2": "The natives of Snaddra look very much like humans, except they have antennae, three eyes, and earflaps that they can open and close. Snaddrans have two hearts, and their essential organs are placed differently from humans\u2019. They speak Snadd but also learn English as their third language. They are intelligent and civilized, with a president, parliament, and a local university. When upset, they turn a triple somersault in the air and coil their antennae to insult another Snaddran. They can move by floating or self-levitating. Snaddrans form relationships much the same way that humans do, falling in love and marrying. They have emotions including love, sadness, jealousy, and pride.\n",
        "Summary_3": "The natives of Snaddra are under great stress. They are deeply concerned about their survival and are willing to do almost anything in order to save themselves. The creatures live underground and have never been to the surface of the planet. However, Bbulas\u2019s plan involves proving to the Terrans that they are a primitive population with very little going for them, so they create a less advanced society above ground. Bbulas actually wears contact lenses, but in the new down-and-out society he has created, he cannot be seen wearing them. He must put on glasses in order to convince the Terrans that Snaddra is not a place of great wealth. All of the citizens are forced to dress in carefully crafted rags by society\u2019s most notable tailor, and the costumes are deeply uncomfortable in the rain and wind on the surface of the planet. This is especially true since the people have never been exposed to the elements before. Bbulas, however, wears warm underskirts under his robes. He believes it\u2019s important to keep imports like certain types of clothes secret from the Terrans. \n\nThe Snaddraths do not actually live in huts, but Bbulas had some built in order to convince the Terrans that they have very little technology and are in need of more advanced peoples to teach them their ways. \n\nAt one point, Skkiru remembers that the libel laws in Snaddra are very severe, so he can not openly criticize Bbula or his master plan without facing severe punishment. The planet\u2019s government has a very top-down approach to ruling. The parliament selected Bbulas to be the only person in his generation to get a Terran education on another planet, and they have left the survival of Snaddra completely up to himi. \n",
        "Summary_4": "The natives of Snaddra are an advanced species who live in underground cities on a planet whose surface is extremely muddy and rainy. They have antennae, three eyes, and emerald green skin which becomes more pale if they are sick or malnourished. They are humanoid but have their organs in different places from Terrans. They have interesting reactions to food, such as chocolate helping provide resistance to weather. They are able to levitate on their own, but also have developed technology like air-cars and spaceships, and fourth-dimensional reflectors that can serve as walls. We know that they are an advanced species despite what the Terrestrians encounter because the Snaddrath have re-invented their society to be more primitive than they actually are. The reasoning behind this is that they want the Earthmen to take an interest in them, but if most civilized societies are about the same, they have to be a more primitive society for the Earthmen to care enough to want to learn more. The primary trade on the planet is metal work, and the lack of natural resources means that the Snaddrath have to rely heavily on trade with other planets in the system, especially for things like fabric. It is not only the level of resources that is dwindling, but the population as well. They have strong education systems of their own, and easy access to library resources, but they send one person per generation off-world to get a Terran education. The Snaddrath are considered more emotionally driven than humans, at least in that the focus of their education does not include as much on emotional regulation, so there are visible temperament differences between these groups.",

Go Away from me, Skkiru, Larhgan said, pushing his hand off her arm.A beggar does not associate with the high priestess of Snaddra.     But the Earthmen aren't due for another fifteen minutes, Skkiruprotested.     Of what importance are fifteen minutes compared to eternity! sheexclaimed. Her lovely eyes fuzzed softly with emotion. You don't seemto realize, Skkiru, that this isn't just a matter of minutes or hours.It's forever.       Forever! He looked at her incredulously. You mean we're going tokeep this up as a permanent thing? You're joking!     Bbulas groaned, but Skkiru didn't care about that. The sad, sweet wayLarhgan shook her beautiful head disturbed him much more, and whenshe said, No, Skkiru, I am not joking, a tiny pang of doubt andapprehension began to quiver in his second smallest left toe.     This is, in effect, good-by, she continued. We shall see each otheragain, of course, but only from a distance. On feast days, perhaps youmay be permitted to kiss the hem of my robe ... but that will be all.     Skkiru turned to the third person present in the council chamber.Bbulas, this is your fault! It was all your idea!     There was regret on the Dilettante's thin face\u2014an obviously insincereregret, the younger man knew, since he was well aware how Bbulas hadalways felt about the girl.     I am sorry, Skkiru, Bbulas intoned. I had fancied you understood.This is not a game we are playing, but a new way of life we areadopting. A necessary way of life, if we of Snaddra are to keep onliving at all.     It's not that I don't love you, Skkiru, Larhgan put in gently, butthe welfare of our planet comes first.   <doc-sep> He adjusted the fall of his glittering robe before the great polishedfour-dimensional reflector that formed one wall of the chamber.       Kismet     , Skkiru muttered to himself,      and a little sleight of hand.     But he didn't dare offer this conclusion aloud; the libel laws ofSnaddra were very severe. So he had to fall back on a weak, And Isuppose it is kismet that makes us all have to go live out on theground during the day, like\u2014like savages.     It is necessary, Bbulas replied without turning.     Pooh, Skkiru said. Pooh,      pooh     , POOH!     Larhgan's dainty earflaps closed. Skkiru! Such language!     As you said, Bbulas murmured, contemptuously coiling one antenna atSkkiru, the lots chose well and if you touch me, Skkiru, we shall haveanother drawing for beggar and you will be made a metal-worker.     But I can't work metal!     Then that will make it much worse for you than for the otheroutcasts, Bbulas said smugly, because you will be a pariah without atrade.     Speaking of pariahs, that reminds me, Skkiru, before I forget, I'dbetter give you back your grimpatch\u2014 Larhgan handed the glitteringbauble to him\u2014and you give me mine. Since we can't be betrothed anylonger, you might want to give yours to some nice beggar girl.     I don't want to give my grimpatch to some nice beggar girl! Skkiruyelled, twirling madly in the air.     As for me, she sighed, standing soulfully on her head, I do notthink I shall ever marry. I shall make the religious life my career.Are there going to be any saints in your mythos, Bbulas?     Even if there will be, Bbulas said, you certainly won't qualify ifyou keep putting yourself into a position which not only represents atrait wholly out of keeping with the new culture, but is most unseemlywith the high priestess's robes.     Larhgan ignored his unfeeling observations. I shall set myself apartfrom mundane affairs, she vowed, and I shall pretend to be happy,even though my heart will be breaking.     It was only at that moment that Skkiru realized just how outrageous thewhole thing really was. There must be another solution to the planet'sproblem. Listen\u2014 he began, but just then excited noises filtereddown from overhead. It was too late.     Earth ship in view! a squeaky voice called through the intercom.Everybody topside and don't forget your shoes.     Except the beggar. Beggars went barefoot. Beggars suffered. Bbulas hadmade him beggar purposely, and the lots were a lot of slibwash.     Hurry up, Skkiru.   <doc-sep> Unfortunately, the fees that he'd received in the past had not enabledhim both to live well and to save, and now that his fortunes had beenso drastically reduced, he seemed in a fair way of starving to death.It gave him a gentle, moody pleasure to envisage his own funeral,although, at the same time, he realized that Bbulas would probably haveto arrange some sort of pension for him; he could not expect Skkiru'spatriotism to extend to abnormal limits.

    {
        "Query": "What is the location of the story, The Ignoble Savages, set in?",
        "Summary_1": "Snaddra is a planet leagues away from many other solar systems. Its isolation and general lack of resources has left the planet as a whole in a terrible situation. Snaddra has two seasons: wet and wetter season. Raining practically every day, the surface of the planet is covered in mud. Because of the muddy surface and difficult weather, the Snaddrath have built cities underground and truly thrived there. Skkiru, one of the main characters, is an architect, and supposedly helped to build underground buildings and cities. Their futuristic lifestyle is threatened, however, by a lack of resources. The only crop that can grow on Snaddra is rice, brought in by Terrans, and much of the native animals and fish are dying out. The one commodity and resource left is minerals. However, the constant importation of foreign goods depleted their economy, leaving the Snaddrath between a rock and a hard place. \nBbulas, the Planetary Dilettante, developed the Bbulas Plan to save Snaddra from ruin. He designed a whole aboveground world, new garbs for citizens, as well as an entirely new culture. He believes, as does most of Snaddra, that a primitive culture will draw Terrans in more than an equally advanced and civilized one. So, the story mostly takes place on the surface of Snaddra, now covered in huts. \n",
        "Summary_2": "On Snaddra, it rains almost all the time, and the surface is covered with thick, deep, murky mud. The temperature is uncomfortably cool. They have advanced technology in their air-cars. In addition to a president and parliament, the natives have a Planetary Dilettante. This civil-service position is filled by a Snaddran who has the highest intelligence score on a competitive examination. The winner attends university on Gambrell, which is the nearest planet with a Terran League University, to receive a Terran education. This is so expensive that only one person per generation can be awarded this opportunity. The Diletantte\u2019s role is to help the planet in times of emergency. Presumably, the Diletantte\u2019s superior intellect and education enable him to determine the best ways to handle the emergencies that arise. Snaddrans live underground, perhaps because of the unpleasant conditions on the planet\u2019s surface where it rains almost constantly, and the ground is all mud. Snaddra\u2019s population and natural resources are quickly dwindling, and its main natural resource has been minerals. Life forms on the planet are on the verge of extinction, and the only food the planet produces is fish and rice. Other foods and materials must be imported from other planets, which is extremely expensive because Snaddra is not located along direct trade routes. The planet also doesn\u2019t attract tourists. The society has just been transformed in preparation for the arrival of the Terrans who want to study them. Now the society features a high priest and priestess. All the metal workers have been made outcasts, and beggars are just slightly higher than the metal workers. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Snaddra, the planet where the story takes place, is in deep trouble. The Snaddrath who live underground, are forced to take a chance on the Planetary Dilettante\u2019s plan to save the society. \nThe population of Snaddra is decreasing rapidly, there are almost zero natural resources left, and creatures from other planets are not interested in visiting Snaddra for tourism or trading purposes. Food and other resources have to be purchased from other planets, and that is a highly expensive endeavor. Metal-working is the most important industry they have, yet metal-workers are looked at as the lowliest of the Snaddraths. Instead of being thankful for their hardest and most important workers, they treat them very poorly. \n\nWhen Raoul offers Skkiru a chocolate bar, he happily accepts the gift. This is because chocolate is only available in very expensive shops, and Skkiru has had very few opportunities to taste the delicacy. \n\nThe surface of Snaddra is virtually untouched because all of society lives in underground cities. When the citizens embark on their new mission to convince the Terran that they live primitive lives on the surface, they are wholly unprepared to deal with the rainy and windy weather. The nonstop precipitation means that everyone is standing in mud, and their costumes do not adequately protect them from the harsh conditions. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Snaddra is a muddy and rainy planet with limited natural resources, and a race of people who live in underground cities. There is so much mud that neither the Terrans nor the Snaddrath can move very quickly on the surface. The depleting resources of the planet means that there are only a few things that can grow on the surface, rice and fish. Rice is itself an import from Earth, and a lot of resources are acquired through trade. The Snaddrath people live in underground cities, but they have erected buildings on the surface as well for the sake of their plan to convince the Earthmen of their facade. ",

It's not that I don't love you, Skkiru, Larhgan put in gently, butthe welfare of our planet comes first.   <doc-sep> Okay, threw back Star and the man appeared in the doorway, emptyhands held high. After a second, the other joined him.     Anne turned to Star. Now I know why they call you 'Death Star' Blade,she said, and gestured toward the men who had surrendered, and the twowhom Starrett had shot down.     He mused there for a minute. Then Anne broke the silence with, Star,what are we going to do now? Garrett's men will be up here in a littlewhile. We can't get to a sub-space beam. What are we going to do whenthey come up to investigate?     Starrett Blade laughed. Do? Well, we could turn them over to CommanderWeddel!           What?          Grinning broadly, Star pointed, with a flourish, at the door. Annespun about, and found Commander Weddel grinning in the door from thecorridor.     Very simple, said Star across the lounge to Anne. When I smashedthe vision set with that dinner fork, I broke a small unit which isincluded in all sets. You know, a direction finder doesn't work, exceptin the liner-beam principle, in space, because of the diffusing effectof unrestricted cosmic rays.     Yes, I knew that, said Anne. But how\u2014     Starrett grinned again. A type of beam has been found which it isimpossible for cosmics to disturb. But you can't send messages onit, so it is made in a little unit on every set. If that unit isbroken, the set automatically releases a signal beam. This is adistress signal, and the location of the set that sent out the signalis recorded at the Section Headquarters. When Commander Weddel sawme throw something at the set, and it went dead, he looked at theautomatic record, and found out that a signal had been sent in froma location on Alpha Cen's third planet. Then he had a high-velocitycruiser brought out and dropped in, in time to pick up some pieces. Hestopped, and idly toyed with a sheaf of papers, then held them up. Seethese papers?     Uh-huh. What are they, Star?     They are the main plans of Devil Garrett's power plant, and they'rethe one good thing he's ever done. These plans are going to bring thebarren, rocky Centauri planets to life!     He got up, and paced to the window, and stood there, looking out, andup through the plastic port. The planets of Centauri! he murmuredsoftly. Seven circling Alpha alone. And all seven are barren, rocky,level except for the thousands of lakes ... lakes that are going to bethe life of Centauri!   <doc-sep> You have done well, announced Torp when Thig had completed his reporton the resources and temperatures of various sections of Terra. We nowhave located three worlds fit for colonization and so we will return toOrtha at once.     I will recommend the conquest of this planet, 72-P-3 at once and thecomplete destruction of all biped life upon it. The mental aberrationsof the barbaric natives might lead to endless complications if theywere permitted to exist outside our ordered way of life. I imagine thatthree circuits of the planet about its primary should prove sufficientfor the purposes of complete liquidation.     But why, asked Thig slowly, could we not disarm all the natives andexile them on one of the less desirable continents, Antarctica forexample or Siberia? They are primitive humans even as our race was oncea race of primitives. It is not our duty to help to attain our owndegree of knowledge and comfort?     Only the good of the Horde matters! shouted Torp angrily. Shall arace of feeble-witted beasts, such as these Earthmen, stand in the wayof a superior race? We want their world, and so we will take it. TheLaw of the Horde states that all the universe is ours for the taking.     Let us get back to Ortha at once, then, gritted out Thig savagely.Never again do I wish to set foot upon the soil of this mad planet.There are forces at work upon Earth that we of Ortha have longforgotten.     Check the blood of Thig for disease, Kam, ordered Torp shortly. Hiswords are highly irrational. Some form of fever perhaps native to thisworld. While you examine him I will blast off for Ortha.     Thig followed Kam into the tiny laboratory and found a seat beside thesquat scientist's desk. His eyes roamed over the familiar instrumentsand gauges, each in its own precise position in the cases along thewalls. His gaze lingered longest on the stubby black ugliness ofa decomposition blaster in its rack close to the deck. A blast ofthe invisible radiations from that weapon's hot throat and flesh orvegetable fiber rotted into flaky ashes.     The ship trembled beneath their feet; it tore free from the feebleclutch of the sand about it, and they were rocketing skyward. Thig'sbroad fingers bit deep into the unyielding metal of his chair. Suddenlyhe knew that he must go back to Earth, back to Ellen and the childrenof the man he had helped destroy. He loved Ellen, and nothing muststand between them! The Hordes of Ortha must find some other world, anempty world\u2014this planet was not for them.     Turn back! he cried wildly. I must go back to Earth. There is awoman there, helpless and alone, who needs me! The Horde does not needthis planet.     Kam eyed him coldly and lifted a shining hypodermic syringe from itscase. He approached Thig warily, aware that disease often made a maniacof the finest members of the Horde.     No human being is more important than the Horde, he stated baldly.This woman of whom you speak is merely one unit of the millions wemust eliminate for the good of the Horde.     Then it was that Thig went berserk. His fists slashed into the thickjaw of the scientist and his fingers ripped at the hard cords overlyingthe Orthan's vital throat tubes. His fingers and thumb gouged deep intoKam's startled throat and choked off any cry for assistance before itcould be uttered.     Kam's hand swept down to the holster swung from his intricate harnessand dragged his blaster from it. Thig's other hand clamped over his andfor long moments they swayed there, locked together in silent deadlystruggle. The fate of a world hung in the balance as Kam's other handfought against that lone arm of Thig.  "

        "Query": "What is the story of Bbulas in The Ignoble Savages?",
        "Summary_1": "Bbulas, a Snaddrath, was chosen as a young boy to attend a Terran school on Gambrell. This Terran League University was far too expensive for any Snaddrath to afford, not only due to tuition costs. The travel expenses alone were outrageous. And so, only one student per generation would receive funds to attend. Since Bbulas was schooled there, he has more Terran tendencies than his brethren, such as his ability to not show emotions or keep from whirling when upset. \nAfter attending university, he was selected to work as the Planetary Dilettante. This selection process involves testing Snaddrath in a variety of subjects. Evidently, Bbulas\u2019 scores were the highest, so when President Luccar declared a state of emergency, he chose Bbulas to fix the situation at hand. \nBbulas designed the Bbulas Plan to solve Snaddra\u2019s economic downfall. His ultimate goal was to entice Terrans to come to Snaddra and support the planet with foreign trade. In order to do so, he decided to completely redesign their entire culture and move their capital aboveground. Bbulas believes that Terrans will be more likely to help if Snaddra is primitive in nature. \nThe story begins with an argument between Skkiru, Larhgan, and Bbulas. Bbulas elected himself High Priest in the new world, and the lots elected Larhgan to be the High Priestess. Skkiru, her fiance, was to be a beggar, sot hey could no longer be together, much to Bbulas\u2019 delight. \nAfter passively threatening Skkiru, the three rise to the surface and ready themselves for the Terrans\u2019 arrival. \nBbulas welcomes the Terrans at the temple and invites them to a stop-the-rain ceremony. He sends the Terrans to their hut and then becomes upset at Skkiru for wearing mud shoes when he is supposed to be a beggar. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Bbulas is the Planetary Diletantte who has just overhauled the Snaddran society in preparation for the Terrans\u2019 study. He has done away with the president and parliament, replacing them with himself as high priest and a female high priestess. He has created elaborate rules and a new social hierarchy with all the roles assigned by lots, although some Snadds doubt the fairness of the lot-drawing. He has also made the Snadds move from underground to above ground even though the surface of the planet is covered with thick mud from the constant rain. Bbulas considers himself superior due to his education and thinks he is talented in multiple ways, including speechwriting and even building shelters. He anticipated the Terrans\u2019 interests and makes sure the females are scantily clad and rewrites the words to their popular songs to make them less suggestive in case the Terrans have learned any Snadd. The majority of the Snaddrath voted to adopt Bbulas\u2019s plan because no one else had come up with a better one. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Bbulas is a pompous and conceited man, and he fancies himself very important. He was chosen by the government as the only person from Snaddra to get a Terran education on the planet of Gambrell. Not a single citizen can afford the expenses associated with interplanetary travel, so Bbulas\u2019s opportunity is looked at as once-in-a-lifetime. \n\nBbulas takes advantage of his position as an elite. Although he claims that in the program he created, each individual\u2019s position was selected randomly, he openly acknowledges that he was the only person who could possibly pose as the high priest. When Skkiru complains about having to pose as a beggar when he was once a successful architect, Bbulas immediately threatens to turn him into a metal-worker, a member of the lowest caste system, instead. He is completely unconcerned about the breakup of Skkiru and Lahgran\u2019s relationship and simply reminds Skkiru that he must make sacrifices for the good of the planet. Skkiru knows that Bbulas has had his eyes on his fiance for quite some time, so it\u2019s no surprise that Bbulas have given her a role where he will get to spend loads of time with her. \n\nSkkiru definitely doesn\u2019t approve of Bbulas as the Planetary Dilettante and believes he passed the examination because the exam itself was deeply flawed. He believes someone with more charm and adaptiveness should be in charge of society\u2019s survival, and he isn\u2019t impressed with Bbula\u2019s grand scheme to win over the Terran anthropologists. When he hears Lahrgran making her speech as High Priestess, he instantly recognizes that Bbulas was the speechwriter and complains that it\u2019s far too long and involved. Bbulas is undeniably interested in hearing himself speak and truly believes that it is he alone who can save the Snaddrath from a terrible fate. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Bbulas is a member of the Snaddrath race, the group of people who live on Snaddra. He has a particular role in the society as the Planetary Dilettante, which means he is the one person in his generation who was afforded an off-world education where he could learn from the Terran style system, which focuses more on emotional regulation than the native training. He was educated on Gambrell, a nearby planet which has a Terran League University. The government can only afford to send one person per generation to receive this kind of schooling so it is considered a high honor. The Dilettante is the one on standby for when there are emergencies, and the President decided that the arrival of the Earthmen was such an emergency. In order to prepare for the arrival of the Terrans, he set up everything necessary to fool the Terrans into thinking the Snaddrath were more primitive than they actually were. He was the one who restructured society so that the metal workers were the lower class, as they were the most populous group of people, and assigned Skkiru the role of a beggar which forced him to break off his engagement with Larhgan as she was assigned the high priestess role. This is especially angering to Skkiru because Bbulas assigned himself the high priest role. Skkiru is frustrated with Bbulas for making him a beggar and also disappointed because he thinks he could have been more creative in his set-up of a new society, especially being as intelligent as he was. He used blueprints from a Terrestrial magazine to build some of the above-ground features, instead of designing his own, for instance. At the beginning of the story, he is bickering with Skkiru about the fact that Skkiru is now a beggar, and all of the issues that come for Skkiru with that. He eventually led Skkiru and Larhgan to the surface of the planet when they received notice that the Earthmen had arrived, and focused on greeting these visitors. After a procession is completed, at the end of this excerpt of the story, he is yelling at Skkiru in an attempt to show his power over him, insisting that Skkiru not think for himself and just abide by the guidelines Bbulas puts forth. \n",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]        Snaddra had but one choice in its fight       to afford to live belowground\u2014underhandedly       pretend theirs was an aboveboard society!        Go Away from me, Skkiru, Larhgan said, pushing his hand off her arm.A beggar does not associate with the high priestess of Snaddra.     But the Earthmen aren't due for another fifteen minutes, Skkiruprotested.     Of what importance are fifteen minutes compared to eternity! sheexclaimed. Her lovely eyes fuzzed softly with emotion. You don't seemto realize, Skkiru, that this isn't just a matter of minutes or hours.It's forever.       Forever! He looked at her incredulously. You mean we're going tokeep this up as a permanent thing? You're joking!     Bbulas groaned, but Skkiru didn't care about that. The sad, sweet wayLarhgan shook her beautiful head disturbed him much more, and whenshe said, No, Skkiru, I am not joking, a tiny pang of doubt andapprehension began to quiver in his second smallest left toe.     This is, in effect, good-by, she continued. We shall see each otheragain, of course, but only from a distance. On feast days, perhaps youmay be permitted to kiss the hem of my robe ... but that will be all.     Skkiru turned to the third person present in the council chamber.Bbulas, this is your fault! It was all your idea!     There was regret on the Dilettante's thin face\u2014an obviously insincereregret, the younger man knew, since he was well aware how Bbulas hadalways felt about the girl.     I am sorry, Skkiru, Bbulas intoned. I had fancied you understood.This is not a game we are playing, but a new way of life we areadopting. A necessary way of life, if we of Snaddra are to keep onliving at all.     It's not that I don't love you, Skkiru, Larhgan put in gently, butthe welfare of our planet comes first.   <doc-sep> He adjusted the fall of his glittering robe before the great polishedfour-dimensional reflector that formed one wall of the chamber.       Kismet     , Skkiru muttered to himself,      and a little sleight of hand.     But he didn't dare offer this conclusion aloud; the libel laws ofSnaddra were very severe. So he had to fall back on a weak, And Isuppose it is kismet that makes us all have to go live out on theground during the day, like\u2014like savages.     It is necessary, Bbulas replied without turning.     Pooh, Skkiru said. Pooh,      pooh     , POOH!     Larhgan's dainty earflaps closed. Skkiru! Such language!     As you said, Bbulas murmured, contemptuously coiling one antenna atSkkiru, the lots chose well and if you touch me, Skkiru, we shall haveanother drawing for beggar and you will be made a metal-worker.     But I can't work metal!     Then that will make it much worse for you than for the otheroutcasts, Bbulas said smugly, because you will be a pariah without atrade.     Speaking of pariahs, that reminds me, Skkiru, before I forget, I'dbetter give you back your grimpatch\u2014 Larhgan handed the glitteringbauble to him\u2014and you give me mine. Since we can't be betrothed anylonger, you might want to give yours to some nice beggar girl.     I don't want to give my grimpatch to some nice beggar girl! Skkiruyelled, twirling madly in the air.     As for me, she sighed, standing soulfully on her head, I do notthink I shall ever marry. I shall make the religious life my career.Are there going to be any saints in your mythos, Bbulas?     Even if there will be, Bbulas said, you certainly won't qualify ifyou keep putting yourself into a position which not only represents atrait wholly out of keeping with the new culture, but is most unseemlywith the high priestess's robes.     Larhgan ignored his unfeeling observations. I shall set myself apartfrom mundane affairs, she vowed, and I shall pretend to be happy,even though my heart will be breaking.     It was only at that moment that Skkiru realized just how outrageous thewhole thing really was. There must be another solution to the planet'sproblem. Listen\u2014 he began, but just then excited noises filtereddown from overhead. It was too late.     Earth ship in view! a squeaky voice called through the intercom.Everybody topside and don't forget your shoes.     Except the beggar. Beggars went barefoot. Beggars suffered. Bbulas hadmade him beggar purposely, and the lots were a lot of slibwash.     Hurry up, Skkiru.   <doc-sep> The traditional office of Planetary Dilettante was a civil-servicejob, awarded by competitive examination whenever it fell vacant tothe person who scored highest in intelligence, character and generalgloonatz. However, the tests were inadequate when it came to measuringsense of proportion, adaptiveness and charm\u2014and there, Skkiru felt,was where the essential flaw lay. After all, no really effective testwould have let a person like Bbulas come out on top.     The winner was sent to Gambrell, the nearest planet with a TerranLeague University, to be given a thorough Terran-type education. Noindividual on Snaddra could afford such schooling, no matter howgreat his personal fortune, because the transportation costs were soimmense that only a government could afford them. That was the reasonwhy only one person in each generation could be chosen to go abroad atthe planet's expense and acquire enough finish to cover the rest of thepopulation.     The Dilettante's official function had always been, in theory, to servethe planet when an emergency came\u2014and this, old Luccar, the formerPresident, had decided, when he and the Parliament had awakened to thefact that Snaddra was falling into ruin, was an emergency. So he had,after considerable soul-searching, called upon Bbulas to plan a methodof saving Snaddra\u2014and Bbulas, happy to be in the limelight at last,had come up with this program.     It was not one Skkiru himself would have chosen. It was not one, hefelt, that any reasonable person would have chosen. Nevertheless, theBbulas Plan had been adopted by a majority vote of the Snaddrath,largely because no one had come up with a feasible alternative and,as a patriotic citizen, Skkiru would abide by it. He would accept thestatus of beggar; it was his duty to do so. Moreover, as in the case ofthe planet, there was no choice.     But all was not necessarily lost, he told himself. Had he not, in hisanthropological viewings\u2014though Bbulas might have been the only oneprivileged to go on ethnological field trips to other planets, he wasnot the only one who could use a library\u2014seen accounts of societieswhere beggarhood could be a rewarding and even responsible station inlife? There was no reason why, within the framework of the primitivesociety Bbulas had created to allure Terran anthropologists, Skkirushould not make something of himself and show that a beggar was worthyof the high priestess's hand\u2014which would be entirely in the Terranprimitive tradition of romance.     Skkiru! Bbulas was screaming, as he spun, now that the Terrans wereout of ear- and eye-shot Skkiru, you idiot, listen to me! What arethose ridiculous things you are wearing on your silly feet?     Skkiru protruded all of his eyes in innocent surprise. Just someold pontoons I took from a wrecked air-car once. I have a habit ofcollecting junk and I thought\u2014     Bbulas twirled madly in the air. You are not supposed to think. Leaveall the thinking to me!     Yes, Bbulas, Skkiru said meekly.  "

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of The Gravity Business's storyline?",
        "Summary_1": " Grampa Peppergrass is an inventor, creator of the gravity polarizer and the space flivver, which have earned him one hundred million dollars. But he invested much of his earnings in perpetual motion machines and longevity pills. Now, the Peppergrass family travels to different planets, searching for radioactive metals that they can exploit to make themselves a fortune. The family consists of four generations of men and their spouses. Apparently, Grandpa, who is 90-years-old, is a widower. His son, Fred, is 60 and married to Joyce. Their son Junior, 35, is married to Reba; they are parents of an eight-year-old genius son known as Four.\n\tThe flivver they travel in was purchased by Grampa, who gave \u2159 ownership to each of the family members. The flivver\u2019s landing is unusually bumpy because the gravity polarizer failed. Through the view screen, they see that the planet has meadows, woodlands, plains, and lakes, and Four announces that it also has fauna before he rushes out the air lock to check it out. The ship has already ascertained that the air is almost like that on Earth, and there are no micro-organisms. When Four returns to the flivver accompanied by the native fauna, Fweep, he announces they are friends. The creature looks like a transparent blob and likes to sweep. Four is curious about what Fweep does with the sweepings since the outer inch or so of his body turns cloudy but clears afterward. \n\tAfter Fred and Junior use their scintillation counters to search for heavy metals, they return to the flivver to report there aren\u2019t any, just low-grade iron. The group mulls over what could be making the planet so heavy if it doesn\u2019t have heavy metals, but no one has the answer. \nJunior and Fred tell the rest of the family that the gravity polarizer isn\u2019t working and that without it, they will not be able to lift off. Reba looks on the bright side and says they can have more children instead of stopping at one child, as is currently the dictated number on Earth. In the meantime, Four returns from an excursion searching for the center of gravity for the planet and announces that it changes because of Fweep\u2019s presence. The little guy is a circular polarizer, making the planet heavy and preventing their gravity polarizer from working. Fweep is also radioactive and has impervious skin. Joyce is furious that Fweep is making them stay there, and when Grampa jokingly, or as a test, suggests leaving Four behind with Fweep, she immediately goes along with it. Four offers to stay behind with Fweep, who is lonely and likes having a friend so much it doesn\u2019t want to lose Four. Grampa announces that the problem isn\u2019t one that their computer can solve; instead, it\u2019s a logic problem like the ones Four told him earlier.   \n",
        "Summary_2": "A small, weird spaceship crashes into a meadow with four generations of the Peppergrass family inside. The men are Grampa, (Young) Fred, Junior, and Four. There are two women: Four's mom Reba, and Junior's mom Joyce. There is bickering, as Joyce doesn't think Grampa has spent his money well, and they argue about the role of gravity in their crash, which happened on a search for heavy metals to bring back to Earth. \nThe air should be safe to breathe, and they spot both plants and animals, so Four wants to rush outside. Junior pulls Fred into a private conversation explaining that something went wrong and their ship now won\u2019t move. When Four gets back, he brings with him a creature named Fweep: a gelatin-like orb about two feet in diameter that is raspberry in color. When he moves across the tile, he cleans it, picking up what he passes over. Joyce is appalled but Reba insists Four should be able to have a friend, so Four focuses on learning how Fweep's ability works. The ship shook when Grampa patted Fweep, and the family discussed a plan. The polarizer on the ship is broken so they might not be able to go anywhere. Grampa insists it can\u2019t be broken, Junior responds that polarization doesn\u2019t work here, so Fred insists on an explanation from Grampa about how gravity polarization works. Joyce insists Grampa doesn't actually know, and expresses her frustration that they aren't just getting rich from finding uranium. They figure they could build a community on the planet, but having more than one child per family is against their laws. As they argue about options, Four uses another contraption to try to find the planet\u2019s center of gravity. The center of gravity shifts when Fweep leaves - he is a circular polarizer, making the planet heavy, conflicting with the linear polarizer of the spaceship, which is why it can't move. Joyce tries to poison Fweep with rat poison but it can\u2019t hurt him, he doesn\u2019t consume what he picks up but rather uses matter to create radioactive substance: this means he has a lot of mass, and it was him their equipment picked up on, not uranium. They talk about how to turn off his gravity, but they don\u2019t know how, and figure he might be immortal. Fred tries to calm Joyce down but she suggest that they appeal to Fweep to let them go. Four says he\u2019d asked already, but Fweep doesn\u2019t want his only friend to leave. The question arises: what if Four stays behind? Junior is found yelling at a computer and doesn\u2019t want Four to stay behind, he refuses to leave his son on a strange planet. Grampa insists that Junior\u2019s computer work won\u2019t help them because it is not a scientific issue, but rather a moral and logical one. The story ends with Fweep and Four coming back from playing in the meadow with the family ready to discuss options.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Four generations of the Peppergrass family approach a new planet. They are riding a flivver, a spaceship that was poorly constructed for very little money. The flivver descends on the new planet, stops abruptly before impact, and lands and rocks back and forth in a grassy meadow. \n\nGrampa, the patriarch of the family, gets upset because his logic puzzle, a pircuit, is disrupted by the harsh landing. When his family members tell him to work on his game, he reminds them that he\u2019s the one that invented the gravity polarizer and the flivver. He also boasts that he made one hundred million dollars doing it. Joyce points out that he spent most of the money, and now the family is stuck searching various planets for uranium. \n\nFour, an eight-year-old boy, leaves the ship and returns with a creature that looks like a two-foot sphere made of raspberry flavored Jello. Almost simultaneously, Junior, the pilot, discovers that the polarizer stopped working, and now the flivver won\u2019t move at all. Joyce, Four\u2019s grandmother, tells him to get the blob away immediately, but Four has already named it Fweep because that\u2019s the only word it has said thus far, and he likes it. Fweep begins sweeping the floor, and his body picks up all of the particles that he passes through. When Grampa reaches down to pet the alien, the flivver physically shakes. \n\nFred reveals that the tests show that Fweep\u2019s planet has no uranium or other heavy metals that would be valuable to the Peppergrass family. They have a difficult time understanding why the planet is so heavy without those resources, and they are all disappointed that the new land will not bring them wealth. They have spent a year on the flivver and they have very little to show for themselves. Worst of all, they are now stuck on Fweep\u2019s planet. After a short discussion, it becomes clear that although Grampa created the polarizer, he has very little knowledge about how it works and how to fix it.\n\nFour discovers that Fweep\u2019s planet has a shifting center of gravity because Fweep himself is a circular polarizer. He is the force that makes the planet heavy. Joyce tries to feed Fweep poison so that the family can leave, but Fweep has zero enzymes and no nervous system. He\u2019s a radioactive being, but it\u2019s unclear what makes him that way. There is no way to kill Fweep because his skin is thicker than lead, and he doesn\u2019t breathe. Four believes he is the only one of his kind and that he is immortal. He reveals that he has been communicating with Fweep, and Fweep has told him that he will not let his family leave because he wants to be Four\u2019s friend. The family considers leaving Four on the planet alone, but his mother won\u2019t have it. Four leaves to play in the meadow with Fweep, and the other family members are left to come up with a solution to the problem. \n",
        "Summary_4": "The Peppergrass family is made up of Grampa, their son Fred and his wife Joyce, their son Junior and his wife Reba, and their son Four. The Peppergrass men all looked alike and were currently onboard their Grampa\u2019s flivver which they each hold a share in. Due to Grampa\u2019s poor spending choices, they are currently broke and searching the universe for rare finds or radioactive materials to sell back on Earth. Their rocket, the flivver, lands on this new planet suddenly, as the polarizer gave out when it neared the surface. The men quickly go to investigate it, while Four decides to explore the new planet after looking out the window and discovering both flora and fauna. After reassuring his mother, Four rushes outside, while Junior and Fred discuss the polarizer issue. \nFour returns soon after with a gelatinous, dark pink blob with a mouth that calls itself Fweep. His family reacts somewhat negatively, but Four claims that Fweep is his friend. Reba allows Fweep to say and dismisses Joyce in the process. Fweep sweeps and absorbs matter and particulates into his body. He starts cleaning the floors of the spaceship leaving nothing behind. \nGrampa and Reba share a quick conversation about her choice to marry Junior. Four attempts to understand Fweep before talking with Grampa about his puzzle circuits. Fweep momentarily absorbed Grampa\u2019s hand before spitting it back out. The flivver shook as it did so. Despite having a similar atmosphere to Earth, this planet was extremely heavy, making it impossible to take off of. They toss around ideas, then come to the conclusion that there\u2019s something different about the gravity here. Four discovers that Fweep is the center of gravity after traipsing all across the planet trying to find it. Fweep is a circular polarizer, not a linear polarizer, so he makes the planet heavy and impossible for the polarizer to work. \nJoyce attempts to poison Fweep sometime later, but it doesn\u2019t work. Four reveals all that he\u2019s learned about Fweep and the way it works. After a quick outburst from Joyce, Four says that he\u2019s able to speak to Fweep. Fweep doesn\u2019t want to let them leave because Four is his friend. Joyce suggests leaving Four behind so the rest can leave, which Reba takes great offense to, though Four agrees with Joyce. Grampa and Junior attempt to solve their issue logically while Four and Fweep play outside. \n",

Your people must be unusually interested in that regionof space.     If that's all you wanted to know, I'll be on my way. I have matters ofimportance to see to.     After Gulver left, Retief called Miss Furkle in. I'd like to have abreak-out of all the student movements that have been planned under thepresent program, he said. And see if you can get a summary of whatMEDDLE has been shipping lately.     Miss Furkle compressed her lips. If Mr. Magnan were here, I'm surehe wouldn't dream of interfering in the work of other departments.I ... overheard your conversation with the gentleman from the CroanieLegation\u2014     The lists, Miss Furkle.     I'm not accustomed, Miss Furkle said, to intruding in mattersoutside our interest cluster.     That's worse than listening in on phone conversations, eh? But nevermind. I need the information, Miss Furkle.     Loyalty to my Chief\u2014     Loyalty to your pay-check should send you scuttling for the materialI've asked for, Retief said. I'm taking full responsibility. Nowscat.     The buzzer sounded. Retief flipped a key. MUDDLE, Retief speaking....     Arapoulous's brown face appeared on the desk screen.     How-do, Retief. Okay if I come up?     Sure, Hank. I want to talk to you.     In the office, Arapoulous took a chair. Sorry if I'm rushing you,Retief, he said. But have you got anything for me?     Retief waved at the wine bottles. What do you know about Croanie?     Croanie? Not much of a place. Mostly ocean. All right if you likefish, I guess. We import our seafood from there. Nice prawns in monsoontime. Over a foot long.     You on good terms with them?     Sure, I guess so. Course, they're pretty thick with Boge.     So?     Didn't I tell you? Boge was the bunch that tried to take us over herea dozen years back. They'd've made it too, if they hadn't had a lot ofbad luck. Their armor went in the drink, and without armor they're easygame.     Miss Furkle buzzed. I have your lists, she said shortly.     Bring them in, please.   <doc-sep> Joyce glared at him furiously. Four! Act your age! We've got to dosomething with him. It's preposterous that we should be detained hereat the whim of a mere blob!     I don't figure it's a whim, Grampa said. Circular gravity is whathe's got to have for one reason or another, so he just naturally bendsthe space-time continuum around him\u2014conscious or subconscious, I don'tknow. But protoplasm is always more efficient than machines, so theflivver won't move.     I don't care why that thing does it, Joyce said icily. I want itstopped, and the sooner the better. If it won't turn the gravity off,we'll just have to do away with it.     How? asked Four. Fweep's skin is pretty close to impervious andyou can't shoot him, stab him or poison him. He doesn't breathe, soyou can't drown or strangle him. You can't imprison him; he 'eats'everything. And violence might be more dangerous to us than to him.Right now, Fweep is friendly, but suppose he got mad! He could lowerhis radioactive shield or he might increase the gravity by a few times.Either way, you'd feel rather uncomfortable, Grammy.     Don't call me 'Grammy!' Well, what are we going to do, just sit aroundand wait for that thing to die?     We'd have a long wait, Four observed. Fweep is the only one of hiskind on this planet.     Well?     Probably he's immortal.     And he doesn't reproduce? Reba asked sympathetically.     Probably not. If he doesn't die, there's no point in reproduction.Reproduction is nature's way of providing racial immortality to mortalcreatures.     But he must have some way of reproduction, Reba argued. An egg orsomething. He couldn't just have sprung into being as he is now.     Maybe he developed, Four offered. It seems to me that he's biggerthan when we first landed. He must have been here a long, long time,Fred said. Fweepland, as Four calls it, kept its atmosphere and itswater, which a planet this size ordinarily would have lost by now.   <doc-sep> The land of the Fweep turned slowly on its axis. The orange sun set androse again and stared down once more at the meadow where the improbablespaceship rested on its improbable stern. The sixteen Earth hours thatthe rotation had taken had changed nothing inside the ship, either.

        "Query": "What is the backdrop of The Gravity Business?",
        "Summary_1": "The first setting mentioned in the story is the flivver, a bullet-shaped spaceship that lands vertically on the blunt end. It is made of sheet metal and insulation board. Fully equipped, a flivver sells for $15,730. The flivver has a large central cabin with the pilot\u2019s chair; the control stick is situated between the pilot\u2019s knees, and there is an on/off button for the gravity polarizer. It is also equipped with a computer named Abacus that analyzes data that fed into it. Flivvers have their own power plants that operate their lights, air and water recirculation systems, and food and clothing synthesizers. It also has a storage battery. Off of the central cabin, there are several private rooms. The flivver is owned jointly by the Peppergrass family; Grandpa bought it the \u201823 model and gave everyone \u2159 shares. The flivver also carries devices that can analyze the air and detect microorganisms.\nThe other setting where the story takes place is on a planet much like Earth, with a diameter smaller than Mercury\u2019s but a gravitational pull as strong as Earth\u2019s. The Peppergrass family calls the world Fweepland since \u201cFweep\u201d is the sound/word the one organism there says. Fweepland\u2019s air is within 1% of Earth\u2019s air, and there are no microorganisms present. Fweepland features a beautiful landscape with a peaceful green woodland, grassy plains, a meadow, and a blue lake. The only organism they encounter is Fweep, a friendly blob-shaped creature that sweeps over debris and picks it up. The Peppergrass family hopes to find radioactive or heavy metals on the planet, but their scintillation counters only detect low-grade iron. Four points out that while it doesn\u2019t have the metals they are looking for, the planet is very valuable as real estate. Interestingly, the planet\u2019s center of gravity shifts wherever Fweep goes. A day on Fweepland is 16 Earth hours, as that is the length of time it takes for one rotation of the planet.\nThe story presumably takes place sometime in the 22nd century as Grampa references Einstein\u2019s work \u201ctwo hundred years ago.\u201d There are some references to life on Earth at this time. Families are only allowed one child; if they have more, they are exiled from civilization. We can also assume that others are traveling into space since Grampa became wealthy from his invention of flivvers and gravity polarizers. People on Earth are trying to lengthen their lives, hence Grampa\u2019s efforts to create longevity pills and his hundred-year contract with the Life-Begins-At-Ninety longevity company.\n",
        "Summary_2": "There are two settings directly important to the story: one is the planet which the Peppergrass family calls Fweepland, and the other is the spaceship that took them there. Inside the small spaceship are a number of computers that the family interacts with (ones that run puzzles are called pircuit, and the computer that runs the ship is called Abacus). There are personal rooms for the members of the family, and an area to pilot the ship from. Outside of the airlock is the planet the Peppergrass family finds themselves on after the crash: Four refers to it as Fweepland, after the creature he meets who he calls Fweep because \"fweep\" is the only word the creature seems capable of saying. It has beautiful grassy meadows, one of which was the location of the crash. There are various plants and animals on the planet, but one unique creature named Fweep seems to stand on his own. ",

The flivver has been the Peppergrass\u2019s home for about a year at this point. Although Grampa had millions of dollars not that long ago, he spent it all on frivolous inventions, and the family is now forced to search uncolonized planets for uranium or other expensive heavy metals. It is clear that the family members are getting on each others\u2019 nerves after spending so much time together cooped up in a crude contraption that was built for only $15,000. \n\nFweep\u2019s planet is very similar to Earth, the original home of the Peppergrass family. It is smaller than Mercury, but it has almost the same level of gravity as Earth. The surface is covered with grass and white flowers. Because the planet is unusually heavy for its size, the family believes they may find heavy metals there. However, their instincts are wrong, and the reason the planet is heavy is because Fweep, an alien creature, is polarizing the gravity. At one point, Reba points out that the land is beautiful and fertile, and it really isn\u2019t the worst place to get stuck. \n",

Four is shocked to discover that this planet has both flora and fauna.

Its relatively ugly figure is unlike any other rocket ship, but it gets the job done.

The flivver descended vertically toward the green planet circling theold, orange sun.     It was a spaceship, but not the kind men had once dreamed about. Theflivver was shaped like a crude bullet, blunt at one end of a fatcylinder and tapering abruptly to a point at the other. It had beenslapped together out of sheet metal and insulation board, and it sold,fully equipped, for $15,730. It didn't behave like a spaceship, either.     As it hurtled down, its speed increased with dramatic swiftness. Then,at the last instant before impact, it stopped. Just like that.     A moment later, it thumped a last few inches into the ankle-deep grassand knee-high white flowers of the meadow. It was a shock of a jar thatmade the sheet-metal walls boom like thunder machines. The flivverrocked unsteadily on its flat stern before it decided to stay upright.     Then all was quiet\u2014outside.     Inside the big, central cabin, Grampa waved his pircuit irately in theair.

They had seen many such stars come near out of the galaxy's glitteringbackdrop, and had seen them dwindle, turn red and go out as the      QuestIII     drove on its way once more, lashed by despair toward the speed oflight, leaving behind the mockery of yet another solitary and lifelessluminary unaccompanied by worlds where men might dwell. They had grownsated with the sight of wonders\u2014of multiple systems of giant stars, ofnebulae that sprawled in empty flame across light years.     But now unwonted excitement possessed the hundred-odd members of the      Quest III's     crew. It was a subdued excitement; men and women, theycame and stood quietly gazing into the big vision screens that showedthe oncoming star, and there were wide-eyed children who had been bornin the ship and had never seen a planet. The grownups talked in lowvoices, in tones of mingled eagerness and apprehension, of what mightlie at the long journey's end.

        "Query": "What role does Fweep play in The Gravity Business?",
        "Summary_1": "Fweep is significant because he is the only creature living on Fweepland. He is a blob-shaped, raspberry-colored, gelatinous, transparent creature who sweeps up the debris that he runs over and engulfs it in his body. After he sweeps up particles, the outer inch or two of his body turns cloudy, then slowly clears. It seems he also absorbs substances from human contact since he follows a crooked path and hiccups after Grampa, who has been imbibing, pats him. He has a pseudo-mouth and makes the sound, or says the word, \u201cFweep.\u201d His skin is impervious, and he has no enzymes or nervous system, so rat poison has no effect on him. Fweep immediately befriends Four. \n\tWhen Four explores Fweepland to identify its center of gravity, he discovers that it shifts because Fweep is a circular polarizer. Fweep is what makes the planet so heavy and prevents the flivver\u2019s gravity polarizer from working so the family can leave. Fweep is slightly radioactive and likely immortal and incapable of reproduction since there is no need to reproduce. Because he has circular polarization, linear polarization is uncomfortable to him, so Fweep turned of the flivver\u2019s gravity polarizer just before they landed. Fweep wants to be helpful, but he doesn\u2019t want Four to leave since Four is the only friend he has ever had. Fweep was lonely before he met Four. Fweep will let the Peppergrass family leave only if Four stays with him. Fweep is responsible for the family\u2019s landing on Fweepland and their predicament of being unable to leave.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Fweep is a creature that Four finds when the Peppergrass family lands on an unknown planet. He is a gelatin-like orb about two feet in diameter that is raspberry in color, and has something resembling a mouth. However, he has an interesting ability in which he picks up particulates on the ground by rolling around. He calls this sweeping, and we find out later in the story that he is able to convert the materials in what he picks up to create radioactive matter. Because of this ability, he has a very high mass which the Peppergrass family misinterpreted as heavy metals as they were scanning the planet, which is what drew them to the planet in the first place. Fweep is also responsible for the ship's crashing: because of his mass, Fweep is a circular polarizer, which conflicted with the linear polarizer of the spaceship. Fweep and Four become instant friends when they meet, which adds another layer of complication to the relationship that the family has with Fweep. He could let the family return home, which they can't do under his gravitational pull, but Fweep does not want to let the family go if that means that Four would leave him, and Four is his only friend. This presents a moral conundrum to the family: they could return if they leave Four on the planet, but they do not want to leave a family member behind. ",
        "Summary_3": "Fweep is a pink colored blob, and he\u2019s about two-feet wide. He looks like gelatin, and he picks up dust and particles as he moves across the floor of the flivver. The outer couple of inches of his body become cloudy when he does this, and then they clear again. Fweep gets his name because when Four first meets him and brings him back to the flivver, the only word he says is \u201cFweep?\u201d He is trying to ask Four if he should sweep the spaceship. He wants to be helpful because he has no other friends or family members on his planet. \n\nThe family has a difficult time figuring out why their ship\u2019s polarizer won\u2019t work, and Fweep ends up being the culprit. Fweep is a circular polarizer, and he is the reason that the planet is so heavy. He is a being entirely different than anything living on Earth. Four believes he is immortal because he appears to be the only one of his kind. As far as they know, he cannot be killed because he has zero enzymes, no nervous system, his skin is impenetrable, and he doesn\u2019t breathe. Junior uses a special tool to test Fweep\u2019s radioactivity levels, and he finds that the creature is radioactive, although it\u2019s unclear how or why. \n\nWhen the family\u2019s flivver lands, Fweep does not like the feeling of linear polarization, so he neutralizes it. This causes the spaceship to abruptly fall to the ground. After he meets Four, the eight-year-old genius of the family, he decides that he wants to be his friend. Four asks Fweep if his family can leave the planet, and Fweep tells him he doesn\u2019t want his friend to leave. He enjoys sitting in Four\u2019s lap and even learns the word \u201cfwend.\u201d Fweep won\u2019t allow the flivver\u2019s polarizer to work, so the family cannot leave. He won\u2019t allow the polarizer to work because he wants to stay friends with Four. When the story abruptly comes to an end, the Peppergrass adults are trying to figure out how to solve this problem. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Fweep is a gelatinous life-form, unlike anything the Peppergrass family has ever seen before. Fweep is slightly radioactive after having absorbed much of the radioactive substances found on this planet. He can also convert ordinary matter into a radioactive substance. Fweep is unstable, unshootable, and unable to be poisoned. Fweep does not breathe, so he is unable to be suffocated or drowned. As well, Fweep may be immortal, since there are no other of his kind. Since he\u2019s the only one of his kind, he\u2019s very lonely and latches onto Four as soon as he arrives. Fweep controls the gravity of Fweepland, and uses circular gravity not linear gravity. His powers are extraordinary and completely unknown. ",
        "Article": "Reba looked at Fweep kindly. We can thank the little fellow for that,anyway.     I thank him for nothing, Joyce snapped. He lured us down here bymaking us think the planet had heavy metals and I want him to let us go      immediately     !     Fred turned impatiently on his wife. Well, try making him understand!And if you can make him understand what you want him to do, try makinghim do it!     Joyce looked at Fred with startled eyes. Fred! she said in a high,shocked voice and turned blindly toward her room.     Grampa lowered his bottle and smacked his lips. Well, boy, he said toFred, I thought you'd never do that. Didn't think you had it in you.     Fred stood up apologetically. I'd better go calm her down, hemuttered, and walked quickly after Joyce.     Give her one for me! Grampa called.     Fred's shoulders twitched as the door closed behind him. From the roomcame the filtered sound of high-pitched voices rising and falling likesome reedy folk music.     Makes you think, doesn't it? Grampa said, looking at Fweep benignly.Maybe the whole theory of gravitation is cockeyed. Maybe there's aFweep for every planet and sun, big and little, polarizing the gravityin circles, and the matter business is not a cause but a result.     What I can't understand, Junior said thoughtfully, is why thepolarizer worked for a little while when we landed\u2014long enough to keepus from being squashed\u2014and then quit.     Fweep didn't recognize it immediately, didn't know what it was orwhere it came from, Four explained. All he knew was he didn't likelinear polarization and he neutralized it as soon as he could. That'swhen we dropped.   <doc-sep> We're stuck, Reba said softly. We might as well admit it. All we cando is set the transmitter to send out an automatic distress call\u2014     Which, Joyce interrupted, might get picked up in a few centuries.     And make the best of what we've got, Reba went on, unheeding. If welook at it the right way, it's quite a lot. A beautiful, fertile world.Earth gravity. The flivver\u2014even if the polarizer won't work, there'sthe resynthesizer; it will keep us in food and clothes for years. Bythen, we should have a good-sized community built up, because out herewe won't have to stop with one child. We can have all the babies wewant.     You know the law: one child per couple, Joyce reminded her frigidly.You can condemn yourself to exile from civilization if you wish. Notme.     Junior frowned at his wife. I believe you're actually glad ithappened.     I could think of worse things, Reba said.     I like your spunk, Reb, Grampa muttered.     Speaking of children, Junior said, where's Four?     Here. Four came through the airlock and trudged across the room,carrying a curious contraption made of tripod legs supporting asmall box from which dangled a plumb bob. Behind Four, like a round,raspberry shadow, rolled Fweep.     Fweep? it queried hopefully.     Not now, said Four.     Where've you been? Reba asked anxiously. What've you been doing?     I've been all over Fweepland, Four said wearily, trying to locateits center of gravity.     Well? Fred prompted.     It shifts.     That's impossible, said Junior.     Not for Fweep, Four replied.     What do you mean by that? Joyce suspiciously asked.     It shifted, Four explained patiently, because Fweep kept followingme.     Fweep? Junior repeated stupidly.     Fweep? Fweep said eagerly.     He's why the flivver won't work. What Grampa invented was a linearpolarizer. Fweep is a circular polarizer. He's what makes this planetso heavy. He's why we can't leave.   <doc-sep> The land of the Fweep turned like a fat old man toasting himself infront of an open fire, and Junior sat at the computer's keyboardswearing in a steady monotone.     Junior! said Joyce, shocked.     Junior swung around impatiently. Sorry, Mother, but this damned thingwon't work.     I'm sure that calling it names won't help, and besides, you shouldn'texpect a machine to do something that we can't do. And if it did work,it would only say that the logical answer is the one I sug\u2014     Mother! Junior warned. We decided not to talk about it any more.Four is strange enough without encouraging him to think like a martyr.It's out of the question. If that's the only way we can leave thisplanet, we'll stay here until Four has a beard as white as Grampa's!     Well! Joyce said in a stiff, offended tone and sat back in her chair.     Grampa lowered the nippled bottle from his lips and chortled. Junior,I apologize for all the mean things I ever said about you. Maybe yougot the makings of a Peppergrass yet.     Junior turned back to the keyboard and studied it, his chin in hishand. It's just a matter of stating the problem in terms the computercan work on.     I take it all back, said Grampa. That computer won't help you withthis problem, Junior. This ain't a long, complicated calculation; it'sa simple problem in logic. It's a pircuit problem, like the one aboutthe cannibals and the missionaries. We can't leave Fweepland becauseFweep won't let our polarizer work. He won't let our polarizer workbecause he doesn't like gravity that's polarized in a straight line,and he don't want Four to leave him.     Now Fweep ain't the brightest creature in the Universe, so he can'tunderstand why we're so gosh-fired eager to leave. And as long as he'sgot Four, he's happy. Why should he make himself unhappy? As a favorto Four, he'd let us leave\u2014if we'd leave Four here with him, which weain't gonna do.     That's the problem. All we got to do is figure out the answer. No usemaking a pircuit, because a puzzle circuit is just a miniature computerwith the solution built in; if you can build the pircuit, you'vealready solved the problem. And if you can state the problem to Abacus,you've already got the answer. All you want from it then is decimalpoints.     That may be, Junior said stubbornly, but I still want to know whythis computer won't work. It won't even do simple arithmetic! Where'sFour? He's the only one who understands this thing.     He's outside, playing in the meadow with Fweep, Reba said, her voicesoft. No, here they come now.  "

        "Query": "What role does Four play in The Gravity Business?",
        "Summary_1": "Four is the highly intelligent, eight-year-old youngest member of the Peppergrass family. Although he is the youngest, he is the one who figures out the answers to why Fweepland is so heavy and how Fweep disables the flivver\u2019s gravity polarizer. As a child, he is more impulsive than the adults, for example rushing outside to meet Fweep when the others stay back, but this enables him to solve problems and answer questions faster. On the other hand, his lack of experience prevents him from solving the ultimate problem of how to leave the planet, but his riddles and comment that creating a puzzle means you already know the solution trigger an idea for Grampa that may help solve the family\u2019s dilemma. By befriending Fweep so readily, Four discovers that Fweep is responsible for the planet\u2019s \u201cfake\u201d heaviness and the failure of the flivver\u2019s gravity polarizer. He also studies Fweep and determines his significant characteristics such as his impervious skin, lack of enzymes, and radioactivity. While the adults discuss and bemoan the fact that they cannot leave Fweepland, Four goes out and tries to identify the planet\u2019s center of gravity and therefore discovers that Fweep affects the planet\u2019s gravity and that he is a circular polarizer. At the end of the story, Junior even relies on Four to find out why the computer won\u2019t work. Not only is Four a problem solver and investigator, but he is also logical and selfless. He realizes that Fweep doesn\u2019t want him to leave and is willing to stay behind with Fweep so that the rest of his family can leave. ",
        "Summary_2": "Four is the youngest of the Peppergrass family, the son of Junior and Reba. He is eight years old, and due to his unusual upbringing living on a ship with his family, does not have many friends of his own. When the family crash-lands on a planet, he discovers a creature who he calls Fweep and the two instantly become friends. Four seems to understand the creatures when he talks, and can interpret his requests. Four is a curious child, and wants to solve the problem of why the ship can't go anywhere after it crash landed, so he took Fweep on an adventure to find the center of gravity of the planet. It is Four who discovers that Fweep is the center of gravity, and it is the fact that this point shifts that makes the gravity (and thus, the polarization) so unpredictable. It is also Four who aims to learn more about the planet outside of the ship, and not just about the problems on the ship itself, and it is this perspective that drives any progress they made. Besides learning about the moving center of gravity, he learns about the way Fweep picks things up as he rolls over them, and investigates how he converts matter and what his outer shell might be contributing to the distribution of energy. After discovering that Fweep is responsible for the gravity of the planet, things get more complicated. Four is at the center of a moral conundrum at the end of the story: if the family wants to return home, they have to appeal to Fweep, who controls the polarization on the planet. However, Fweep's terms are that Four would have to stay behind, because he does not want his only friend to leave. ",
        "Summary_3": "Four is an eight-year-old genius and a member of the Peppergrass family. He is pale, has a thin face, and acts much, much older than he is. His mother is Reba and his father is Junior. His parents are concerned about his lack of friends and socialization. He truly acts like an adult, and it seems as though he never got to have a normal childhood. When his Grampa struggles to figure out his logic puzzle, Four solves it for him in mere moments. He then comes up with another puzzle for his Grampa to solve, and he even offers to build him a pircuit board with a few parts that he has laying around the flivver. Four is very excited to meet his new friend Fweep, and it\u2019s clear that he does not want to immediately come clean about Fweep being the reason the family\u2019s spaceship can\u2019t take off. Since he has had so few friends in his life, the pink blob that follows him around means a lot to him, especially since he actually tells Four that he wants to be his friend. If it were up to Four, the family would probably stay on Fweep's planet and colonize the fertile land. However, several of the family members are completely against this idea, and Reba refuses to leave her son behind so that the spaceship can take off again. They are in this conundrum when the story ends. ",

However, when they land on this new planet, he quickly makes a friend in Fweep. After discovering that the planet\u2019s gravity is attached to Fweep and therefore circular, he effectively discovered the true issue at hand. It was not the polarizer that was keeping them trapped, it was Fweep. Four nobly offers to stay behind with Fweep, so the rest can leave and Fweep won\u2019t be lonely.

Grampa looked up from his pircuit and said, If I were you, Junior, Iwould take a good look at the TV repairman when we get back to Earth.      If     we get back to Earth, he amended. You can't be Four's father.All over the Universe, gravity is the same, and if it's gravity, thepolarizer will polarize it.     That's just supposition, Junior said stubbornly. The fact is, itisn't because it doesn't. Q.E.D.     Maybe the polarizer is broken, Fred suggested.     Grampa snorted. Broken-shmoken. Nothing to break, Young Fred. Just afew coils of copper wire and they're all right. We checked. We knowthe power plant is working: the lights are on, the air and waterrecirculation systems are going, the food resynthesizer is okay. And,anyway, the polarizer could work from the storage battery if it had to.     Then it goes deeper, Junior insisted. It goes right to the principleof polarization itself. For some reason, it doesn't work here. Why?Before we can discover the answer to that, we'll have to know moreabout polarization itself. How does it work, Grampa?     Grampa gave him a sarcastic grin. Now you're curious, eh? Couldn'tbe bothered with Grampa's invention before. Oh, no! Too busy. Acceptwithout question the blessings that the Good Lord provideth\u2014     Let's not get up on any pulpits, Fred growled. Come on, Grampa,what's the theory behind polarization?     Grampa looked at the four faces staring at him hopefully and thejeering grin turned to a smile. Well, he said, at last. You knowhow light is polarized, eh? The smile faded. No, I guess you don't.   <doc-sep> Most of the cousins gasped as the truth began to percolate through.     I knew from the very beginning, Conrad finished, that I didn'thave to do anything at all. I just had to wait and you would destroyyourselves.     I don't understand, Bartholomew protested, searching the faces of thecousins closest to him. What does he mean, we have never existed?We're here, aren't we? What\u2014     Shut up! Raymond snapped. He turned on Martin. You don't seemsurprised.     The old man grinned. I'm not. I figured it all out years ago.     At first, he had wondered what he should do. Would it be better tothrow them into a futile panic by telling them or to do nothing? Hehad decided on the latter; that was the role they had assigned him\u2014towatch and wait and keep out of things\u2014and that was the role he wouldplay.     You knew all the time and you didn't tell us! Raymond spluttered.After we'd been so good to you, making a gentleman out of you insteadof a criminal.... That's right, he snarled, a criminal! An alcoholic,a thief, a derelict! How do you like that?     Sounds like a rich, full life, Martin said wistfully.     What an exciting existence they must have done him out of! But then, hecouldn't help thinking, he\u2014he and Conrad together, of course\u2014had donethem out of      any     kind of existence. It wasn't his responsibility,though; he had done nothing but let matters take whatever course wasdestined for them. If only he could be sure that it was the bettercourse, perhaps he wouldn't feel that nagging sense of guilt insidehim. Strange\u2014where, in his hermetic life, could he possibly havedeveloped such a queer thing as a conscience?     Then we've wasted all this time, Ninian sobbed, all this energy, allthis money, for nothing!     But you were nothing to begin with, Martin told them. And then,after a pause, he added, I only wish I could be sure there had beensome purpose to this.     He didn't know whether it was approaching death that dimmed his sight,or whether the frightened crowd that pressed around him was growingshadowy.     I wish I could feel that some good had been done in letting you bewiped out of existence, he went on voicing his thoughts. But I knowthat the same thing that happened to your worlds and my world willhappen all over again. To other people, in other times, but again. It'sbound to happen. There isn't any hope for humanity.     One man couldn't really change the course of human history, he toldhimself. Two men, that was\u2014one real, one a shadow.     Conrad came close to the old man's bed. He was almost transparent.     No, he said, there is hope. They didn't know the time transmitterworks two ways. I used it for going into the past only once\u2014just thisonce. But I've gone into the future with it many times. And\u2014 hepressed Martin's hand\u2014believe me, what I did\u2014what      we     did, you andI\u2014serves a purpose. It will change things for the better. Everythingis going to be all right.   <doc-sep> Grampa knitted his bushy, white eyebrows and petulantly pushed the lastbutton on his pircuit. The last light went out. You've got work todo, have you? Whose flivver do you think this is, anyhow?     It belongs to all of us, Four said shrilly. You gave us all a sixthshare.     That's right, Four, Grampa muttered, so I did. But whose moneybought it?     You bought it, Grampa, Fred said.     That's right! And who invented the gravity polarizer and the spaceflivver? Eh? Who made possible this gallivanting all over space?     You, Grampa, Fred said.     You bet! And who made one hundred million dollars out of it that therest of you vultures are just hanging around to gobble up when I die?     And who spent it all trying to invent perpetual motion machines andlongevity pills, Joyce said bitterly, and fixed it so we'd have togo searching for uranium and habitable worlds all through this deadlygalaxy? You, Grampa!     Well, now, Grampa protested, I got a little put away yet. You'll besorry when I'm dead and gone.     You're never going to die, Grampa, Joyce said harshly. Justbefore we left, you bought a hundred-year contract with thatLife-Begins-At-Ninety longevity company.     Well, now, said Grampa, blinking, how'd you find out about that?Well, now! In confusion, he turned back to the pircuit and jabbed abutton. Thirteen slim lights sprang on. I'll get you this time!     Four stretched and stood up. He looked curiously into the corner by thecomputer where Grampa's chair stood. You brought that pircuit fromEarth, didn't you? What's the game?     Grampa looked up, obviously relieved to drop his act of intenseconcentration. I'll tell you, boy. You play against the pircuit,taking turns, and you can put out one, two or three lights. The playerwho makes the other one turn out the last light is the winner.     That's simple, Four said without hesitation. The winning strategy isto\u2014     Don't be a kibitzer! Grampa snapped. When I need help, I'll askfor it. No dad-blamed machine is gonna outthink Grampa! He snortedindignantly.  "

        "Query": "What is Joyce's part in The Gravity Business?",
        "Summary_1": "Joyce is Junior\u2019s mother and Fred\u2019s wife and is nearly sixty years old; she is still in good shape: slender, elegant, and attractive. However, she is described as having ice water instead of blood in her veins because she is such a cold-hearted woman much of the time. Joyce creates most of the tension in the story; she is frequently at odds with Grampa and says whatever she thinks, no matter how rude or hurtful it is. She presents as a spoiled, self-centered woman who only wants lots of money. Grampa\u2019s inventions made him a multimillionaire, but she accuses him of wasting the money on new inventions and making it so that they had to travel the galaxy searching for uranium and other habitable worlds. When Grampa tells her he has set some money aside and she\u2019ll be sorry when he\u2019s dead, she responds that he\u2019ll never die. And she knows he bought a hundred-year contract with the Life-Begins-At-Ninety longevity company. Joyce is eager to get her hands on some of Grampa\u2019s money and resents that he is using some of it to carry out his research. When Four brings Fweep aboard the flivver, she is thoroughly disgusted and insists he take it back out; when Reba stands up for Four and Fweep and calls Joyce Grammy, Joyce is furious and goes into her private room. Later, she even tries to poison Fweep by leaving rat poison on the floor. When the men return from checking Fweepland for heavy metals or radioactive elements, she eagerly comes out of her room and immediately asks if they had found any uranium, radium, or thorium. Their negative answer again draws her ire and shows her greed. She complains to Fred that they are all supposed to get filthy rich finding radioactives and retire on Earth as billionaires. She resents the year they have spent looking for radioactives. When she learns that Fweep is the reason they can\u2019t leave the planet, her first reaction is to kill him, and when she learns that killing him isn\u2019t possible, she readily and seriously agrees to Grampa\u2019s joke that they should leave Four behind so the rest of them can leave. Again, Joyce only wants what is best for her, and she is ready to kill or abandon anyone who stands in her way.",
        "Summary_2": "Joyce is the mother of Junior, an almost-60-year old woman who is very cold and bitter in most of her interactions with the rest of the family. She constantly berates Grampa for how he spends his money and what he may or may not understand about science, especially the polarizer. She is appalled when she encounters Fweep for the first time, but Reba stands up for Four and Fweep and reminds Joyce that she can always go to her room to stay away from it. Joyce just wanted to gain money by finding radioactive material on their journey, but getting rich seems to be her only goal so she is not entertained by the interesting distractions that the rest of the crew find endearing or curious. She makes fun of Grampa for happening upon the right configuration to build a successful polarizer and says his skill and scientific knowledge had nothing to do with his \"accidental\" success. Joyce is the only one who is potentially serious about leaving Four behind on the planet in return for the ability to leave, and people do not usually stand up to her--when Reba stands up for Four's right to have Fweep as a friend, the rest of the family is surprised, and even in awe. Joyce even tries to poison Fweep by leaving out rat poison before she learns that he cannot be affected by it. In general, she is angry or hysterical and is always antagonistic, and acts as the main source of conflict in the family. ",
        "Summary_3": "Joyce is Grampa\u2019s wife and Four\u2019s grandmother, but she refuses to be called by that name. Although she is almost sixty years old, she is still thin and beautiful. However, she is also very difficult to get along with. She openly blames her husband for spending all of their money and essentially ruining their lives, and she tells the rest of the family members his secret about purchasing some type of contract that will extend his life. When Grampa tries to explain how the polarizer works, Joyce immediately pipes up and tells everyone that he is just a tinkerer and has no idea what he\u2019s talking about. Despite the fact that he invented the polarizer and the flivver they are using to travel, she gives him zero credit. Joyce hates living on the flivver and traveling to all sorts of different planets to search for heavy metals. She would much rather be on Earth. When she meets Fweep, she is disgusted and wants him as far away as possible. After she finds out that Fweep is the reason the ship is stuck on the unknown planet, she actually tries to feed the alien rat poison, but it doesn\u2019t work. Joyce would most likely leave Four, a young child, behind to fend for himself on a planet he\u2019s never before visited, but her daughter-in-law Reba will not allow the family to take off without Four. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Joyce is Fred\u2019s wife and prone to tantrums. She is often upset when things don\u2019t go her way and more blunt than may be considered socially acceptable. For example, she is the first to suggest that they leave Four behind so the rest can escape, much to Reba\u2019s horror. As well, she\u2019s upset when Fweep is first introduced to the family circle, especially since his presence forces her to retreat. Joyce often causes conflict, tension, and drama throughout the story with her survivalist attitude and unfortunately unpleasant attitude.  ",
        "Article": "Reba looked at Fweep kindly. We can thank the little fellow for that,anyway.     I thank him for nothing, Joyce snapped. He lured us down here bymaking us think the planet had heavy metals and I want him to let us go      immediately     !     Fred turned impatiently on his wife. Well, try making him understand!And if you can make him understand what you want him to do, try makinghim do it!     Joyce looked at Fred with startled eyes. Fred! she said in a high,shocked voice and turned blindly toward her room.     Grampa lowered his bottle and smacked his lips. Well, boy, he said toFred, I thought you'd never do that. Didn't think you had it in you.     Fred stood up apologetically. I'd better go calm her down, hemuttered, and walked quickly after Joyce.     Give her one for me! Grampa called.     Fred's shoulders twitched as the door closed behind him. From the roomcame the filtered sound of high-pitched voices rising and falling likesome reedy folk music.     Makes you think, doesn't it? Grampa said, looking at Fweep benignly.Maybe the whole theory of gravitation is cockeyed. Maybe there's aFweep for every planet and sun, big and little, polarizing the gravityin circles, and the matter business is not a cause but a result.     What I can't understand, Junior said thoughtfully, is why thepolarizer worked for a little while when we landed\u2014long enough to keepus from being squashed\u2014and then quit.     Fweep didn't recognize it immediately, didn't know what it was orwhere it came from, Four explained. All he knew was he didn't likelinear polarization and he neutralized it as soon as he could. That'swhen we dropped.   <doc-sep> He cleared his throat professorially. Well, now, in ordinary lightthe vibrations are perpendicular to the ray in all directions. Whenlight is polarized by passing through crystals or by reflection orrefraction at non-metallic surfaces, the paths of the vibrations arestill perpendicular to the ray, but they're in straight lines, circlesor ellipses.     The faces were still blank and unillumined.     Gravity is similar to light, he pressed on. In the absence ofmatter, gravity is non-polarized. Matter polarizes gravity in a circlearound itself. That's how we've always known it until the invention ofspaceships and later the polarizer. The polarizer polarizes gravityinto a straight line. That makes the ship take off and continueaccelerating until the polarizer is shut off or its angle is shifted.     The faces looked at him silently. Finally Joyce could endure it nolonger. That's just nonsense! You all know it. Grampa's no genius.He's just a tinkerer. One day he happened to tinker out the polarizer.He doesn't know how it works any more than I do.     Now wait a minute! Grampa protested. That's not fair. MaybeI didn't figure out the theory myself, but I read everything thescientists ever wrote about it. Wanted to know myself what made theblamed thing work. What I told you is what the scientists said, nearas I remember. Now me\u2014I'm like Edison. I do it and let everybody elseworry over 'why.'     The only thing you ever did was the polarizer, Joyce snapped.And then you spent everything you got from it on those foolperpetual-motion machines and those crazy longevity schemes when anymoron would know they were impossible.     Grampa squinted at her sagely. That's what they said about the gravitypolarizer before I invented it.     But you don't really know why it works, Junior persisted.     Well, no, Grampa admitted. Actually I was just fiddling around withsome coils when one of them took off. Went right through the ceiling,dragging a battery behind it. I guess it's still going. Ought to be outnear the Horsehead Nebula by now. Luckily, I remembered how I'd woundit.     Why won't the ship work then, if you know so much? Joyce demandedironically.     Well, now, Grampa said in bafflement, it rightly should, you know.   <doc-sep> We're stuck, Reba said softly. We might as well admit it. All we cando is set the transmitter to send out an automatic distress call\u2014     Which, Joyce interrupted, might get picked up in a few centuries.     And make the best of what we've got, Reba went on, unheeding. If welook at it the right way, it's quite a lot. A beautiful, fertile world.Earth gravity. The flivver\u2014even if the polarizer won't work, there'sthe resynthesizer; it will keep us in food and clothes for years. Bythen, we should have a good-sized community built up, because out herewe won't have to stop with one child. We can have all the babies wewant.     You know the law: one child per couple, Joyce reminded her frigidly.You can condemn yourself to exile from civilization if you wish. Notme.     Junior frowned at his wife. I believe you're actually glad ithappened.     I could think of worse things, Reba said.     I like your spunk, Reb, Grampa muttered.     Speaking of children, Junior said, where's Four?     Here. Four came through the airlock and trudged across the room,carrying a curious contraption made of tripod legs supporting asmall box from which dangled a plumb bob. Behind Four, like a round,raspberry shadow, rolled Fweep.     Fweep? it queried hopefully.     Not now, said Four.     Where've you been? Reba asked anxiously. What've you been doing?     I've been all over Fweepland, Four said wearily, trying to locateits center of gravity.     Well? Fred prompted.     It shifts.     That's impossible, said Junior.     Not for Fweep, Four replied.     What do you mean by that? Joyce suspiciously asked.     It shifted, Four explained patiently, because Fweep kept followingme.     Fweep? Junior repeated stupidly.     Fweep? Fweep said eagerly.     He's why the flivver won't work. What Grampa invented was a linearpolarizer. Fweep is a circular polarizer. He's what makes this planetso heavy. He's why we can't leave.  "

        "Query": "What is the storyline of THE SPY IN THE ELEVATOR?",
        "Summary_1": "      It was one of those days when everything that could go wrong, goes wrong. Edmund Rice, the main character, has decided to propose to his girlfriend, Linda on the day when the story takes place, but at breakfast, he broke his egg yolk; he had a stuck zipper; he had feedback in the aircon exhaust; and his window stuck at full transparency. On top of all that, the elevator is late. Edmund\u2019s girlfriend is a dispatcher for ore-sled robots; when one doesn\u2019t return on time, they know that the robot has been been captured and therefore blown itself up. As a result, Linda is a real stickler for punctuality because if Edmund is late, as he was once before, she goes into hysterics thinking that something horrible has happened to him. \n     When the elevator doesn\u2019t come, Edmund goes back to his apartment to call Linda to let her know why he will be late, but she has set her phone not to accept calls since she was expecting Edmund to come propose to her. Edmund decides to complain to the Transit Staff, who give him the official statement that the elevator is disconnected, but when Edmund explains that the late elevator is ruining his life, the operator takes pity on him and secretly tells him there is a spy on the elevator who won\u2019t get off, and the Army might have to starve him to make him exit. Finally, at 10:15, Edmund thinks of taking the stairs, but when he does, the spy intercepts him, forcing him at gunpoint back to Edmund\u2019s apartment. At this point, Edmund gives up on reaching Linda.\n     The spy tells Edmund he doesn\u2019t want to hurt him and begins a conversation, asking what Edmund does for a living. Because Edmund doesn\u2019t want the spy to know that he teaches gymnastics and knows wrestling, judo, and karati, he lies and tells him he is an ore-sled operator, figuring he can pull off the ruse since he knows a lot about Linda\u2019s job. This piques the spy\u2019s interest, and he asks what Edmund knows about the radiation level of the ore-sleds when they return. Edmund says they don\u2019t check for radiation before de-radiating the sled; there\u2019s no point. The spy is irritated that Edmund doesn\u2019t even care about the radiation level outside the Project and compares the Projects to caves. \nThe spy goes on to tell Edmund he isn\u2019t a spy, that he is an atomic engineer from a Project 80 miles north. He traveled to Edmund\u2019s Project on foot without any kind of radiation shield to prove that the radiation level is so low that it is safe for people to leaves the Projects. He is trying to get the word out, but people don\u2019t believe him because their Commissions tell them the radiation level is still high and that it isn\u2019t safe to go outside. Edmund thinks the man is a lunatic and doesn\u2019t believe any of the ludicrous claims he makes.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Edmund Rice lives in one of the Projects and has finally decided to propose to his girlfriend for a Non-P marriage. He set the time with her before, 10 o\u2019clock sharp, and prepared himself that morning. He steps outside his apartment with a few minutes to spare but soon realizes that the elevator isn\u2019t working. He waits for a minute or two, starting to freak out, then rushes inside to call Linda and warn her. She hates tardiness because of her job as an ore-sled dispatcher, and he didn\u2019t want to upset her on the big day. Her landline was disconnected for privacy\u2019s sake, so he couldn\u2019t let her know. He runs back to the elevator and keeps trying, but to no avail. Officially late, he goes back to his apartment and calls the Transit Staff. A young woman picks up and robotically tells him that the elevator will be back in service soon. He yells at her, eventually explaining why she has ruined his life, and she responds sympathetically, clearly a romantic. She leans forward and tells him the truth: there\u2019s a spy in the elevator. He is in shock, but she explains the whole situation and how they\u2019re worried they\u2019ll have to starve him out. Finished, she hangs up, and Edmund runs back to the elevator in the hopes that they successfully removed him. \nHe is saddened to find it still not working, so he decides to take the stairs, which no one does. A few landings down, he sees a door with faint lettering on it, explaining that this once led to the elevator shaft. He wonders briefly why no one is guarding it, and then suddenly the spy comes out of the door. The spy holds a gun up to his head and tells him to stay quiet and take him back to his room. They return to the 153rd floor, and Edmund harbors him in his apartment. The spy asks for a cup of Chico coffee, which saddens Edmund as he only gets two cups a day. Edmund lies about his identity and pretends he\u2019s an ore-sled dispatcher, like Linda. He is, in fact, a gymnast instructor with martial arts abilities, but he wants to have the advantage of surprise should the situation take a violent turn. \nThey chat while Edmund makes him the coffee, and the spy grows agitated and manic. He tries to explain to Edmund that he\u2019s not really a spy. He actually came from another Project 80 miles away on foot. He is the proof that the radiation levels outside have dramatically decreased, making it safe for humans to go outside again. However, the Commission doesn\u2019t want the world to know that as then they would quickly go out of business. The spy reveals he\u2019s an atomic engineer, and the story ends on a slight cliffhanger. \n",
        "Summary_3": "In the years following World War III, atomic radiation and rapid population growth had led nations to develop vertically rather than horizontally, and people lived together in massive high-rises called Projects where they could live, work, and play while never having to go Outside and face the dangers of radiation. Only ore-sleds and spies leave the buildings--the ore-sleds to gather essential raw materials impossible to produce in the Projects, and the spies to visit other Projects to learn about potential attacks on their home Project. Edmund Rice is a gymnast instructor who lives on the hundred fifty-third floor of one of these Projects. He plans to propose Non-Permanent marriage to his girlfriend Linda, who is an ore-sled dispatcher obsessed with punctuality. The morning of his planned proposal, set for 10:00 sharp, Edmund goes to the elevator to travel down to Linda's hundred fortieth floor and discovers the elevator is unresponsive. He continues pressing the button to no avail. He runs back to his apartment to alert Linda and discovers her phone has a \"privacy disconnection\" notice, probably placed because Linda expected Edmund's proposal. When the elevator continuously fails to arrive, Edmund calls the Transit Staff to inquire what is going wrong. The staff person informs him that a spy has penetrated the Project force-screen and is barricading himself in the elevator. Using manual controls, the spy wields the elevator like a projectile weapon against any soldier that approaches. Stunned, Edmund makes a last-ditch effort to reach Linda. He uses the stairs, an option he hasn't taken since he was a young child. A few flights down, he sees an emergency exit from the elevator, and the spy emerges from it. The spy holds him at gun point and leads him back to his apartment, where the two men share a coffee. The spy reveals he is not a spy at all; rather, he is a trained atomic engineer who claims radiation levels have reduced to such an extent that people may now safely venture Outside. The reason this is not common knowledge is because the Commission suppresses the truth so that is may keep making money from the continued operation of the Projects.",
        "Summary_4": "Some time after the year 2100, humans live in vertical buildings called Projects that are completely isolated from each other and nations unto themselves. Decades ago, the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War involved so much atomic bombing that the radiation levels outside are said to be too unsafe for humans. The Projects are all suspicious of each other, supposedly sending spies out to see whether attacks are being planned. There hasn\u2019t been an attack in decades, and the external threats largely just exist as fears in the minds of the people.\nEdmund Rice leaves his 153rd floor apartment in his Project at five minutes to ten to propose to an ore-sled dispatcher who lives on the 144th floor that he is deeply in love with named Linda. He plans to propose a Non-P marriage (Non-Permanent, No Progeny) since neither of them are genetically desirable enough to have children in their society, and he knows that Linda wants to keep her independence. The ten o\u2019clock time of the appointment is significant because Linda is so punctual that Edmund believes she will not marry him if he is late. However, the elevator is not working and does not respond to pressing the button and kicking the door. Becoming frantic, he runs back to his apartment and calls Linda, but she does not answer. She likely disconnected her phone because she wanted to have no interruptions when Edmund arrived. He furiously calls the Transit Staff to file a complaint, and tells the woman that his life has been ruined. She feels bad for him and tells him secret information that there is a spy in the elevator and that the Army thinks they may have to starve him out. Edmund then realizes he can take an ancient thing called the stairs. He rushes to the staircase even though it is already quarter past ten and races down. He spots a door to the elevator shaft on the landing between the 150th and 149th floors, and a man -the spy- bursts out of it. The spy uses a gun to threaten Edmund and forces him to take them both back to hide in Edmund\u2019s apartment to lose the Army that had been racing up the stairs behind them. In the apartment, the spy asks Edmund to make him a cup of coffee and begins a conversation, acting like a maniac in Edmund\u2019s perception at times. The spy reveals he is an atomic engineer who worked on the reactor in his own Project. He calculated that the radiation from the war decades ago must have subsided, and it would be safe for humans to leave the Projects and resume progress on other advances like space travel. The Commission would not let him test the theory, so he risked his life by traveling outside to determine if it was indeed true. His survival of the crossing is proof that the radiation is low enough for humans to survive outside, and Edmund can hardly believe what he is hearing.",
        "Article": "But now there was a spy in the elevator.     When I thought of how deeply he had penetrated our defenses, and of howmany others there might be, still penetrating, I shuddered. The wallswere our safeguards only so long as all potential enemies were on theother side of them.     I sat shaken, digesting this news, until suddenly I remembered Linda.     I leaped to my feet, reading from my watch that it was now ten-fifteen.I dashed once more from the apartment and down the hall to theelevator, praying that the spy had been captured by now and that Lindawould agree with me that a spy in the elevator was good and sufficientreason for me to be late.     He was still there. At least, the elevator was still out.     I sagged against the wall, thinking dismal thoughts. Then I noticed thedoor to the right of the elevator. Through that door was the stairway.     I hadn't paid any attention to it before. No one ever uses the stairsexcept adventurous young boys playing cops and robbers, running up anddown from landing to landing. I myself hadn't set foot on a flight ofstairs since I was twelve years old.     Actually, the whole idea of stairs was ridiculous. We had elevators,didn't we? Usually, I mean, when they didn't contain spies. So what wasthe use of stairs?     Well, according to Dr. Kilbillie (a walking library of unnecessaryinformation), the Project had been built when there still had been suchthings as municipal governments (something to do with cities, whichwere more or less grouped Projects), and the local municipal governmenthad had on its books a fire ordinance, anachronistic even then, whichrequired a complete set of stairs in every building constructed in thecity. Ergo, the Project had stairs, thirty-two hundred of them.     And now, after all these years, the stairs might prove useful afterall. It was only thirteen flights to Linda's floor. At sixteen steps aflight, that meant two hundred and eight steps.     Could I descend two hundred and eight steps for my true love? I could.If the door would open.     It would, though reluctantly. Who knew how many years it had been sincelast this door had been opened? It squeaked and wailed and groaned andfinally opened half way. I stepped through to the musty, dusty landing,took a deep breath, and started down. Eight steps and a landing, eightsteps and a floor. Eight steps and a landing, eight steps and a floor.     On the landing between one fifty and one forty-nine, there was asmallish door. I paused, looking curiously at it, and saw that at onetime letters had been painted on it. The letters had long since flakedaway, but they left a lighter residue of dust than that which coveredthe rest of the door. And so the words could still be read, if withdifficulty.     I read them. They said:     EMERGENCY ENTRANCE     ELEVATOR SHAFT     AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL     ONLY     KEEP LOCKED     I frowned, wondering immediately why this door wasn't being firmlyguarded by at least a platoon of Army men. Half a dozen possibleanswers flashed through my mind. The more recent maps might simplyhave omitted this discarded and unnecessary door. It might be sealedshut on the other side. The Army might have caught the spy already.Somebody in authority might simply have goofed.     As I stood there, pondering these possibilities, the door opened andthe spy came out, waving a gun.      III     He couldn't have been anyone else but the spy. The gun, in the firstplace. The fact that he looked harried and upset and terribly nervous,in the second place. And, of course, the fact that he came from theelevator shaft.     Looking back, I think he must have been just as startled as I when wecame face to face like that. We formed a brief tableau, both of usopen-mouthed and wide-eyed.     Unfortunately, he recovered first.     He closed the emergency door behind him, quickly but quietly. His gunstopped waving around and instead pointed directly at my middle. Don'tmove! he whispered harshly. Don't make a sound!     I did exactly as I was told. I didn't move and I didn't make a sound.Which left me quite free to study him.     He was rather short, perhaps three inches shorter than me, with a bonyhigh-cheekboned face featuring deepset eyes and a thin-lipped mouth. Hewore gray slacks and shirt, with brown slippers on his feet. He lookedexactly like a spy ... which is to say that he      didn't     look like aspy, he looked overpoweringly ordinary. More than anything else, hereminded me of a rather taciturn milkman who used to make deliveries tomy parents' apartment.     His gaze darted this way and that. Then he motioned with his free handat the descending stairs and whispered, Where do they go?     I had to clear my throat before I could speak. All the way down, Isaid.     Good, he said\u2014just as we both heard a sudden raucous squealing fromperhaps four flights down, a squealing which could be nothing but theopening of a hall door. It was followed by the heavy thud of ascendingboots. The Army!     But if I had any visions of imminent rescue, the spy dashed them. Hesaid, Where do you live?     One fifty-three, I said. This was a desperate and dangerous man.I knew my only slim chance of safety lay in answering his questionspromptly, cooperating with him until and unless I saw a chance toeither escape or capture him.     All right, he whispered. Go on. He prodded me with the gun.     And so we went back up the stairs to one fifty-three, and stopped atthe door. He stood close behind me, the gun pressed against my back,and grated in my ear, I'll have this gun in my pocket. If you make onefalse move I'll kill you. Now, we're going to your apartment. We'refriends, just strolling along together. You got that?     I nodded.     All right. Let's go.     We went. I have never in my life seen that long hall quite so empty asit was right then. No one came out of any of the apartments, no oneemerged from any of the branch halls. We walked to my apartment. Ithumbed the door open and we went inside.     Once the door was closed behind us, he visibly relaxed, sagging againstthe door, his gun hand hanging limp at his side, a nervous smileplaying across his lips.     I looked at him, judging the distance between us, wondering if I couldleap at him before he could bring the gun up again. But he must haveread my intentions on my face. He straightened, shaking his head. Hesaid, Don't try it. I don't want to kill you. I don't want to killanybody, but I will if I have to. We'll just wait here together untilthe hue and cry passes us. Then I'll tie you up, so you won't be ableto sic your Army on me too soon, and I'll leave. If you don't try anysilly heroics, nothing will happen to you.     You'll never get away, I told him. The whole Project is alerted.     You let me worry about that, he said. He licked his lips. You gotany chico coffee?     Yes.     Make me a cup. And don't get any bright ideas about dousing me withboiling water.     I only have my day's allotment, I protested. Just enough for twocups, lunch and dinner.     Two cups is fine, he said. One for each of us.   <doc-sep> It took three tries before I got through to a hurried-looking femalereceptionist My name is Rice! I bellowed. Edmund Rice! I live on thehundred and fifty-third floor! I just rang for the elevator and\u2014\u2014     The-elevator-is-disconnected. She said it very rapidly, as though shewere growing very used to saying it.     It only stopped me for a second. Disconnected? What do you meandisconnected? Elevators don't      get     disconnected! I told her.     We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible, she rattled. My bellowingwas bouncing off her like radiation off the Project force-screen.     I changed tactics. First I inhaled, making a production out of it,giving myself a chance to calm down a bit. And then I asked, asrationally as you could please, Would you mind terribly telling me      why     the elevator is disconnected?     I-am-sorry-sir-but-that\u2014\u2014     Stop, I said. I said it quietly, too, but she stopped. I saw herlooking at me. She hadn't done that before, she'd merely gazed blanklyat her screen and parroted her responses.     But now she was actually looking at      me     .     I took advantage of the fact. Calmly, rationally, I said to her, Iwould like to tell you something, Miss. I would like to tell you justwhat you people have done to me by disconnecting the elevator. You haveruined my life.     She blinked, open-mouthed. Ruined your life?     Precisely. I found it necessary to inhale again, even more slowlythan before. I was on my way, I explained, to propose to a girl whomI dearly love. In every way but one, she is the perfect woman. Do youunderstand me?     She nodded, wide-eyed. I had stumbled on a romantic, though I was toopreoccupied to notice it at the time.     In every way but one, I continued. She has one small imperfection,a fixation about punctuality. And I was supposed to meet her at teno'clock.      I'm late!      I shook my fist at the screen. Do you realizewhat you've      done     , disconnecting the elevator? Not only won't shemarry me, she won't even      speak     to me! Not now! Not after this!     Sir, she said tremulously, please don't shout.     I'm not shouting!     Sir, I'm terribly sorry. I understand your\u2014     You      understand     ? I trembled with speechless fury.     She looked all about her, and then leaned closer to the screen,revealing a cleavage that I was too distraught at the moment to payany attention to. We're not supposed to give this information out,sir, she said, her voice low, but I'm going to tell you, so you'llunderstand why we had to do it. I think it's perfectly awful that ithad to ruin things for you this way. But the fact of the matter is\u2014she leaned even closer to the screen\u2014there's a spy in the elevator.      II     It was my turn to be stunned.     I just gaped at her. A\u2014a what?     A spy. He was discovered on the hundred forty-seventh floor, andmanaged to get into the elevator before the Army could catch him. Hejammed it between floors. But the Army is doing everything it can thinkof to get him out.     Well\u2014but why should there be any problem about getting him out?     He plugged in the manual controls. We can't control the elevator fromoutside at all. And when anyone tries to get into the shaft, he aimsthe elevator at them.     That sounded impossible. He      aims     the elevator?     He runs it up and down the shaft, she explained, trying to crushanybody who goes after him.     Oh, I said. So it might take a while.     She leaned so close this time that even I, distracted as I was, couldhardly help but take note of her cleavage. She whispered, They'reafraid they'll have to starve him out.     Oh, no!     She nodded solemnly. I'm terribly sorry, sir, she said. Then sheglanced to her right, suddenly straightened up again, and said,We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible. Click. Blank screen.     For a minute or two, all I could do was sit and absorb what I'd beentold. A spy in the elevator! A spy who had managed to work his way allthe way up to the hundred forty-seventh floor before being unmasked!     What in the world was the matter with the Army? If things were gettingthat lax, the Project was doomed, force-screen or no. Who knew how manymore spies there were in the Project, still unsuspected?     Until that moment, the state of siege in which we all lived had hadno reality for me. The Project, after all, was self-sufficient andcompletely enclosed. No one ever left, no one ever entered. Under ourroof, we were a nation, two hundred stories high. The ever-presentthreat of other projects had never been more for me\u2014or for most otherpeople either, I suspected\u2014than occasional ore-sleds that didn'treturn, occasional spies shot down as they tried to sneak into thebuilding, occasional spies of our own leaving the Project in tinyradiation-proof cars, hoping to get safely within another project andbring back news of any immediate threats and dangers that project mightbe planning for us. Most spies didn't return; most ore-sleds did. Andwithin the Project life was full, the knowledge of external dangersmerely lurking at the backs of our minds. After all, those externaldangers had been no more than potential for decades, since what Dr.Kilbillie called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War.     Dr. Kilbillie\u2014Intermediate Project History, when I was fifteen yearsold\u2014had private names for every major war of the twentieth century.There was the Ignoble Nobleman's War, the Racial Non-Racial War, andthe Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, known to the textbooks of course asWorld Wars One, Two, and Three.     The rise of the Projects, according to Dr. Kilbillie, was the result ofmany many factors, but two of the most important were the populationexplosion and the Treaty of Oslo. The population explosion, of course,meant that there was continuously more and more people but never anymore space. So that housing, in the historically short time of onecentury, made a complete transformation from horizontal expansion tovertical. Before 1900, the vast majority of human beings lived intiny huts of from one to five stories. By 2000,      everybody     lived inProjects. From the very beginning, small attempts were made to makethese Projects more than dwelling places. By mid-century, Projects(also called apartments and co-ops) already included restaurants,shopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners and a host ofother adjuncts. By the end of the century, the Projects were completelyself-sufficient, with food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements,separate floors set aside for schools and churches and factories, robotore-sleds capable of seeking out raw materials unavailable within theProjects themselves and so on. And all because of, among other things,the population explosion.     And the Treaty of Oslo.     It seems there was a power-struggle between two sets of then-existingnations (they were something like Projects, only horizontal instead ofvertical) and both sets were equipped with atomic weapons. The Treatyof Oslo began by stating that atomic war was unthinkable, and addedthat just in case anyone happened to think of it only      tactical     atomicweapons could be used. No      strategic     atomic weapons. (A tacticalweapon is something you use on the soldiers, and a strategic weapons issomething you use on the folks at home.) Oddly enough, when somebodydid think of the war, both sides adhered to the Treaty of Oslo, whichmeant that no Projects were bombed.     Of course, they made up for this as best they could by using tacticalatomic weapons all over the place. After the war almost the wholeworld was quite dangerously radioactive. Except for the Projects. Orat least those of them which had in time installed the force screenswhich had been invented on the very eve of battle, and which deflectedradioactive particles.     However, what with all of the      other     treaties which were broken duringthe Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, by the time it was finished nobodywas quite sure any more who was on whose side. That project over thereon the horizon might be an ally. And then again it might not. Sincethey weren't sure either, it was risky to expose yourself in order toask.     And so life went on, with little to remind us of the dangers lurkingOutside. The basic policy of Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparednesswas left to the Army. The rest of us simply lived our lives and let itgo at that.   <doc-sep>    THE SPY IN THE ELEVATOR     By DONALD E.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]         He was dangerously insane. He threatened       to destroy everything that was noble and       decent\u2014including my date with my girl!        When the elevator didn't come, that just made the day perfect. A brokenegg yolk, a stuck zipper, a feedback in the aircon exhaust, the windowsticking at full transparency\u2014well, I won't go through the whole sorrylist. Suffice it to say that when the elevator didn't come, that putthe roof on the city, as they say.     It was just one of those days. Everybody gets them. Days when you'relucky in you make it to nightfall with no bones broken.     But of all times for it to happen! For literally months I'd beenbuilding my courage up. And finally, just today, I had made up mymind to do it\u2014to propose to Linda. I'd called her second thing thismorning\u2014right after the egg yolk\u2014and invited myself down to herplace. Ten o'clock, she'd said, smiling sweetly at me out of thephone. She knew why I wanted to talk to her. And when Linda said teno'clock, she meant ten o'clock.     Don't get me wrong. I don't mean that Linda's a perfectionist or aharridan or anything like that. Far from it. But she does have afixation on that one subject of punctuality. The result of her job,of course. She was an ore-sled dispatcher. Ore-sleds, being robots,were invariably punctual. If an ore-sled didn't return on time, no onewaited for it. They simply knew that it had been captured by some otherProject and had blown itself up.     Well, of course, after working as an ore-sled dispatcher for threeyears, Linda quite naturally was a bit obsessed. I remember one time,shortly after we'd started dating, when I arrived at her place fiveminutes late and found her having hysterics. She thought I'd beenkilled. She couldn't visualize anything less than that keeping me fromarriving at the designated moment. When I told her what actually hadhappened\u2014I'd broken a shoe lace\u2014she refused to speak to me for fourdays.     And then the elevator didn't come.  "

    {
        "Query": "What role does Linda play in THE SPY IN THE ELEVATOR?",
        "Summary_1": "     Linda is the woman to whom Edmund intends to propose. She is the reason Edmund is trying to get on the elevator and why he ultimately decides to take the stairs, leading him to meet the spy. Linda\u2019s job as an ore-sled operator has left her high-strung when it comes to punctuality. She sends robots out with ore-sleds, and when they don\u2019t return on time, they know that the robot has been captured and has blown itself up to prevent other Projects from learning their technology secrets. Once when Edmund was late for a date with her, Linda worked herself into hysterics, and when he did show up, she refused to speak to Edmund for four days. \n\tEdmund has spent months building up the courage to propose to Linda, and the day he plans to do it, everything goes awry, making him run late. But he still reaches the elevator in time to reach Linda\u2019s place thirteen stories below his level on time, except the elevator doesn\u2019t come. The longer he waits for the elevator car, the more anxious Edmund grows, knowing that Linda will be so upset if he is late he won\u2019t get to propose.\n\tEdmund loves Linda and would like to have a permanent marriage, but he realizes that Linda enjoys her freedom and independence too much to agree to a permanent marriage. Edmund will settle for a Non-P marriage with her: Non-Permanent, No Progeny. \n\tLinda anticipates Edmund\u2019s proposal when he calls that morning to invite himself to her apartment. He can tell by her smile on the phone. In preparation for the proposal, Linda has set her phone to PRIVACY DISCONNECTION to prevent their proposal from being interrupted, but this also means that Edmund cannot reach her to let her know he is running late and why. Edmund is convinced that she won\u2019t speak to him again after being late for the proposal and certainly will not accept his proposal. In a last-ditch effort to reach Linda, Edmund decides he can take 208 stairs to reach her, even though he hasn\u2019t taken the stairs since he was 12 years old. This decision, of course, puts him in the path to run into the spy.\n\tFinally, Linda\u2019s job helps Edmund believe he can overtake the spy if he can catch him off guard. Edmund knows enough about her job to talk about it with the spy, keeping his knowledge of wrestling, judo, and karate secret until he can make his move.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Linda is Edmund Rice\u2019s fiance\u00e9-to-be and current girlfriend. They have been together presumably for quite some time, as he knows quite a bit about her. Her one flaw, as he likes to say, is her absolute adherence to punctuality. Edmund recalls when he was late to meet her by a few minutes, and she broke down in tears thinking he had died. Her adherence comes from her job as an ore-sled dispatcher; when an ore-sled doesn\u2019t return, it means the sled has been captured or destroyed. Linda is a very independent woman and, according to Edmund, would never into a long-term marriage, only a Non-P marriage (Non-Permanent and No Progeny). \nLinda is significant to the story because she provides the basis for conflict. Edmund is on his way to propose to Linda when he realizes the elevator is stuck. He realizes he will be late and freaks out, which leads him on the path to running into the so-called spy. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Linda is Edmund Rice's girlfriend who works as an ore-dispatcher at the same Project where Edmund lives. She lives on Floor 140 while Edmund lives on 153, and he frequently visits her using the local elevator. Due to the nature of her work, Linda has developed an obsession with punctuality, and she cannot handle the smallest deviation from set appointment times. Once, she and Edmund had first started dating, Edmund arrived at her apartment five minutes late to find Linda in complete hysterics; she thought Edmund had been killed. When Edmund explained he had simply been late, she didn't speak to him for four days. This explains Edmund's panic when the elevator fails to arrive the morning he plans to propose to Linda at 10:00 precisely. Linda anticipates the proposal, so she switches her phone to \"privacy disconnection\" mode in order to prevent them from being disturbed when Edmunds pops the question. Although Edmund will not admit that he loves Linda in more than a Non-Permanent way, he understands that Linda cherishes her freedom and independence, so he plans for his proposal to be of the Non-Permanent, No Progeny variety.",
        "Summary_4": "Linda is an ore-sled dispatcher, and after three years working in the profession has become quite obsessed with punctuality. If the ore-sleds aren\u2019t on time, nobody waits for them. They are assumed to be blown up or captured by other Projects. She does not accept tardiness with ease, and once gave Edmund Rice the silent treatment for four days when he was late to meet her. She is in a relationship with Edmund, and expects that he will propose marriage to her when he tells her he has something important to talk about. \nShe is significant to the story because her punctuality places great stress on Edmund when he knows he will be late. This causes him to frantically panic when the elevator is not working, and resort to using the stairwell to attempt to meet with her before their relationship deteriorates beyond repair. Linda\u2019s reaction to tardiness is very strict, evidenced when Edmund describes to the Transit Staff when he files a complaint about the elevator that they have ruined his life and that Linda will no longer speak to him or even consider marrying him. Because Linda means so much to Edmund, he continues to try to get to her even when he knows he is over 15 minutes late. Trying the stairwell as his final effort to be with Linda causes him to run into the spy escaping the elevator shaft, which is the climax of the story. It is not revealed what happens between Linda and Edmund in the end.\n",
        "Article": "But now there was a spy in the elevator.     When I thought of how deeply he had penetrated our defenses, and of howmany others there might be, still penetrating, I shuddered. The wallswere our safeguards only so long as all potential enemies were on theother side of them.     I sat shaken, digesting this news, until suddenly I remembered Linda.     I leaped to my feet, reading from my watch that it was now ten-fifteen.I dashed once more from the apartment and down the hall to theelevator, praying that the spy had been captured by now and that Lindawould agree with me that a spy in the elevator was good and sufficientreason for me to be late.     He was still there. At least, the elevator was still out.     I sagged against the wall, thinking dismal thoughts. Then I noticed thedoor to the right of the elevator. Through that door was the stairway.     I hadn't paid any attention to it before. No one ever uses the stairsexcept adventurous young boys playing cops and robbers, running up anddown from landing to landing. I myself hadn't set foot on a flight ofstairs since I was twelve years old.     Actually, the whole idea of stairs was ridiculous. We had elevators,didn't we? Usually, I mean, when they didn't contain spies. So what wasthe use of stairs?

A brokenegg yolk, a stuck zipper, a feedback in the aircon exhaust, the windowsticking at full transparency\u2014well, I won't go through the whole sorrylist. Suffice it to say that when the elevator didn't come, that putthe roof on the city, as they say.     It was just one of those days. Everybody gets them. Days when you'relucky in you make it to nightfall with no bones broken.     But of all times for it to happen! For literally months I'd beenbuilding my courage up. And finally, just today, I had made up mymind to do it\u2014to propose to Linda. I'd called her second thing thismorning\u2014right after the egg yolk\u2014and invited myself down to herplace. Ten o'clock, she'd said, smiling sweetly at me out of thephone. She knew why I wanted to talk to her. And when Linda said teno'clock, she meant ten o'clock.     Don't get me wrong. I don't mean that Linda's a perfectionist or aharridan or anything like that. Far from it. But she does have afixation on that one subject of punctuality. The result of her job,of course. She was an ore-sled dispatcher. Ore-sleds, being robots,were invariably punctual. If an ore-sled didn't return on time, no onewaited for it. They simply knew that it had been captured by some otherProject and had blown itself up.     Well, of course, after working as an ore-sled dispatcher for threeyears, Linda quite naturally was a bit obsessed. I remember one time,shortly after we'd started dating, when I arrived at her place fiveminutes late and found her having hysterics. She thought I'd beenkilled. She couldn't visualize anything less than that keeping me fromarriving at the designated moment. When I told her what actually hadhappened\u2014I'd broken a shoe lace\u2014she refused to speak to me for fourdays.     And then the elevator didn't come.   <doc-sep> Until then, I'd managed somehow to keep the day's minor disasters fromruining my mood. Even while eating that horrible egg\u2014I couldn't verywell throw it away, broken yolk or no; it was my breakfast allotmentand I was hungry\u2014and while hurriedly jury-rigging drapery across thatgaspingly transparent window\u2014one hundred and fifty-three storiesstraight down to slag\u2014I kept going over and over my prepared proposalspeeches, trying to select the most effective one.     I had a Whimsical Approach: Honey, I see there's a nice littleNon-P apartment available up on one seventy-three. And I had aRomantic Approach: Darling, I can't live without you at the moment.Temporarily, I'm madly in love with you. I want to share my lifewith you for a while. Will you be provisionally mine? I even had aStraightforward Approach: Linda, I'm going to be needing a wife for atleast a year or two, and I can't think of anyone I would rather spendthat time with than you.     Actually, though I wouldn't even have admitted this to Linda, much lessto anyone else, I loved her in more than a Non-P way. But even if weboth had been genetically desirable (neither of us were) I knew thatLinda relished her freedom and independence too much to ever contractfor any kind of marriage other than Non-P\u2014Non-Permanent, No Progeny.     So I rehearsed my various approaches, realizing that when the timecame I would probably be so tongue-tied I'd be capable of no morethan a blurted, Will you marry me? and I struggled with zippers andmalfunctioning air-cons, and I managed somehow to leave the apartmentat five minutes to ten.     Linda lived down on the hundred fortieth floor, thirteen stories away.It never took more than two or three minutes to get to her place, so Iwas giving myself plenty of time.     But then the elevator didn't come.     I pushed the button, waited, and nothing happened. I couldn'tunderstand it.     The elevator had always arrived before, within thirty seconds ofthe button being pushed. This was a local stop, with an elevatorthat traveled between the hundred thirty-third floor and the hundredsixty-seventh floor, where it was possible to make connections foreither the next local or for the express. So it couldn't be more thantwenty stories away. And this was a non-rush hour.     I pushed the button again, and then I waited some more. I looked at mywatch and it was three minutes to ten. Two minutes, and no elevator! Ifit didn't arrive this instant, this second, I would be late.     It didn't arrive.     I vacillated, not knowing what to do next. Stay, hoping the elevatorwould come after all? Or hurry back to the apartment and call Linda, togive her advance warning that I would be late?     Ten more seconds, and still no elevator. I chose the secondalternative, raced back down the hall, and thumbed my way into myapartment. I dialed Linda's number, and the screen lit up with whiteletters on black: PRIVACY DISCONNECTION.     Of course! Linda expected me at any moment. And she knew what I wantedto say to her, so quite naturally she had disconnected the phone, tokeep us from being interrupted.     Frantic, I dashed from the apartment again, back down the hall to theelevator, and leaned on that blasted button with all my weight. Even ifthe elevator should arrive right now, I would still be almost a minutelate.     No matter. It didn't arrive.     I would have been in a howling rage anyway, but this impossibilitypiled on top of all the other annoyances and breakdowns of the daywas just too much. I went into a frenzy, and kicked the elevator doorthree times before I realized I was hurting myself more than I washurting the door. I limped back to the apartment, fuming, slammed thedoor behind me, grabbed the phone book and looked up the number ofthe Transit Staff. I dialed, prepared to register a complaint so loudthey'd be able to hear me in sub-basement three.     I got some more letters that spelled: BUSY.  "

        "Query": "What are the physical and social environments depicted in THE SPY IN THE ELEVATOR?",
        "Summary_1": "The story takes place some time after the year 2100, after World Wars I, II, and III have been fought. Due to the population explosion, by 2000, everyone lived in Projects. These Projects are vertically expanded buildings housing people on floors numbering up to two hundred; the Projects are self-contained and self-sufficient. The people in them do not have to go outside where they fear radiation from atomic bombs used in the wars still exists. The Projects provide restaurants, shopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners, schools, churches, factories, etc. Food is grown hydroponically. The Projects are protected by force screens that deflect the radiation and all have their own armies that are supposed to protect them from spies from other Projects.\n\tThe Projects have advanced technology. Telephones have visual capability that allows callers to see each other; this is how Edmund knows that Linda anticipates his proposal. They have robots that mine and collect ore using ore-sleds. The robots are equipped to self-detonate if they are captured. \n\tThe Projects are suspicious of each other because so many treaties were broken during the Ungentlemanly Gentleman\u2019s War, so Projects aren\u2019t willing to expose themself to the possible dangers of reaching out or allying with other Projects. The Army practices Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparedness in case of danger, allowing the people in the Projects to just live their lives.The Treaty of Oslo provides a sense of safety because it means that Projects will not be bombed in case of war.\n\tSocially, not all marriages are intended to be permanent, especially if the couple is not genetically desirable. There is a Non-P marriage option in this case: Non-Permanent and No Progeny. In Non-P marriages, people contract to marry for a short term, such as one or two years. People are also scared of strangers; hence, the man in the elevator is deemed a spy before anyone even speaks with him.\n",
        "Summary_2": "The Spy in the Elevator by Donald E. Westlake takes place in the century after the year 2000. After the third of the Ungentelamnly Wars, AKA World War III, Earth was scorched and full of radiation. The remaining population moved into self-sustaining Projects that feature 200+ floors of residential housing, churches, gyms, caf\u00e9s, and even a hydroponic farm in the basement. Humans were locked away due to the deadly levels of radiation outside due to the tactical atomic bombings. Each Project defends itself with an Army and various equipment as no one is sure whether or not another Project will attack. \nThe Project that Edmund Rice and Linda live in has 200 floors and features all the normal amenities. The elevator, however, is the main source of travel, and no one uses the stairs anymore. Edmund\u2019s room is modest, and he receives a small supply of food daily to prevent any waste. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The Projects had been developed as a result of population booms and the Treaty of Oslo following Word War III, cheekily called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War by Edmunds Intermediate Project History teacher Dr. Kilbillie. Prior to 1900, everyone lived in small, one-to-five-story homes. By the year 2000, everyone lived in the giant high-rises called Projects, also known as apartments or co-ops. The Projects were several hundred stories tall and were essential compact nations that included restaurants, shopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners, etc. Eventually, the Projects became self-sustaining and added schools, churches, factories, robot ore-sleds, etc. The Treaty of Oslo disallowed deployment of strategic atomic weapons and only permitted the use of tactical weapons, which resulted in the world's current state of omnipresent radiation. In the years since, no one has left the buildings to go Outside, except the ore-sleds that seek out raw materials and the spies that invade the protective force-screens to seek out information about potential attacks from other Projects. The residents have developed a level of comfort with life in the Projects, even though they are only allotted a certain amount of food each day and can never leave. Later, the \"spy\" posits that the residents are being fed lies by the Commission, which runs the Projects and profits from their operation.\n",
        "Summary_4": "After the year 2100, humans live in Projects, which are self-sufficient vertical buildings that essentially govern themselves. Raw materials come in and out on ore-sleds and the humans in the Projects have no contact with the outside world. Vertical living became the norm because population explosion meant there was no more horizontal space for people to expand into. Then, with the onset of nuclear warfare in the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, the only safety for the public was to stay inside their residence in the Projects because of the Treaty of Oslo, which stipulates that in this era of atomic weapons, civilians are not to be targeted.\nThere has been so much atomic bombing that the radiation levels outside are said to be too unsafe for humans to endure. The Projects are suspicious of each other planning attacks, and there is high alert for spies from nearby projects infiltrating the building. The people within the Projects live in fear of atomic attacks, though they do not question the accuracy of what they have been told. There hasn\u2019t been an attack in decades, and this threat is largely now just a fear in the minds of the people. They go on with their daily lives, not checking to see if the radiation from the outside remains too high to go outdoors, but just believing what they are told. \nIn one Project, on the 153rd floor lives Edmund Rice in a nicely appointed apartment building, with a video calling service he can use to dial other residents and the building Transit Staff, and he receives allotted rations of food just as all of the other residents do. The love of his life that he wishes to propose Non-P marriage to, Linda, lives on the 144th floor of the same building. There is a local elevator that serves the higher floors that Edmund frequently uses, though it is out of order due to a spy jamming its controls and hiding inside it. There is a stairwell next to the elevator, and on a landing between the 150th and 149th floor there is a small door to the elevator shaft. \nThe spy - an atomic engineer from a neighboring Project - has discovered that the radiation is actually low outside and it is now safe for humans to venture out. However, for Edmund and many others, the Project is all that they know, and the idea of going outside is radically against what they have been conditioned to believe.\n",
        "Article": "But now there was a spy in the elevator.     When I thought of how deeply he had penetrated our defenses, and of howmany others there might be, still penetrating, I shuddered. The wallswere our safeguards only so long as all potential enemies were on theother side of them.     I sat shaken, digesting this news, until suddenly I remembered Linda.     I leaped to my feet, reading from my watch that it was now ten-fifteen.I dashed once more from the apartment and down the hall to theelevator, praying that the spy had been captured by now and that Lindawould agree with me that a spy in the elevator was good and sufficientreason for me to be late.     He was still there. At least, the elevator was still out.     I sagged against the wall, thinking dismal thoughts. Then I noticed thedoor to the right of the elevator. Through that door was the stairway.     I hadn't paid any attention to it before. No one ever uses the stairsexcept adventurous young boys playing cops and robbers, running up anddown from landing to landing. I myself hadn't set foot on a flight ofstairs since I was twelve years old.     Actually, the whole idea of stairs was ridiculous. We had elevators,didn't we? Usually, I mean, when they didn't contain spies. So what wasthe use of stairs?     Well, according to Dr. Kilbillie (a walking library of unnecessaryinformation), the Project had been built when there still had been suchthings as municipal governments (something to do with cities, whichwere more or less grouped Projects), and the local municipal governmenthad had on its books a fire ordinance, anachronistic even then, whichrequired a complete set of stairs in every building constructed in thecity. Ergo, the Project had stairs, thirty-two hundred of them.     And now, after all these years, the stairs might prove useful afterall. It was only thirteen flights to Linda's floor. At sixteen steps aflight, that meant two hundred and eight steps.     Could I descend two hundred and eight steps for my true love? I could.If the door would open.     It would, though reluctantly. Who knew how many years it had been sincelast this door had been opened? It squeaked and wailed and groaned andfinally opened half way. I stepped through to the musty, dusty landing,took a deep breath, and started down. Eight steps and a landing, eightsteps and a floor. Eight steps and a landing, eight steps and a floor.     On the landing between one fifty and one forty-nine, there was asmallish door. I paused, looking curiously at it, and saw that at onetime letters had been painted on it. The letters had long since flakedaway, but they left a lighter residue of dust than that which coveredthe rest of the door. And so the words could still be read, if withdifficulty.     I read them. They said:     EMERGENCY ENTRANCE     ELEVATOR SHAFT     AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL     ONLY     KEEP LOCKED     I frowned, wondering immediately why this door wasn't being firmlyguarded by at least a platoon of Army men. Half a dozen possibleanswers flashed through my mind. The more recent maps might simplyhave omitted this discarded and unnecessary door. It might be sealedshut on the other side. The Army might have caught the spy already.Somebody in authority might simply have goofed.     As I stood there, pondering these possibilities, the door opened andthe spy came out, waving a gun.      III     He couldn't have been anyone else but the spy. The gun, in the firstplace. The fact that he looked harried and upset and terribly nervous,in the second place. And, of course, the fact that he came from theelevator shaft.     Looking back, I think he must have been just as startled as I when wecame face to face like that. We formed a brief tableau, both of usopen-mouthed and wide-eyed.     Unfortunately, he recovered first.     He closed the emergency door behind him, quickly but quietly. His gunstopped waving around and instead pointed directly at my middle. Don'tmove! he whispered harshly. Don't make a sound!     I did exactly as I was told. I didn't move and I didn't make a sound.Which left me quite free to study him.     He was rather short, perhaps three inches shorter than me, with a bonyhigh-cheekboned face featuring deepset eyes and a thin-lipped mouth. Hewore gray slacks and shirt, with brown slippers on his feet. He lookedexactly like a spy ... which is to say that he      didn't     look like aspy, he looked overpoweringly ordinary. More than anything else, hereminded me of a rather taciturn milkman who used to make deliveries tomy parents' apartment.     His gaze darted this way and that. Then he motioned with his free handat the descending stairs and whispered, Where do they go?     I had to clear my throat before I could speak. All the way down, Isaid.     Good, he said\u2014just as we both heard a sudden raucous squealing fromperhaps four flights down, a squealing which could be nothing but theopening of a hall door. It was followed by the heavy thud of ascendingboots. The Army!     But if I had any visions of imminent rescue, the spy dashed them. Hesaid, Where do you live?     One fifty-three, I said. This was a desperate and dangerous man.I knew my only slim chance of safety lay in answering his questionspromptly, cooperating with him until and unless I saw a chance toeither escape or capture him.     All right, he whispered. Go on. He prodded me with the gun.     And so we went back up the stairs to one fifty-three, and stopped atthe door. He stood close behind me, the gun pressed against my back,and grated in my ear, I'll have this gun in my pocket. If you make onefalse move I'll kill you. Now, we're going to your apartment. We'refriends, just strolling along together. You got that?     I nodded.     All right. Let's go.     We went. I have never in my life seen that long hall quite so empty asit was right then. No one came out of any of the apartments, no oneemerged from any of the branch halls. We walked to my apartment. Ithumbed the door open and we went inside.     Once the door was closed behind us, he visibly relaxed, sagging againstthe door, his gun hand hanging limp at his side, a nervous smileplaying across his lips.     I looked at him, judging the distance between us, wondering if I couldleap at him before he could bring the gun up again. But he must haveread my intentions on my face. He straightened, shaking his head. Hesaid, Don't try it. I don't want to kill you. I don't want to killanybody, but I will if I have to. We'll just wait here together untilthe hue and cry passes us. Then I'll tie you up, so you won't be ableto sic your Army on me too soon, and I'll leave. If you don't try anysilly heroics, nothing will happen to you.     You'll never get away, I told him. The whole Project is alerted.     You let me worry about that, he said. He licked his lips. You gotany chico coffee?     Yes.     Make me a cup. And don't get any bright ideas about dousing me withboiling water.     I only have my day's allotment, I protested. Just enough for twocups, lunch and dinner.     Two cups is fine, he said. One for each of us.   <doc-sep> It took three tries before I got through to a hurried-looking femalereceptionist My name is Rice! I bellowed. Edmund Rice! I live on thehundred and fifty-third floor! I just rang for the elevator and\u2014\u2014     The-elevator-is-disconnected. She said it very rapidly, as though shewere growing very used to saying it.     It only stopped me for a second. Disconnected? What do you meandisconnected? Elevators don't      get     disconnected! I told her.     We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible, she rattled. My bellowingwas bouncing off her like radiation off the Project force-screen.     I changed tactics. First I inhaled, making a production out of it,giving myself a chance to calm down a bit. And then I asked, asrationally as you could please, Would you mind terribly telling me      why     the elevator is disconnected?     I-am-sorry-sir-but-that\u2014\u2014     Stop, I said. I said it quietly, too, but she stopped. I saw herlooking at me. She hadn't done that before, she'd merely gazed blanklyat her screen and parroted her responses.     But now she was actually looking at      me     .     I took advantage of the fact. Calmly, rationally, I said to her, Iwould like to tell you something, Miss. I would like to tell you justwhat you people have done to me by disconnecting the elevator. You haveruined my life.     She blinked, open-mouthed. Ruined your life?     Precisely. I found it necessary to inhale again, even more slowlythan before. I was on my way, I explained, to propose to a girl whomI dearly love. In every way but one, she is the perfect woman. Do youunderstand me?     She nodded, wide-eyed. I had stumbled on a romantic, though I was toopreoccupied to notice it at the time.     In every way but one, I continued. She has one small imperfection,a fixation about punctuality. And I was supposed to meet her at teno'clock.      I'm late!      I shook my fist at the screen. Do you realizewhat you've      done     , disconnecting the elevator? Not only won't shemarry me, she won't even      speak     to me! Not now! Not after this!     Sir, she said tremulously, please don't shout.     I'm not shouting!     Sir, I'm terribly sorry. I understand your\u2014     You      understand     ? I trembled with speechless fury.     She looked all about her, and then leaned closer to the screen,revealing a cleavage that I was too distraught at the moment to payany attention to. We're not supposed to give this information out,sir, she said, her voice low, but I'm going to tell you, so you'llunderstand why we had to do it. I think it's perfectly awful that ithad to ruin things for you this way. But the fact of the matter is\u2014she leaned even closer to the screen\u2014there's a spy in the elevator.      II     It was my turn to be stunned.     I just gaped at her. A\u2014a what?     A spy. He was discovered on the hundred forty-seventh floor, andmanaged to get into the elevator before the Army could catch him. Hejammed it between floors. But the Army is doing everything it can thinkof to get him out.     Well\u2014but why should there be any problem about getting him out?     He plugged in the manual controls. We can't control the elevator fromoutside at all. And when anyone tries to get into the shaft, he aimsthe elevator at them.     That sounded impossible. He      aims     the elevator?     He runs it up and down the shaft, she explained, trying to crushanybody who goes after him.     Oh, I said. So it might take a while.     She leaned so close this time that even I, distracted as I was, couldhardly help but take note of her cleavage. She whispered, They'reafraid they'll have to starve him out.     Oh, no!     She nodded solemnly. I'm terribly sorry, sir, she said. Then sheglanced to her right, suddenly straightened up again, and said,We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible. Click. Blank screen.     For a minute or two, all I could do was sit and absorb what I'd beentold. A spy in the elevator! A spy who had managed to work his way allthe way up to the hundred forty-seventh floor before being unmasked!     What in the world was the matter with the Army? If things were gettingthat lax, the Project was doomed, force-screen or no. Who knew how manymore spies there were in the Project, still unsuspected?     Until that moment, the state of siege in which we all lived had hadno reality for me. The Project, after all, was self-sufficient andcompletely enclosed. No one ever left, no one ever entered. Under ourroof, we were a nation, two hundred stories high. The ever-presentthreat of other projects had never been more for me\u2014or for most otherpeople either, I suspected\u2014than occasional ore-sleds that didn'treturn, occasional spies shot down as they tried to sneak into thebuilding, occasional spies of our own leaving the Project in tinyradiation-proof cars, hoping to get safely within another project andbring back news of any immediate threats and dangers that project mightbe planning for us. Most spies didn't return; most ore-sleds did. Andwithin the Project life was full, the knowledge of external dangersmerely lurking at the backs of our minds. After all, those externaldangers had been no more than potential for decades, since what Dr.Kilbillie called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War.     Dr. Kilbillie\u2014Intermediate Project History, when I was fifteen yearsold\u2014had private names for every major war of the twentieth century.There was the Ignoble Nobleman's War, the Racial Non-Racial War, andthe Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, known to the textbooks of course asWorld Wars One, Two, and Three.     The rise of the Projects, according to Dr. Kilbillie, was the result ofmany many factors, but two of the most important were the populationexplosion and the Treaty of Oslo. The population explosion, of course,meant that there was continuously more and more people but never anymore space. So that housing, in the historically short time of onecentury, made a complete transformation from horizontal expansion tovertical. Before 1900, the vast majority of human beings lived intiny huts of from one to five stories. By 2000,      everybody     lived inProjects. From the very beginning, small attempts were made to makethese Projects more than dwelling places. By mid-century, Projects(also called apartments and co-ops) already included restaurants,shopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners and a host ofother adjuncts. By the end of the century, the Projects were completelyself-sufficient, with food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements,separate floors set aside for schools and churches and factories, robotore-sleds capable of seeking out raw materials unavailable within theProjects themselves and so on. And all because of, among other things,the population explosion.     And the Treaty of Oslo.     It seems there was a power-struggle between two sets of then-existingnations (they were something like Projects, only horizontal instead ofvertical) and both sets were equipped with atomic weapons. The Treatyof Oslo began by stating that atomic war was unthinkable, and addedthat just in case anyone happened to think of it only      tactical     atomicweapons could be used. No      strategic     atomic weapons. (A tacticalweapon is something you use on the soldiers, and a strategic weapons issomething you use on the folks at home.) Oddly enough, when somebodydid think of the war, both sides adhered to the Treaty of Oslo, whichmeant that no Projects were bombed.     Of course, they made up for this as best they could by using tacticalatomic weapons all over the place. After the war almost the wholeworld was quite dangerously radioactive. Except for the Projects. Orat least those of them which had in time installed the force screenswhich had been invented on the very eve of battle, and which deflectedradioactive particles.     However, what with all of the      other     treaties which were broken duringthe Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, by the time it was finished nobodywas quite sure any more who was on whose side. That project over thereon the horizon might be an ally. And then again it might not. Sincethey weren't sure either, it was risky to expose yourself in order toask.     And so life went on, with little to remind us of the dangers lurkingOutside. The basic policy of Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparednesswas left to the Army. The rest of us simply lived our lives and let itgo at that.   <doc-sep>    CINDERELLA STORY     By ALLEN KIM LANG       What a bank! The First Vice-President       was a cool cat\u2014the elevator and the       money operators all wore earmuffs\u2014was       just as phony as a three-dollar bill!       [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Worlds of If Science Fiction, May 1961.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      I     The First Vice-President of the William Howard Taft National Bank andTrust Company, the gentleman to whom Miss Orison McCall was applyingfor a job, was not at all the public picture of a banker. His suit ofhound's-tooth checks, the scarlet vest peeping above the vee of hisjacket, were enough to assure Orison that the Taft Bank was a curiousbank indeed. I gotta say, chick, these references of yours reallyswing, said the Vice-President, Mr. Wanji. Your last boss says youcome on real cool in the secretary-bit.     He was a very kind employer, Orison said. She tried to keep fromstaring at the most remarkable item of Mr. Wanji's costume, a pair offurry green earmuffs. It was not cold.     Mr. Wanji returned to Orison her letters of reference. What colorbread you got eyes for taking down, baby? he asked.     Beg pardon?     What kinda salary you bucking for? he translated, bouncing up anddown on the toes of his rough-leather desert boots.     I was making one-twenty a week in my last position, Miss McCall said.     You're worth more'n that, just to jazz up the decor, Mr. Wanji said.What you say we pass you a cee-and-a-half a week. Okay? He caughtOrison's look of bewilderment. One each, a Franklin and a Grant, heexplained further. She still looked blank. Sister, you gonna workin a bank, you gotta know who's picture's on the paper. That's ahunnerd-fifty a week, doll.     That will be most satisfactory, Mr. Wanji, Orison said. It was indeed.     Crazy! Mr. Wanji grabbed Orison's right hand and shook it withathletic vigor. You just now joined up with our herd. I wanna tellyou, chick, it's none too soon we got some decent scenery aroundthis tomb, girlwise. He took her arm and led her toward the bank ofelevators. The uniformed operator nodded to Mr. Wanji, bowed slightlyto Orison. He, too, she observed, wore earmuffs. His were more formalthan Mr. Wanji's, being midnight blue in color. Lift us to five, Mac,Mr. Wanji said. As the elevator door shut he explained to Orison,You can make the Taft Bank scene anywhere between the street floorand floor five. Basement and everything higher'n fifth floor is IronCurtain Country far's you're concerned. Dig, baby?     Yes, sir, Orison said. She was wondering if she'd be issued earmuffs,now that she'd become an employee of this most peculiar bank.     The elevator opened on five to a tiny office, just large enough tohold a single desk and two chairs. On the desk were a telephone anda microphone. Beside them was a double-decked In and Out basket.Here's where you'll do your nine-to-five, honey, Mr. Wanji said.     What will I be doing, Mr. Wanji? Orison asked.     The Vice-President pointed to the newspaper folded in the In basket.Flip on the microphone and read the paper to it, he said. When youget done reading the paper, someone will run you up something new toread. Okay?     It seems a rather peculiar job, Orison said. After all, I'm asecretary. Is reading the newspaper aloud supposed to familiarize mewith the Bank's operation?     Don't bug me, kid, Mr. Wanji said. All you gotta do is read thatthere paper into this here microphone. Can do?     Yes, sir, Orison said. While you're here, Mr. Wanji, I'd like toask you about my withholding tax, social security, credit union,coffee-breaks, union membership, lunch hour and the like. Shall we takecare of these details now? Or would you\u2014     You just take care of that chicken-flickin' kinda stuff any way seemsbest to you, kid, Mr. Wanji said.     Yes, sir, Orison said. This laissez-faire policy of Taft Bank'smight explain why she'd been selected from the Treasury Department'ssecretarial pool to apply for work here, she thought. Orison McCall,girl Government spy. She picked up the newspaper from the In basket,unfolded it to discover the day's      Wall Street Journal     , and began atthe top of column one to read it aloud. Wanji stood before the desk,nodding his head as he listened. You blowing real good, kid, he said.The boss is gonna dig you the most.     Orison nodded. Holding her newspaper and her microphone, she read theone into the other. Mr. Wanji flicked his fingers in a good-by, thentook off upstairs in the elevator.  "

        "Query": "What is the importance of the spy who was in the elevator?",
        "Summary_1": "The spy thwarts Edmund\u2019s planned proposal to Linda, but on a larger scale, he threatens the entire way of life in the Projects. The spy in the elevator isn\u2019t really a spy, but the Army claims he is. It is in the interest of the Army and the Commissions of the Projects for people to believe that the radiation level outside the Projects is too high for people to survive because keeping people fearful keeps them in the Projects and needful of the Army and Commission. The people in the Projects are taught to be fearful of other Projects who might come and try to learn their secrets, military, technology, or otherwise. The Army is trying to capture the spy who has holed himself up in the elevator and is planning to starve him out if necessary. The spy uses logic to try to convince Edmund that he isn\u2019t really a spy, that the Projects don\u2019t really need to worry about spies, and that the Projects aren\u2019t really needed at all.\n\tThe spy is actually an atomic engineer from a Project about 80 miles north of Edmund\u2019s. He suspected that the radiation levels after the atomic war have dropped low enough to be safe for people to go outside the Projects. When he asks his Commission to be allowed to study this, he is refused. The Commission knows that if people can leave the Projects, there would be no need for the Commission. To secretly test his theory, the spy left his Project and walked all the way to Edmund\u2019s project without a radiation shield. He is fine, and he is trying to convince the people in the Projects that it is safe to go outside; he compares the Projects to caves and the people to cavemen. He claims that the Projects are stunting society\u2019s progress by keeping everyone \u201clocked down.\u201d\n\n",
        "Summary_2": "The first conflict is caused by the spy in the elevator, as he prevents Edmund from visiting and therefore proposing to Linda on time. This causes a chain of events that leads to their eventual meeting and Edmund\u2019s partial captivity. While he harbors the alleged spy in his room after running into him on the stairwell, the spy reveals that he is not a spy at all. He came from a Project 80 miles away and walked to this one on foot. He claims the radiation levels are back to a healthy level and that they have been for years. He believes that the Commission is hiding the truth from people, because, if they knew, the Projects would go out of business, as people are not allowed to leave them for their own health and safety. ",
        "Summary_3": "When Edmund realizes the unmoving elevator is going to make him late for his proposal to Linda, he calls the Transit Staff. The staff person reveals to Edmund that a spy has barricaded himself in the elevator and with the help of manual controls is using it as a projectile against anyone who tries to get near him. Edmund had heard of spies going between Projects to try to learn information about any planned attacks, but he is surprised and scared to discover that a spy has managed to penetrate his Project's force-screen. He wonders what this will mean for the overall safety of the Project, but he doesn't dwell on this too long because he still needs to get to Linda. He makes his way down the stairs and encounters a small door, which turns out to be an emergency exit from the elevator shaft. The spy opens the shaft and orders Edmund to lead him back to his apartment at gunpoint. In the apartment, the spy demands coffee, and the two men talk. Edmund claims to be an ore-sled dispatcher, and the spy inquires if the dispatchers check radiation levels when the sleds return from a supply run. Edmund scoffs at this idea, claiming that there would be no point in doing so since the radiation is purged prior to entering the force-screen. The spy reveals himself to be an atomic engineer and tells Edmund that the Project defenses, as well as the claims of toxic radiation levels Outside, are nothing more than a smokescreen, a way to keep the residents of the Projects content to live inside and never venture out. He posits the Commission is responsible for this deception because they want to continue profiting from the operation of the Projects.",
        "Summary_4": "The spy is discovered on the 147th floor of Edmund\u2019s building, and runs into the elevator before the Army can catch him. The spy plugs the manual controls of the elevator so that he can\u2019t be caught, and runs the elevator up and down the shaft if anyone tries to enter the car through the shaft. After he bursts out of the elevator shaft door into the stairwell and forces Edmund to take him back to his apartment to hide, we learn the real story of the spy. He is actually an atomic engineer from another Project where he was in charge of their reactor. He thought the radiation from the war decades ago would likely be so low now that it would be safe for humans to leave the Projects and go outside. However, the Commission would not let him test the theory, so he risked his life to travel to a nearby Project to find out for himself. Because he survived the crossing outside, it is now safe for humans to resume activities outside. This is very significant, because Edmund\u2019s conditioning has him believe that there is no reason to question why they can\u2019t go outside and that there is not going to be a life outside the Project. The spy gives Edmund a reason to believe that what he has been told by the Commission is untrue. Also, the ability of the spy to penetrate so deeply into the project undetected is a significant concern to Edmund, who considers the reliability of the safeguards to keep the people safe from outside enemies.\n",
        "Article": "It took three tries before I got through to a hurried-looking femalereceptionist My name is Rice! I bellowed. Edmund Rice! I live on thehundred and fifty-third floor! I just rang for the elevator and\u2014\u2014     The-elevator-is-disconnected. She said it very rapidly, as though shewere growing very used to saying it.     It only stopped me for a second. Disconnected? What do you meandisconnected? Elevators don't      get     disconnected! I told her.     We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible, she rattled. My bellowingwas bouncing off her like radiation off the Project force-screen.     I changed tactics. First I inhaled, making a production out of it,giving myself a chance to calm down a bit. And then I asked, asrationally as you could please, Would you mind terribly telling me      why     the elevator is disconnected?     I-am-sorry-sir-but-that\u2014\u2014     Stop, I said. I said it quietly, too, but she stopped. I saw herlooking at me. She hadn't done that before, she'd merely gazed blanklyat her screen and parroted her responses.     But now she was actually looking at      me     .     I took advantage of the fact. Calmly, rationally, I said to her, Iwould like to tell you something, Miss. I would like to tell you justwhat you people have done to me by disconnecting the elevator. You haveruined my life.     She blinked, open-mouthed. Ruined your life?     Precisely. I found it necessary to inhale again, even more slowlythan before. I was on my way, I explained, to propose to a girl whomI dearly love. In every way but one, she is the perfect woman. Do youunderstand me?     She nodded, wide-eyed. I had stumbled on a romantic, though I was toopreoccupied to notice it at the time.     In every way but one, I continued. She has one small imperfection,a fixation about punctuality. And I was supposed to meet her at teno'clock.      I'm late!      I shook my fist at the screen. Do you realizewhat you've      done     , disconnecting the elevator? Not only won't shemarry me, she won't even      speak     to me! Not now! Not after this!     Sir, she said tremulously, please don't shout.     I'm not shouting!     Sir, I'm terribly sorry. I understand your\u2014     You      understand     ? I trembled with speechless fury.     She looked all about her, and then leaned closer to the screen,revealing a cleavage that I was too distraught at the moment to payany attention to. We're not supposed to give this information out,sir, she said, her voice low, but I'm going to tell you, so you'llunderstand why we had to do it. I think it's perfectly awful that ithad to ruin things for you this way. But the fact of the matter is\u2014she leaned even closer to the screen\u2014there's a spy in the elevator.      II     It was my turn to be stunned.     I just gaped at her. A\u2014a what?     A spy. He was discovered on the hundred forty-seventh floor, andmanaged to get into the elevator before the Army could catch him. Hejammed it between floors. But the Army is doing everything it can thinkof to get him out.     Well\u2014but why should there be any problem about getting him out?     He plugged in the manual controls. We can't control the elevator fromoutside at all. And when anyone tries to get into the shaft, he aimsthe elevator at them.     That sounded impossible. He      aims     the elevator?     He runs it up and down the shaft, she explained, trying to crushanybody who goes after him.     Oh, I said. So it might take a while.     She leaned so close this time that even I, distracted as I was, couldhardly help but take note of her cleavage. She whispered, They'reafraid they'll have to starve him out.     Oh, no!     She nodded solemnly. I'm terribly sorry, sir, she said. Then sheglanced to her right, suddenly straightened up again, and said,We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible. Click. Blank screen.     For a minute or two, all I could do was sit and absorb what I'd beentold. A spy in the elevator! A spy who had managed to work his way allthe way up to the hundred forty-seventh floor before being unmasked!     What in the world was the matter with the Army? If things were gettingthat lax, the Project was doomed, force-screen or no. Who knew how manymore spies there were in the Project, still unsuspected?     Until that moment, the state of siege in which we all lived had hadno reality for me. The Project, after all, was self-sufficient andcompletely enclosed. No one ever left, no one ever entered. Under ourroof, we were a nation, two hundred stories high. The ever-presentthreat of other projects had never been more for me\u2014or for most otherpeople either, I suspected\u2014than occasional ore-sleds that didn'treturn, occasional spies shot down as they tried to sneak into thebuilding, occasional spies of our own leaving the Project in tinyradiation-proof cars, hoping to get safely within another project andbring back news of any immediate threats and dangers that project mightbe planning for us. Most spies didn't return; most ore-sleds did. Andwithin the Project life was full, the knowledge of external dangersmerely lurking at the backs of our minds. After all, those externaldangers had been no more than potential for decades, since what Dr.Kilbillie called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War.     Dr. Kilbillie\u2014Intermediate Project History, when I was fifteen yearsold\u2014had private names for every major war of the twentieth century.There was the Ignoble Nobleman's War, the Racial Non-Racial War, andthe Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, known to the textbooks of course asWorld Wars One, Two, and Three.     The rise of the Projects, according to Dr. Kilbillie, was the result ofmany many factors, but two of the most important were the populationexplosion and the Treaty of Oslo. The population explosion, of course,meant that there was continuously more and more people but never anymore space. So that housing, in the historically short time of onecentury, made a complete transformation from horizontal expansion tovertical. Before 1900, the vast majority of human beings lived intiny huts of from one to five stories. By 2000,      everybody     lived inProjects. From the very beginning, small attempts were made to makethese Projects more than dwelling places. By mid-century, Projects(also called apartments and co-ops) already included restaurants,shopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners and a host ofother adjuncts. By the end of the century, the Projects were completelyself-sufficient, with food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements,separate floors set aside for schools and churches and factories, robotore-sleds capable of seeking out raw materials unavailable within theProjects themselves and so on. And all because of, among other things,the population explosion.     And the Treaty of Oslo.     It seems there was a power-struggle between two sets of then-existingnations (they were something like Projects, only horizontal instead ofvertical) and both sets were equipped with atomic weapons. The Treatyof Oslo began by stating that atomic war was unthinkable, and addedthat just in case anyone happened to think of it only      tactical     atomicweapons could be used. No      strategic     atomic weapons. (A tacticalweapon is something you use on the soldiers, and a strategic weapons issomething you use on the folks at home.) Oddly enough, when somebodydid think of the war, both sides adhered to the Treaty of Oslo, whichmeant that no Projects were bombed.     Of course, they made up for this as best they could by using tacticalatomic weapons all over the place. After the war almost the wholeworld was quite dangerously radioactive. Except for the Projects. Orat least those of them which had in time installed the force screenswhich had been invented on the very eve of battle, and which deflectedradioactive particles.     However, what with all of the      other     treaties which were broken duringthe Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, by the time it was finished nobodywas quite sure any more who was on whose side. That project over thereon the horizon might be an ally. And then again it might not. Sincethey weren't sure either, it was risky to expose yourself in order toask.     And so life went on, with little to remind us of the dangers lurkingOutside. The basic policy of Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparednesswas left to the Army. The rest of us simply lived our lives and let itgo at that.   <doc-sep> But now there was a spy in the elevator.     When I thought of how deeply he had penetrated our defenses, and of howmany others there might be, still penetrating, I shuddered. The wallswere our safeguards only so long as all potential enemies were on theother side of them.     I sat shaken, digesting this news, until suddenly I remembered Linda.     I leaped to my feet, reading from my watch that it was now ten-fifteen.I dashed once more from the apartment and down the hall to theelevator, praying that the spy had been captured by now and that Lindawould agree with me that a spy in the elevator was good and sufficientreason for me to be late.     He was still there. At least, the elevator was still out.     I sagged against the wall, thinking dismal thoughts. Then I noticed thedoor to the right of the elevator. Through that door was the stairway.     I hadn't paid any attention to it before. No one ever uses the stairsexcept adventurous young boys playing cops and robbers, running up anddown from landing to landing. I myself hadn't set foot on a flight ofstairs since I was twelve years old.     Actually, the whole idea of stairs was ridiculous. We had elevators,didn't we? Usually, I mean, when they didn't contain spies. So what wasthe use of stairs?     Well, according to Dr. Kilbillie (a walking library of unnecessaryinformation), the Project had been built when there still had been suchthings as municipal governments (something to do with cities, whichwere more or less grouped Projects), and the local municipal governmenthad had on its books a fire ordinance, anachronistic even then, whichrequired a complete set of stairs in every building constructed in thecity. Ergo, the Project had stairs, thirty-two hundred of them.     And now, after all these years, the stairs might prove useful afterall. It was only thirteen flights to Linda's floor. At sixteen steps aflight, that meant two hundred and eight steps.     Could I descend two hundred and eight steps for my true love? I could.If the door would open.     It would, though reluctantly. Who knew how many years it had been sincelast this door had been opened? It squeaked and wailed and groaned andfinally opened half way. I stepped through to the musty, dusty landing,took a deep breath, and started down. Eight steps and a landing, eightsteps and a floor. Eight steps and a landing, eight steps and a floor.     On the landing between one fifty and one forty-nine, there was asmallish door. I paused, looking curiously at it, and saw that at onetime letters had been painted on it. The letters had long since flakedaway, but they left a lighter residue of dust than that which coveredthe rest of the door. And so the words could still be read, if withdifficulty.     I read them. They said:     EMERGENCY ENTRANCE     ELEVATOR SHAFT     AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL     ONLY     KEEP LOCKED     I frowned, wondering immediately why this door wasn't being firmlyguarded by at least a platoon of Army men. Half a dozen possibleanswers flashed through my mind. The more recent maps might simplyhave omitted this discarded and unnecessary door. It might be sealedshut on the other side. The Army might have caught the spy already.Somebody in authority might simply have goofed.     As I stood there, pondering these possibilities, the door opened andthe spy came out, waving a gun.      III     He couldn't have been anyone else but the spy. The gun, in the firstplace. The fact that he looked harried and upset and terribly nervous,in the second place. And, of course, the fact that he came from theelevator shaft.     Looking back, I think he must have been just as startled as I when wecame face to face like that. We formed a brief tableau, both of usopen-mouthed and wide-eyed.     Unfortunately, he recovered first.     He closed the emergency door behind him, quickly but quietly. His gunstopped waving around and instead pointed directly at my middle. Don'tmove! he whispered harshly. Don't make a sound!     I did exactly as I was told. I didn't move and I didn't make a sound.Which left me quite free to study him.     He was rather short, perhaps three inches shorter than me, with a bonyhigh-cheekboned face featuring deepset eyes and a thin-lipped mouth. Hewore gray slacks and shirt, with brown slippers on his feet. He lookedexactly like a spy ... which is to say that he      didn't     look like aspy, he looked overpoweringly ordinary. More than anything else, hereminded me of a rather taciturn milkman who used to make deliveries tomy parents' apartment.     His gaze darted this way and that. Then he motioned with his free handat the descending stairs and whispered, Where do they go?     I had to clear my throat before I could speak. All the way down, Isaid.     Good, he said\u2014just as we both heard a sudden raucous squealing fromperhaps four flights down, a squealing which could be nothing but theopening of a hall door. It was followed by the heavy thud of ascendingboots. The Army!     But if I had any visions of imminent rescue, the spy dashed them. Hesaid, Where do you live?     One fifty-three, I said. This was a desperate and dangerous man.I knew my only slim chance of safety lay in answering his questionspromptly, cooperating with him until and unless I saw a chance toeither escape or capture him.     All right, he whispered. Go on. He prodded me with the gun.     And so we went back up the stairs to one fifty-three, and stopped atthe door. He stood close behind me, the gun pressed against my back,and grated in my ear, I'll have this gun in my pocket. If you make onefalse move I'll kill you. Now, we're going to your apartment. We'refriends, just strolling along together. You got that?     I nodded.     All right. Let's go.     We went. I have never in my life seen that long hall quite so empty asit was right then. No one came out of any of the apartments, no oneemerged from any of the branch halls. We walked to my apartment. Ithumbed the door open and we went inside.     Once the door was closed behind us, he visibly relaxed, sagging againstthe door, his gun hand hanging limp at his side, a nervous smileplaying across his lips.     I looked at him, judging the distance between us, wondering if I couldleap at him before he could bring the gun up again. But he must haveread my intentions on my face. He straightened, shaking his head. Hesaid, Don't try it. I don't want to kill you. I don't want to killanybody, but I will if I have to. We'll just wait here together untilthe hue and cry passes us. Then I'll tie you up, so you won't be ableto sic your Army on me too soon, and I'll leave. If you don't try anysilly heroics, nothing will happen to you.     You'll never get away, I told him. The whole Project is alerted.     You let me worry about that, he said. He licked his lips. You gotany chico coffee?     Yes.     Make me a cup. And don't get any bright ideas about dousing me withboiling water.     I only have my day's allotment, I protested. Just enough for twocups, lunch and dinner.     Two cups is fine, he said. One for each of us.   <doc-sep>    THE SPY IN THE ELEVATOR     By DONALD E.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]         He was dangerously insane. He threatened       to destroy everything that was noble and       decent\u2014including my date with my girl!        When the elevator didn't come, that just made the day perfect. A brokenegg yolk, a stuck zipper, a feedback in the aircon exhaust, the windowsticking at full transparency\u2014well, I won't go through the whole sorrylist. Suffice it to say that when the elevator didn't come, that putthe roof on the city, as they say.     It was just one of those days. Everybody gets them. Days when you'relucky in you make it to nightfall with no bones broken.     But of all times for it to happen! For literally months I'd beenbuilding my courage up. And finally, just today, I had made up mymind to do it\u2014to propose to Linda. I'd called her second thing thismorning\u2014right after the egg yolk\u2014and invited myself down to herplace. Ten o'clock, she'd said, smiling sweetly at me out of thephone. She knew why I wanted to talk to her. And when Linda said teno'clock, she meant ten o'clock.     Don't get me wrong. I don't mean that Linda's a perfectionist or aharridan or anything like that. Far from it. But she does have afixation on that one subject of punctuality. The result of her job,of course. She was an ore-sled dispatcher. Ore-sleds, being robots,were invariably punctual. If an ore-sled didn't return on time, no onewaited for it. They simply knew that it had been captured by some otherProject and had blown itself up.     Well, of course, after working as an ore-sled dispatcher for threeyears, Linda quite naturally was a bit obsessed. I remember one time,shortly after we'd started dating, when I arrived at her place fiveminutes late and found her having hysterics. She thought I'd beenkilled. She couldn't visualize anything less than that keeping me fromarriving at the designated moment. When I told her what actually hadhappened\u2014I'd broken a shoe lace\u2014she refused to speak to me for fourdays.     And then the elevator didn't come.  "

        "Query": "What is the fate of Edmund Rice in THE SPY IN THE ELEVATOR?",
        "Summary_1": "Edmund is eager to propose to his girlfriend. He truly loves her and would like a long marriage, but he is willing to settle for a Non-P marriage since he knows she values her freedom and independence. After gathering the courage to propose, he makes a date with her one morning, but multiple minor calamities make him run late. Linda is a stickler for punctuality, so on this morning, it is especially important to be on time. When he makes it to the elevator with five minutes to spare, his proposal is thwarted because a spy is holding it up. When he tries to call Linda to let her know he is running late, he can\u2019t get the call through because she has set her phone not to be disturbed. When he learns that a spy is holding up the elevator and might be in there until the Army can starve him out, he decides to brave the 208 stairs down to Linda\u2019s apartment, only to run into the spy there. The spy forces Edmund back to his apartment, where he explains he is not really a spy and that the radiation levels outside are so low it is safe for everyone to leave the projects. Edmund is sure the man is a lunatic despite the logic of his argument. He realizes that his chance to marry Linda is gone; she will never forgive him for being late.",
        "Summary_2": "Edmund Rice is a gymnast and martial arts instructor living on the 153rd floor of one of the many Projects. He is in love with Linda, an ore-sled dispatcher who lives a few floors down from him, and wants to ask her to marry him. After eating his egg, he prepares himself to propose to Linda, reviewing his three speeches. He leaves with a few minutes to spare, but the elevator won\u2019t work. He watches hopefully as time ticks by and finally accepts that he\u2019s going to be late. He dashes back to his apartment to call Linda and warn her of his tardiness, but she has disconnected her landline. He goes back to the elevator, but still nothing. He storms home and calls the Transit Staff, yelling at the woman who picks up. After he shares his sob story, she reveals that the elevator isn\u2019t working because there\u2019s a spy in it who\u2019s taken over the control system. Realizing just how late he is, Edmund runs back out, tries the elevator again, and then decides to take the stairs. On one of the landings, he notices a door with faint letters on it. This door connects to the elevator shaft. Suddenly, the spy bursts through the door and holds Edmund at gunpoint. Edmund hides him in his room and is forced to make the spy a cup of Chico coffee as he tells his tale. Edmund disguises his identity and pretends he\u2019s an ore-sled dispatcher like Linda, so, if the time should come, he can take the so-called spy by surprise. ",

He lives on the 153rd floor of a Project high-rise building and is preparing to propose to his girlfriend, Linda. Although he loves Linda and wants more than a Non-Permanent, No Progeny arrangement, he realizes she values her independence and plans to respect that. He has found a suitable Non-P apartment for them to share. Edmund's day is not going right. The egg yolk breaks when he prepares breakfast, his zipper sticks, the window is stuck open at full transparency. All of these minor problems are enhanced because he knows if he is even a minute late to his appointment with Linda, she will possibly think he is dead. Edmund gives himself plenty of time to get to the elevator, even though he knows the local and express elevators have a thirty-second arrival time, and it takes less than two minutes to get down to Linda's floor in the same building. When the elevator fails to arrive, Edmund panics. He tries to call Linda, but she has set the phone to private in anticipation of his proposal.

        "Summary_4": "Edmund Rice is the narrating voice of the story, and so the events that occur to him in the story closely mirror the plot since it is all told from his perspective. Edmund is a gymnast instructor, skilled in wrestling, judo and karati. He lives on the 153rd floor of a self-sufficient vertical city building in which no one is supposed to enter or leave. There are many like it in the world, all called \u201cProjects\u201d. The world outside is said to be too dangerous to set foot in for humans because of the radiation from atomic bombs during the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War. \nHe is deeply in love with an ore-sled dispatcher on the 144th floor, Linda, and wants to propose a Non-P marriage to her (Non-Permanent, No Progeny). Neither of them are genetically desirable enough to have children, and he knows that Linda likes her independence too much to have a permanent marriage, even though he would like to have one with her. He makes an appointment to meet with her at ten o\u2019clock and propose. The time of the appointment is important because Linda is so critical of punctuality that Edmund thinks she will not marry him or even talk to him again if he is late. When he exits his apartment to take the elevator at five minutes before ten, the elevator is not working. He returns to his apartment to call Linda, but she does not answer. He assumes she shut off her phone because he would be there soon and she wanted to have no interruptions. Edmund calls the Transit Staff to file a complaint that they have ruined his life, and the woman at the Transit center says there is a spy in the elevator and it will be some time before it can be fixed because the Army thinks they may have to starve him out. Edmund is crestfallen, then realizes that there are also stairs. It is 10:15, but he rushes to the staircase to try to get to Linda. As he races down, he notices a door to the elevator shaft between the 150th and 149th floors. He pauses to contemplate it, and suddenly a man (the \u201cspy\u201d) bursts out. He threatens Edmund with a gun, forcing him to escort them both back to Edmund\u2019s 153rd floor room without alerting anyone. He does this. Edmund is forced to make him a cup of coffee, taking one of his two coffee rations for the day. Edmund fears that the spy is a maniac, and does as he asks while they wait for the Army to lose the trail so the spy will leave. The spy reveals to Edmund that he is actually an atomic engineer testing his theory that it is now safe for humans to go outside the Projects by risking his life since the Commission would not let him run experiments on it. Edmund is stunned since this is contrary to what he has been conditioned to believe. \n",
        "Article": "It took three tries before I got through to a hurried-looking femalereceptionist My name is Rice! I bellowed. Edmund Rice! I live on thehundred and fifty-third floor! I just rang for the elevator and\u2014\u2014     The-elevator-is-disconnected. She said it very rapidly, as though shewere growing very used to saying it.     It only stopped me for a second. Disconnected? What do you meandisconnected? Elevators don't      get     disconnected! I told her.     We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible, she rattled. My bellowingwas bouncing off her like radiation off the Project force-screen.     I changed tactics. First I inhaled, making a production out of it,giving myself a chance to calm down a bit. And then I asked, asrationally as you could please, Would you mind terribly telling me      why     the elevator is disconnected?     I-am-sorry-sir-but-that\u2014\u2014     Stop, I said. I said it quietly, too, but she stopped. I saw herlooking at me. She hadn't done that before, she'd merely gazed blanklyat her screen and parroted her responses.     But now she was actually looking at      me     .     I took advantage of the fact. Calmly, rationally, I said to her, Iwould like to tell you something, Miss. I would like to tell you justwhat you people have done to me by disconnecting the elevator. You haveruined my life.     She blinked, open-mouthed. Ruined your life?     Precisely. I found it necessary to inhale again, even more slowlythan before. I was on my way, I explained, to propose to a girl whomI dearly love. In every way but one, she is the perfect woman. Do youunderstand me?     She nodded, wide-eyed. I had stumbled on a romantic, though I was toopreoccupied to notice it at the time.     In every way but one, I continued. She has one small imperfection,a fixation about punctuality. And I was supposed to meet her at teno'clock.      I'm late!      I shook my fist at the screen. Do you realizewhat you've      done     , disconnecting the elevator? Not only won't shemarry me, she won't even      speak     to me! Not now! Not after this!     Sir, she said tremulously, please don't shout.     I'm not shouting!     Sir, I'm terribly sorry. I understand your\u2014     You      understand     ? I trembled with speechless fury.     She looked all about her, and then leaned closer to the screen,revealing a cleavage that I was too distraught at the moment to payany attention to. We're not supposed to give this information out,sir, she said, her voice low, but I'm going to tell you, so you'llunderstand why we had to do it. I think it's perfectly awful that ithad to ruin things for you this way. But the fact of the matter is\u2014she leaned even closer to the screen\u2014there's a spy in the elevator.      II     It was my turn to be stunned.     I just gaped at her. A\u2014a what?     A spy. He was discovered on the hundred forty-seventh floor, andmanaged to get into the elevator before the Army could catch him. Hejammed it between floors. But the Army is doing everything it can thinkof to get him out.     Well\u2014but why should there be any problem about getting him out?     He plugged in the manual controls. We can't control the elevator fromoutside at all. And when anyone tries to get into the shaft, he aimsthe elevator at them.     That sounded impossible. He      aims     the elevator?     He runs it up and down the shaft, she explained, trying to crushanybody who goes after him.     Oh, I said. So it might take a while.     She leaned so close this time that even I, distracted as I was, couldhardly help but take note of her cleavage. She whispered, They'reafraid they'll have to starve him out.     Oh, no!     She nodded solemnly. I'm terribly sorry, sir, she said. Then sheglanced to her right, suddenly straightened up again, and said,We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible. Click. Blank screen.     For a minute or two, all I could do was sit and absorb what I'd beentold. A spy in the elevator! A spy who had managed to work his way allthe way up to the hundred forty-seventh floor before being unmasked!     What in the world was the matter with the Army? If things were gettingthat lax, the Project was doomed, force-screen or no. Who knew how manymore spies there were in the Project, still unsuspected?     Until that moment, the state of siege in which we all lived had hadno reality for me. The Project, after all, was self-sufficient andcompletely enclosed. No one ever left, no one ever entered. Under ourroof, we were a nation, two hundred stories high. The ever-presentthreat of other projects had never been more for me\u2014or for most otherpeople either, I suspected\u2014than occasional ore-sleds that didn'treturn, occasional spies shot down as they tried to sneak into thebuilding, occasional spies of our own leaving the Project in tinyradiation-proof cars, hoping to get safely within another project andbring back news of any immediate threats and dangers that project mightbe planning for us. Most spies didn't return; most ore-sleds did. Andwithin the Project life was full, the knowledge of external dangersmerely lurking at the backs of our minds. After all, those externaldangers had been no more than potential for decades, since what Dr.Kilbillie called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War.     Dr. Kilbillie\u2014Intermediate Project History, when I was fifteen yearsold\u2014had private names for every major war of the twentieth century.There was the Ignoble Nobleman's War, the Racial Non-Racial War, andthe Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, known to the textbooks of course asWorld Wars One, Two, and Three.     The rise of the Projects, according to Dr. Kilbillie, was the result ofmany many factors, but two of the most important were the populationexplosion and the Treaty of Oslo. The population explosion, of course,meant that there was continuously more and more people but never anymore space. So that housing, in the historically short time of onecentury, made a complete transformation from horizontal expansion tovertical. Before 1900, the vast majority of human beings lived intiny huts of from one to five stories. By 2000,      everybody     lived inProjects. From the very beginning, small attempts were made to makethese Projects more than dwelling places. By mid-century, Projects(also called apartments and co-ops) already included restaurants,shopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners and a host ofother adjuncts. By the end of the century, the Projects were completelyself-sufficient, with food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements,separate floors set aside for schools and churches and factories, robotore-sleds capable of seeking out raw materials unavailable within theProjects themselves and so on. And all because of, among other things,the population explosion.     And the Treaty of Oslo.     It seems there was a power-struggle between two sets of then-existingnations (they were something like Projects, only horizontal instead ofvertical) and both sets were equipped with atomic weapons. The Treatyof Oslo began by stating that atomic war was unthinkable, and addedthat just in case anyone happened to think of it only      tactical     atomicweapons could be used. No      strategic     atomic weapons. (A tacticalweapon is something you use on the soldiers, and a strategic weapons issomething you use on the folks at home.) Oddly enough, when somebodydid think of the war, both sides adhered to the Treaty of Oslo, whichmeant that no Projects were bombed.     Of course, they made up for this as best they could by using tacticalatomic weapons all over the place. After the war almost the wholeworld was quite dangerously radioactive. Except for the Projects. Orat least those of them which had in time installed the force screenswhich had been invented on the very eve of battle, and which deflectedradioactive particles.     However, what with all of the      other     treaties which were broken duringthe Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, by the time it was finished nobodywas quite sure any more who was on whose side. That project over thereon the horizon might be an ally. And then again it might not. Sincethey weren't sure either, it was risky to expose yourself in order toask.     And so life went on, with little to remind us of the dangers lurkingOutside. The basic policy of Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparednesswas left to the Army. The rest of us simply lived our lives and let itgo at that.   <doc-sep> But now there was a spy in the elevator.     When I thought of how deeply he had penetrated our defenses, and of howmany others there might be, still penetrating, I shuddered. The wallswere our safeguards only so long as all potential enemies were on theother side of them.     I sat shaken, digesting this news, until suddenly I remembered Linda.     I leaped to my feet, reading from my watch that it was now ten-fifteen.I dashed once more from the apartment and down the hall to theelevator, praying that the spy had been captured by now and that Lindawould agree with me that a spy in the elevator was good and sufficientreason for me to be late.     He was still there. At least, the elevator was still out.     I sagged against the wall, thinking dismal thoughts. Then I noticed thedoor to the right of the elevator. Through that door was the stairway.     I hadn't paid any attention to it before. No one ever uses the stairsexcept adventurous young boys playing cops and robbers, running up anddown from landing to landing. I myself hadn't set foot on a flight ofstairs since I was twelve years old.     Actually, the whole idea of stairs was ridiculous. We had elevators,didn't we? Usually, I mean, when they didn't contain spies. So what wasthe use of stairs?     Well, according to Dr. Kilbillie (a walking library of unnecessaryinformation), the Project had been built when there still had been suchthings as municipal governments (something to do with cities, whichwere more or less grouped Projects), and the local municipal governmenthad had on its books a fire ordinance, anachronistic even then, whichrequired a complete set of stairs in every building constructed in thecity. Ergo, the Project had stairs, thirty-two hundred of them.     And now, after all these years, the stairs might prove useful afterall. It was only thirteen flights to Linda's floor. At sixteen steps aflight, that meant two hundred and eight steps.     Could I descend two hundred and eight steps for my true love? I could.If the door would open.     It would, though reluctantly. Who knew how many years it had been sincelast this door had been opened? It squeaked and wailed and groaned andfinally opened half way. I stepped through to the musty, dusty landing,took a deep breath, and started down. Eight steps and a landing, eightsteps and a floor. Eight steps and a landing, eight steps and a floor.     On the landing between one fifty and one forty-nine, there was asmallish door. I paused, looking curiously at it, and saw that at onetime letters had been painted on it. The letters had long since flakedaway, but they left a lighter residue of dust than that which coveredthe rest of the door. And so the words could still be read, if withdifficulty.     I read them. They said:     EMERGENCY ENTRANCE     ELEVATOR SHAFT     AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL     ONLY     KEEP LOCKED     I frowned, wondering immediately why this door wasn't being firmlyguarded by at least a platoon of Army men. Half a dozen possibleanswers flashed through my mind. The more recent maps might simplyhave omitted this discarded and unnecessary door. It might be sealedshut on the other side. The Army might have caught the spy already.Somebody in authority might simply have goofed.     As I stood there, pondering these possibilities, the door opened andthe spy came out, waving a gun.      III     He couldn't have been anyone else but the spy. The gun, in the firstplace. The fact that he looked harried and upset and terribly nervous,in the second place. And, of course, the fact that he came from theelevator shaft.     Looking back, I think he must have been just as startled as I when wecame face to face like that. We formed a brief tableau, both of usopen-mouthed and wide-eyed.     Unfortunately, he recovered first.     He closed the emergency door behind him, quickly but quietly. His gunstopped waving around and instead pointed directly at my middle. Don'tmove! he whispered harshly. Don't make a sound!     I did exactly as I was told. I didn't move and I didn't make a sound.Which left me quite free to study him.     He was rather short, perhaps three inches shorter than me, with a bonyhigh-cheekboned face featuring deepset eyes and a thin-lipped mouth. Hewore gray slacks and shirt, with brown slippers on his feet. He lookedexactly like a spy ... which is to say that he      didn't     look like aspy, he looked overpoweringly ordinary. More than anything else, hereminded me of a rather taciturn milkman who used to make deliveries tomy parents' apartment.     His gaze darted this way and that. Then he motioned with his free handat the descending stairs and whispered, Where do they go?     I had to clear my throat before I could speak. All the way down, Isaid.     Good, he said\u2014just as we both heard a sudden raucous squealing fromperhaps four flights down, a squealing which could be nothing but theopening of a hall door. It was followed by the heavy thud of ascendingboots. The Army!     But if I had any visions of imminent rescue, the spy dashed them. Hesaid, Where do you live?     One fifty-three, I said. This was a desperate and dangerous man.I knew my only slim chance of safety lay in answering his questionspromptly, cooperating with him until and unless I saw a chance toeither escape or capture him.     All right, he whispered. Go on. He prodded me with the gun.     And so we went back up the stairs to one fifty-three, and stopped atthe door. He stood close behind me, the gun pressed against my back,and grated in my ear, I'll have this gun in my pocket. If you make onefalse move I'll kill you. Now, we're going to your apartment. We'refriends, just strolling along together. You got that?     I nodded.     All right. Let's go.     We went. I have never in my life seen that long hall quite so empty asit was right then. No one came out of any of the apartments, no oneemerged from any of the branch halls. We walked to my apartment. Ithumbed the door open and we went inside.     Once the door was closed behind us, he visibly relaxed, sagging againstthe door, his gun hand hanging limp at his side, a nervous smileplaying across his lips.     I looked at him, judging the distance between us, wondering if I couldleap at him before he could bring the gun up again. But he must haveread my intentions on my face. He straightened, shaking his head. Hesaid, Don't try it. I don't want to kill you. I don't want to killanybody, but I will if I have to. We'll just wait here together untilthe hue and cry passes us. Then I'll tie you up, so you won't be ableto sic your Army on me too soon, and I'll leave. If you don't try anysilly heroics, nothing will happen to you.     You'll never get away, I told him. The whole Project is alerted.     You let me worry about that, he said. He licked his lips. You gotany chico coffee?     Yes.     Make me a cup. And don't get any bright ideas about dousing me withboiling water.     I only have my day's allotment, I protested. Just enough for twocups, lunch and dinner.     Two cups is fine, he said. One for each of us.   <doc-sep> As Celeste and Theodor entered the committee room, Rosalind Wolver\u2014aglitter of platinum against darkness\u2014came in through the oppositedoor and softly shut it behind her. Frieda, a fair woman in blue robes,got up from the round table.     Celeste turned away with outward casualness as Theodor kissed his twoother wives. She was pleased to note that Edmund seemed impatient too.A figure in close-fitting black, unrelieved except for two red arrowsat the collar, he struck her as embodying very properly the serious,fateful temper of the moment.     He took two briefcases from his vest pocket and tossed them down on thetable beside one of the microfilm projectors.     I suggest we get started without waiting for Ivan, he said.     Frieda frowned anxiously. It's ten minutes since he phoned from theDeep Space Bar to say he was starting right away. And that's hardly atwo minutes walk.     Rosalind instantly started toward the outside door.     I'll check, she explained. Oh, Frieda, I've set the mike so you'llhear if Dotty calls.     Edmund threw up his hands. Very well, then, he said and walked over,switched on the picture and stared out moodily.     Theodor and Frieda got out their briefcases, switched on projectors,and began silently checking through their material.     Celeste fiddled with the TV and got a newscast. But she found her eyesdidn't want to absorb the blocks of print that rather swiftly succeededeach other, so, after a few moments, she shrugged impatiently andswitched to audio.     At the noise, the others looked around at her with surprise and someirritation, but in a few moments they were also listening.     The two rocket ships sent out from Mars Base to explore the orbitalpositions of Phobos and Deimos\u2014that is, the volume of space they'd beoccupying if their positions had remained normal\u2014report finding massesof dust and larger debris. The two masses of fine debris are movingin the same orbits and at the same velocities as the two vanishedmoons, and occupy roughly the same volumes of space, though the massof material is hardly a hundredth that of the moons. Physicists haveventured no statements as to whether this constitutes a confirmation ofthe Disintegration Hypothesis.     However, we're mighty pleased at this news here. There's a markedlessening of tension. The finding of the debris\u2014solid, tangiblestuff\u2014seems to lift the whole affair out of the supernatural miasma inwhich some of us have been tempted to plunge it. One-hundredth of themoons has been found.     The rest will also be!     Edmund had turned his back on the window. Frieda and Theodor hadswitched off their projectors.     Meanwhile, Earthlings are going about their business with a minimumof commotion, meeting with considerable calm the strange threat tothe fabric of their Solar System. Many, of course, are assembled inchurches and humanist temples. Kometevskyites have staged helicopterprocessions at Washington, Peking, Pretoria, and Christiana, demandingthat instant preparations be made for\u2014and I quote\u2014'Earth's comingleap through space.' They have also formally challenged all astronomersto produce an explanation other than the one contained in that strangebook so recently conjured from oblivion,      The Dance of the Planets     .     That about winds up the story for the present. There are no newreports from Interplanetary Radar, Astronomy, or the other rocket shipssearching in the extended Mars volume. Nor have any statements beenissued by the various groups working on the problem in Astrophysics,Cosmic Ecology, the Congress for the Discovery of New Purposes, and soforth. Meanwhile, however, we can take courage from the words of a poemwritten even before Dr. Kometevsky's book:   This Earth is not the steadfast place We landsmen build upon; From deep to deep she varies pace, And while she comes is gone. Beneath my feet I feel Her smooth bulk heave and dip; With velvet plunge and soft upreel She swings and steadies to her keel Like a gallant, gallant ship. "

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in LOST IN TRANSLATION?",
        "Summary_1": "Korvin sits in a cell after crash-landing on the planet of the Tr'en, which is populated by an extremely logical and intelligent humanoid race. Due to the speed of their scientific and technological advancements, the Comity of Planets will soon extend them an invitation, but Korvin believes they will not accept their offer. As a representative of Earth Central, he has been sent to Tr'en in order to find a way to prevent its people from marauding and settling other planets. In the days since Korvin's crash, the prison guards provide him with food and teach him the local language through drug hypnosis. He describes the language as \"stiff and slightly awkward\" but acknowledges its logical, meticulous construction. After several days imprisoned, a Tr'en named Didyak visits Korvin and informs him that he will be brought to The Ruler. When Korvin meets The Ruler--a massive, formidable Tr'en--he answers his questions to the best of his ability with respect to the logical constructions of the language. Korvin describes the physical appearance of adult humans as well as children, and The Ruler appears confused by the variations in height. The Ruler keeps emphasizing the importance of speaking with exactitude when communicating with the Tr'en. When Korvin claims his purpose on the planet was to crash-land his ship, The Ruler scoffs and orders him connected to a lie-detector machine for the duration of the questioning. After adjusting the lie-detector machine to Korvin's physiology, The Ruler continues his interrogation of Korvin, attempting to determine the true purpose of his mission on Tr'en. Adopting the Tr'en mode of providing extremely logical answers, Korvin claims his mission is to \"stay alive\", which frustrates The Ruler; he claims Korvin is trying to confuse him, so he calls upon his experts to help determine if the machine is faulty and analyze Korvin's responses. As the Tr'en broach the subject of Earth, they start to ask questions about its name, location, and finally, governance. Because the Tr'en receive and obey orders from one Ruler, they are completely perplexed by the concept of democracy where conflicting interests may contribute to a system of self-governance. In fact, they are so stumped by Korvin's responses that they continue this line of questioning for three days and are unsatisfied by what they consider to be his illogical, but truthful answers. On the third day, Korvin takes advantage of their lack of mental insight to escape prison and sends a message back to Earth Central informing them that he has accomplished his mission because the Tr'en will never be able to solve the problem of democracy.",
        "Summary_2": "Korvin, a human, had been siting isolated in a jail cell for three days on the Tr'en planet when Didyak, a member of the Tr'en, entered his cell. The Tr'en are somewhat humanoid, greenish beings, and Didyak was tall. Korvin had learned some of the Tr'en language under drug hypnosis but was frustrated with how literally Didyak took everything, so it took some time to determine that The Ruler had summoned Korvin for a conversation. This was what he wanted, though: Korvin had been sent to eliminate the threat the the Tr'en posed to the Comity of Planets and the rest of the galaxy because of how quickly their technology was developing. When he got to the Room of the Ruler, Korvin met The Ruler who was over seven feet tall, which was tall even for the Tr'en. The Ruler started with questions about how typical of a human Korvin was, and Korvin found himself apologizing for his race's inclination towards approximation over precision. They don't believe Korvin when he says that his job required he be on this planet, and the Tr'en brought out a lie detector that they built. Korvin was worried about the calibration of the machine, because he knew one misstep would mean death. After the machine was calibrated, the questioning continued, and the Tr'en had to accept that Korvin crashed his ship on purpose. Korvin's truth was not the truth that the Tr'en wanted, which Korvin used against the logic-led race. Experts in logic were called into the room, and Korvin quickly learned that logical paradoxes would not trick the Tr'en. He gave them just enough information for them to logically conclude, incorrectly, that Korvin was there to get help invading Earth. They discussed their respective forms of government, and when The Ruler asked who is in charge on Earth, Korvin refused to give away that information. This causes frustration, and the seed of confusion had been planted. Korvin asked them about their government, which has one being ruling everyone else. Korvin tried to explain that there is no one governor, and that everyone governs, which made no sense to the Tr'en. They did not understand how there was not a single ruler to make decisions; democracy seemed impossible to them. One of the experts insisted that Korvin was lying and that something must be wrong with the machine; they took a three-day break from questioning to investigate the issue only to conclude that nothing was wrong. On this third day, Korvin escaped. He knew the Tr'en couldn't conclude that it was an impossible problem, so their subconsciouses would prepare Korvin for an escape so that their conscious selves wouldn't have to admit that they did not have the answer. The story ends with Korvin heading back to Earth, sending a report back that the Tr'en would have to change their social structure to get the insight to answer the questions he left them with, meaning they were no longer a threat.",
        "Summary_3": "Korvin, a visitor from Earth, is held captive on a planet run by a race called the Tr'en. The Tr'en rely on logic and exact measurements to design their systems of governance, but Korvin's homeworld does not do quite the same. When the ruler of this world begins to question Korvin, they doubt he is telling the truth when he talks about how he crashed his ship on their planet on purpose. They wheel out a lie detector in order to tell if Korvin is telling the truth. The lie detector affirms his answers, but when Korvin starts to speak about his home world's politics, it is too much for the Tr'en to stand and one of his guards sets him free because they cannot cope with what they perceive as logical fallacies in the governance of Korvin's homeworld.",
        "Summary_4": "Korvin is a man from Earth who has landed on the planet of the Tr\u2019en. At the beginning of the story, he has been imprisoned in a jail cell and isolated for three days, causing him great boredom. Every night, he is hypnotized so his guards can teach him the Tr\u2019en language. Korvin has learned that the Tr\u2019en are literalists. After three days, a Tr\u2019en named Didyak comes to Korvin\u2019s cell and tells him the Ruler wants to speak with him. Korvin follows the rituals of the Tr\u2019en language and social norms, agreeing to see the Ruler. After all, Korvin\u2019s purpose is to remove the Tr\u2019en threat.\n\tThe Ruler asks Korvin several questions about his race, name, and sex and if his appearance is typical for a human. When Korvin offers a wide range of heights for humans, including \u201capproximately nine or ten inches,\u201d referring to children, the Ruler snaps at him that they ask for precision because the Tr\u2019en are scientific men. \n\tAs the Ruler asks him questions, Korvin answers truthfully but in ways that will not translate literally, thus confusing the Ruler. He has his people bring in a truth detector machine and hook it up to Korvin, testing it with a set of questions to which Korvin answers truthfully and ordering him to answer one untruthfully. These responses lead the Ruler to accept that the machine is calibrated accurately. The Ruler then returns to questioning Korvin, asking if he intentionally crashed his ship on their planet and what else his job entails after landing. Korvin says his job also involves staying alive, and the Ruler retorts that that is not the truth they want. \n\tKorvin has discerned that the Tr\u2019en are brilliant with math and physical science but know nothing about how the mind works. The Ruler calls in his experts for advice who explain to Korvin that they will not be confused by logical paradox. They tell Korvin his plan to confuse them is a failure, and Korvin says that is good. The experts conclude that Korvin must be a traitor to Earth and must want them to conquer it. When the Ruler asks Korvin an either/or question, Korvin answers, \u201cBoth,\u201d remaining intentionally ambiguous. When the Ruler asks about the government on Earth, Korvin answers that he cannot give him the explanation, but when he is pressed, Korvin pretends to try to be helpful, all the while, following through with his plan to confuse the Tr\u2019en by describing a democracy with everyone as the governor and no single ruler.\n\tAfter the experts decide their machine must be faulty, they put Korvin back in his cell but continue questioning him. He escapes after someone leaves a door unlocked and a weapon nearby. As he leaves the planet, he sends a message ahead that the Tr\u2019en are worrying over the meaning of democracy and will not be a threat because they will be so focused on the conundrum that they can\u2019t understand. \n",
        "Article": "What is it you wish? he barked. I understood in my discussions withthe other ... ah ... civilian there'd be no further need for theseirritating conferences.     I've just learned you're placing more students abroad, Mr. Gulver. Howmany this time?     Two thousand.     And where will they be going?     Croanie. It's all in the application form I've handed in. Your job isto provide transportation.     Will there be any other students embarking this season?     Why ... perhaps. That's Boge's business. Gulver looked at Retief withpursed lips. As a matter of fact, we had in mind dispatching anothertwo thousand to Featherweight.     Another under-populated world\u2014and in the same cluster, I believe,Retief said. Your people must be unusually interested in that regionof space.     If that's all you wanted to know, I'll be on my way. I have matters ofimportance to see to.     After Gulver left, Retief called Miss Furkle in. I'd like to have abreak-out of all the student movements that have been planned under thepresent program, he said. And see if you can get a summary of whatMEDDLE has been shipping lately.     Miss Furkle compressed her lips. If Mr. Magnan were here, I'm surehe wouldn't dream of interfering in the work of other departments.I ... overheard your conversation with the gentleman from the CroanieLegation\u2014     The lists, Miss Furkle.     I'm not accustomed, Miss Furkle said, to intruding in mattersoutside our interest cluster.     That's worse than listening in on phone conversations, eh? But nevermind. I need the information, Miss Furkle.     Loyalty to my Chief\u2014     Loyalty to your pay-check should send you scuttling for the materialI've asked for, Retief said. I'm taking full responsibility. Nowscat.     The buzzer sounded. Retief flipped a key. MUDDLE, Retief speaking....     Arapoulous's brown face appeared on the desk screen.     How-do, Retief. Okay if I come up?     Sure, Hank. I want to talk to you.     In the office, Arapoulous took a chair. Sorry if I'm rushing you,Retief, he said. But have you got anything for me?     Retief waved at the wine bottles. What do you know about Croanie?     Croanie? Not much of a place. Mostly ocean. All right if you likefish, I guess. We import our seafood from there. Nice prawns in monsoontime. Over a foot long.     You on good terms with them?     Sure, I guess so. Course, they're pretty thick with Boge.     So?     Didn't I tell you? Boge was the bunch that tried to take us over herea dozen years back. They'd've made it too, if they hadn't had a lot ofbad luck. Their armor went in the drink, and without armor they're easygame.     Miss Furkle buzzed. I have your lists, she said shortly.     Bring them in, please.   <doc-sep> Eric caught a faint nod here, a gesture there. Kroon nodded as ifin satisfaction. He turned to the girl, And what is your opinion,Daughter of the City?     Nolette's expression held sorrow, as if she looked into the far future.She said, He is Eric the Bronze. I have no doubt.     Eric asked, And what is this Legend of Eric the Bronze? Why am I sodespised in the city?     Kroon answered, According to the Ancient Legend you will destroy thecity. This, and other things.     Eric gaped. No wonder the crowd had shown such hatred. But why werethe elders so friendly? They were obviously the governing body, and ifthere was strife between them and the people it had not shown in therespect the crowd had accorded Nolette.     Kroon said, I see you are puzzled. Let me tell you the story of theCity. The City is old. It dates from long ago when the canals of Marsran clear and green with water, and the deserts were vineyards andgardens. The drouth came, and the changes in climate, and soon itbecame plain that the people of Mars were doomed. They had ships, andcould build more, and gradually they left to colonize other planets.Yet they could take little of their science. And fear and riotsdestroyed much. Also there were those who were filled with love forthis homeland, and who thought that one day it might be habitableagain. All the skill of the ancient Martian fathers went into thebuilding of a giant machine, the machine that is the City, to protect asmall colony of those who were chosen to remain on Mars.     This whole city is a machine! Eric asked.     Yes, or the product of one. The heart of it lies underneath our feet,in caverns beneath this building. The nature of the machine is this,that it translates thought into reality.     Eric stared. The idea was staggering.     This is essentially simple, although the technology is complex. It isnecessary to have a recording device, to capture thought, a transmutingdevice capable of transmuting the red dust of the desert into anysort of material desired, and a construction device, to assemble thismaterial into the pattern already recorded from thought. Kroon paused.You still doubt, my friend. Perhaps you are thirsty after your escape.Think strongly of a tall glass of cold water, visualize it in yourmind, the sight and the fluidity and the touch of it.     Eric did so. Without warning a glass of water stood on the table beforehim. He touched the water to his lips. It was cool and satisfying. Hedrank it, convinced completely.     Eric asked, And I am to destroy the City?     Yes. The time has come.     But why? Eric demanded. For an instant he could see the twinklingbeauty as clearly as if he had stood outside the walls of this building.     Kroon said, There are difficulties. The machine builds according tothe mass will of the people, though it is sensitive to the individualin areas where it does not conflict with the imagination of the mass.We have had strangers, visitors, and even our own people, who grewdrunk with the power of the machine, who dreamed more and more lust andgreed into existence. These were banished from the city, and so strongis the call of the city that many of them became victims of their ownevilness, and now walk mindlessly, with no thought but to seek for thebeauty they have lost here.     Kroon sighed. The people have lost the will to learn. Many do not evenknow of the machine. Our science is almost gone, and only a few of us,the dreamers, the elders, have kept alive the old knowledge of themachine and its history. By the collected powers of our imagination webuild and control the outward appearance of the city.     We have passed this down from father to son. A part of the ancientLegend is that the builders made provisions for the machine to bedestroyed when contact with outsiders had been made once again, so thatour people would again have to struggle forward to knowledge and power.The instrument of destruction was to be a man termed Eric the Bronze.It is not that you are reborn. It is just that sometime such a manwould come.     Eric said, I can understand the Bronze part. They had thought that aspace man might well be sun tanned. They had thought that a science toprotect against this beautiful illusion would provide a metal shieldof some sort, probably copper in nature. That such a man should comeis inevitable. But why Eric. Why the name Eric?     For the first time Nolette spoke. She said quietly, The name Ericwas an honorable name of the ancient fathers. It must have been theirthought that the new beginning should wait for some of their own farflung kind to return.     Eric nodded. He asked, What happens now?     Nothing. Dwell here with us and you will be safe from our people. Ifthe prediction is not soon fulfilled and you are not the Eric of theLegend, you may stay or go as you desire.     My brother, Garve. What about him?     He loves the city. He will also stay, though he will be outside thisbuilding. Kroon clasped his hands. Nolette, will you show Eric hisquarters?   <doc-sep>     LOST     IN     TRANSLATION     By     LARRY M.     HARRIS         In language translation, you may get a literally accurateword-for-word translation ... but miss the meaning entirely. And inspace-type translation ... the effect may be the same!         Illustrated by Schoenherr        The cell had been put together more efficiently than any Korvin hadever been in. But that was only natural, he told himself sadly; theTr'en were an efficient people. All the preliminary reports had agreedon that; their efficiency, as a matter of fact, was what had madeKorvin's arrival a necessity. They were well into the atomic era, andwere on the verge of developing space travel. Before long they'd besettling the other planets of their system, and then the nearer stars.Faster-than-light travel couldn't be far away, for the magnificentlyefficient physical scientists of the Tr'en\u2014and that would mean, inthe ordinary course of events, an invitation to join the Comity ofPlanets.     An invitation, the Comity was sure, which the Tr'en would not accept.     Korvin stretched out on the cell's single bunk, a rigid affair whichwas hardly meant for comfort, and sighed. He'd had three days ofisolation, with nothing to do but explore the resources of his ownmind. He'd tried some of the ancient Rhine experiments, but that wasno good; he still didn't show any particular psi talents. He couldn'tunlock the cell door with his unaided mind; he couldn't even alter theprobability of a single dust-mote's Brownian path through the somewhatsmelly air. Nor could he disappear from his cell and appear, as if bymagic, several miles away near the slightly-damaged hulk of his ship,to the wonder and amazement of his Tr'en captors.     He could do, as a matter of fact, precisely nothing. He wished quietlythat the Tr'en had seen fit to give him a pack of cards, or a book, oreven a folder of tourist pictures. The Wonders of Tr'en, according toall the advance reports, were likely to be pretty boring, but they'dhave been better than nothing.     In any decently-run jail, he told himself with indignation, therewould at least have been other prisoners to talk to. But on Tr'enKorvin was all alone.     True, every night the guards came in and gave him a concentratedlesson in the local language, but Korvin failed to get much pleasureout of that, being unconscious at the time. But now he was equipped todiscuss almost anything from philosophy to plumbing, but there wasnobody to discuss it with. He changed position on the bunk and staredat the walls. The Tr'en were efficient; there weren't even anyimperfections in the smooth surface to distract him.     He wasn't tired and he wasn't hungry; his captors had left him with afull stock of food concentrates.     But he was almightily bored, and about ready to tell anything toanyone, just for the chance at a little conversation.     As he reached this dismal conclusion, the cell door opened. Korvin gotup off the bunk in a hurry and spun around to face his visitor.     The Tr'en was tall, and slightly green.     He looked, as all the Tr'en did, vaguely humanoid\u2014that is, if youdon't bother to examine him closely. Life in the universe appeared tobe rigidly limited to humanoid types on oxygen planets; Korvin didn'tknow why, and neither did anybody else. There were a lot of theories,but none that accounted for all the facts satisfactorily. Korvinreally didn't care about it; it was none of his business.     The Tr'en regarded him narrowly through catlike pupils. You areKorvin, he said.     It was a ritual, Korvin had learned. You are of the Tr'en, hereplied. The green being nodded.     I am Didyak of the Tr'en, he said. Amenities over with, he relaxedslightly\u2014but no more than slightly\u2014and came into the cell, closingthe door behind him. Korvin thought of jumping the Tr'en, but decidedquickly against it. He was a captive, and it was unwise to assume thathis captors had no more resources than the ones he saw: a smalltranslucent pistollike affair in a holster at the Tr'en's side, and asmall knife in a sheath at the belt. Those Korvin could deal with; butthere might be almost anything else hidden and ready to fire on him.     What do you want with me? Korvin said. The Tr'en speech\u2014apparentlythere was only one language on the planet\u2014was stiff and slightlyawkward, but easily enough learned under drug hypnosis; it was themost rigorously logical construction of its kind Korvin had ever comeacross. It reminded him of some of the mathematical metalanguages he'ddealt with back on Earth, in training; but it was more closely andcarefully constructed than even those marvels.     I want nothing with you, Didyak said, leaning against thedoor-frame. You have other questions?     Korvin sighed. What are you doing here, then? he asked. Asconversation, it wasn't very choice; but it was, he admitted, betterthan solitude.     I am leaning against the door, Didyak said. The Tr'en literalistapproach to the smallest problems of everyday living was a little hardto get the hang of, Korvin told himself bitterly. He thought for asecond.     Why did you come to me? he said at last.     Didyak beamed at him. The sight was remarkably unpleasant, involvingas it did the disclosure of the Tr'en fifty-eight teeth, mostlypointed. Korvin stared back impassively. I have been ordered to cometo you, Didyak said, by the Ruler. The Ruler wishes to talk withyou.     It wasn't quite talk; that was a general word in the Tr'en language,and Didyak had used a specific meaning, roughly: gain informationfrom, by peaceful and vocal means. Korvin filed it away for futurereference. Why did the Ruler not come to me? Korvin asked.     The Ruler is the Ruler, Didyak said, slightly discomfited. You areto go to him. Such is his command.     Korvin shrugged, sighed and smoothed back his hair. I obey thecommand of the Ruler, he said\u2014another ritual. Everybody obeyed thecommand of the Ruler. If you didn't, you never had a second chance totry.     But Korvin meant exactly what he'd said. He was going to obey thecommands of the Ruler of the Tr'en\u2014and remove the Tr'en threat fromthe rest of the galaxy forever.     That, after all, was his job.  "

        "Query": "What is the role of the Ruler in the story \"Lost in Translation\"?",
        "Summary_1": "The Ruler is the sole governor of the Tr'en race. Characterized by their humanoid appearance, Tr'en are tall, greenish, and have four fingers. The Ruler himself is taller than most at seven-feet tall and is quite broad. The Tr'en are very logical and speak in a language almost mathematical in its clarity and precision. The Ruler epitomizes Tr'en commitment to logical inquiry. At first, The Ruler grills Korvin on his name, his race, his sex, and whether or not his appearance is normal for humanity. When Korvin's response regarding the variations in height amongst human adults and children, The Ruler is confounded. He also disbelieves Korvin's response regarding his purpose on Tr'en. Because of this, The Ruler orders Korvin to be hooked up to a lie detector. After adjusting the detector to Korvin's physiology, Korvin launches into a line of questioning regarding planet Earth, specifically the governance of it. When the experts monitoring the lie detector's reactions to Korvin's answers become baffled by his truth-telling in the face of seemingly illogical answers, The Ruler seemingly throws in the towel and lets the experts investigate the idea that Korvin is either lying or the machine is broken. In reality, Korvin has exploited a flaw in their logic--although they are masters of science, they have not mastered mental science. Only a grasp of mental science would allow the Tr'en to fathom humankind's embrace of democracy.",
        "Summary_2": "The Ruler is the head of the Tr'en government, and is a greenish humanoid who stands over seven feet tall. He makes all of the decisions for the race, and was appointed by the prior Ruler, which he feels is an important aspect of the consistency of the Tr'en leadership. The Ruler is the one who leads the interrogation of Korvin three days after his initial capture, and calls in the logic experts and the lie detector machine when he finds he needs assistance to understand what information Korvin is giving them. He is important to Korvin's plan: his goal after being captured is to talk to The Ruler, to plant some confusion in his head along with the logic experts. Korvin thinks that describing democracy to a society that is so single-authority oriented will force them to restructure their government if they want to try to understand the truths that Korvin presents them about Earth and related governments. ",
        "Summary_3": "The Ruler is the ruler of this planet. Anything the Ruler commands is done, without question. The Tr'en people rely on this type of governance as no other form of governance makes much sense to them. Someone must be in charge of shaping and then enforcing the rules. That is the Ruler's role, and in this story, he is taxed with questioning the prisoner Korvin in order to get to the bottom of his purpose for being on their planet. ",
        "Summary_4": "The Ruler is the autocratic leader of the Tr\u2019en. He is a large creature, more than seven feet tall and with a broad build. He has been trained by the previous Ruler, who was trained by the Ruler before him, and so on for past generations, ensuring that the society and its values do not change. The Ruler questions Korvin, trying to determine Korvin\u2019s ulterior motive for crash-landing his ship on the planet. Captives in his presence are closely guarded. The Ruler demands precision and exactitude in answers from Korvin, and when Korvin\u2019s responses are more figurative than literal, he sends for their truth-detector. As Korvin\u2019s answers remain intriguingly vague, which the Ruler cannot understand, he accuses Korvin of not telling the truth that he wants. He calls his experts for their advice, and they also question Korvin. The Ruler and his experts cannot understand Korvin\u2019s explanation of the government on Earth because his statements contradict their assumptions, especially about government. After a frustrating interrogation, the Ruler sends Korvin away but allows his experts to continue to question him in an attempt to understand what he says.",

That, after all, was his job.   <doc-sep> The name of your planet is Earth? the Ruler asked. A few minutes hadpassed; the experts were clustered around the single chair. Korvin wasstill strapped to the machine; a logical race makes use of a traitor,but a logical race does not trust him.     Sometimes, Korvin said.     It has other names? the Ruler said.     It has no name, Korvin said truthfully. The Tr'en idiom was like theEarthly one; and certainly a planet had no name. People attached namesto it, that was all. It had none of its own.     Yet you call it Earth? the Ruler said.     I do, Korvin said, for convenience.     Do you know its location? the Ruler said.     Not with exactitude, Korvin said.     There was a stir. But you can find it again, the Ruler said.     I can, Korvin said.     And you will tell us about it? the Ruler went on.     I will, Korvin said, so far as I am able.     We will wish to know about weapons, the Ruler said, and about plansand fortifications. But we must first know of the manner of decisionon this planet. Is your planet joined with others in a government ordoes it exist alone?     Korvin nearly smiled. Both, he said.     A short silence was broken by one of the attendant experts. We havetheorized that an underling may be permitted to make some of his owndecisions, leaving only the more extensive ones for the master. Thisseems to us inefficient and liable to error, yet it is a possiblesystem. Is it the system you mean?     Very sharp, Korvin told himself grimly. It is, he said.     Then the government which reigns over several planets is supreme,the Ruler said.     It is, Korvin said.     Who is it that governs? the Ruler said.     The key question had, at last, been asked. Korvin felt grateful thatthe logical Tr'en had determined to begin from the beginning, insteadof going off after details of armament first; it saved a lot of time.     The answer to that question, Korvin said, cannot be given to you.     Any question of fact has an answer, the Ruler snapped. A paradox isnot involved here; a government exists, and some being is thegovernor. Perhaps several beings share this task; perhaps machines dothe work. But where there is a government, there is a governor. Isthis agreed?     Certainly, Korvin said. It is completely obvious and true.     The planet from which you come is part of a system of planets whichare governed, you have said, the Ruler went on.     True, Korvin said.     Then there is a governor for this system, the Ruler said.     True, Korvin said again.     The ruler sighed gently. Explain this governor to us, he said.     Korvin shrugged. The explanation cannot be given to you.     The Ruler turned to a group of his experts and a short mutteredconversation took place. At its end the Ruler turned his gaze back toKorvin. Is the deficiency in you? he said. Are you in some wayunable to describe this government?     It can be described, Korvin said.     Then you will suffer unpleasant consequences if you describe it tous? the Ruler went on.     I will not, Korvin said.     It was the signal for another conference. With some satisfaction,Korvin noticed that the Tr'en were becoming slightly puzzled; theywere no longer moving and speaking with calm assurance.     The plan was taking hold.     The Ruler had finished his conference. You are attempting again toconfuse us, he said.     Korvin shook his head earnestly. I am attempting, he said, not toconfuse you.     Then I ask for an answer, the Ruler said.     I request that I be allowed to ask a question, Korvin said.     The Ruler hesitated, then nodded. Ask it, he said. We shall answerit if we see fit to do so.     Korvin tried to look grateful. Well, then, he said, what is yourgovernment?     The Ruler beckoned to a heavy-set green being, who stepped forwardfrom a knot of Tr'en, inclined his head in Korvin's direction, andbegan. Our government is the only logical form of government, hesaid in a high, sweet tenor. The Ruler orders all, and his subjectsobey. In this way uniformity is gained, and this uniformity aids inthe speed of possible action and in the weight of action. All Tr'enact instantly in the same manner. The Ruler is adopted by the previousRuler; in this way we are assured of a common wisdom and a steadyjudgment.     You have heard our government defined, the Ruler said. Now, youwill define yours for us.     Korvin shook his head. If you insist, he said, I'll try it. But youwon't understand it.     The Ruler frowned. We shall understand, he said. Begin. Who governsyou?     None, Korvin said.     But you are governed?     Korvin nodded. Yes.     Then there is a governor, the Ruler insisted.     True, Korvin said. But everyone is the governor.     Then there is no government, the Ruler said. There is no singledecision.     No, Korvin said equably, there are many decisions binding on all.     Who makes them binding? the Ruler asked. Who forces you to acceptthese decisions? Some of them must be unfavorable to some beings?     Many of them are unfavorable, Korvin said. But we are not forced toaccept them.     Do you act against your own interests?     Korvin shrugged. Not knowingly, he said. The Ruler flashed a look atthe technicians handling the lie-detector. Korvin turned to see theirexpression. They needed no words; the lie-detector was telling them,perfectly obviously, that he was speaking the truth. But the truthwasn't making any sense. I told you you wouldn't understand it, hesaid.     It is a defect in your explanation, the Ruler almost snarled.     My explanation is as exact as it can be, he said.     The Ruler breathed gustily. Let us try something else, he said.Everyone is the governor. Do you share a single mind? A racial mindhas been theorized, though we have met with no examples\u2014     Neither have we, Korvin said. We are all individuals, likeyourselves.     But with no single ruler to form policy, to make decisions\u2014     We have no need of one, Korvin said calmly.     Ah, the Ruler said suddenly, as if he saw daylight ahead. And whynot?     We call our form of government      democracy     , Korvin said. It meansthe rule of the people. There is no need for another ruler.     One of the experts piped up suddenly. The beings themselves rule eachother? he said. This is clearly impossible; for, no one being canhave the force to compel acceptance of his commands. Without hisforce, there can be no effective rule.     That is our form of government, Korvin said.     You are lying, the expert said.     One of the technicians chimed in: The machine tells us\u2014     Then the machine is faulty, the expert said. It will be corrected.     Korvin wondered, as the technicians argued, how long they'd takestudying the machine, before they realized it didn't have any defectsto correct. He hoped it wasn't going to be too long; he could foreseeanother stretch of boredom coming. And, besides, he was gettinghomesick.     It took three days\u2014but boredom never really had a chance to set in.Korvin found himself the object of more attention than he had hopedfor; one by one, the experts came to his cell, each with a differentmethod of resolving the obvious contradictions in his statements.     Some of them went away fuming. Others simply went away, puzzled.     On the third day Korvin escaped.     It wasn't very difficult; he hadn't thought it would be. Even the mostlogical of thinking beings has a subconscious as well as a consciousmind, and one of the ways of dealing with an insoluble problem is tomake the problem disappear. There were only two ways of doing that,and killing the problem's main focus was a little more complicated.That couldn't be done by the subconscious mind; the conscious had tointervene somewhere. And it couldn't.     Because that would mean recognizing, fully and consciously, that theproblem      was     insoluble. And the Tr'en weren't capable of that sort ofthinking.     Korvin thanked his lucky stars that their genius had been restrictedto the physical and mathematical. Any insight at all into the mentalsciences would have given them the key to his existence, and hisentire plan, within seconds.     But, then, it was lack of that insight that had called for thisparticular plan. That, and the political structure of the Tr'en.     The same lack of insight let the Tr'en subconscious work on hisescape without any annoying distractions in the way of deepreflection. Someone left a door unlocked and a weapon nearby\u2014allquite intent, Korvin was sure. Getting to the ship was a little morecomplicated, but presented no new problems; he was airborne, and thenspace-borne, inside of a few hours after leaving the cell.     He set his course, relaxed, and cleared his mind. He had no psionictalents, but the men at Earth Central did; he couldn't receivemessages, but he could send them. He sent one now.       Mission accomplished; the Tr'en aren't about to comemarauding out into space too soon. They've been given foodfor thought\u2014nice indigestible food that's going to stick intheir craws until they finally manage to digest it. But theycan't digest it and stay what they are; you've got to bedemocratic, to some extent, to understand the idea. Whatkeeps us obeying laws we ourselves make? What keeps usobeying laws that make things inconvenient for us? Sheerself-interest, of course\u2014but try to make a Tr'en see it!         With one government and one language, they just weren'tequipped for translation. They were too efficient physicallyto try for the mental sciences at all. No mental sciences,no insight into my mind or their own\u2014and that means notranslation.         But\u2014damn it\u2014I wish I were home already.         I'm bored absolutely stiff!       THE END    <doc-sep> The Ruler looked to his technicians for a signal, and nodded onreceiving it. You will tell an untruth now, he said. Are youstanding or sitting?     I am standing, Korvin said.     The technicians gave another signal. The Ruler looked, in his frowningmanner, reasonably satisfied. The machine, he announced, has beenadjusted satisfactorily to your physiology. The questioning will nowcontinue.     Korvin swallowed again. The test hadn't really seemed extensive enoughto him. But, after all, the Tr'en knew their business, better thananyone else could know it. They had the technique and the logic andthe training.     He hoped they were right.     The Ruler was frowning at him. Korvin did his best to look receptive.Why did you land your ship on this planet? the Ruler said.     My job required it, Korvin said.     The Ruler nodded. Your job is to crash your ship, he said. It iswasteful but the machines tell me it is true. Very well, then; weshall find out more about your job. Was the crash intentional?     Korvin looked sober. Yes, he said.     The Ruler blinked. Very well, he said. Was your job ended when theship crashed? The Tr'en word, of course, wasn't      ended     , nor did itmean exactly that. As nearly as Korvin could make out, it meantdisposed of for all time.     No, he said.     What else does your job entail? the Ruler said.     Korvin decided to throw his first spoke into the wheel. Stayingalive.     The Ruler roared. Do not waste time with the obvious! he shouted.Do not try to trick us; we are a logical and scientific race! Answercorrectly.     I have told the truth, Korvin said.     But it is not\u2014not the truth we want, the Ruler said.     Korvin shrugged. I replied to your question, he said. I did notknow that there was more than one kind of truth. Surely the truth isthe truth, just as the Ruler is the Ruler?     I\u2014 The Ruler stopped himself in mid-roar. You try to confuse theRuler, he said at last, in an approximation of his usual one. Butthe Ruler will not be confused. We have experts in matters oflogic\u2014the Tr'en word seemed to mean      right-saying     \u2014who will advisethe Ruler. They will be called.     Korvin's guards were standing around doing nothing of importance nowthat their captor was strapped down in the lie-detector. The Rulergestured and they went out the door in a hurry.     The Ruler looked down at Korvin. You will find that you cannot trickus, he said. You will find that such fiddling\u2014      chulad-like     Korvintranslated\u2014attempts will get you nowhere.     Korvin devoutly hoped so.  "

        "Query": "What role does translation play in the narrative of LOST IN TRANSLATION?",
        "Summary_1": "After Korvin crash-lands on Tr\u2019en, he is captured and imprisoned for several days before he wakes up. During that time, the prison guards teach him the Tr\u2019en language via hypnop\u00e6dic language instruction. He learns the language is closer to mathematical metalanguage and is centered in logic and clarity. As a result, Korvin has to adjust the way he speaks in order to make sure to convey what he really means in his conversations with Didyak and when he responds to The Ruler's line of questioning. Because the Tr'en language requires perfect logic, Korvin's answers to The Ruler's questions confuse The Ruler and his group of experts that examine the lie detector and confer to determine if Korvin is telling the truth or beating the system somehow. Translation ultimately saves Korvin since the Tr'en are unable to logically process the concept of democracy, and they will spend an endless amount of time trying to solve that problem instead of advancing to the point where they will maraud and settle others in the Comity of Planets.",
        "Summary_2": "Translation is at the core of the story because Korvin has to rely on the logical nature of the Tr'en language to try to throw the Tr'en people off. Because of the lived experiences of the Tr'en people, with their specific government style, and their literal approach to communication, Korvin is able to give them enough information about why he is there to be telling the truth without giving away his true motives. He hopes that this will spur them to try democracy in an attempt to understand the nature of the government on Earth, which will break their current habits and hopefully slow down their technological progress. It is the way that the groups of people must translate as they communicate that allows Korvin to confuse the masters of logic in the end. ",
        "Summary_3": "The Tr'en language has words that have more exact meanings than words in the English language. As a result, the true intent of the speaker is better conveyed. Korvin learns the Tr'en language while he is their captive, and he picks up on the nuance so well that he can understand the exact meaning and intent of the Tr'en when they speak to them, and thus use this to his advantage. Korvin can mask his own intent since his own language, the language of Earth, is less literal and capable of more complexity.",
        "Summary_4": "   The Tr\u2019en society is based on straightforward communication and literal interpretation of every spoken word. This is presumably why they teach Korvin their language, enabling him to communicate with them directly without an interpreter. However, the Tr\u2019ens\u2019 exclusive focus on math and the physical sciences creates a significant weakness that Korvin exploits: they have no understanding of their own or others\u2019 mental capacity and nuances of language and, therefore, no ability to interpret anything they consider illogical. When Didyak uses the word \u201ctalk\u201d that means to \u201cgain information from, by peaceful and vocal means,\u201d Korvin realizes that he will be able to save himself and his mission by communicating with the Tr\u2019ens in a way that literally answers their questions without giving away his true mission of stopping the Tr\u2019en\u2019s advancement into the galaxy. \n     When the Ruler tries to find out Korvin\u2019s purpose for intentionally crashing his ship and if he has other intentions, Korvin\u2019s responses are forthright in a literal sense: yes, he crashed his ship on purpose, no his job isn\u2019t ended, now his job is to stay alive.       \n     Completely flummoxed, the Ruler calls in his experts in logic to question Korvin further, and based on his answers, they logically conclude that he is a traitor to Earth and is there to help the Tr\u2019ens overthrow Earth. Korvin also confuses the Tr\u2019ens with his explanation of Earth\u2019s democracy. Their frustration ends the hearing before the Ruler, but the experts continue to question Korvin in his cell. \n     It becomes clear to the experts that their lie-detecting machine is not faulty, but they cannot understand Korvin\u2019s explanations. So on the third day after being called to the Ruler, Korvin finds an unlocked door and a weapon, enabling him to escape and thus solving their insolvable problem. Korvin knows that the Tr\u2019en will be obsessed with trying to understand the democratic ideas that he described and that they will never be able to understand them without changing themselves. They are incapable of translating his responses in the context of their very literal society.\n",
        "Article": "    LOST     IN     TRANSLATION     By     LARRY M.     HARRIS         In language translation, you may get a literally accurateword-for-word translation ... but miss the meaning entirely. And inspace-type translation ... the effect may be the same!         Illustrated by Schoenherr        The cell had been put together more efficiently than any Korvin hadever been in. But that was only natural, he told himself sadly; theTr'en were an efficient people. All the preliminary reports had agreedon that; their efficiency, as a matter of fact, was what had madeKorvin's arrival a necessity. They were well into the atomic era, andwere on the verge of developing space travel. Before long they'd besettling the other planets of their system, and then the nearer stars.Faster-than-light travel couldn't be far away, for the magnificentlyefficient physical scientists of the Tr'en\u2014and that would mean, inthe ordinary course of events, an invitation to join the Comity ofPlanets.     An invitation, the Comity was sure, which the Tr'en would not accept.     Korvin stretched out on the cell's single bunk, a rigid affair whichwas hardly meant for comfort, and sighed. He'd had three days ofisolation, with nothing to do but explore the resources of his ownmind. He'd tried some of the ancient Rhine experiments, but that wasno good; he still didn't show any particular psi talents. He couldn'tunlock the cell door with his unaided mind; he couldn't even alter theprobability of a single dust-mote's Brownian path through the somewhatsmelly air. Nor could he disappear from his cell and appear, as if bymagic, several miles away near the slightly-damaged hulk of his ship,to the wonder and amazement of his Tr'en captors.     He could do, as a matter of fact, precisely nothing. He wished quietlythat the Tr'en had seen fit to give him a pack of cards, or a book, oreven a folder of tourist pictures. The Wonders of Tr'en, according toall the advance reports, were likely to be pretty boring, but they'dhave been better than nothing.     In any decently-run jail, he told himself with indignation, therewould at least have been other prisoners to talk to. But on Tr'enKorvin was all alone.     True, every night the guards came in and gave him a concentratedlesson in the local language, but Korvin failed to get much pleasureout of that, being unconscious at the time. But now he was equipped todiscuss almost anything from philosophy to plumbing, but there wasnobody to discuss it with. He changed position on the bunk and staredat the walls. The Tr'en were efficient; there weren't even anyimperfections in the smooth surface to distract him.     He wasn't tired and he wasn't hungry; his captors had left him with afull stock of food concentrates.     But he was almightily bored, and about ready to tell anything toanyone, just for the chance at a little conversation.     As he reached this dismal conclusion, the cell door opened. Korvin gotup off the bunk in a hurry and spun around to face his visitor.     The Tr'en was tall, and slightly green.     He looked, as all the Tr'en did, vaguely humanoid\u2014that is, if youdon't bother to examine him closely. Life in the universe appeared tobe rigidly limited to humanoid types on oxygen planets; Korvin didn'tknow why, and neither did anybody else. There were a lot of theories,but none that accounted for all the facts satisfactorily. Korvinreally didn't care about it; it was none of his business.     The Tr'en regarded him narrowly through catlike pupils. You areKorvin, he said.     It was a ritual, Korvin had learned. You are of the Tr'en, hereplied. The green being nodded.     I am Didyak of the Tr'en, he said. Amenities over with, he relaxedslightly\u2014but no more than slightly\u2014and came into the cell, closingthe door behind him. Korvin thought of jumping the Tr'en, but decidedquickly against it. He was a captive, and it was unwise to assume thathis captors had no more resources than the ones he saw: a smalltranslucent pistollike affair in a holster at the Tr'en's side, and asmall knife in a sheath at the belt. Those Korvin could deal with; butthere might be almost anything else hidden and ready to fire on him.     What do you want with me? Korvin said. The Tr'en speech\u2014apparentlythere was only one language on the planet\u2014was stiff and slightlyawkward, but easily enough learned under drug hypnosis; it was themost rigorously logical construction of its kind Korvin had ever comeacross. It reminded him of some of the mathematical metalanguages he'ddealt with back on Earth, in training; but it was more closely andcarefully constructed than even those marvels.     I want nothing with you, Didyak said, leaning against thedoor-frame. You have other questions?     Korvin sighed. What are you doing here, then? he asked. Asconversation, it wasn't very choice; but it was, he admitted, betterthan solitude.     I am leaning against the door, Didyak said. The Tr'en literalistapproach to the smallest problems of everyday living was a little hardto get the hang of, Korvin told himself bitterly. He thought for asecond.     Why did you come to me? he said at last.     Didyak beamed at him. The sight was remarkably unpleasant, involvingas it did the disclosure of the Tr'en fifty-eight teeth, mostlypointed. Korvin stared back impassively. I have been ordered to cometo you, Didyak said, by the Ruler. The Ruler wishes to talk withyou.     It wasn't quite talk; that was a general word in the Tr'en language,and Didyak had used a specific meaning, roughly: gain informationfrom, by peaceful and vocal means. Korvin filed it away for futurereference. Why did the Ruler not come to me? Korvin asked.     The Ruler is the Ruler, Didyak said, slightly discomfited. You areto go to him. Such is his command.     Korvin shrugged, sighed and smoothed back his hair. I obey thecommand of the Ruler, he said\u2014another ritual. Everybody obeyed thecommand of the Ruler. If you didn't, you never had a second chance totry.     But Korvin meant exactly what he'd said. He was going to obey thecommands of the Ruler of the Tr'en\u2014and remove the Tr'en threat fromthe rest of the galaxy forever.     That, after all, was his job.   <doc-sep> Commander Eagan said, You'd better find some new way of amusingyourself, Jones. Have you read General Order 17?     Isobar said, I seen it. But if you think\u2014     It says, stated Eagan deliberately, '      In order that work or restperiods of the Dome's staff may not be disturbed, it is hereby orderedthat the playing or practicing of all or any musical instruments mustbe discontinued immediately. By order of the Dome Commander     ,' Thatmeans you, Jones!     But, dingbust it! keened Isobar, it don't disturb nobody for me toplay my bagpipes! I know these lunks around here don't appreciate goodmusic, so I always go in my office and lock the door after me\u2014     But the Dome, pointed out Commander Eagan, has an air-conditioningsystem which can't be shut off. The ungodly moans ofyour\u2014er\u2014so-called musical instrument can be heard through the entirestructure.     He suddenly seemed to gain stature.     No, Jones, this order is final! You cannot disrupt our entireorganization for your own\u2014er\u2014amusement.     But\u2014 said Isobar.     No!     Isobar wriggled desperately. Life on Luna was sorry enough already.If now they took from him the last remaining solace he had, the lastamusement which lightened his moments of freedom\u2014     Look, Commander! he pleaded, I tell you what I'll do. I won't bothernobody. I'll go Outside and play it\u2014     Outside! Eagan stared at him incredulously. Are you mad? How aboutthe Grannies?     Isobar knew all about the Grannies. The only mobile form of lifefound by space-questing man on Earth's satellite, their name was anabbreviation of the descriptive one applied to them by the first Lunarexployers: Granitebacks. This was no exaggeration; if anything, it wasan understatement. For the Grannies, though possessed of certain lowintelligence, had quickly proven themselves a deadly, unyielding andimplacable foe.     Worse yet, they were an enemy almost indestructible! No man had everyet brought to Earth laboratories the carcass of a Grannie; sciencewas completely baffled in its endeavors to explain the composition ofGraniteback physiology\u2014but it was known, from bitter experience, thatthe carapace or exoskeleton of the Grannies was formed of somethingharder than steel, diamond, or battleplate! This flesh could bepenetrated by no weapon known to man; neither by steel nor flame,by electronic nor ionic wave, nor by the lethal, newly discoveredatomo-needle dispenser.     All this Isobar knew about the Grannies. Yet:     They ain't been any Grannies seen around the Dome, he said, fora 'coon's age. Anyhow, if I seen any comin', I could run right backinside\u2014     No! said Commander Eagan flatly. Absolutely,      no     ! I have no timefor such nonsense. You know the orders\u2014obey them! And now, gentlemen,good afternoon!     He left. Sparks turned to Isobar, grinning.     Well, he said, one man's fish\u2014hey, Jonesy? Too bad you can't playyour doodlesack any more, but frankly, I'm just as glad. Of all theawful screeching wails\u2014     But Isobar Jones, generally mild and gentle, was now in a perfectfury. His pale eyes blazed, he stomped his foot on the floor, and fromhis lips poured a stream of such angry invective that Riley lookedstartled. Words that, to Isobar, were the utter dregs of violentprofanity.     Oh, dagnab it! fumed Isobar Jones. Oh, tarnation and dingbust!Oh\u2014      fiddlesticks     !      II     And so, chuckled Riley, he left, bubbling like a kettle on a red-hotoven. But, boy! was he ever mad! Just about ready to bust, he was.     Some minutes had passed since Isobar had left; Riley was talking to Dr.Loesch, head of the Dome's Physics Research Division. The older mannodded commiseratingly.     It is funny, yes, he agreed, but at the same time it is notaltogether amusing. I feel sorry for him. He is a very unhappy man, ourpoor Isobar.     Yeah, I know, said Riley, but, hell, we all get a little bithomesick now and then. He ought to learn to\u2014     Excuse me, my boy, interrupted the aged physicist, his voice gentle,it is not mere homesickness that troubles our friend. It is somethingdeeper, much more vital and serious. It is what my people call:      weltschmertz     . There is no accurate translation in English. It means'world sickness,' or better, 'world weariness'\u2014something like that butintensified a thousandfold.     It is a deeply-rooted mental condition, sometimes a dangerous frameof mind. Under its grip, men do wild things. Hating the world on whichthey find themselves, they rebel in curious ways. Suicide ... mad actsof valor ... deeds of cunning or knavery....     You mean, demanded Sparks anxiously, Isobar ain't got all hisbuttons?     Not that exactly. He is perfectly sane. But he is in a dark morassof despair. He may try      anything     to retrieve his lost happiness, ridhis soul of its dark oppression. His world-sickness is like a cryinghunger\u2014By the way, where is he now?     Below, I guess. In his quarters.     Ah, good! Perhaps he is sleeping. Let us hope so. In slumber he willfind peace and forgetfulness.     But Dr. Loesch would have been far less sanguine had some power thegiftie gi'en him of watching Isobar Jones at that moment.     Isobar was not asleep. Far from it. Wide awake and very much astir, hewas acting in a singularly sinister role: that of a slinking, furtiveculprit.     Returning to his private cubicle after his conversation with DomeCommander Eagan, he had stalked straightway to the cabinet wherein wasencased his precious set of bagpipes. These he had taken from theirpegs, gazed upon defiantly, and fondled with almost parental affection.     So I can't play you, huh? he muttered darkly. It disturbs the peaceo' the dingfounded, dumblasted Dome staff, does it? Well, we'll      see     about that!     And tucking the bag under his arm, he had cautiously slipped from theroom, down little-used corridors, and now he stood before the huge      impervite     gates which were the entrance to the Dome and the doorwayto Outside.     On all save those occasions when a spacecraft landed in the cradleadjacent the gateway, these portals were doubly locked and barred. Buttoday they had been unbolted that the two maintenance men might ventureout. And since it was quite possible that Brown and Roberts might haveto get inside in a hurry, their bolts remained drawn. Sole guardian ofthe entrance was a very bored Junior Patrolman.     Up to this worthy strode Isobar Jones, confident and assured, exudingan aura of propriety.     Very well, Wilkins, he said. I'll take over now. You may go to themeeting.     Wilkins looked at him bewilderedly.     Huh? Whuzzat, Mr. Jones?     Isobar's eyebrows arched.     You mean you haven't been notified?     Notified of      what     ?     Why, the general council of all Patrolmen! Weren't you told that Iwould take your place here while you reported to G.H.Q.?     I ain't, puzzled Wilkins, heard nothing about it. Maybe I ought tocall the office, maybe?     And he moved the wall-audio. But Isobar said swiftly. That\u2014er\u2014won'tbe necessary, Wilkins. My orders were plain enough. Now, you just runalong. I'll watch this entrance for you.     We-e-ell, said Wilkins, if you say so. Orders is orders. But keep asharp eye out, Mister Jones, in case Roberts and Brown should come backsudden-like.     I will, promised Isobar, don't worry.   <doc-sep> Looks okay to me, I said. Quade passed a gauntlet over his faceplate.It's real. I can blur it with a smudged visor. When it blurs, it'ssolid.     The landscape beyond the black corona left by our landing rockets wasunimpressive. The rocky desert was made up of silicon and iron oxide,so it looked much the same as a terrestrial location. Yellowish-whitesand ran up to and around reddish brown rock clawing into the pinksunlight.     I don't understand it, Quade admitted. Transphasia hits you a foulas soon as you let it into the airlock.     Apparently, Quade,      this     thing is going to creep up on us.     Don't sound smug, Captain. It's pitty-pattying behind you too.     The keening call across the surface of consciousness postponed my reply.     The wail was ominously forlorn, defiant of description. I turned myhead around slowly inside my helmet, not even sure that I had heard it.     But what else can you do with a wail but      hear     it?     Quade nodded. I've felt this before. It usually hits sooner. Let'strace it.     I don't like this, I admitted. It's not at all what I expected fromwhat you said about transphasia. It must be something else.     It couldn't be anything else. I know what to expect. You don't. Youmay begin smelling sensations, tasting sounds, hearing sights, seeingtastes, touching odors\u2014or any other combination. Don't let it botheryou.     Of course not. I'll soothe my nerves by counting little shocks oflanolin jumping over a loud fence.     Quade grinned behind his faceplate. Good idea.     Then you can have it. I'm going to try keeping my eyes open andstaying alive.     There was no reply.     His expression was tart and greasy despite all his light talk, andI knew mine was the same. I tested the security rope between ourpressure suits. It was a taut and virile bass.     We scaled a staccato of rocks, our suits grinding pepper against ourhides.     The musk summit rose before us, a minor-key horizon with a shiftingtreble for as far as I could smell. It was primitive beauty that madeyou feel shocking pink inside. The most beautiful vista I had evertasted, it couldn't be dulled even by the sensation of beef broth undermy skin.     Is this transphasia? I asked in awe.     It always has been before, Quade remarked. Ready to swallow yourwords about this being something an old hand wouldn't recognize,Captain?     I'm swallowing no words until I find out precisely how they tastehere.     Not a bad taste. They're pretty. Or haven't you noticed?     Quade, you're right! About the colors anyway. This reminds me of anilliscope recording from a cybernetic translator.     It should. I don't suppose we could understand each other if it wasn'tfor our morphistudy courses in reading cross-sense translations ofCentauri blushtalk and the like.     It became difficult to understand him, difficult to try talking in theface of such splendor. You never really appreciate colors until yousmell them for the first time.  "

        "Summary_1": "Didyak is a Tr'en from the planet Tr'en, and he is tall, slightly green, vaguely humanoid, and has cat-like pupils. Didyak is the first Tr'en that Korvin encounters after waking up in the days following his crash.

Didyak carries a small weapon that is translucent and looks like a pistol; he also carries a small knife attached to his belt. Didyak's speech is stiff and slightly awkward, much like the rest of the Tr'en, and he speaks with very careful attention paid to the construction of each sentence in order to express perfect logic.

Didyak is the first Tr'en who Korvin had a conversation with after having learned the Tr'en language under drug hypnosis, which gave him practice in the customs of conversation and the logical, literal nature of the Tr'en discourse. Didyak is also the first experience the reader has with this language, and learns more about the knowledge Korvin comes into his mission with through this exchange.",
        "Summary_3": "Didyak is the Tr'en who arrives at Korvin's cell in order to take him to the Ruler. Didyak is the first being with which Korvin has had any interaction in a long time, so Korvin is happy to talk with Didyak and to work on using the correct Tr'en words to convey his exact meaning. Didyak answers Korvin's questions in a very literal sense, which is customary among the Tr'en people. Didyak explains that he must take Korvin to the Ruler and that the Ruler is going to question him in a way that is meant to gather information.",
        "Summary_4": "Didyak is a tall, green Tr\u2019en who, like all Tr\u2019en, looks somewhat humanoid. He comes to Korvin\u2019s cell after Korvin has been held in solitary confinement for three days. His initial conversation with Korvin follows the Tr\u2019en ritual in which Didyak says who Korvin is and Korvin says who Didyak is (\u201cof the Tr\u2019en\u201d). Didyak seems to be a guard because he has access to Korvin and enters his cell; he also carries a small translucent pistol-like weapon along with a knife in a sheath. After introducing each other, Didyak waits for Korvin to speak, and when he does, he asks what Didyak wants with him; Didyak answers that he wants nothing with Korvin. This response reminds Korvin of what he has learned of the Tr\u2019en; they are extremely literal, more inclined to mathematical and scientific thinking. And when Korvin asks what Didyak is doing there, he again answers literally, stating that he is leaning against the door. When Korvin finally asks a specific question that can only be answered literally, Didyak beams at him as if he is pleased that Korvin finally understands what he needs to say. Didyak tells him that he has been ordered to take Korvin to the Ruler, who wants to talk with him. Didyak escorts Korvin to the Ruler, but his interaction with Korvin has proven a stark reminder of how the Tr\u2019ens think and that Korvin needs to be mindful of how he speaks to them. The interaction with Didyak also gives Korvin his plan for how he will thwart the Tr\u2019ens\u2019 anticipated expansion to other planets.\n",
        "Article": "    LOST     IN     TRANSLATION     By     LARRY M.     HARRIS         In language translation, you may get a literally accurateword-for-word translation ... but miss the meaning entirely. And inspace-type translation ... the effect may be the same!         Illustrated by Schoenherr        The cell had been put together more efficiently than any Korvin hadever been in. But that was only natural, he told himself sadly; theTr'en were an efficient people. All the preliminary reports had agreedon that; their efficiency, as a matter of fact, was what had madeKorvin's arrival a necessity. They were well into the atomic era, andwere on the verge of developing space travel. Before long they'd besettling the other planets of their system, and then the nearer stars.Faster-than-light travel couldn't be far away, for the magnificentlyefficient physical scientists of the Tr'en\u2014and that would mean, inthe ordinary course of events, an invitation to join the Comity ofPlanets.     An invitation, the Comity was sure, which the Tr'en would not accept.     Korvin stretched out on the cell's single bunk, a rigid affair whichwas hardly meant for comfort, and sighed. He'd had three days ofisolation, with nothing to do but explore the resources of his ownmind. He'd tried some of the ancient Rhine experiments, but that wasno good; he still didn't show any particular psi talents. He couldn'tunlock the cell door with his unaided mind; he couldn't even alter theprobability of a single dust-mote's Brownian path through the somewhatsmelly air. Nor could he disappear from his cell and appear, as if bymagic, several miles away near the slightly-damaged hulk of his ship,to the wonder and amazement of his Tr'en captors.     He could do, as a matter of fact, precisely nothing. He wished quietlythat the Tr'en had seen fit to give him a pack of cards, or a book, oreven a folder of tourist pictures. The Wonders of Tr'en, according toall the advance reports, were likely to be pretty boring, but they'dhave been better than nothing.     In any decently-run jail, he told himself with indignation, therewould at least have been other prisoners to talk to. But on Tr'enKorvin was all alone.     True, every night the guards came in and gave him a concentratedlesson in the local language, but Korvin failed to get much pleasureout of that, being unconscious at the time. But now he was equipped todiscuss almost anything from philosophy to plumbing, but there wasnobody to discuss it with. He changed position on the bunk and staredat the walls. The Tr'en were efficient; there weren't even anyimperfections in the smooth surface to distract him.     He wasn't tired and he wasn't hungry; his captors had left him with afull stock of food concentrates.     But he was almightily bored, and about ready to tell anything toanyone, just for the chance at a little conversation.     As he reached this dismal conclusion, the cell door opened. Korvin gotup off the bunk in a hurry and spun around to face his visitor.     The Tr'en was tall, and slightly green.     He looked, as all the Tr'en did, vaguely humanoid\u2014that is, if youdon't bother to examine him closely. Life in the universe appeared tobe rigidly limited to humanoid types on oxygen planets; Korvin didn'tknow why, and neither did anybody else. There were a lot of theories,but none that accounted for all the facts satisfactorily. Korvinreally didn't care about it; it was none of his business.     The Tr'en regarded him narrowly through catlike pupils. You areKorvin, he said.     It was a ritual, Korvin had learned. You are of the Tr'en, hereplied. The green being nodded.     I am Didyak of the Tr'en, he said. Amenities over with, he relaxedslightly\u2014but no more than slightly\u2014and came into the cell, closingthe door behind him. Korvin thought of jumping the Tr'en, but decidedquickly against it. He was a captive, and it was unwise to assume thathis captors had no more resources than the ones he saw: a smalltranslucent pistollike affair in a holster at the Tr'en's side, and asmall knife in a sheath at the belt. Those Korvin could deal with; butthere might be almost anything else hidden and ready to fire on him.     What do you want with me? Korvin said. The Tr'en speech\u2014apparentlythere was only one language on the planet\u2014was stiff and slightlyawkward, but easily enough learned under drug hypnosis; it was themost rigorously logical construction of its kind Korvin had ever comeacross. It reminded him of some of the mathematical metalanguages he'ddealt with back on Earth, in training; but it was more closely andcarefully constructed than even those marvels.     I want nothing with you, Didyak said, leaning against thedoor-frame. You have other questions?     Korvin sighed. What are you doing here, then? he asked. Asconversation, it wasn't very choice; but it was, he admitted, betterthan solitude.     I am leaning against the door, Didyak said. The Tr'en literalistapproach to the smallest problems of everyday living was a little hardto get the hang of, Korvin told himself bitterly. He thought for asecond.     Why did you come to me? he said at last.     Didyak beamed at him. The sight was remarkably unpleasant, involvingas it did the disclosure of the Tr'en fifty-eight teeth, mostlypointed. Korvin stared back impassively. I have been ordered to cometo you, Didyak said, by the Ruler. The Ruler wishes to talk withyou.     It wasn't quite talk; that was a general word in the Tr'en language,and Didyak had used a specific meaning, roughly: gain informationfrom, by peaceful and vocal means. Korvin filed it away for futurereference. Why did the Ruler not come to me? Korvin asked.     The Ruler is the Ruler, Didyak said, slightly discomfited. You areto go to him. Such is his command.     Korvin shrugged, sighed and smoothed back his hair. I obey thecommand of the Ruler, he said\u2014another ritual. Everybody obeyed thecommand of the Ruler. If you didn't, you never had a second chance totry.     But Korvin meant exactly what he'd said. He was going to obey thecommands of the Ruler of the Tr'en\u2014and remove the Tr'en threat fromthe rest of the galaxy forever.     That, after all, was his job.   <doc-sep> Most of the cousins gasped as the truth began to percolate through.     I knew from the very beginning, Conrad finished, that I didn'thave to do anything at all. I just had to wait and you would destroyyourselves.     I don't understand, Bartholomew protested, searching the faces of thecousins closest to him. What does he mean, we have never existed?We're here, aren't we? What\u2014     Shut up! Raymond snapped. He turned on Martin. You don't seemsurprised.     The old man grinned. I'm not. I figured it all out years ago.     At first, he had wondered what he should do. Would it be better tothrow them into a futile panic by telling them or to do nothing? Hehad decided on the latter; that was the role they had assigned him\u2014towatch and wait and keep out of things\u2014and that was the role he wouldplay.     You knew all the time and you didn't tell us! Raymond spluttered.After we'd been so good to you, making a gentleman out of you insteadof a criminal.... That's right, he snarled, a criminal! An alcoholic,a thief, a derelict! How do you like that?     Sounds like a rich, full life, Martin said wistfully.     What an exciting existence they must have done him out of! But then, hecouldn't help thinking, he\u2014he and Conrad together, of course\u2014had donethem out of      any     kind of existence. It wasn't his responsibility,though; he had done nothing but let matters take whatever course wasdestined for them. If only he could be sure that it was the bettercourse, perhaps he wouldn't feel that nagging sense of guilt insidehim. Strange\u2014where, in his hermetic life, could he possibly havedeveloped such a queer thing as a conscience?     Then we've wasted all this time, Ninian sobbed, all this energy, allthis money, for nothing!     But you were nothing to begin with, Martin told them. And then,after a pause, he added, I only wish I could be sure there had beensome purpose to this.     He didn't know whether it was approaching death that dimmed his sight,or whether the frightened crowd that pressed around him was growingshadowy.     I wish I could feel that some good had been done in letting you bewiped out of existence, he went on voicing his thoughts. But I knowthat the same thing that happened to your worlds and my world willhappen all over again. To other people, in other times, but again. It'sbound to happen. There isn't any hope for humanity.     One man couldn't really change the course of human history, he toldhimself. Two men, that was\u2014one real, one a shadow.     Conrad came close to the old man's bed. He was almost transparent.     No, he said, there is hope. They didn't know the time transmitterworks two ways. I used it for going into the past only once\u2014just thisonce. But I've gone into the future with it many times. And\u2014 hepressed Martin's hand\u2014believe me, what I did\u2014what      we     did, you andI\u2014serves a purpose. It will change things for the better. Everythingis going to be all right.   <doc-sep> She had finished. And now Cyril cleared his throat. Dear friends, wewere honored by your gracious invitation to visit this fair planet, andwe are honored now by the cordial reception you have given to us.     The crowd yoomped politely. After a slight start, Cyril went on,apparently deciding that applause was all that had been intended.     We feel quite sure that we are going to derive both pleasure andprofit from our stay here, and we promise to make our intensiveanalysis of your culture as painless as possible. We wish only to studyyour society, not to tamper with it in any way.       Ha, ha     , Skkiru said to himself.      Ha, ha, ha!       But why is it, Raoul whispered in Terran as he glanced around out ofthe corners of his eyes, that only the beggar wears mudshoes?     Shhh, Cyril hissed back. We'll find out later, when we'veestablished rapport. Don't be so impatient!     Bbulas gave a sickly smile. Skkiru could almost find it in his heartsto feel sorry for the man.     We have prepared our best hut for you, noble sirs, Bbulas said withgreat self-control, and, by happy chance, this very evening a smallbut unusually interesting ceremony will be held outside the temple. Wehope you will be able to attend. It is to be a rain dance.     Rain dance! Raoul pulled his macintosh together more tightly at thethroat. But why do you want rain? My faith, not only does it rain now,but the planet seems to be a veritable sea of mud. Not, of course, headded hurriedly as Cyril's reproachful eye caught his, that it is notattractive mud. Finest mud I have ever seen. Such texture, such color,such aroma!     Cyril nodded three times and gave an appreciative sniff.     But, Raoul went on, one can have too much of even such a good thingas mud....     The smile did not leave Bbulas' smooth face. Yes, of course, honorableTerrestrials. That is why we are holding this ceremony. It is not adance to bring on rain. It is a dance to      stop     rain.     He was pretty quick on the uptake, Skkiru had to concede. However,that was not enough. The man had no genuine organizational ability.In the time he'd had in which to plan and carry out a scheme forthe improvement of Snaddra, surely he could have done better thanthis high-school theocracy. For one thing, he could have apportionedthe various roles so that each person would be making a definitecontribution to the society, instead of creating some positions plums,like the priesthood, and others prunes, like the beggarship.     What kind of life was that for an active, ambitious young man, standingaround begging? And, moreover, from whom was Skkiru going to beg?Only the Earthmen, for the Snaddrath, no matter how much they threwthemselves into the spirit of their roles, could not be so carriedaway that they would give handouts to a young man whom they had beenaccustomed to see basking in the bosom of luxury.

        "Query": "What is the backdrop of the story LOST IN TRANSLATION?",
        "Summary_1": "Korvin works for Earth Central and flies to the planet Tr'en on its behalf. Tr'en is a planet populated by the Tr'en race, a tall humanoid people with greenish skin, fifty-eight pointy teeth, and a unique language centered on the idea of logic. They are an extremely advanced race in terms of science and technology and others in the Comity of Planets consider them a possible threat seeing as they are in the atomic era and are on the brink of developing space travel. After Korvin crash-lands on Tr'en he sits in a prison cell noted for its smelly air, and, more importantly, its efficiency of design. Besides the Tr'en, the only known living creature on Tr'en is the chulad, a small creature that looks like a large deathwatch beetle. The Room of the Ruler is large and square, and everything inside the room is brown including the walls, furniture, and drapes. In terms of furniture, Korvin observes a large chair where The Ruler sits, many kneeling benches, and a small table near the chair. When two technicians bring in a lie detector test for Korvin, he notices that it is large, squat, and metallic and has wheels, dials, blinking lights, tubes, wires, and a seat with armrests and straps. The technicians use these straps to tie Korvin into the machine.",
        "Summary_2": "This story takes place on a planet occupied by the Tr'en, a race of tall greenish humanoid-like aliens. This race is known for their extremely efficient technological development, which is attributed at least in part to their government structure. To humans, the air on the planet is a little bit smelly, and they don't expect the Tr'en to have large cultural institutions and interesting works of art because they are led by logic and mathematics alone--they even communicate very literally, talking their way through logic puzzles. There are two rooms that house most of the story: the lone jail cell that Korvin is kept in for six days in total, and the Room of the Ruler where the questioning happens. The jail cell was built very quickly once Korvin was captured, and there are no other prisoners in the jail, so it is a lonely and quiet place for Korvin to sit in, with nothing to occupy him but his own thoughts. There is one bed for him to lie on but nothing else of interest. His only interaction with others is the nightly lessons in the Tr'en language that are done under drug hypnosis. He is escorted out of this solitary confinement to meet The Ruler, whose chambers are a large room with brown and tan everywhere. The walls were dark brown, many of the furnishings were light brown, and the drapes on the windows were tan. Although the brown contrasted nicely with the green skin of the Tr'en, Korvin still found there to be far too much brown in the room. There was a great big chair in the middle for The Ruler to sit in, surrounded by benches for others to kneel at. Eventually, a lie detector chair is brought into the room as well. The story ends with Korvin making it back to his spaceship, but the author does not give us many details about this part of the setting. ",
        "Summary_3": "The story takes place on a planet that is ruled by a people called the Tr'en. The planet is not as far along in its evolution as Korvin's planet, and Korvin makes a point of this several times in his observations about their lack of experience with other races and in their absence from the Comity of Planets, a governing body that oversees many different planets. The Tr'en are efficient, so all the structures built on the planet are built without flaw. There also isn't anything very exciting to do recreationally on the planet. The planet and its people are largely defined by the very logical and literal nature of the Tr'en.",
        "Summary_4": "\n\tThe story takes place on the planet occupied by the Tr\u2019en, an oxygen-breathing humanoid species whose members tend to be quite tall and various shades of green. The Tr\u2019en are known to be an especially efficient lot who are mathematically and scientifically minded, and therefore literally minded as well. Word has reached Earth that the Tr\u2019en are making progress in their atomic era and are almost capable of space travel, which means they will soon settle other planets and travel to nearby stars. It is also suspected they will soon be capable of traveling faster than light, which will earn them an invitation to join the Comity of Planets and which they are sure to reject. The Tr\u2019en have a justice system in place; they have jail cells and the advanced technology that enabled them to build a truth detector device. The planet is ruled by an autocrat referred to as the Ruler; everyone obeys him because they know there are no second chances. This form of government ensures uniformity, enabling rapid, consistent responses from everyone. Everything is constant, as each successive Ruler is adopted by the current Ruler, guaranteeing the same wisdom and judgment exist under each leader.\n",

But they erred in thinking     the Old Ones were too big to be clever.     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Planet Stories Fall 1949.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      In the last hours the star ahead had grown brighter by many magnitudes,and had changed its color from a dazzling blue through white to thenormal yellow, of a GO sun. That was the Doppler effect as the star'sradial velocity changed relative to the      Quest III     , as for forty hoursthe ship had decelerated.     They had seen many such stars come near out of the galaxy's glitteringbackdrop, and had seen them dwindle, turn red and go out as the      QuestIII     drove on its way once more, lashed by despair toward the speed oflight, leaving behind the mockery of yet another solitary and lifelessluminary unaccompanied by worlds where men might dwell. They had grownsated with the sight of wonders\u2014of multiple systems of giant stars, ofnebulae that sprawled in empty flame across light years.     But now unwonted excitement possessed the hundred-odd members of the      Quest III's     crew. It was a subdued excitement; men and women, theycame and stood quietly gazing into the big vision screens that showedthe oncoming star, and there were wide-eyed children who had been bornin the ship and had never seen a planet. The grownups talked in lowvoices, in tones of mingled eagerness and apprehension, of what mightlie at the long journey's end. For the      Quest III     was coming home; thesun ahead was      the     Sun, whose rays had warmed their lives' beginning.   <doc-sep> On a larger and heavier world than Planetoid 42, Johnson's curiositywould probably have had weight and mass. He was bursting withquestions, but he was obviously afraid they would cost him money. Forhis part, Harvey allowed that curiosity to grow like a Venusian amoebauntil Joe came in, lugging a radio.     Is that what you were talking about? the mayor snorted. What makesyou think I want a radio? I came here to get away from singers andpolitical speech-makers.     Do not jump to hasty conclusions, Harvey cautioned. Another word,and I shall refuse you the greatest opportunity any man has ever had,with the sole exceptions of Joseph, myself and the unfortunate inventorof this absolutely awe-inspiring device.     I ain't in the market for a radio, Johnson said stubbornly.     Harvey nodded in relief. We have attempted to repay our host, Joseph.He has spurned our generosity. We have now the chance to continue ourstudy, which I am positive will soon reward us with the key to anenormous fortune.     Well, that's no plating off our bow, Joe grunted. I'm glad he didturn it down. I hated to give it up after working on it for three wholeyears.     He picked up the radio and began walking toward the door.     Now, hold on! the mayor cried. I ain't      saying     I'll buy, but whatis it I'm turning down?     Joe returned and set the instrument down on the bar. His facesorrowful, Harvey fondly stroked the scarred plasticoid cabinet.     To make a long story, Mr. Johnson, he said, Joseph and I were amongthe chosen few who knew the famous Doctor Dean intimately. Just beforehis tragic death, you will recall, Dean allegedly went insane. Hebanged his fist on the bar. I have said it before, and I repeat again,that was a malicious lie, spread by the doctor's enemies to discredithis greatest invention\u2014this fourth dimensional radio!     This what? Johnson blurted out.     In simple terms, clarified Harvey, the ingenious doctor discoveredthat the yawning chasm between the dimensions could be bridged byenergy of all quanta. There has never been any question that theinhabitants of the super-dimension would be far more civilized thanourselves. Consequently, the man who could tap their knowledge wouldfind himself in possession of a powerful, undreamt-of science!     The mayor looked respectfully at the silent box on the bar.     And this thing gets broadcasts from the fourth dimension?     It does, Mr. Johnson! Only charlatans like those who envied DoctorDean's magnificent accomplishments could deny that fact.     The mayor put his hands in his pockets, unswiveled one hip and staredthoughtfully at the battered cabinet.     Well, let's say it picks up fourth dimensional broadcasts, heconceded. But how could you understand what they're saying? Folks upthere wouldn't talk our language.     Again Harvey smashed his fist down. Do you dare to repeat the scurvylie that broke Dean's spirit and drove him to suicide?     Johnson recoiled. No\u2014no,      of course not     . I mean, being up here, Inaturally couldn't get all the details.     Naturally, Harvey agreed, mollified. I'm sorry I lost my temper.But it is a matter of record that the doctor proved the broadcastsemanating from the super-dimension were in English! Why should that beso difficult to believe? Is it impossible that at one time there wascommunication between the dimensions, that the super-beings admiredour language and adopted it in all its beauty, adding to it their ownhyper-scientific trimmings?     Why, I don't know, Johnson said in confusion.     For three years, Joseph and I lost sleep and hair, trying to detectthe simple key that would translate the somewhat metamorphosedbroadcasts into our primitive English. It eluded us. Even the doctorfailed. But that was understandable; a sensitive soul like his couldstand only so much. And the combination of ridicule and failure tosolve the mystery caused him to take his own life.     Johnson winced. Is that what you want to unload on me?     For a very good reason, sir. Patience is the virtue that will berewarded with the key to these fourth dimensional broadcasts. A man whocould devote his life to improving this lonely worldlet is obviously aperson with unusual patience.     Yeah, the mayor said grudgingly, I ain't exactly flighty.     Therefore, you are the man who could unravel the problem!     Johnson asked skeptically: How about a sample first?  "

        "Summary_1": "Jonathan Fawkes dropped off the only member of his crew on Mars after he got space sickness, so he was alone on the journey to Jupiter. He had been charged with dropping off tobacco seed to see if they could cultivate it on the colonies in Jupiter. However, along the way, he got tired at the wheel of the ship, and, during his nap, crashed into an asteroid. When he awoke, a beautiful blonde woman named Ann was standing over him. They introduce themselves, and she explains that she\u2019s one of the 27 female survivors of their crash over three years ago. Ann sees a horde of centaurs coming over the plains, so she and Jonathan crawl to the foothills, where they can\u2019t be followed. She spears a creature along the way and hooks it on her belt. Jonathan attempts to escape, as he\u2019s uncomfortable around women and wants a cigarette, but she takes him down. They run into nine more women who pin him to the ground. They start to carry him the four miles back to their base, but he asks to walk instead as he\u2019s humiliated. They trudge through the foothills, only stopping once to throw stones at the pestering centaurs, before finally reaching home. They treat Jonathan like a king, pulling out a chair for him at the table, and endlessly complimenting him. They eat inside the dining room of their wrecked ship, and Jonathan watches the wild, Amazonian-like women in horror. Their leader, a big woman named Billy, halts all the flirting and tells Jonathan that he needs to rest in order to feel better. After his belly\u2019s full, he quickly falls asleep, and they carry him upstairs to bed, attempting to take off his shoes which he refuses. \nThe next morning, he wakes up and walks outside with a cane, exaggerating his injuries so as to be treated better. He sits beneath a tree and is soon greeted by Ann. She grabs him and they make to embrace but are caught by the rest of the girls. Billy splits them up and says it\u2019s time to figure out who gets him. The women fight and argue their cases, and Jonathan slips away, running back to his ship. Another cruiser is sat down next to his own, the Interstellar Cosmography Society scrawled on its side. He meets Dr. Boynton and another man who offer to rescue him. Jonathan refuses them, tells them there\u2019s nothing to worry about, then grabs his tobacco seeds, cigarettes, and tools, and makes his way back to the women. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Jonathan Fawkes, a Universal space pilot, flying from Mars to Jupiter, has seeds for the colonists there. He is flying alone, using autopilot at times to sleep. Something goes wrong, and his ship crashes onto an asteroid. He is discovered by a beautiful young woman checking to see if he is alive. She reveals that she, along with 26 other women, crashed their ship onto the asteroid three years ago when they were on their way to become wives for the colonists on Jupiter. This woman, Ann Clotilde, invites Jonathan back to their camp. Along the way, she spies a herd of centaurs and hides Jonathan from them. Ann is surprisingly strong and can kill a rabbit-like creature with her spear, reminding Jonathan of an amazon. \n\tWhen Jonathan craves a cigarette and realizes they are in his ship, he turns to go back for them, but Ann stops him with the tip of her spear. Other women appear to find out what is going on, and they are all astonished to discover a man among them. They shout with joy and throw themselves at him. To prevent him from trying to get away again, they tie his hands and feet and carry him, which utterly humiliates Jonathan. He had always considered himself a tough guy, but he had been bested by a group of women! He persuades them to let him walk the rest of the way, but later, when his feet slip on the narrow ridge of a trail, they have to rescue him and then tie a rope around his waist like a child to keep him safe.\n\tAs they reach their camp, the women announce they\u2019ve caught a man, and one of the women exclaims they are rescued. But another points out that having a man there is the next best thing, and the women talk openly about his attractiveness. At dinner, several women invite Jonathan to join them for private activities the next day. He eventually falls asleep at the dinner table and is carried away to bed.\n\tThe next day, Ann, his finder, discovers him alone and engages with him. He is worried that others might see them, but she assures him they are alone. But something he says draws all of the women into the opening where they are, and they begin arguing over whose man he is, Ann\u2019s, all of theirs to share\u2026.Jonathan exclaims he should have a say in it, but Billy, the leader, tells him he doesn\u2019t. He then decides it\u2019s a good time to get those cigarettes, and when he arrives, two men are there from the Instellar Cosmography Society and offer him a ride back to civilization. Jonathan tells them he has decided he likes it there and wants to stay, even though it will be another three years before the asteroid\u2019s orbit is in the space lanes again where he can be picked up.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Jonathan Fawkes is a space pilot with a company called Universal. After dropping his co-pilot off on Mars due to illness, Jonathan has been flying solo, carrying a load of seed to be delivered to colonists on Jupiter. Somehow, he crash-lands on an asteroid, and when he wakes up, he sees a woman with bright yellow hair standing over him. Her name is Ann Clotilde, and she is one of the women that had been sent to Jupiter three years earlier by the Food-growers Association to become wives for the colonists. Ann informs Jonathan their ship had crash-landed and only twenty-seven women survived. She offers to bring Jonathan back to her camp, and Jonathan agrees despite his discomfort around women. They begin to move across the prairie. Along the way, a group of centaurs chases them, and they run toward the safety of a small ravine leading into the hills. After Ann uses her spear to snag a rabbit, Jonathan realizes the women must have developed Amazon-like skills during their time on the asteroid. He begins to crave a cigarette and decides to return to his ship to fetch the cartons of cigarettes he had left behind. Ann insists he leaves the cigarettes behind and accompanies her to the camp, whereupon he trips her and takes her spear. The commotion draws the attention of some of Ann's fellow survivors who come to her aid and apprehend Jonathan. Feeling shame, Jonathan joins the cohort on their march back to the camp as the women and the centaurs throw rocks and insults at each other. The women, particularly Olga and Ann, begin flirting with Jonathan since they haven't seen a man in many years. When they return to camp, all of the women are delighted to see a man, and he joins them for a great feast prepared by their cook, Billy. The women argue about who will get to spend alone time with Jonathan, but he is too tired to play along. Eventually, he falls asleep, and the women carry him to bed. When he awakens, he explores the encampment and runs into Ann. Emboldened by Ann's forwardness, Jonathan wraps his arm around her, and the other women suddenly appear, prepared to fight for Jonathan. As they argue amongst themselves, Jonathan makes a run for his ship, leaving the women behind. When he arrives, he sees a space cruiser next to his wrecked ship with the inscription \"Interstellar Cosmography Society.\" Three men step out, and the eldest explains to Jonathan that they have been commissioned to examine the asteroid. They offer Jonathan a ride off the asteroid, but Jonathan turns down their off. He has decided to stay with the women after all. He grabs his cigarettes and makes his way back to camp.",

He awakes to find a woman (Ann Clotilde) wearing a ragged blue frock and sandals that is surprised he isn\u2019t dead. She doesn\u2019t know where they are, but suspects they are on an asteroid. She and 26 other women survived a crash landing here three years ago while on their way to become wives to Jupiter\u2019s colonists. A herd of Centaurs charge towards them and they flee down a ravine that opens into a large gorge. Ann spears a small furry creature and ties it to her belt. Jonathan craves cigarettes and wants to go back to his wrecked ship to retrieve some, but Ann insists they go to camp. Jonathan knocks her feet out and takes her spear, turning it on her. Just then, another woman approaches, shrieking at the presence of a man. Jonathan flees, and nine women chase him down, bind his arms and legs, and begin carrying him to their camp. Jonathan begs to walk and they let him down, knowing they can catch him again if he tries to run. He slips and nearly plummets down a canyon wall, but Ann grabs him and saves him, humiliating Jonathan to be helped by a woman. They stop briefly to throw rocks and yell at some Centaurs on the prairie below. At their camp, they feed Jonathan in the dining salon of their wrecked ship. Some women invite Jonathan to hunt and forage, fawning over him. One of them, Olga, makes strong sexual advances. Billy, the leader of the women, silences the chatter and declares that Jonathan must rest. He says his ship can\u2019t be salvaged, and is so tired he falls asleep at the table. A dozen women carry him up to a stateroom for his rest.\nJonathan wakes with a limp and goes to the nearby stream. Ann makes a strong sexual advance on him, forcing him back into a seat when he tries to get up and assuring him that the other women won\u2019t return until lunch. Billy interrupts them, and the rest of the women are lined up behind her. Ann bears her spear and claims that Jonathan is hers because she found him. Jonathan runs back to his shipwreck and finds a group of three men from the Interstellar Cosmography Society examining the asteroid. Doctor Boynton says Jonathan is lucky they saw his wreck, but Jonathan insists he does not want to be rescued. They think he has gone mad. Jonathan tells them to send a freighter back to the asteroid in three years when it crosses into the shipping lane again to pick up his load of tobacco. He grabs tools, tobacco seeds and cigarettes, and heads back to the women\u2019s camp.",

        "Query": "What is the backdrop of The Happy Castaway?",
        "Summary_1": "The Happy Castaway by Robert E. McDowell takes place during the year 3372 on an asteroid between Mars and Jupiter. The asteroid is mostly prairie and sprawling plains, but there are also foothills and steep mountains. In the mountains, there is also a mountain emitting white smoke. The centaurs, the Natives on the asteroid, live in the prairie and plains, as they are unable to successfully travel through the hills and mountains. The stranded women live beyond the mountains, where the centaurs can\u2019t reach them, and have transformed the wreckage of their ship into a livable base. There is a grand table and weighted chairs to serve food at, a kitchen supposedly where they can cook the food they\u2019ve hunted and foraged, as well as areas to sleep. \nThere are rivers that run through the asteroid teeming with fish. Ann caught a rabbit-like creature, so there are other creatures to be hunted. \n",
        "Summary_2": "The story takes place in 3372 on an asteroid where a flight of girls was stranded three years earlier after their ship went down. The ship's remains are still there, and the girls use it for living quarters. The asteroid is rich with flora and fauna and a variety of landforms. It has grassy meadows, foothills, chains of mountains, a volcano, and a brook. There are ravines and hills, canyons, and valleys. There are small furry animals, much like rabbits, that the girls catch to eat and large centaurs that the girls have developed a healthy fear of. Jonathan refers to the women on the planet as amazons because they are so strong, but then he also learns that the pull of gravity is 30 times less than that of Earth, so the women can lift and carry his easily. The women are eager to be rescued but equally eager for a man\u2019s attention. They flirt with Jonathan shamelessly, each trying to gain his attention. They have established a bit of social order; it appears that Billy is their leader. She reigns in the girls when they become too competitive over Jonathan. The women wait on Jonathan hand and foot, each eager for time alone with him. ",
        "Summary_3": "The story takes place in the year 3372 on an asteroid somewhere between Mars and Jupiter. Jonathan works as a pilot for a company called Universal delivering seeds to planets like Jupiter, which has a colony and a Food-growers Association. Jonathan crash-lands in a vast prairie, which stretches a mile past the crash site to a range of jagged foothills leading up to a chain of mountains. Within this chain, Jonathan sees a puff of smoke issuing from the top of a cone-shaped peak indicating the presence of a volcano. The asteroid is home to centaurs, which appear to be hostile towards humans. When Ann and Jonathan run away from the centaurs, they escape to a small ravine leading into the hills. As they make their way through the ravine, it deepens into a canyon then further into a gorge with walls towering on either side of them. On the floor of the canyon grow yellow, fern-like plants. After the women capture Jonathan, they march him back to camp by way of a narrow ledge climbing the canyon wall which comes to rest at a high ridge overlooking the prairie. Because the asteroid has less gravity than Earth, the women are thirty times as stronger than normal. Their encampment is at the head of a deep valley beyond the canyon's ridge where a tree-flanked stream flows next to their crashed space liner. Inside the space liner is a massive dining area with a long meturilium table at its center sitting atop a green fiberon carpet. It reminds Jonathan of the \"fabulous barbarian past.\"",
        "Summary_4": "In the year 3372, humans have colonized other planets in the solar system, and there is interplanetary transport to support the colonists. Asteroids can be dangerous in the shipping lanes, as the main character, Jonathan Fawkes, finds out when he crashes into one on his way to deliver seeds and other supplies to Jupiter.\nThe asteroid contains prairies, jagged foothills, a chain of mountains, a fuming volcano and deep valley gorges and streams. Dangerous Centaurs that are half man and half horse roam the prairie in herds. There is a ravine nearby to Jonathan\u2019s crash site that opens into a wide gorge with high walls that tower on both sides. Yellow fern-like plants grow within the canyon. The 27 stranded women camp about four miles away from where Jonathan crash lands. They camp in their wrecked ship which has a stream close by to it. There is small game to eat like the furry creature that Ann spears and ties off to her belt. They still use the dining hall on the ship for their meals, and go out daily to hunt, fish, and forage for fruits and berries. \nThe asteroid will cross the interplanetary shipping lane every three years in its orbit, meaning that every three years there is a chance they may come into contact with transport ships again. This creates a sense of pioneering prosperity for Johnathan who decides he wants to live with the 27 women on the asteroid and use the fertile land to grow tobacco and then sell it every three years when a freight ship comes by.\n",

He was flat on his back, and a girlwas bending over him. He detected a frightened expression on thegirl's face. His pale blue eyes traveled upward beyond the girl. Thesky was his roof, yet he distinctly remembered going to sleep on hisbunk aboard the space ship.     You're not dead?     I've some doubt about that, he replied dryly. He levered himself tohis elbows. The girl, he saw, had bright yellow hair. Her nose waspert, tip-tilted. She had on a ragged blue frock and sandals.     Is\u2014is anything broken? she asked.     Don't know. Help me up. Between them he managed to struggle to hisfeet. He winced. He said, My name's Jonathan Fawkes. I'm a space pilotwith Universal. What happened? I feel like I'd been poured out of aconcrete mixer.     She pointed to the wreck of a small space freighter a dozen feet away.Its nose was buried in the turf, folded back like an accordion. Ithad burst open like a ripe watermelon. He was surprised that he hadsurvived at all. He scratched his head. I was running from Mars toJupiter with a load of seed for the colonists.     Oh! said the girl, biting her lips. Your co-pilot must be in thewreckage.     He shook his head. No, he reassured her. I left him on Mars. Hehad an attack of space sickness. I was all by myself; that was thetrouble. I'd stay at the controls as long as I could, then lock her onher course and snatch a couple of hours' sleep. I can remember crawlinginto my bunk. The next thing I knew you were bending over me. Hepaused. I guess the automatic deflectors slowed me up or I would havebeen a cinder by this time, he said.     The girl didn't reply. She continued to watch him, a faint enigmaticsmile on her lips. Jonathan glanced away in embarrassment. He wishedthat pretty women didn't upset him so. He said nervously, Where am I?I couldn't have slept all the way to Jupiter.     The girl shrugged her shoulders.     I don't know.     You don't know! He almost forgot his self-consciousness in hissurprise. His pale blue eyes returned to the landscape. A mile acrossthe plain began a range of jagged foothills, which tossed upwardhigher and higher until they merged with the blue saw-edge of a chainof mountains. As he looked a puff of smoke belched from a truncatedcone-shaped peak. A volcano. Otherwise there was no sign of life: justhe and the strange yellow-headed girl alone in the center of that vastrolling prairie.     I was going to explain, he heard her say. We think that we are on anasteroid.     We? he looked back at her.     Yes. There are twenty-seven of us. We were on our way to Jupiter, too,only we were going to be wives for the colonists.     I remember, he exclaimed. Didn't the Jupiter Food-growersAssociation enlist you girls to go to the colonies?     She nodded her head. Only twenty-seven of us came through the crash.     Everybody thought your space ship hit a meteor, he said.     We hit this asteroid.     But that was three years ago.     Has it been that long? We lost track of time. She didn't take hereyes off him, not for a second. Such attention made him acutely selfconscious. She said, I'm Ann. Ann Clotilde. I was hunting when I sawyour space ship. You had been thrown clear. You were lying all in aheap. I thought you were dead. She stooped, picked up a spear.     Do you feel strong enough to hike back to our camp? It's only aboutfour miles, she said.     I think so, he said.  "

She takes him down when he attempts to escape, proving her Amazonian strength. The other girls come when they see her and fawn over Jonathan as well. Together, they half-carry, half-drag him back to their ship, where they feed him. The next day, Ann meets him beneath a tree and essentially throws herself at him.

To prevent him from escaping, they bind his hands and feet and half-carry him to their camp. Ann believes that Jonathan should belong to her since she found him first. When she finds him alone and comes onto him, she assures Jonathan that they are completely alone. But after he groans from pain but claims he isn\u2019t hurt too badly, Billy and all the other women come out of the woods, pleased that he is okay. Ann claims that Jonathan belongs to her while other women complain and argue they should all share him. When Jonathan states he should have a say in it, Billy tells him he doesn\u2019t and has to do what they say. Jonathan turns and runs for his ship to retrieve his cigarettes.",
        "Summary_3": "Ann Clotilde is one of the twenty-seven survivors of a crashed space liner that had been enlisted by the Jupiter Food-growers Association to transport wives for the colonists on Jupiter. Ann and her fellow survivors have lived on the asteroid for three years, waiting for someone to come rescue them, but they have also adjusted quite well and spend their days hunting, gathering berries and fruit, and attending to various chores around the encampment. Thanks to the low gravity on the asteroid, the women have magnified their strength, enabling them to hold their own against the centaurs and capture Jonathan without any problems. Ann is out hunting when she stumbles upon Jonathan, and she believes he is dead. She has bright, yellow hair and wears a ragged blue frock and sandals. She is curious about Jonathan and invites him back to her encampment. Along the way, she helps him escape from a herd of hostile centaurs, but she threatens him with a spear when he wants to return to the ship to get his cigarettes. Later, Ann joins the rest of the women in flirting with Jonathan because it has been several years since any of them has seen a man, and they all find Jonathan to be attractive. In fact, Ann flirts the most forwardly, and Jonathan seems intrigued by her offer until they are stopped by the rest of the women who wish to fight for him.",

        "Article": "Jonathan leaped to his feet, dumping Ann to the ground. He jerkedaround. All twenty-six of the girls were lined up on the path. Theirfeatures were grim. He said: I don't feel so well after all.     It don't wash, said Billy. It's time for a showdown.     Jonathan's hair stood on end. He felt rather than saw Ann Clotilde takeher stand beside him. He noticed that she was holding her spear at amenacing angle. She said in an angry voice: He's mine. I found him.Leave him alone.     Where do you get that stuff? cried Olga. Share and share alike, sayI.     We could draw straws for him, suggested the green-eyed blonde.     Look here, Jonathan broke in. I've got some say in the matter.     You have not, snapped Billy. You'll do just as we say. She took astep toward him.     Jonathan edged away in consternation.     He's going to run! Olga shouted.     Jonathan never stopped until he was back in the canyon leading to theplain. His nerves were jumping like fleas. He craved the soothingrelaxation of a smoke. There was, he remembered, a carton of cigarettesat the wreck. He resumed his flight, but at a more sober pace.     At the spot where he and Ann had first crawled away from the centaurs,he scrambled out of the gulley, glanced in the direction of his spaceship. He blinked his eyes, stared. Then he waved his arms, shouted andtore across the prairie. A trim space cruiser was resting beside thewreck of his own. Across its gleaming monaloid hull ran an inscriptionin silver letters: INTERSTELLAR COSMOGRAPHY SOCIETY.     Two men crawled out of Jonathan's wrecked freighter, glanced insurprise at Jonathan. A third man ran from the cruiser, a Dixon RayRifle in his hand.     I'm Jonathan Fawkes, said the castaway as he panted up, pilot forUniversal. I was wrecked.     A tall elderly man held out his hand. He had a small black waxedmustache and Van Dyke. He was smoking a venusian cigarette in ayellow composition holder. He said, I'm Doctor Boynton. He had arich cultivated voice, and a nose like a hawk. We are members of theInterstellar Cosmography Society. We've been commissioned to make acursory examination of this asteroid. You had a nasty crack up, Mr.Fawkes. But you are in luck, sir. We were on the point of returningwhen we sighted the wreck.     I say, said the man who had run out of the cruiser. He was a prim,energetic young man. Jonathan noted that he carried the ray gungingerly, respectfully. We're a week overdue now, he said.

He was flat on his back, and a girlwas bending over him. He detected a frightened expression on thegirl's face. His pale blue eyes traveled upward beyond the girl. Thesky was his roof, yet he distinctly remembered going to sleep on hisbunk aboard the space ship.     You're not dead?     I've some doubt about that, he replied dryly. He levered himself tohis elbows. The girl, he saw, had bright yellow hair. Her nose waspert, tip-tilted. She had on a ragged blue frock and sandals.     Is\u2014is anything broken? she asked.     Don't know. Help me up. Between them he managed to struggle to hisfeet. He winced. He said, My name's Jonathan Fawkes. I'm a space pilotwith Universal. What happened? I feel like I'd been poured out of aconcrete mixer.     She pointed to the wreck of a small space freighter a dozen feet away.Its nose was buried in the turf, folded back like an accordion. Ithad burst open like a ripe watermelon. He was surprised that he hadsurvived at all. He scratched his head. I was running from Mars toJupiter with a load of seed for the colonists.     Oh! said the girl, biting her lips. Your co-pilot must be in thewreckage.     He shook his head. No, he reassured her. I left him on Mars. Hehad an attack of space sickness. I was all by myself; that was thetrouble. I'd stay at the controls as long as I could, then lock her onher course and snatch a couple of hours' sleep. I can remember crawlinginto my bunk. The next thing I knew you were bending over me. Hepaused. I guess the automatic deflectors slowed me up or I would havebeen a cinder by this time, he said.     The girl didn't reply. She continued to watch him, a faint enigmaticsmile on her lips. Jonathan glanced away in embarrassment. He wishedthat pretty women didn't upset him so. He said nervously, Where am I?I couldn't have slept all the way to Jupiter.     The girl shrugged her shoulders.     I don't know.     You don't know! He almost forgot his self-consciousness in hissurprise. His pale blue eyes returned to the landscape. A mile acrossthe plain began a range of jagged foothills, which tossed upwardhigher and higher until they merged with the blue saw-edge of a chainof mountains. As he looked a puff of smoke belched from a truncatedcone-shaped peak. A volcano. Otherwise there was no sign of life: justhe and the strange yellow-headed girl alone in the center of that vastrolling prairie.     I was going to explain, he heard her say. We think that we are on anasteroid.     We? he looked back at her.     Yes. There are twenty-seven of us. We were on our way to Jupiter, too,only we were going to be wives for the colonists.     I remember, he exclaimed. Didn't the Jupiter Food-growersAssociation enlist you girls to go to the colonies?     She nodded her head. Only twenty-seven of us came through the crash.     Everybody thought your space ship hit a meteor, he said.     We hit this asteroid.     But that was three years ago.     Has it been that long? We lost track of time. She didn't take hereyes off him, not for a second. Such attention made him acutely selfconscious. She said, I'm Ann. Ann Clotilde. I was hunting when I sawyour space ship. You had been thrown clear. You were lying all in aheap. I thought you were dead. She stooped, picked up a spear.     Do you feel strong enough to hike back to our camp? It's only aboutfour miles, she said.     I think so, he said.   <doc-sep> Jonathan was slumped forward across the table, his head buried in hisarms.     Catch a hold, said Billy, pushing back from the table. A dozen girlsvolunteered with a rush. Hoist! said Billy. They lifted him like asleepy child, bore him tenderly up an incline and into a stateroom,where they deposited him on the bed.     Ann said to Olga; Help me with these boots. But they resisted everytug. It's no use, groaned Ann, straightening up and wiping her brightyellow hair back from her eyes. His feet have swollen. We'll have tocut them off.     At these words, Jonathan raised upright as if someone had pulled a rope.           Cut off whose feet?      he cried in alarm.     Not your feet, silly, said Ann. Your boots.     Lay a hand on those boots, he scowled; and I'll make me another pairout of your hides. They set me back a week's salary. Having deliveredhimself of this ultimatum, he went back to sleep.     Olga clapped her hand to her forehead. And this, she cried is whatwe've been praying for during the last three years.     The next day found Jonathan Fawkes hobbling around by the aid of acane. At the portal of the space ship, he stuck out his head, glancedall around warily. None of the girls were in sight. They had, hepresumed, gone about their chores: hunting, fishing, gathering fruitsand berries. He emerged all the way and set out for the creek. Hewalked with an exaggerated limp just in case any of them should behanging around. As long as he was an invalid he was safe, he hoped.     He sighed. Not every man could be waited on so solicitously bytwenty-seven handsome strapping amazons. He wished he could carry itoff in cavalier fashion. He hobbled to the creek, sat down beneath theshade of a tree. He just wasn't the type, he supposed. And it might beyears before they were rescued.     As a last resort, he supposed, he could hide out in the hills or jointhe centaurs. He rather fancied himself galloping across the plainson the back of a centaur. He looked up with a start. Ann Clotilde wasambling toward him.     How's the invalid? she said, seating herself beside him.     Hot, isn't it? he said. He started to rise. Ann Clotilde placed theflat of her hand on his chest and shoved.       Ooof!      he grunted. He satdown rather more forcibly than he had risen.     Don't get up because of me, she informed him. It's my turn to cook,but I saw you out here beneath the trees. Dinner can wait. Jonathan doyou know that you are irresistible? She seized his shoulders, staredinto his eyes. He couldn't have felt any more uncomfortable had ahungry boa constrictor draped itself in his arms. He mopped his browwith his sleeve.     Suppose the rest should come, he said in an embarrassed voice.     They're busy. They won't be here until I call them to lunch. Youreyes, she said, are like deep mysterious pools.     Sure enough? said Jonathan with involuntary interest. He began torecover his nerve.     She said, You're the best looking thing. She rumpled his hair. Ican't keep my eyes off you.     Jonathan put his arm around her gingerly. Ouch! He winced. He hadforgotten his sore muscles.     I forgot, said Ann Clotilde in a contrite voice. She tried to rise.You're hurt.     He pulled her back down. Not so you could notice it, he grinned.     Well! came the strident voice of Billy from behind them. We're      all     glad to hear that!  "

        "Query": "What was the fate of the 27 women stranded on the asteroid in The Happy Castaway?",
        "Summary_1": "The Jupiter Food-growers Association enlisted many women to travel out to the colonies to serve as wives and promote happiness as well as breed a new generation. However, on their way to Jupiter, their spaceship crashed into an asteroid, and only 27 of the women survived. In the three years since the crash, these women have learned to hunt, forage, and defend themselves against the native species there, Centaurs. They developed a society based on sharing and generosity, shown through their individual chores that all serve the greater good. However, the two things they wished for were a rescue mission or a man. When Jonathan Fawkes arrived, their second wish came true. After they all met him, they each complimented him incessantly and offered him more food, drinks, and other sweet amenities. Being the first man they\u2019d seen in over three years, he was quite the rarity. ",
        "Summary_2": "The 27 women stuck on the asteroid have been stranded there for three years. They were on a ship bound for the Food-growers Association on Jupiter to become wives for the colonists but crash-landed on the asteroid. Some of the women did not survive, but those who did have learned to fend for themselves. Their only hope of leaving the asteroid is if a man comes and takes them away. When Ann discovers Jonathan, all the women are interested in him and want to \u201cwin\u201d him for themselves. They flirt shamelessly and help him, treating him almost like a princess. The women have learned to fend for themselves, hunt their food, and become quite strong. Jonathan thinks of them as amazons. Of course, the gravity on the asteroid is about thirty times weaker than that of Earth, which helps the women carry Jonathan when they tie him up to prevent him from getting away. They are so excited and desperate to see a man, they will do anything to prevent him from leaving. Their main wish is to be rescued, but the next best thing to being rescued is to have a man among them.",
        "Summary_3": "Originally, the women were part of a larger group that had been enlisted by the Jupiter Food-growers Association to journey to the colonies on Jupiter to become wives for the colonists. Before they reached their destination, they crash-landed on the same asteroid that Jonathan would crash on three years later. During those three years, the twenty-seven survivors turned their crash site into a livable encampment. Lucky for them, they had crashed in a deep valley near a stream and plenty of trees. Because of the lush foliage, they are able to collect an ample supply of fruits and berries, and there is plenty of wildlife to hunt including rabbits. As a result of the low gravity, the women's strength has magnified thirty times, so they are able to easily defend against the centaurs and provide for themselves. Although they are hoping to be rescued, they seem generally content in the makeshift society they have built together. The only thing they mention missing is the presence of a man, so when Jonathan arrives, they all fight over his personal attention.",
        "Summary_4": "Twenty-seven women survived a shipwreck on an asteroid while on their way to Jupiter to become the wives of the colonists there. They have been successfully living on the asteroid for three years, and hunt and gather the plentiful resources the land has to sustain themselves. They have to fight or evade dangerous Centaurs that are half man and half horse while they are out hunting, which they do by throwing rocks and yelling at them. They camp next to a stream in their wrecked ship, using the dining hall and staterooms for eating and living quarters. Jonathan finds them to be powerful and athletic, and frequently refers to them as Amazons. Many of them make forceful sexual advances on Jonathan, and they compete amongst themselves for his attention.\nWhen the asteroid orbits through the interplanetary shipping lane every three years, they become more likely to be rescued. When Jonathan intercepts Doctor Boynton and his two colleagues from the Interstellar Cosmography Society who have been commissioned to examine the asteroid, he tells them emphatically that he does not wish to be rescued. He would only like for them to send a freighter back in another three years to pick up the load of tobacco that he plans to grow with the seeds in the cargo of his shipwreck. The implication of what Jonathan has decided is that the twenty seven women will also likely remain on the asteroid for at least three more years because Jonathan has turned away their chance at being rescued.\n",
        "Article": "Jonathan's face broke into a grin. He said, Do any of you know how togrow tobacco?     They glanced at each other in perplexity.     I like it here, continued Jonathan. I'm not going back.     What? cried the three explorers in one breath.     I'm going to stay, he repeated. I only came back here after thecigarettes.     But it will be three years before the asteroid's orbit brings it backin the space lanes, said Doctor Boynton. You don't possibly expect tobe picked up before then!     Jonathan shook his head, began to load himself with tools, tobaccoseed, and cigarettes.     Odd. Doctor Boynton shook his head, turned to the others. Though ifI remember correctly, there was quite an epidemic of hermits duringthe medieval period. It was an esthetic movement. They fled to thewilderness to escape the temptation of      women     .     Jonathan laughed outright.     You are sure you won't return, young man?     He shook his head. They argued, they cajoled, but Jonathan was adamant.He said, You might report my accident to Universal. Tell them to stopone of their Jupiter-bound freighters here when the asteroid swingsback in the space ways. I'll have a load for them.     Inside the ship, Doctor Boynton moved over to a round transparent porthole. What a strange fellow, he murmured.

I think so, he said.   <doc-sep> The girls set up a shout and threw stones down at the centaurs, whoreared, pawed the air, and galloped to a safe distance, from which theyhurled back insults in a strange tongue. Their voices sounded faintlylike the neighing of horses.     Amazons and centaurs, he thought again. He couldn't get the problemof the girls' phenomenal strength out of his mind. Then it occurredto him that the asteroid, most likely, was smaller even than Earth'smoon. He must weigh about a thirtieth of what he usually did, due tothe lessened gravity. It also occurred to him that they would be thirtytimes as strong. He was staggered. He wished he had a smoke.     At length, the amazons and the centaurs tired of bandying insultsback and forth. The centaurs galloped off into the prairie, the girlsresumed their march. Jonathan scrambled up hills, skidded down slopes.The brunette was beside him helping him over the rough spots.     I'm Olga, she confided. Has anybody ever told you what a handsomefellow you are? She pinched his cheek. Jonathan blushed.     They climbed a ridge, paused at the crest. Below them, he saw a deepvalley. A stream tumbled through the center of it. There were treesalong its banks, the first he had seen on the asteroid. At the head ofthe valley, he made out the massive pile of a space liner.     They started down a winding path. The space liner disappeared behinda promontory of the mountain. Jonathan steeled himself for the comingordeal. He would have sat down and refused to budge except that he knewthe girls would hoist him on their shoulders and bear him into the camplike a bag of meal.     The trail debouched into the valley. Just ahead the space linerreappeared. He imagined that it had crashed into the mountain, skiddedand rolled down its side until it lodged beside the stream. It remindedhim of a wounded dinosaur. Three girls were bathing in the stream. Helooked away hastily.     Someone hailed them from the space ship.     We've caught a man, shrieked one of his captors.     A flock of girls streamed out of the wrecked space ship.     A man! screamed a husky blonde. She was wearing a grass skirt. Shehad green eyes. We're rescued!     No. No, Ann Clotilde hastened to explain. He was wrecked like us.     Oh, came a disappointed chorus.     He's a man, said the green-eyed blonde. That's the next best thing.     Oh, Olga, said a strapping brunette. Who'd ever thought a man couldlook so good?     I did, said Olga. She chucked Jonathan under the chin. He shiveredlike an unbroken colt when the bit first goes in its mouth. He feltlike a mouse hemmed in by a ring of cats.     A big rawboned brute of a girl strolled into the circle. She said,Dinner's ready. Her voice was loud, strident. It reminded him ofthe voices of girls in the honky tonks on Venus. She looked at himappraisingly as if he were a horse she was about to bid on. Bring himinto the ship, she said. The man must be starved.     He was propelled jubilantly into the palatial dining salon of thewrecked liner. A long polished meturilium table occupied the center ofthe floor. Automatic weight distributing chairs stood around it. Hisfeet sank into a green fiberon carpet. He had stepped back into theThirty-fourth Century from the fabulous barbarian past.     With a sigh of relief, he started to sit down. A lithe red-head sprangforward and held his chair. They all waited politely for him to beseated before they took their places. He felt silly. He felt likea captive princess. All the confidence engendered by the familiarsettings of the space ship went out of him like wind. He, JonathanFawkes, was a castaway on an asteroid inhabited by twenty-seven wildwomen.  "

    {
        "Query": "How does Jonathan Fawkes change over the course of The Happy Castaway?",
        "Summary_1": "At first, Jonathan Fawkes claims that he is most uncomfortable around women. Despite being a galavanting spaceman known around the universe for his strength and bravery, he is in awe and possibly fearful only of women. When he first arrives on the asteroid and encounters Ann, he is immensely uncomfortable with her gaze on him, and that continues as he discovers that she can overpower him in his weakened state quite easily. As the rest of the stranded women arrive, they all ogle at him and tell him how incredibly handsome he is. This only makes him even more uncomfortable. \nHowever, by the end of the story, he wraps his arms around Ann and would have embraced her had they not been caught by the others. The rest of the women vie for his attention, and he runs off back to his spaceship. At first, the reader might think it\u2019s because he needs to get away from the girls or that he can\u2019t handle the pressure. However, his encounter with the potential rescuers proves that he is now far more comfortable around the women. He ran back to his spaceship to grab his cigarettes and tobacco seeds. He always planned to return to the women and does not tell the rescuers about them. \nAlthough at first, he was terrified of the girls, by the end he too is infatuated and loves the situation at hand. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Jonathan undergoes a complete role reversal with the women on the asteroid. At first, Jonathan is rather uncomfortable at all the attention the 27 women pay him. He isn\u2019t accustomed to women openly flirting with him, being possessive of him, or being the center of their attention. He also isn\u2019t accustomed to women having control over him. When he wants to go back to his ship for his cartons of cigarettes and Ann tries to stop him, he tries to thwart her physically. But when other women join them and Ann explains what is happening, the women gang up together, tackle him, tie him up, and carry him to prevent him from going. As a big, rangy, tough man, he feels completely humiliated for the women to have the upper hand over him. The humiliation continues when he starts to slide over the edge of the narrow ledge, and the women save him and tie a rope around his waist like he\u2019s a baby on a leash. The women talk openly to him about his physical attractiveness and invite him to join them in private activities. The whole scene is much like what single women experience when they are in a group of men, and Jonathan doesn\u2019t know what to make of it. As the object of their attention, he finds he has no say in what they plan to do with him when Ann claims he belongs to her since she found him and others say they should all share him. However, when the men from the Interstellar Cosmography Society find Jonathan\u2019s ship and meet him, offering to take him with them, he tells them he has decided he likes it on the asteroid and will be staying there to raise tobacco. He doesn\u2019t mention the 27 women because he has decided that he likes the center of their attention.\n",
        "Summary_3": "When Jonathan first meets Ann Clotilde, he feels a little embarrassed and uncomfortable because being around beautiful women makes him feel awkward and nervous. He follows Ann back to the encampment because he is injured and unfamiliar with the environment of the asteroid. Jonathan is a tall and large man, but the women easily apprehend him, which makes him sulk. His sulking leads to him nearly falling off the cliff, and the women have to save him. He feels even more uncomfortable when he arrives at the encampment and meets the rest of the twenty-seven survivors of the crash. They are all beautiful women--he calls them Amazons--and they flirt with him incessantly calling him handsome and attractive. Unsure of their true intentions with him, Jonathan walks around the encampment with an exaggerated limp, hoping to garner their sympathy. As he does this, Ann corners him, and suddenly he feels a desire to flirt with her back until all of the women arrive and want to fight for his attention. Jonathan escapes back to his ship to get his cigarettes and finds a cosmography society there to survey the asteroid. They offer him a ride home, but he decides he wants to stay. Before, Jonathan wanted to escape from the women, but now he realizes he is happy there and wants to return.",
        "Summary_4": "Jonathan Fawkes is a space pilot with Universal, known in the interplanetary transport business as a man to leave alone. He thinks of himself as big and tough, and over the years he has picked up three broken noses and had a scar on his left cheek from a bar brawl. When the women capture him and tie him up to take him to their camp he says he has never been so humiliated in his life. He feels intimidated and scared by the sexual advances of the women, especially one named Olga, and wishes he could run away or retreat on several occasions.\nA transformation occurs when he is approached by Ann in the stream the morning after he sleeps at the women\u2019s camp. He switches from trying to escape to succumbing to her sexual advance. When the other women discover them together and Ann uses her spear to try to defend her claim over him, he runs back to his ship. However, he is only running back to his ship to gather supplies like tools, tobacco seeds from the cargo he was supposed to be delivering when he shipwrecked, and cigarettes. Even with the offer to go home from Doctor Boynton and his two colleagues from the Interstellar Cosmography Society who land on the asteroid and find his wreck, he decides that he will stay here with the women. They think he has lost his mind, but Jonathan sees an opportunity for himself now to live on the asteroid with the women and farm tobacco that he can sell to passing freighters in another three years when the orbit will cross the interplanetary shipping lane again.\n",
        "Article": "  The Happy Castaway     BY ROBERT E. McDOWELL     Being space-wrecked and marooned is tough     enough. But to face the horrors of such a     planet as this was too much. Imagine Fawkes'     terrible predicament; plenty of food\u2014and     twenty seven beautiful girls for companions.     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Planet Stories Spring 1945.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]       Jonathan Fawkes opened his eyes. He was flat on his back, and a girlwas bending over him. He detected a frightened expression on thegirl's face. His pale blue eyes traveled upward beyond the girl. Thesky was his roof, yet he distinctly remembered going to sleep on hisbunk aboard the space ship.     You're not dead?     I've some doubt about that, he replied dryly. He levered himself tohis elbows. The girl, he saw, had bright yellow hair. Her nose waspert, tip-tilted. She had on a ragged blue frock and sandals.     Is\u2014is anything broken? she asked.     Don't know. Help me up. Between them he managed to struggle to hisfeet. He winced. He said, My name's Jonathan Fawkes. I'm a space pilotwith Universal. What happened? I feel like I'd been poured out of aconcrete mixer.     She pointed to the wreck of a small space freighter a dozen feet away.Its nose was buried in the turf, folded back like an accordion. Ithad burst open like a ripe watermelon. He was surprised that he hadsurvived at all. He scratched his head. I was running from Mars toJupiter with a load of seed for the colonists.     Oh! said the girl, biting her lips. Your co-pilot must be in thewreckage.     He shook his head. No, he reassured her. I left him on Mars. Hehad an attack of space sickness. I was all by myself; that was thetrouble. I'd stay at the controls as long as I could, then lock her onher course and snatch a couple of hours' sleep. I can remember crawlinginto my bunk. The next thing I knew you were bending over me. Hepaused. I guess the automatic deflectors slowed me up or I would havebeen a cinder by this time, he said.     The girl didn't reply. She continued to watch him, a faint enigmaticsmile on her lips. Jonathan glanced away in embarrassment. He wishedthat pretty women didn't upset him so. He said nervously, Where am I?I couldn't have slept all the way to Jupiter.     The girl shrugged her shoulders.     I don't know.     You don't know! He almost forgot his self-consciousness in hissurprise. His pale blue eyes returned to the landscape. A mile acrossthe plain began a range of jagged foothills, which tossed upwardhigher and higher until they merged with the blue saw-edge of a chainof mountains. As he looked a puff of smoke belched from a truncatedcone-shaped peak. A volcano. Otherwise there was no sign of life: justhe and the strange yellow-headed girl alone in the center of that vastrolling prairie.     I was going to explain, he heard her say. We think that we are on anasteroid.     We? he looked back at her.     Yes. There are twenty-seven of us. We were on our way to Jupiter, too,only we were going to be wives for the colonists.     I remember, he exclaimed. Didn't the Jupiter Food-growersAssociation enlist you girls to go to the colonies?     She nodded her head. Only twenty-seven of us came through the crash.     Everybody thought your space ship hit a meteor, he said.     We hit this asteroid.     But that was three years ago.     Has it been that long? We lost track of time. She didn't take hereyes off him, not for a second. Such attention made him acutely selfconscious. She said, I'm Ann. Ann Clotilde. I was hunting when I sawyour space ship. You had been thrown clear. You were lying all in aheap. I thought you were dead. She stooped, picked up a spear.     Do you feel strong enough to hike back to our camp? It's only aboutfour miles, she said.     I think so, he said.   <doc-sep> Jonathan leaped to his feet, dumping Ann to the ground. He jerkedaround. All twenty-six of the girls were lined up on the path. Theirfeatures were grim. He said: I don't feel so well after all.     It don't wash, said Billy. It's time for a showdown.     Jonathan's hair stood on end. He felt rather than saw Ann Clotilde takeher stand beside him. He noticed that she was holding her spear at amenacing angle. She said in an angry voice: He's mine. I found him.Leave him alone.     Where do you get that stuff? cried Olga. Share and share alike, sayI.     We could draw straws for him, suggested the green-eyed blonde.     Look here, Jonathan broke in. I've got some say in the matter.     You have not, snapped Billy. You'll do just as we say. She took astep toward him.     Jonathan edged away in consternation.     He's going to run! Olga shouted.     Jonathan never stopped until he was back in the canyon leading to theplain. His nerves were jumping like fleas. He craved the soothingrelaxation of a smoke. There was, he remembered, a carton of cigarettesat the wreck. He resumed his flight, but at a more sober pace.     At the spot where he and Ann had first crawled away from the centaurs,he scrambled out of the gulley, glanced in the direction of his spaceship. He blinked his eyes, stared. Then he waved his arms, shouted andtore across the prairie. A trim space cruiser was resting beside thewreck of his own. Across its gleaming monaloid hull ran an inscriptionin silver letters: INTERSTELLAR COSMOGRAPHY SOCIETY.     Two men crawled out of Jonathan's wrecked freighter, glanced insurprise at Jonathan. A third man ran from the cruiser, a Dixon RayRifle in his hand.     I'm Jonathan Fawkes, said the castaway as he panted up, pilot forUniversal. I was wrecked.     A tall elderly man held out his hand. He had a small black waxedmustache and Van Dyke. He was smoking a venusian cigarette in ayellow composition holder. He said, I'm Doctor Boynton. He had arich cultivated voice, and a nose like a hawk. We are members of theInterstellar Cosmography Society. We've been commissioned to make acursory examination of this asteroid. You had a nasty crack up, Mr.Fawkes. But you are in luck, sir. We were on the point of returningwhen we sighted the wreck.     I say, said the man who had run out of the cruiser. He was a prim,energetic young man. Jonathan noted that he carried the ray gungingerly, respectfully. We're a week overdue now, he said. If youhave any personal belongings that you'd like to take with you, you'dbest be getting them aboard.   <doc-sep> The girls set up a shout and threw stones down at the centaurs, whoreared, pawed the air, and galloped to a safe distance, from which theyhurled back insults in a strange tongue. Their voices sounded faintlylike the neighing of horses.     Amazons and centaurs, he thought again. He couldn't get the problemof the girls' phenomenal strength out of his mind. Then it occurredto him that the asteroid, most likely, was smaller even than Earth'smoon. He must weigh about a thirtieth of what he usually did, due tothe lessened gravity. It also occurred to him that they would be thirtytimes as strong. He was staggered. He wished he had a smoke.     At length, the amazons and the centaurs tired of bandying insultsback and forth. The centaurs galloped off into the prairie, the girlsresumed their march. Jonathan scrambled up hills, skidded down slopes.The brunette was beside him helping him over the rough spots.     I'm Olga, she confided. Has anybody ever told you what a handsomefellow you are? She pinched his cheek. Jonathan blushed.     They climbed a ridge, paused at the crest. Below them, he saw a deepvalley. A stream tumbled through the center of it. There were treesalong its banks, the first he had seen on the asteroid. At the head ofthe valley, he made out the massive pile of a space liner.     They started down a winding path. The space liner disappeared behinda promontory of the mountain. Jonathan steeled himself for the comingordeal. He would have sat down and refused to budge except that he knewthe girls would hoist him on their shoulders and bear him into the camplike a bag of meal.     The trail debouched into the valley. Just ahead the space linerreappeared. He imagined that it had crashed into the mountain, skiddedand rolled down its side until it lodged beside the stream. It remindedhim of a wounded dinosaur. Three girls were bathing in the stream. Helooked away hastily.     Someone hailed them from the space ship.     We've caught a man, shrieked one of his captors.     A flock of girls streamed out of the wrecked space ship.     A man! screamed a husky blonde. She was wearing a grass skirt. Shehad green eyes. We're rescued!     No. No, Ann Clotilde hastened to explain. He was wrecked like us.     Oh, came a disappointed chorus.     He's a man, said the green-eyed blonde. That's the next best thing.     Oh, Olga, said a strapping brunette. Who'd ever thought a man couldlook so good?     I did, said Olga. She chucked Jonathan under the chin. He shiveredlike an unbroken colt when the bit first goes in its mouth. He feltlike a mouse hemmed in by a ring of cats.     A big rawboned brute of a girl strolled into the circle. She said,Dinner's ready. Her voice was loud, strident. It reminded him ofthe voices of girls in the honky tonks on Venus. She looked at himappraisingly as if he were a horse she was about to bid on. Bring himinto the ship, she said. The man must be starved.     He was propelled jubilantly into the palatial dining salon of thewrecked liner. A long polished meturilium table occupied the center ofthe floor. Automatic weight distributing chairs stood around it. Hisfeet sank into a green fiberon carpet. He had stepped back into theThirty-fourth Century from the fabulous barbarian past.     With a sigh of relief, he started to sit down. A lithe red-head sprangforward and held his chair. They all waited politely for him to beseated before they took their places. He felt silly. He felt likea captive princess. All the confidence engendered by the familiarsettings of the space ship went out of him like wind. He, JonathanFawkes, was a castaway on an asteroid inhabited by twenty-seven wildwomen.  "

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in THE STAR-SENT KNAVES?",
        "Summary_1": "Dan Slane is in Clyde Snithian's office; he proposes that, in response to a recent slew of art thefts, he guard Snithian's art vault overnight in addition to the external security he has. Dan is suspicious about the thefts and has a theory that the crooks are entering from within the vaults, perhaps through time travel. Snithian refuses to hire Dan, but Kelly, head of security, hires him in secret. That night, Dan guards from within the vault, keeping himself occupied with sleep and food, when a strange, cage like contraption appears out of thin air. Two men emerge, named Manny and Fiorello, and Dan hesitantly confronts them. While Dan speaks to them, Kelly's voice suddenly booms from a hidden speaker in the room, under the impression that Dan had been in on the thefts. Dan wrestles Manny and Fiorello off and manages to take control of the carrier and escape. Not knowing how to control it, Dan finds himself passing through many rooms and settings, until the carrier finally settles in an office room of a skyscraper. There, Dan meets Blote, a strange, giant-like creature, who asks him what happened to Manny and Fiorello. Blote, the apparent head of the art schemes, requests that Dan join the team to replace them. Dan refuses, and asks about the carrier, referring to it as a time machine; Blote is perplexed, unaware of the concept of a time machine, and demands that Dan find one in exchange for a reward, and for avoiding trouble for trespassing. Dan, unsure of where to retrieve a time machine, bluffs and manages to take Blote back to Snithian's, where he abandons him. Suddenly, Dan hears a siren, and the carrier travels to a park. The carrier becomes frosted over as a man emerges to confront him. The man introduces himself as an agent of the Inter-Dimensional Monitor Service.",
        "Summary_2": "Dan Slane approaches Clyde Snithian to tell about a flaw in the guarding system for paintings. There are more than two hundred bodyguards across the house but none in the vault, which is dangerous, because recently art collections were disappearing from locked vaults all over the world. Clyde refuses to waste more money on security and walks away, while Kelly, who is responsible for security, agrees to hire Dan for cheap. Dan makes himself comfortable at the new workplace and waits for the thieves to find out how they break in, which is his real goal. After eight hours, a framework appears in the air with two figures from the future sitting within, who soon step out into the vault. The two men, Manny and Fiorello, open and admire the paintings from the shelves without noticing Dan. When they realize his presence, the men try to back off and pretend to confuse the rooms. When Dan starts proposing a deal, Kelly's voice proclaims Dan a crook. Dan wants to join the departing men, and as there is only room for two, he aims the pistol at Manny. A fight for place happens and Kelly enters, grabbing Manny. Fiorello rushes to help his friend, another cop moves towards Dan, who enters the time machine and pulls a lever at random. Dan's plan goes wrong but he has the machine for himself as he wanted and he needs to figure out the controls. He emerges into a kitchen and then moves through the house to avoid being seen, unable to travel in time. Dan nearly crashes into a building but suddenly finds himself in an office with a weird creature at the desk. The boss asks about his two employees and Dan's coming. The creature comes from Vorplisch and proposes to Dan to take the place of Manny and Fiorello. When Dan mentions the time-machine, it turns out that the framework is a simple carrier, but a time-machine intrigues the creature who believes the humans have developed one. The creature introduces himself as Blote and warns Dan against trying to leave. He also tasks Dan with securing a time-machine for Blote, otherwise, Dan will be dealt harshly with. Dan points at the first name in the phone book and Blote decides to accompany him to the office to buy a time-machine. Blote is surprised he missed this development. The two drive towards the pointed building and get into it in secret. Inside, someone catches Blote for the break-in and Dan leaves in the carrier. Some noise appears from the machine and Dan finds himself in a park, where another creature named Dzhackoon appears, he is from Inter-dimensional Monitor Service. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Clyde W. Snithian is meeting with Dan Slane. Dan has told Eddie Kelly that he to see Snithian regarding the safeguarding of his paintings. Although Snithian has stationed two hundred and twenty-five guards working at all times, nobody is in the vault with the paintings. Snithian thinks it is unnecessary, but Kelly finds that Dan has a point. Snithian thinks it is unnecessary, but he is hired secretly anyway because he is willing to work cheaply. His purpose of doing this job is to see whoever has been stealing art from collections without entering the usual way. Since the Snithian collection is the largest west of the Mississippi, he waits inside and sees how the thieves operate. Eight hours later, Dan wakes up from his light doze when an apparition in the shape of an open-work cage with two figures inside suddenly materializes. Two men rise out of the cage, and they are pleased that the collection is fully-stocked. The shorter man, named Manny, complains that there are no nood dames. The taller man, named Fiorello, remarks on the artistic techniques of the paintings. Dan suddenly interrupts their conversation, and the two try to come up with excuses. Suddenly, Mr. Kelly\u2019s voice interrupts them as he assumes that Dan is working with the two. Dan points a pistol at Manny and tells him to stay because he will go with Fiorello; Kelly and three cops suddenly appear to confront them. As they struggle, Dan gets into the machine and tries to get a grip on the controls. He neutralizes the control lever to rest an inch above the floor, and a young girl appears at the end of the hallway. The girl gets ready to get into a tub, and as she whirls to see if there is anybody, the cage shoots with great acceleration. He scrambles out of the cage once he reaches his destination and sees a large man with too many hands behind a desk. The man is a Vorplischer, and he is confused when Dan calls the contraption a time machine. It is simply a carrier, and beachball says that his superiors will be delighted with any knowledge of a time machine. He introduces himself as Blote and tells Dan to bring back a small time machine. Dan pretends to bluff, and Blote says that he will go with him to the location he has picked. As Dan leads him through the building area in the cage, Manny and Fiorello come back for revenge. The carrier, with Dan in it, shoots away again; he begins to hear sirens as it goes to a new location. Although it does not catch the attention of anyone, Dan steps out to investigate as a dark-skinned, long-nosed, and  tall figure in a white uniform approaches him. The man, named Dzhackoon, introduces himself as a member of the Inter-dimensional Monitor Service and tells him that he is glad Dan stopped. Dan is confused and asks what Dzhackoon wants from him. ",
        "Summary_4": "The story begins with Dan Slane in Clyde W. Snithian\u2019s office. Dan is trying to convince Clyde that he has a deficiency in his security details and he would be the perfect person to fix the issuer. He is dismissed by the man, but Kelly, Clyde\u2019s head of security pulls him aside and informs him that he will hire him. Dan agrees to the conditions and is quickly put to work to monitor the vault by staying inside of it. \n\nDan\u2019s plan is to catch the thieves that are entering vaults and successfully stealing artwork. He has a suspicion that there is time travel involved in the plan. He suddenly wakes up and notices two frames in the vault with him. They are discussing their mission and the paintings that they spot in the vault. One of them eventually notices Dan, and he tries to stammer out a reply. He tells the two men, Fiorella and Manny, that he wants to join them. Kelly, who is listening into the fault, overhears Dan betraying him and shouts as such over a speaker installed in the vault. Dan gets into the carrier and successfully steals it. He figures out how to operate it and eventually ends up at the office of Blote. Blote, a Fourth Class Trader employed by the Vegan Confederation, is the boss of Manny and Fiorello. He\u2019s not mad at Dan and is willing to allow Dan to join his operations. During their discussions, Dan keeps insisting that a carrier is a time machine. Blote misunderstands Dan\u2019s assertions and believes him to not be referring to the carrier as he has never heard of someone successfully inventing the time machine. Blote then insists that Dan immediately take him to a time machine. Dan agrees to do so, and Blote controls the carrier to take both of them there. However, it is a trap and they end up in the vault where Manny and Fiorello still are trapped. Manny, Fiorello, and Blote are all angry with Dan and try to take control of the carrier. Dan is able to get away and he quickly moves the carrier into a different location. When the carrier settles again, he is greeted by a strange-looking figure that speaks to him in French. After some slight discussion between the two, Dan is told that he is in a place called the Anglic colonial sector and that the man is with the Inter-dimensional Monitor Service. It is clear that Dan has ended up in another strange and unknown location and is confused by his predicament. \n",

Round-shoulderedin a loose cloak, he blinked small reddish eyes at Dan Slane'stravel-stained six foot one.     Kelly here tells me you've been demanding to see me. He nodded towardthe florid man at his side. He had a high, thin voice, like somethingthat needed oiling. Something about important information regardingsafeguarding my paintings.     That's right, Mr. Snithian, Dan said. I believe I can be of greathelp to you.     Help how? If you've got ideas of bilking me.... The red eyes boredinto Dan like hot pokers.     Nothing like that, sir. Now, I know you have quite a system of guardshere\u2014the papers are full of it\u2014     Damned busybodies! Sensation-mongers! If it wasn't for the press,I'd have no concern for my paintings today!     Yes sir. But my point is, the one really important spot has been leftunguarded.     Now, wait a minute\u2014 Kelly started.     What's that? Snithian cut in.     You have a hundred and fifty men guarding the house and grounds dayand night\u2014     Two hundred and twenty-five, Kelly snapped.     \u2014but no one at all in the vault with the paintings, Slane finished.     Of course not, Snithian shrilled. Why should I post a man in thevault? It's under constant surveillance from the corridor outside.     The Harriman paintings were removed from a locked vault, Dan said.There was a special seal on the door. It wasn't broken.     By the saints, he's right, Kelly exclaimed. Maybe we ought to have aman in that vault.     Another idiotic scheme to waste my money, Snithian snapped. I'vemade you responsible for security here, Kelly! Let's have no morenonsense. And throw this nincompoop out! Snithian turned and stalkedaway, his cloak flapping at his knees.     I'll work cheap, Dan called after him as Kelly took his arm. I'm anart lover.     Never mind that, Kelly said, escorting Dan along the corridor. Heturned in at an office and closed the door.     Now, as the old buzzard said, I'm responsible for security here. Ifthose pictures go, my job goes with them. Your vault idea's not bad.Just how cheap would you work?     A hundred dollars a week, Dan said promptly. Plus expenses, headded.     Kelly nodded. I'll fingerprint you and run a fast agency check. Ifyou're clean, I'll put you on, starting tonight. But keep it quiet.   <doc-sep> What is it you wish? he barked. I understood in my discussions withthe other ... ah ... civilian there'd be no further need for theseirritating conferences.     I've just learned you're placing more students abroad, Mr. Gulver. Howmany this time?     Two thousand.     And where will they be going?     Croanie. It's all in the application form I've handed in. Your job isto provide transportation.     Will there be any other students embarking this season?     Why ... perhaps. That's Boge's business. Gulver looked at Retief withpursed lips. As a matter of fact, we had in mind dispatching anothertwo thousand to Featherweight.     Another under-populated world\u2014and in the same cluster, I believe,Retief said. Your people must be unusually interested in that regionof space.     If that's all you wanted to know, I'll be on my way. I have matters ofimportance to see to.     After Gulver left, Retief called Miss Furkle in. I'd like to have abreak-out of all the student movements that have been planned under thepresent program, he said. And see if you can get a summary of whatMEDDLE has been shipping lately.     Miss Furkle compressed her lips. If Mr. Magnan were here, I'm surehe wouldn't dream of interfering in the work of other departments.I ... overheard your conversation with the gentleman from the CroanieLegation\u2014     The lists, Miss Furkle.     I'm not accustomed, Miss Furkle said, to intruding in mattersoutside our interest cluster.     That's worse than listening in on phone conversations, eh? But nevermind. I need the information, Miss Furkle.     Loyalty to my Chief\u2014     Loyalty to your pay-check should send you scuttling for the materialI've asked for, Retief said. I'm taking full responsibility. Nowscat.     The buzzer sounded. Retief flipped a key. MUDDLE, Retief speaking....     Arapoulous's brown face appeared on the desk screen.     How-do, Retief. Okay if I come up?     Sure, Hank. I want to talk to you.     In the office, Arapoulous took a chair. Sorry if I'm rushing you,Retief, he said. But have you got anything for me?     Retief waved at the wine bottles. What do you know about Croanie?     Croanie? Not much of a place. Mostly ocean. All right if you likefish, I guess. We import our seafood from there. Nice prawns in monsoontime. Over a foot long.     You on good terms with them?     Sure, I guess so. Course, they're pretty thick with Boge.     So?     Didn't I tell you? Boge was the bunch that tried to take us over herea dozen years back. They'd've made it too, if they hadn't had a lot ofbad luck. Their armor went in the drink, and without armor they're easygame.     Miss Furkle buzzed. I have your lists, she said shortly.

Later that night, Dan sleeps in the art vault, a small room with gray walls that support paintings wrapped in brown paper. The room contains a bunk, fridge, and bookshelf. Once Dan escapes through the carrier, he finds himself passing through different rooms, including a kitchen, hallway, and bedroom. The carrier then takes him to an office in a skyscraper, with posters, framed paintings, and a desk, where he finds Blote. After returning back to Snithian's, the carrier takes him to a large park.",

The vault has gray walls, shelves stacked with wrapped paintings, a refrigerator with some snacks, a radio, an armchair bunk, a bookshelf and a small table. Soon a framework appears in the air with two people in armchairs. A mess takes place and Dan enters the framework alone. There are a lot of controls and levers, so Dan moves into some spacious kitchen with a cook. Then he travels through the house with a carpeted hall, a spiral staircase, a wide bedroom with flouncy curtains, a dressing table and a flowered canopy. Outside there is a clipped lawn an d a terrace, inside Dan appears in a plain room with a planter and a wide window. Suddenly, he heads towards some building wall and finds himself in a simple brown office with dim light, posters, paintings and a weird creature at the table, Blote.

        "Summary_3": "The story is initially set at Clyde W. Snithian\u2019s home. There is a vault full of paintings that is unguarded until Dan offers to become a guard. In the vault, there are shelves stacked with wrapped paintings under a low ceiling. Two three-hundred-watt bulbs also light the place up. To prepare Dan, Kelly has also ordered a neat-white refrigerator, a bunk, an arm-chair, a bookshelf, and a small table. The table is set with paper plates, plastic utensils, and a radio. Inside the fridge, Dan finds salami, liverwurst, cheese, and beer. The carrier that arrives in is an open-work cage about the size and shape of an outhouse minus the sheathing. There are two contoured chairs too. When Dan grabs the lever, he finds himself in a room with walls that glow blue. There is also a second lever present too. There is a third lever that causes the carrier to rise. The levers themselves do not have any controls written by them, and they are all plain, unadorned black. They look like ordinary circuit-breaker type knife-switches, and even the entire carrier looks hastily thrown together. He reaches an area with a hallway and goes into a bedroom shortly after. It is a wide chamber with flouncy curtains, a four-poster bed with a flowered canopy, and a dressing table. The area he is in has a terrace. Then, he steers the machine to a plain room with a depression in the floor, a wide window, and a planter filled with glowing blue plants. In the room, there is also a ten-foot-square sunken tub. The office that Blote is in is painted a simple brown, dimly lit by sunlight filtered through elaborate Venetian blinds. There is also a potted plant by the door, a heap of framed paintings beside it, and a desk on the far side of the room. Posters also line the walls of the office. The Time office that they go to is a square, five-story structure with lettering. The location is two twenty-one Maple Street. There is a dimly seen office, a second floor, and a barely visible corridor. Finally, when he gets into the carrier again, it takes him to an area where there is a landscape of trees and houses. He stops at the corner of a wide park. \n",
        "Summary_4": "The story begins in Clyde W. Snithian\u2019s office. After being hired by the head of security, Kelly, Dan settles into living within the vault. The vault is described as having grey walls with a low ceiling. Shelves are stacked against the walls and wrapped paintings are adorned upon them. There is a refrigerator, a bed, an armchair, a table, and a bookshelf along with other useful supplies for Dan to live in the vault. After taking the travel apparatus from the two art thieves, Fiorello and Manny, Dan ends up at the office of Blote. Under false pretences, Dan and Blote both end up traveling back to the vault where Manny and Fiorello still are trapped. Dan successfully is able to maneuver the three away from the carrier and he navigates it to a different location away from the vault. When Dan steps out of the carrier, he meets a strange-looking man. Through small talk, the man informs Dan that he is in the Anglic colonial sector speaking to a Field Agent of Class five with the Inter-dimensional Monitor Service.  ",

They had seen many such stars come near out of the galaxy's glitteringbackdrop, and had seen them dwindle, turn red and go out as the      QuestIII     drove on its way once more, lashed by despair toward the speed oflight, leaving behind the mockery of yet another solitary and lifelessluminary unaccompanied by worlds where men might dwell.

But now unwonted excitement possessed the hundred-odd members of the      Quest III's     crew. It was a subdued excitement; men and women, theycame and stood quietly gazing into the big vision screens that showedthe oncoming star, and there were wide-eyed children who had been bornin the ship and had never seen a planet.

If anyone else had noticed the change, he failed to mention it. Thisdisturbed Rikud, although he could not tell why.

        "Summary_1": "Dan first meets Blote when he finally stops the carrier. Blote is a giant, strange man with a beachball-like head and many fingers, with a mouth above his eyes. Dan is immediately intimidated and fascinated by Blote, and Blote, aware of his superiority, requests that Dan replace Manny and Fiorello in the art stealing scheme. When Dan refuses, Blote orders that he find him a time machine and threatens to punish him for trespassing. Dan manages to fool Blote, but the two have an imbalanced power relationship, where Blote is much more powerful than Dan. ",
        "Summary_2": "Dan is mistaken and he believes the carrier to be a time-machine, so he doesn't expect to meet Blote, especially considering the fact that the least is an alien. Dan basically spoils Blote's mission by preventing his two employees' escape. This mistake makes Blote to be seeking for the new employees and as Dan has seen him and knows about his crimes, he offers the job to the man. Dan is afraid and has no means to escape. Blote believes humans to develop a time-machine due to Dan's mistake and now he wants Dan to get it. So, their relationship is based on confusion and dangerous fo Dan. For that reason, the least leaves Blote behind and escapes, stealing the carrier. ",
        "Summary_3": "Blote is very interested after seeing Dan arrive from the carrier. He asks who Dan is and what he did to the other two men. He also supposes that Dan did not bring any paintings back after finding out how he got on the carrier. When Blote catches Dan looking at him, he says that he hopes Dan does not harbor any racial prejudices against him. He offers Dan something to drink after revealing what species he is from. Although Manny and Fiorello are gone, Blote is interested in hiring Dan as one of the staff. When Dan asks him about the time machine, however, he assumes that Dan is talking about how he knows where to get one. Dan is confused since he thinks that a carrier is a time machine. However, he becomes shocked once he realizes what Blote wants him to do for him to pay back for taking the carrier. To escape, he bluffs Blote into taking him to the fake Time location. Although Blote trusts him, Dan betrays this trust once Manny and Fiorello appear, leaving the three of them behind. ",
        "Summary_4": "Dan and Blote meet after Dan takes the apparatus from Fiorello and Manny after their tussle in the vault. Blote is the boss of Fiorello and Manny. Blote does not appear to be mad at Dan and even tries to recruit Dan to join his operations. He speaks very matter of fact to Dan and appears to try to answer his questions even though he does become confused at some of them. He trusts Dan to show him where to find a time machine and they both get on the carrier to go to the supposed location. However, Dan eventually betrays this trust and leads him into a trap. Then Dan ultimately takes the carrier again and goes to another unknown location. ",

But, to put you in the picture, I'd bestintroduce myself and explain my mission here. I'm Blote, Trader FourthClass, in the employ of the Vegan Confederation. My job is to developnew sources of novelty items for the impulse-emporiums of the entireSecondary Quadrant.     But the way Manny and Fiorello came sailing in through the wall! That      has     to be a time machine they were riding in. Nothing else could justmaterialize out of thin air like that.     You seem to have a time-machine fixation, Dan, Blote said. Youshouldn't assume, just because you people have developed time travel,that everyone has. Now\u2014 Blote's voice sank to a bass whisper\u2014I'llmake a deal with you, Dan. You'll secure a small time machine in goodcondition for me. And in return\u2014           I'm     supposed to supply      you     with a time machine?     Blote waggled a stubby forefinger at Dan. I dislike pointing it out,Dan, but you are in a rather awkward position at the moment. Illegalentry, illegal possession of property, trespass\u2014then doubtless someembarrassment exists back at the Snithian residence. I daresay Mr.Kelly would have a warm welcome for you. And, of course, I myself woulddeal rather harshly with any attempt on your part to take a powder.The Vegan flexed all eighteen fingers, drummed his tentacles under thedesk, and rolled one eye, bugging the other at Dan.     Whereas, on the other hand, Blote's bass voice went on, you and megot the basis of a sweet deal. You supply the machine, and I fix you upwith an abundance of the local medium of exchange. Equitable enough, Ishould say. What about it, Dan?     Ah, let me see, Dan temporized. Time machine. Time machine\u2014     Don't attempt to weasel on me, Dan, Blote rumbled ominously.     I'd better look in the phone book, Dan suggested.     Silently, Blote produced a dog-eared directory. Dan opened it.     Time, time. Let's see.... He brightened. Time, Incorporated; localbranch office. Two twenty-one Maple Street.     A sales center? Blote inquired. Or a manufacturing complex?     Both, Dan said. I'll just nip over and\u2014     That won't be necessary, Dan, Blote said. I'll accompany you. Hetook the directory, studied it.     Remarkable! A common commodity, openly on sale, and I failed to noticeit. Still, a ripe nut can fall from a small tree as well as from alarge. He went to his desk, rummaged, came up with a handful of fuelcells.

The bluff was all right up to apoint\u2014but the point had just about been reached. He took his seat.Blote moved a lever. The familiar blue glow sprang up. Kindly directme, Dan, Blote demanded. Two twenty-one Maple Street, I believe yousaid.     I don't know the town very well, Dan said, but Maple's over thatway.     Blote worked levers. The carrier shot out into a ghostly afternoon sky.Faint outlines of buildings, like faded negatives, spread below. Danlooked around, spotted lettering on a square five-story structure.     Over there, he said. Blote directed the machine as it swoopedsmoothly toward the flat roof Dan indicated.     Better let me take over now, Dan suggested. I want to be sure toget us to the right place.     Very well, Dan.     Dan dropped the carrier through the roof, passed down through a dimlyseen office. Blote twiddled a small knob. The scene around the cagegrew even fainter. Best we remain unnoticed, he explained.     The cage descended steadily. Dan peered out, searching for identifyinglandmarks. He leveled off at the second floor, cruised along a barelyvisible corridor. Blote's eyes rolled, studying the small chambersalong both sides of the passage at once.     Ah, this must be the assembly area, he exclaimed. I see the machinesemploy a bar-type construction, not unlike our carriers.     That's right, Dan said, staring through the haziness. This is wherethey do time.... He tugged at a lever suddenly; the machine veeredleft, flickered through a barred door, came to a halt. Two nebulousfigures loomed beside the cage. Dan cut the switch. If he'd guessedwrong\u2014     The scene fluoresced, sparks crackling, then popped into sharp focus.Blote scrambled out, brown eyes swivelling to take in the concretewalls, the barred door and\u2014     You! a hoarse voice bellowed.     Grab him! someone yelled.     Blote recoiled, threshing his ambulatory members in a fruitless attemptto regain the carrier as Manny and Fiorello closed in. Dan hauled at alever. He caught a last glimpse of three struggling, blue-lit figuresas the carrier shot away through the cell wall.      III     Dan slumped back against the seat with a sigh. Now that he was in theclear, he would have to decide on his next move\u2014fast. There was notelling what other resources Blote might have. He would have to hidethe carrier, then\u2014     A low growling was coming from somewhere, rising in pitch and volume.Dan sat up, alarmed. This was no time for a malfunction.     The sound rose higher, into a penetrating wail. There was no sign ofmechanical trouble. The carrier glided on, swooping now over a nebulouslandscape of trees and houses. Dan covered his ears against thedeafening shriek, like all the police sirens in town blaring at once.If the carrier stopped it would be a long fall from here. Dan workedthe controls, dropping toward the distant earth.     The noise seemed to lessen, descending the scale. Dan slowed, broughtthe carrier in to the corner of a wide park. He dropped the last fewinches and cut the switch.     As the glow died, the siren faded into silence.     Dan stepped from the carrier and looked around. Whatever the noisewas, it hadn't attracted any attention from the scattered pedestriansin the park. Perhaps it was some sort of burglar alarm. But if so, whyhadn't it gone into action earlier? Dan took a deep breath. Sound or nosound, he would have to get back into the carrier and transfer it to asecluded spot where he could study it at leisure. He stepped back in,reached for the controls\u2014     There was a sudden chill in the air. The bright surface of the dialsbefore him frosted over. There was a loud      pop!     like a flashbulbexploding. Dan stared from the seat at an iridescent rectanglewhich hung suspended near the carrier. Its surface rippled, fadedto blankness. In a swirl of frosty air, a tall figure dressed in atight-fitting white uniform stepped through.     Dan gaped at the small rounded head, the dark-skinned long-nosed face,the long, muscular arms, the hands, their backs tufted with curlyred-brown hair, the strange long-heeled feet in soft boots. A neatpillbox cap with a short visor was strapped low over the deep-setyellowish eyes, which turned in his direction. The wide mouth opened ina smile which showed square yellowish teeth.           Alors, monsieur     , the new-comer said, bending his knees and back ina quick bow.       Vous ete une indigine, n'est ce pas?          No compree, Dan choked out Uh ... juh no parlay Fransay....     My error. This is the Anglic colonial sector, isn't it? Stupid of me.Permit me to introduce myself. I'm Dzhackoon, Field Agent of Classfive, Inter-dimensional Monitor Service.     That siren, Dan said. Was that you?     Dzhackoon nodded. For a moment, it appeared you were disinclined tostop. I'm glad you decided to be reasonable.     What outfit did you say you were with? Dan asked.     The Inter-dimensional Monitor Service.     Inter-what?     Dimensional. The word is imprecise, of course, but it's the best ourlanguage coder can do, using the Anglic vocabulary.

Snithian declines, but Kelly, head of security, accepts, and that night Dan is settled into the vault. After a few hours, Dan is shocked to see a machine appear out of thin air, where two men appear to steal the art. Dan believes this is a time machine, but Kelly suddenly arrives and threatens to arrest Dan, believing he is part of an inside job. Dan attempts to escape with the carrier, and after a few detours, he ends up in the office of a large man named Blote. He asks Blote about the carrier, implying that it is a time machine, but Blote demands that Dan supply him with a time machine, as his people have never seen one. Dan leads Blote back to the Snithian office, where Manny and Fiorello see him, but he manages to escape once again. Then, Dan hears a siren as the carrier hurdles through the air, and he is met by a man who says he is from the Inter-dimensional Monitor Service. ",

So he gets a job as a vault guard for cheap at Snithian's vault, where the collection is read and must attract the thieves. He faces two men exiting from a framework and believes them to come in a time-machine from the future. He asks to join them and as they don't have space for him, he attacks them and leaves alone. The plan goes wrong when Dan can't figure out how to control the machine and finds himself in a house full of people, He moves from one room to another trying not to be seen. Eventually, the carrier takes him to Blote's office who is a weirdly looking creature and who makes Dan scared. Dan is in danger and has to bluff, as Blote wants him to get a time-machine. So, the two enter an office where Dan leaves Blote behind and escapes the guard. On the way, he hears loud siren-like noise and stepson a park, where he meets another creature reminding Blote. ",

After, the carrier takes him to Blote, who then demands him to go retrieve a small time machine for further analysis. Not trusting that Dan won\u2019t escape on his own, Blote decides to go with him to see the time machines himself. Dan is once again traveling on the carrier by himself when he leaves Blote behind with the other two men who have come back for revenge. Then, he has an encounter with Dzhackoon, who sounds the alarm that causes him to land the carrier once again.",

Dan\u2019s predictions are somewhat accurate as two men do suddenly appear in the vault to steal the art. He then proceeds to try to convince them to take him with them as he believes that it is a time machine they are using to complete their heists. Kelly overhears this through the microphones he had installed in the vault and tells Dan that when he gets inside he will be punished. Dan becomes frantic and in a tussle with the two art thieves, Manny and Fiorello, he steals their apparatus and activates it to the best of his abilities. The following sequence of events has Dan transported to different locations that cause more confusion. The owner of the apparatus, or the carrier, does not confirm Dan\u2019s suspicion that it is a time machine and even seems confused by the question.

Nothing like that, sir. Now, I know you have quite a system of guardshere\u2014the papers are full of it\u2014     Damned busybodies! Sensation-mongers! If it wasn't for the press,I'd have no concern for my paintings today!     Yes sir. But my point is, the one really important spot has been leftunguarded.     Now, wait a minute\u2014 Kelly started.     What's that? Snithian cut in.     You have a hundred and fifty men guarding the house and grounds dayand night\u2014     Two hundred and twenty-five, Kelly snapped.     \u2014but no one at all in the vault with the paintings, Slane finished.     Of course not, Snithian shrilled. Why should I post a man in thevault? It's under constant surveillance from the corridor outside.     The Harriman paintings were removed from a locked vault, Dan said.There was a special seal on the door. It wasn't broken.     By the saints, he's right, Kelly exclaimed. Maybe we ought to have aman in that vault.     Another idiotic scheme to waste my money, Snithian snapped. I'vemade you responsible for security here, Kelly! Let's have no morenonsense. And throw this nincompoop out! Snithian turned and stalkedaway, his cloak flapping at his knees.     I'll work cheap, Dan called after him as Kelly took his arm. I'm anart lover.     Never mind that, Kelly said, escorting Dan along the corridor. Heturned in at an office and closed the door.     Now, as the old buzzard said, I'm responsible for security here. Ifthose pictures go, my job goes with them. Your vault idea's not bad.Just how cheap would you work?     A hundred dollars a week, Dan said promptly. Plus expenses, headded.     Kelly nodded. I'll fingerprint you and run a fast agency check. Ifyou're clean, I'll put you on, starting tonight. But keep it quiet.   <doc-sep> Dan took a deep breath and tried another lever. The cage rose gently,in eerie silence. It reached the ceiling and kept going. Dan grittedhis teeth as an eight-inch band of luminescence passed down the cage.Then he was emerging into a spacious kitchen. A blue-haloed cookwaddled to a luminous refrigerator, caught sight of Dan rising slowlyfrom the floor, stumbled back, mouth open. The cage rose, penetrated asecond ceiling. Dan looked around at a carpeted hall.     Cautiously he neutralized the control lever. The cage came to rest aninch above the floor. As far as Dan could tell, he hadn't traveled somuch as a minute into the past or future.     He looked over the controls. There should be one labeled Forwardand another labeled Back, but all the levers were plain, unadornedblack. They looked, Dan decided, like ordinary circuit-breaker typeknife-switches. In fact, the whole apparatus had the appearance ofsomething thrown together hastily from common materials. Still, itworked. So far he had only found the controls for maneuvering in theusual three dimensions, but the time switch was bound to be heresomewhere....     Dan looked up at a movement at the far end of the hall.     A girl's head and shoulders appeared, coming up a spiral staircase. Inanother second she would see him, and give the alarm\u2014and Dan neededa few moments of peace and quiet in which to figure out the controls.He moved a lever. The cage drifted smoothly sideways, sliced throughthe wall with a flurry of vivid blue light. Dan pushed the leverback. He was in a bedroom now, a wide chamber with flouncy curtains, afour-poster under a flowered canopy, a dressing table\u2014     The door opened and the girl stepped into the room. She was young. Notover eighteen, Dan thought\u2014as nearly as he could tell with the bluelight playing around her face. She had long hair tied with a ribbon,and long legs, neatly curved. She wore shorts and carried a tennisracquet in her left hand and an apple in her right. Her back to Dan andthe cage, she tossed the racquet on a table, took a bite of the apple,and began briskly unbuttoning her shirt.     Dan tried moving a lever. The cage edged toward the girl. Another;he rose gently. The girl tossed the shirt onto a chair and undid thezipper down the side of the shorts. Another lever; the cage shot towardthe outer wall as the girl reached behind her back....     Dan blinked at the flash of blue and looked down. He was hoveringtwenty feet above a clipped lawn.     He looked at the levers. Wasn't it the first one in line that moved thecage ahead? He tried it, shot forward ten feet. Below, a man steppedout on the terrace, lit a cigarette, paused, started to turn his faceup\u2014     Dan jabbed at a lever. The cage shot back through the wall. He was in aplain room with a depression in the floor, a wide window with a planterfilled with glowing blue plants\u2014     The door opened. Even blue, the girl looked graceful as a deer as shetook a last bite of the apple and stepped into the ten-foot-squaresunken tub. Dan held his breath. The girl tossed the apple core aside,seemed to suddenly become aware of eyes on her, whirled\u2014     With a sudden lurch that threw Dan against the steel bars, thecage shot through the wall into the open air and hurtled off withan acceleration that kept him pinned, helpless. He groped for thecontrols, hauled at a lever. There was no change. The cage rushedon, rising higher. In the distance, Dan saw the skyline of a town,approaching with frightful speed. A tall office building reared upfifteen stories high. He was headed dead for it\u2014     He covered his ears, braced himself\u2014     With an abruptness that flung him against the opposite side of thecage, the machine braked, shot through the wall and slammed to a stop.Dan sank to the floor of the cage, breathing hard. There was a loud      click!     and the glow faded.     With a lunge, Dan scrambled out of the cage. He stood looking around ata simple brown-painted office, dimly lit by sunlight filtered throughelaborate venetian blinds. There were posters on the wall, a pottedplant by the door, a heap of framed paintings beside it, and at the farside of the room a desk. And behind the desk\u2014Something.      II     Dan gaped at a head the size of a beachball, mounted on a torso like ahundred-gallon bag of water. Two large brown eyes blinked at him frompoints eight inches apart. Immense hands with too many fingers unfoldedand reached to open a brown paper carton, dip in, then toss threepeanuts, deliberately, one by one, into a gaping mouth that opened justabove the brown eyes.     Who're you? a bass voice demanded from somewhere near the floor.     I'm ... I'm ... Dan Slane ... your honor.     What happened to Manny and Fiorello?     They\u2014I\u2014There was this cop. Kelly\u2014     Oh-oh. The brown eyes blinked deliberately. The many-fingered handsclosed the peanut carton and tucked it into a drawer.     Well, it was a sweet racket while it lasted, the basso voice said. Apity to terminate so happy an enterprise. Still.... A noise like anamplified Bronx cheer issued from the wide mouth.     How ... what...?     The carrier returns here automatically when the charge drops below acritical value, the voice said. A necessary measure to discouragebig ideas on the part of wisenheimers in my employ. May I ask how youhappen to be aboard the carrier, by the way?     I just wanted\u2014I mean, after I figured out\u2014that is, the police ... Iwent for help, Dan finished lamely.     Help? Out of the picture, unfortunately. One must maintain one'sanonymity, you'll appreciate. My operation here is under wraps atpresent. Ah, I don't suppose you brought any paintings?     Dan shook his head. He was staring at the posters. His eyes,accustoming themselves to the gloom of the office, could now make outthe vividly drawn outline of a creature resembling an alligator-headedgiraffe rearing up above scarlet foliage. The next poster showed a facesimilar to the beachball behind the desk, with red circles paintedaround the eyes. The next was a view of a yellow volcano spouting fireinto a black sky.     Too bad. The words seemed to come from under the desk. Dan squinted,caught a glimpse of coiled purplish tentacles. He gulped and looked upto catch a brown eye upon him. Only one. The other seemed to be busilyat work studying the ceiling.     I hope, the voice said, that you ain't harboring no reactionaryracial prejudices.   <doc-sep> Now that the virus diseases had been licked, people hardly evergot sick any more and, when they did, it was mostly psychosomatic.Life was so well organized that there weren't even many accidentsthese days. It was a safe, orderly existence for those who fittedinto it\u2014which accounted for more than ninety-five per cent of thepopulation. The only ones who didn't adjust were those who couldn't,like me\u2014psi-deficients, throwbacks to an earlier era. There were nophysical cripples, because anybody could have a new arm or a new leggrafted on, but you couldn't graft psi powers onto an atavism or, ifyou could, the technique hadn't been developed yet.     I feel a sense of impending doom brooding over this household, myyoungest brother remarked cheerfully as he vaulted into his chair.     You always do, Timothy, my mother said, unfolding her napkin. And Imust say it's not in good taste, especially at breakfast.     He reached for his juice. Guess this is a doomed household. And whatwas all that emotional uproar about?     The usual, Sylvia said from the doorway before anyone else couldanswer. She slid warily into her chair. Hey, Dan, I'm here! shecalled. If anything else comes in, it comes in manually, understand?     Oh, all right. Dan emerged from the kitchen with a tray of foodfloating ahead of him.     The usual? Trouble with Kev? Tim looked at me narrowly. Somehow mysense of ominousness is connected with him.     Well, that's perfectly natural\u2014 Sylvia began, then stopped as Mothercaught her eye.     I didn't mean that, Tim said. I still say Kev's got something wecan't figure out.     You've been saying that for years, Danny protested, and he's beentested for every faculty under the Sun. He can't telepath or teleportor telekinesthesize or even teletype. He can't precognize or prefix orprepossess. He can't\u2014     Strictly a bundle of no-talent, that's me, I interrupted, trying tokeep my animal feelings from getting the better of me. That was how myfamily thought of me, I knew\u2014as an animal, and not a very lovable one,either.     No, Tim said, he's just got something we haven't developed a testfor. It'll come out some day, you'll see. He smiled at me.  "

        "Query": "What kind of gear is utilized in THE STAR-SENT KNAVES?",
        "Summary_1": "The main piece of equipment used in the story is the carrier that Manny and Fiorello arrive in. The carrier contains lots of different levers and controls that make it difficult to navigate. It is able to appear out of thin air, a cage-like structure that has a blue luminous glow to it. Despite the futuristic abilities of the carrier, it is made up of common parts and is not the sturdiest. The carrier is able to appear in random places, but it is also used by Blote to travel to Maple Street.",
        "Summary_2": "The vault is locked and guarded by armed people, Dan himself is supplied with a pistol. The two men appear in a glowing framework in the air, which Dan believes to be a time machine. Indeed, it's an inter-dimensional carrier which can travel rapidly through walls but not through time. It's equipped with multiple levers and controls, which are hard to figure. Siren-like sound is used by inter-dimensional Monitor Service to make the carriers stop. ",
        "Summary_3": "The carrier is the main piece of equipment used throughout the story. It is capable of taking its passengers to a variety of different places by using specific controls and can pass through walls undetected. It is how the art thieves were capable of stealing many pieces of art, despite the vaults often being heavily guarded or sealed. Another piece of equipment is the pistol that Dan points at Manny. It is supplied by Kelly, and Dan does not fire it but uses it to threaten the other man into staying so he can go aboard the carrier. Another piece of equipment used is the siren that Dzhackoon sounds. It sounds like a typical police siren, but nobody else hears it except for Dan. ",
        "Summary_4": "The main equipment that is used in the story is a travel apparatus that is used by Manny and Fiorello to get into the vault to steal valuable artwork. Dan believes it to be a time machine. He takes the apparatus from the two thieves and uses it to go to a different location where he meets Blote, the two thieves\u2019 boss. While on his journey, he figures out how to use the different levels on the machine to control the direction of travel. When he implies to Blote that it is a time machine, Blote is confused and shows that he does not know of the existence of a time machine. Blote calls the travel apparatus a carrier.  ",

It might be possible. He fingeredhis mustache and regarded me from pouchy eyes. Busy executives oftencome to us to avoid the\u2014ah\u2014unpleasantness of formal arrangements.Naturally, we only act as agents, you might say. We never see themerchandise ourselves\u2014 He wiped his hands on his trousers. Now wereyou interested in the ordinary Utility model, Mr. Faircloth?     I assumed he was just being polite. You didn't come to the back doorfor Utility models.     Or perhaps you'd require one of our Deluxe models. Very carefulworkmanship. Only a few key Paralyzers in operation and practicallycomplete circuit duplication. Very useful for\u2014ah\u2014close contact work,you know. Social engagements, conferences\u2014     I was shaking my head. I want a      Super     Deluxe model, I told him.     He grinned and winked. Ah, indeed! You want perfect duplication.Yes, indeed. Domestic situations can be\u2014awkward, shall we say. Veryawkward\u2014     I gave him a cold stare. I couldn't see where my domestic problems wereany affairs of his. He got the idea and hurried me back to a storeroom.     We keep a few blanks here for the basic measurement. You'll go to ourlaboratory on 14th Street to have the minute impressions taken. But Ican assure you you'll be delighted, simply delighted.     The blanks weren't very impressive\u2014clay and putty and steel, faceless,brainless. He went over me like a tailor, checking measurements of allsorts. He was thorough\u2014embarrassingly thorough, in fact\u2014but finallyhe was finished. I went on to the laboratory.     And that was all there was to it.   <doc-sep> Rikud heard the throbbing again as he stood in the room of themachinery. For a long time he watched the wheels and cogs and gearsspinning and humming. He watched for he knew not how long. And then hebegan to wonder. If he destroyed the wheels and the cogs and the gears,would the buzzer stop? It probably would, because, as Rikud saw it, hewas clearly an unauthorized person. He had heard the voice againupon entering the room.     He found a metal rod, bright and shiny, three feet long and half aswide as his arm. He tugged at it and it came loose from the wires thatheld it in place. He hefted it carefully for a moment, and then heswung the bar into the mass of metal. Each time he heard a grinding,crashing sound. He looked as the gears and cogs and wheels crumbledunder his blows, shattered by the strength of his arm.       Almost casually he strode about the room, but his blows were notcasual. Soon his easy strides had given way to frenzied running. Rikudsmashed everything in sight.     When the lights winked out, he stopped. Anyway, by that time the roomwas a shambles of twisted, broken metal. He laughed, softly at first,but presently he was roaring, and the sound doubled and redoubled inhis ears because now the throbbing had stopped.     He opened the door and ran through the little corridor to the smallerviewport. Outside he could see the stars, and, dimly, the terrainbeneath them. But everything was so dark that only the stars shoneclearly. All else was bathed in a shadow of unreality.     Rikud never wanted to do anything more than he wanted to open thatdoor. But his hands trembled too much when he touched it, and once,when he pressed his face close against the viewport, there in thedarkness, something bright flashed briefly through the sky and was gone.     Whimpering, he fled.  "
