        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the story's storyline?",
        "Summary_1": "Second Secretary Magnan will be away from the Manpower Utilization Directorate, Division of Libraries and Education (MUDDLE) for two weeks, leaving Retief in charge. Magnan reminds Retief that his role is to act as a rubber stamp, continuing Magnan\u2019s actions. Magnan points out that Retief should appreciate that Bogan is participating in the Exchange Program. Its participation might be a step toward sublimating their aggression into more cultivated channels. The Bogans are sending two thousand students to d\u2019Land as exchange students, and Magnan thinks this might end their aggression and bring them into the cultural life of the Galaxy. Retief wonders aloud what the students will study in such a poor, industrial land. Magnan points out that this is none of Retief\u2019s concern and that his role is simply to facilitate bringing the two groups together. When Miss Furkle, the secretary, buzzes Magnan that the bucolic person from Lovenbroy is there again, Magnan pushes the meeting off onto Retief.\n\nThe person from Lovenbroy is named Hank Arapoulous. He is a farmer and tells Retief that the Bacchus vines that they use to make their wine mature every twelve years and that this year is a harvest year, but they are short on workers to harvest the grapes. They have a shortage of workers for the harvest due to their conflict over strip mining and the loss of several of their young men in the battles to prevent it. Also, Lovenbroy had to borrow money from Croanie, and the loan was due. The wine crop will put them in the clear if they can harvest it. The biggest concern is what Croanie will do with the land if they can\u2019t pay the loan; Lovenbroy has offered half its grape acreage as security for the loan it received. Hank asks Retief for a loan, but Retief tells him that MEDDLE\u2019s role is only for transportation. Hank says he also checked with the Labor Office, but it only offered to set them up with machinery. \n\nRetief attends a council meeting and learns that Croanie will receive a shipment of strip mining equipment. A spokesman for the Special Committee for Rehabilitation and Overhaul of Under-developed Nations\u2019 General Economies (SCROUNGE) indicates he has been trying to get mining equipment for d\u2019Land. He tells Retief that Boge is a troublemaker, so all the agencies in the Corps are trying to appease her. Upon further discussion, Retief learns that d\u2019Land doesn\u2019t have a university for the exchange students to attend, just a technical college that would be overwhelmed to receive 200, much less 2,000, students. \n\nRetief also learns that all the exchange students are males, and their \u201cluggage\u201d is full of weapons. He diverts their luggage and sends the exchange students to Lovenbroy, where they help harvest the grapes. Retief is also sent to Lovenbroy for exceeding his authority. Hank tells Retief that he has won the prize for the picking competition. The prize is a girl named Delinda.\n\n",
        "Summary_2": "Retief is left in charge of his division while his superior, Magnan, is out of the office. After a farmer from the planet Lovenbroy tries to enlist his help with a labor shortage, Retief realizes a complex plot has been set into motion by the government of the planet Boge. The Bogans are sending two-thousand students to the planet D\u2019Land, except there\u2019s no school to accommodate them there and they\u2019re not actually students but soldiers. They\u2019ve also arranged to have weapons and war vehicles shipped under the guise of student baggage and tractors. Boge is using the financial leverage they have with the planet Croanie to get them to help with these shipments, and to ultimately allow the Bogans to take over Lovenbroy (a planet in debt to Lovenbroy that Boge has tried and failed to conquer in the past), D\u2019Land, and potentially another planet. After Retief uncovers how all of these plans and planets are connected, he moves to disrupt them. He reroutes the \u201cstudents\u201d to Lovenbroy to help with their grape harvest and allow them to get out of their debt to Croanie, and the war machines to D\u2019Land where they\u2019ll be out of Bogan hands. The end of the story finds Retief on Lovenbroy, where he has been sent because his superiors aren\u2019t happy that he meddled with the Bogan situation. Retief doesn\u2019t seem to mind his exile to Lovenbroy at all, as he has just won the grape harvest competition and met the beautiful woman who claims to be his prize. \n",
        "Summary_3": "\tAfter Second Secretary Magnan took his temporary leave of the Manpower Utilization Directorate, Division of Libraries and Education (AKA MUDDLE), Retief, his subordinate, is put in charge. Retief\u2019s first order of business is dealing with Hank Arapoulous who came to MUDDLE to ask for some help harvesting the Bacchus grapes. He shares that they are indebted to Croanie, who loaned them funds after a failed invasion from the Bogans. Arapoulous is worried that the Croanie\u2019s will be able to come in and harvest the grapes (as well as take the land) for themselves if they can\u2019t pay the debt since they hold the mortgage on some of the acreage. After sharing some wine (alternating between red and black), Retief agrees to try and see if he can send some helping hands to Lovenbroy, Arapoulous\u2019 home planet. \n\tRetief soon discovers that MEDDLE, another division at the Manpower Utilization Director, has authorized a shipment of 500 tractors that will be sent to Croanie. Retief questions Mr. Whaffle about it, and he explains that they are in need of heavy mining equipment. However, Croanie is mostly made up of fisheries, so there\u2019s nothing to mine there. Retief questions other shipments as well, including the authorized transport of 2,000 Bogan students to d\u2019Land. He discovers that there is only one technical college on d\u2019Land and that it would be overwhelmed with just 200 transfer students. As well, Boge and d\u2019Land have a very tense relationship; such a trade would be very rare. Sensing something fishy, Retief continues his search. \n\tOn his way to greet the incoming students, Retief stops at a bar and meets their teacher, Mr. Karsh. He describes training them as if they were in the military, not as if they were students. They leave together to meet the students. Retief arranged for a variety of fun events for the students, but Mr. Karsh shuts it all down. He simply wants to know when their luggage, flying in on a Croanie ship, will get in and when they will leave. \n\tQuickly, their plot falls apart as Retief researches these tractors and discovers they are machines built for war. After interrogating Mr. Whaffle about the shipment, he discovers that the tractors are going to Lovenbroy. He speaks to Mr. Gulver, a Bogan representative, who reveals that he just submitted an application for transportation for another 2,000 students. Retief then discovers the student\u2019s luggage was bound for Lovenbroy and filled with army-grade weaponry. Putting it all together, Retief sends the students to Lovenbroy without their weapons, hands Mr. Karsh off to Arapoulous for a frank talking to, and sends the tractors to d\u2019Land. The plan now thwarted, the students help harvest the Bacchus grapes. \n\tRetief was sent to Lovenbroy as punishment. He joins the harvest and ends up picking the most grapes of them all. His prize is a beautiful blonde woman. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Corps HQ is a diplomatic entity that houses a number of intergalactic departments, including the Manpower Utilization Directorate, Division of Libraries and Education (MUDDLE), which employs the story\u2019s protagonist, Retief. Retief reports to Second Secretary Magnan, who is taking some time off and asks Retief to manage affairs in his absence. He reminds Retief of a group of students from the planet Boge who will be traveling to the planet d\u2019Land as part of an Exchange Program. Magnan\u2019s hope is this program will help the warring Bogans better assimilate into the Galaxy\u2019s culture. While he is gone, Retief meets with a man named Hank Arapoulous, who represents a planet called Lovenbroy, known for its plentiful grape harvests. Over wine, Hank requests labor to harvest the crop essential to their livelihood on Lovenbroy, and Retief learns of their connection to a planet called Croanie. Several years ago, the farmers of Lovenbroy had to defend their mineral resources against their neighbors, and they lost a lot of money and men in the process. Therefore, they had to borrow money from Croanie, and Hank is afraid they won\u2019t be able to pay their debt on time without enough hands to harvest their grape crop. In addition, in their desperation, the farmers of Lovenbroy pawned the mortgage of their vineyards to Croanie thinking the twelve-year crop rotation would buy them enough time to pay back their debts. Retief says he will try to find a solution to his problem, and he sets about to attend the Intergroup Council and meet with the Bogan students set to depart for d\u2019Land. At the Council meeting, he learns Croanie is set to receive a shipment of mining equipment from the Corps, and the school on d\u2019Land set to receive the 2,000 Bogan students could hardly accommodate 200. At a bar later, Retief meets a man named Karsh, who drunkenly reveals he is training the students for something other than studying. At the library later, Retief learns that the tractors being sent to Croanie are not mining equipment, but are heavily armored with firepower. When Retief questions why so many tractors are being sent to a planet without the capacity to process them, he learns the excess will be sent to Boge. Retief deduces the entire situation is a Bogan plot to send troops to d\u2019Land and have Croanie provide the military equipment sourced from Corps grants. Instead, Retief has representatives from Armaments confiscate the students\u2019 luggage (which are actually filled with guns) and sends the \u201cstudents\u201d to Lovenbroy instead, where they help the farmers harvest their grape crop. Later, on Lovenbroy, Retief wins the grape-picking competition and celebrates with a local woman named Delinda, his prize for winning.",
        "Article": "What is it you wish? he barked. I understood in my discussions withthe other ... ah ... civilian there'd be no further need for theseirritating conferences.     I've just learned you're placing more students abroad, Mr. Gulver. Howmany this time?     Two thousand.     And where will they be going?     Croanie. It's all in the application form I've handed in. Your job isto provide transportation.     Will there be any other students embarking this season?     Why ... perhaps. That's Boge's business. Gulver looked at Retief withpursed lips. As a matter of fact, we had in mind dispatching anothertwo thousand to Featherweight.     Another under-populated world\u2014and in the same cluster, I believe,Retief said. Your people must be unusually interested in that regionof space.     If that's all you wanted to know, I'll be on my way. I have matters ofimportance to see to.     After Gulver left, Retief called Miss Furkle in. I'd like to have abreak-out of all the student movements that have been planned under thepresent program, he said. And see if you can get a summary of whatMEDDLE has been shipping lately.     Miss Furkle compressed her lips. If Mr. Magnan were here, I'm surehe wouldn't dream of interfering in the work of other departments.I ... overheard your conversation with the gentleman from the CroanieLegation\u2014     The lists, Miss Furkle.     I'm not accustomed, Miss Furkle said, to intruding in mattersoutside our interest cluster.     That's worse than listening in on phone conversations, eh? But nevermind. I need the information, Miss Furkle.     Loyalty to my Chief\u2014     Loyalty to your pay-check should send you scuttling for the materialI've asked for, Retief said. I'm taking full responsibility. Nowscat.     The buzzer sounded. Retief flipped a key. MUDDLE, Retief speaking....     Arapoulous's brown face appeared on the desk screen.     How-do, Retief. Okay if I come up?     Sure, Hank. I want to talk to you.     In the office, Arapoulous took a chair. Sorry if I'm rushing you,Retief, he said. But have you got anything for me?     Retief waved at the wine bottles. What do you know about Croanie?     Croanie? Not much of a place. Mostly ocean. All right if you likefish, I guess. We import our seafood from there. Nice prawns in monsoontime. Over a foot long.     You on good terms with them?     Sure, I guess so. Course, they're pretty thick with Boge.     So?     Didn't I tell you? Boge was the bunch that tried to take us over herea dozen years back. They'd've made it too, if they hadn't had a lot ofbad luck. Their armor went in the drink, and without armor they're easygame.     Miss Furkle buzzed. I have your lists, she said shortly.     Bring them in, please.   <doc-sep>   UNBORN     TOMORROW     BY MACK REYNOLDS   Unfortunately , there was onlyone thing he could bring backfrom the wonderful future ...and though he didn't want to... nevertheless he did....

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]       Every lonely man tries to make friends.     Manet just didn't know when to stop!      William Manet was alone.     In the beginning, he had seen many advantages to being alone. It wouldgive him an unprecedented opportunity to once and for all correlateloneliness to the point of madness, to see how long it would take himto start slavering and clawing the pin-ups from the magazines, to beginteaching himself classes in philosophy consisting of interminablelectures to a bored and captive audience of one.     He would be able to measure the qualities of peace and decide whetherit was really better than war, he would be able to get as fat and asdirty as he liked, he would be able to live more like an animal andthink more like a god than any man for generations.     But after a shorter time than he expected, it all got to be a tearingbore. Even the waiting to go crazy part of it.     Not that he was going to have any great long wait of it. He was alreadytalking to himself, making verbal notes for his lectures, and he hadcut out a picture of Annie Oakley from an old book. He tacked it up andwinked at it whenever he passed that way.     Lately she was winking back at him.     Loneliness was a physical weight on his skull. It peeled the flesh fromhis arms and legs and sandpapered his self-pity to a fine sensitivity.     No one on Earth was as lonely as William Manet, and even William Manetcould only be this lonely on Mars.     Manet was Atmosphere Seeder Station 131-47's own human.     All Manet had to do was sit in the beating aluminum heart in the middleof the chalk desert and stare out, chin cupped in hands, at the flat,flat pavement of dirty talcum, at the stars gleaming as hard in theblack sky as a starlet's capped teeth ... stars two of which were moonsand one of which was Earth. He had to do nothing else. The wholegimcrack was cybernetically controlled, entirely automatic. No one wasneeded here\u2014no human being, at least.     The Workers' Union was a pretty small pressure group, but it didn'ttake much to pressure the Assembly. Featherbedding had been carefullyspecified, including an Overseer for each of the Seeders to honeycombMars, to prepare its atmosphere for colonization.     They didn't give tests to find well-balanced, well-integrated peoplefor the job. Well-balanced, well-integrated men weren't going toisolate themselves in a useless job. They got, instead, William Manetand his fellows.     The Overseers were to stay as long as the job required. Passenger fareto Mars was about one billion dollars. They weren't providing commuterservice for night shifts. They weren't providing accommodationsfor couples when the law specified only one occupant. They weren'tproviding fuel (at fifty million dollars a gallon) for visits betweenthe various Overseers. They weren't very providential.     But it was two hundred thousand a year in salary, and it offeredwonderful opportunities.     It gave William Manet an opportunity to think he saw a spaceship makinga tailfirst landing on the table of the desert, its tail burning asbright as envy.  "

        "Query": "What is the fate of the Bogans' plan in the story of Cultural Exchange?",
        "Summary_1": "The Bogans are people who have a history of aggression within the Nicodemean Cluster. In the last twenty years, they have launched four military campaigns against other Galaxy members; because of this, they are known as the Hoodlums of the Nicodemean Cluster. They have agreed to send 2,000 of their students to participate in the Exchange Program in d\u2019Land that the Manpower Utilization Directorate, Division of Libraries and Education is facilitating. This agreement is a curiosity to Retief because d\u2019Land is a poor, industrial society, so he wonders what the Bogans will study there. His superior, Second Secretary Magnan, tells him that is none of his business and to be sure not to antagonize the Bogan representative. According to the Special Committee for Rehabilitation and Overhaul of Underdeveloped Nations\u2019 General Economies (SCROUNGE) committeeman, every agency in the Corps is trying to appease Boge since Boge is a well-known troublemaker. He also informs Retief that d\u2019Land has no universities, just an under-endowed technical college that could not handle 200, much less 2,000, exchange students. He also tells Retief that most of d\u2019Land\u2019s problems result from an unwise trade agreement that it made with Boge.\n\n Retief meets Karsh, a Scoutmaster who trained the Bogan students; he made it like a game but says they know how to handle a CSU. As the Bogan students come through Customs and see Mr. Karsh, they snap to attention. Mr. Karsh refuses to let the students leave the airport. Retief notices that all the exchange students are males, and Karsh tells him they wanted to see how the first group of students was received before sending any females. Retief realizes that Bogan students are headed to a place that has no classrooms for the students. In the meantime, the tractors are being sent to Croanie, a world under obligation to Boge, and Croanie holds the mortgage to the best vineyards in Lovenbroy. Retief looks up the tractors that are being sent to Croanie and discovers they are armored vehicles with a half-megaton per second firepower. Retief learns that these continental siege units are ultimately being sent to Lovenbroy, which is rich in minerals, on behalf of Boge. Retief also learns that Boge has an application to send another 2,000 students to Croanie and is considering sending 2,000 more to Featherweight. Retief learns that Boge tried to take over Lovenbroy several years earlier and would have succeeded if not for bad luck. Retief calls a friend who works in transport and learns that the Bogan students\u2019 luggage is all being sent to Lovenbroy, and when he looked in the luggage, it was all weapons. Retief diverts the luggage and sends the students on to Lovenbroy to help with the grape harvest for the vineyards. He impounds the luggage full of weapons.\n\n",
        "Summary_2": "The Bogans are the people from the planet Boge. According to Retief\u2019s superior, they are known as the \u201choodlums\u201d of the nearby universe and have launched multiple military campaigns in the recent past. Despite this, no one seems to suspect the Bogans when they claim to be participating in a \u201ccultural exchange\u201d.  They plan to send \u201cstudents\u201d who are really intended to be soldiers and guns to D\u2019Land, a planet that loves peace but isn\u2019t on good terms with Boge. Another planet, Croanie, has fallen into debt to Boge and is facilitating a transshipment of \u201ctractors\u201d that are actually devices only useful for war or mining, making it seem like they might also be looking to take over Lovenbroy (which they tried, unsuccessfully, to do in the past, as well as another small nearby planet referenced in the story, Featherweight. Their plans are thwarted by Retief when he figures out what they are up to and reroutes the weaponry to D\u2019Land and the students to Lovenbroy. \n",
        "Summary_3": "\tThe Bogans are the people of Boge, a planet that lies in the same cluster as Lovenbroy and Croanie. The Bogans attempted to invade Lovenbroy ten years back, and, though they managed to fight for one year, they were eventually defeated. Their goal was to mine the land for the rich minerals that lay below the surface. \n\tAfter scheming with Croanie (who loaned money and resources to Lovenbroy post-war), the Bogans were able to develop a plan to finally invade Lovenbroy successfully. By using grants and a ploy of educating 2,000 of their students, the Bogans were almost able to ship 2,000 male soldiers to Lovenbroy with an array of weaponry in their duffel bags. The Bogans lied and said that they were sending these \u201cstudents\u201d to d\u2019Land to study there at the university. As well, Croanie aided them in acquiring 500 death tractors. These Bolo WV M-1s are incredibly dangerous tanks that can travel extremely fast and are outfitted with a bulldozer blade. Thanks to this added blade, they were able to market them as simply tractors, not the weapons of war they truly are. The tractors were on their way to Lovenbroy when Retief caught wind of their plan and stopped their shipment. He sent them to d\u2019Land instead, an enemy of the Bogans. \n\tRetief further destroyed their plan by sending the trained boys to Lovenbroy without their weaponry. He sent them to this beautiful planet so they could help Arapoulous in harvesting the Bacchus grapes. Fully thwarted and upset, Mr. Gulver, the Bogan representative, admits defeat and somehow escapes any true diplomatic punishment. \n",

Because of their warlike tendencies, the Corps bends over backward to work with them to restore diplomacy to the galaxy. Boge has a trade agreement with the small, underpopulated planet of d\u2019Land, which they use to their advantage in hatching their plan to overtake them. They also have a hold over the planet of Croanie, which controls the vineyard mortgages on the planet of Lovenbroy. The Bogan representative, Mr. Gulver, manipulates the incompetent functions of the Corps to procure grants for 500 armored tractors to be sent to Croanie, which cannot process that amount. The plan is to send the excess to Boge. In addition, he has worked out an agreement with Second Secretary Magnan to send 2,000 students to d\u2019Land\u2019s technical college, which cannot accommodate that many students. Retief discovers that the students\u2019 luggage contains guns, and so he puts all the pieces together and discovers the Bogans\u2019 plan to overtake d\u2019Land rather than sublimate themselves.

When I first came here, the Manpower UtilizationDirectorate, Division of Libraries and Education was a shambles. Ifancy I've made MUDDLE what it is today. Frankly, I question thewisdom of placing you in charge of such a sensitive desk, even for twoweeks. But remember. Yours is purely a rubber-stamp function.     In that case, let's leave it to Miss Furkle. I'll take a couple ofweeks off myself. With her poundage, she could bring plenty of pressureto bear.     I assume you jest, Retief, Magnan said sadly. I should expect evenyou to appreciate that Bogan participation in the Exchange Program maybe the first step toward sublimation of their aggressions into morecultivated channels.     I see they're sending two thousand students to d'Land, Retief said,glancing at the Memo for Record. That's a sizable sublimation.     Magnan nodded. The Bogans have launched no less than four militarycampaigns in the last two decades. They're known as the Hoodlums ofthe Nicodemean Cluster. Now, perhaps, we shall see them breaking thatprecedent and entering into the cultural life of the Galaxy.     Breaking and entering, Retief said. You may have something there.But I'm wondering what they'll study on d'Land. That's an industrialworld of the poor but honest variety.

That would make them only twelve years old by the time\u2014     Oh, that's Lovenbroy years; they'd be eighteen, Terry reckoning.     I was thinking you looked a little mature for twenty-eight, Retiefsaid.     Forty-two, Terry years, Arapoulous said. But this year it looks bad.We've got a bumper crop\u2014and we're short-handed.

Pretty dumb, huh? But we figured twelve years was a long time.     On the whole, Retief said, I think I prefer the black. But the redis hard to beat....     What we figured was, maybe you Culture boys could help us out. A loanto see us through the vintage, enough to hire extra hands. Then we'drepay it in sculpture, painting, furniture\u2014     Sorry, Hank. All we do here is work out itineraries for travelingside-shows, that kind of thing. Now, if you needed a troop of Groacinose-flute players\u2014     Can they pick grapes?     Nope. Anyway, they can't stand the daylight. Have you talked this overwith the Labor Office?     Sure did.

Thanks. Retief finished his glass, stood. I have to run, Hank, hesaid. Let me think this over. Maybe I can come up with something.Check with me day after tomorrow. And you'd better leave the bottleshere. Cultural exhibits, you know.      II     As the council meeting broke up, Retief caught the eye of a colleagueacross the table.     Mr. Whaffle, you mentioned a shipment going to a place called Croanie.What are they getting?     Whaffle blinked. You're the fellow who's filling in for Magnan, overat MUDDLE, he said.

What kind of university do they have on d'Land? asked Retief. We'resending them two thousand exchange students. It must be quite aninstitution.     University? D'Land has one under-endowed technical college.     Will all the exchange students be studying at the Technical College?     Two thousand students? Hah! Two      hundred     students would overtax thefacilities of the college.     I wonder if the Bogans know that?     The Bogans? Why, most of d'Land's difficulties are due to the unwisetrade agreement she entered into with Boge. Two thousand studentsindeed! He snorted and walked away.   <doc-sep> There's something to what you say, I admitted in the face of hisunexpected information. But I can hardly turn my invention over toyour entirely persuasive salesmen, I'm sure. This is part of theresults of an investigation for the government. Washington will haveto decide what to do with the machine.     Listen, Professor, Carmen began, the Mafia\u2014     What makes you think I'm any more afraid of the Mafia than I am of theF.B.I.? I may have already sealed my fate by letting you in on thismuch. Machinegunning is hardly a less attractive fate to me than a poorsecurity rating. To me, being dead professionally would be as bad asbeing dead biologically.     Tony Carmen laid a heavy hand on my shoulder. I finally deduced heintended to be cordial.     Of course, he said smoothly you have to give this to Washington butthere are      ways     , Professor. I know. I'm a business man\u2014     You      are     ? I said.     He named some of the businesses in which he held large shares of stock.     You      are     .     I've had experience in this sort of thing. We simply      leak     theinformation to a few hundred well selected persons about all that yourmachine can do. We'll call 'em Expendables, because they can expendanything.     I, I interjected, planned to call it the Venetti Machine.     Professor, who calls the radio the Marconi these days?     There are Geiger-Muller Counters, though, I said.     You don't have to give a Geiger counter the sex appeal of a TV set ora hardtop convertible. We'll call them Expendables. No home will becomplete without one.     Perfect for disposing of unwanted bodies, I mused. The murder ratewill go alarmingly with those devices within easy reach.     Did that stop Sam Colt or Henry Ford? Tony Carmen asked reasonably....     Naturally, I was aware that the government would      not     be interested inmy machine. I am not a Fortean, a psychic, a psionicist or a screwball.But the government frequently gets things it doesn't know what to dowith\u2014like airplanes in the 'twenties. When it doesn't know what to do,it doesn't do it.     There have been hundreds of workable perpetual motion machinespatented, for example. Of course, they weren't vices in the strictestsense of the word. Many of them used the external power of gravity,they would wear out or slow down in time from friction, but for themeanwhile, for some ten to two hundred years they would just sit there,moving. No one had ever been able to figure out what to do with them.     I knew the AEC wasn't going to dump tons of radioactive waste (withsome possible future reclaimation value) into a machine which theydidn't believe actually could work.     Tony Carmen knew exactly what to do with an Expendable once he got hishands on it.     Naturally, that was what I had been afraid of.  "

        "Query": "What is the role of Hank Arapoulous in the story Cultural Exchange?",
        "Summary_1": "Hank Arapoulousis is first described as a \u201cbucolic person from Lovenbroy.\u201d He is a farmer, tall with bronze skin and gray hair, who comes to MUDDLE\u2019s office to discuss the harvest problems in Lovenbroy. They grow Bacchus vines, which only mature once every twelve years. This year is a harvest year, but they don\u2019t have enough people to harvest the grapes. Arapoulousis explains to Retief that a few years ago, Boge landed a force on Lovenbroy to try to mine their minerals by strip-mining. Lovenbroy fought back for a year but lost a lot of its men. This created financial problems, so Lovenbroy borrowed money from Croanie, mortgaging its crops. The loan is due, and the wine crop will cover the loan amount, but they don\u2019t have enough people to harvest the grapes. He is worried that if they don\u2019t have a great harvest, Croanie will come in and start mining. Also, if they default on the loan, Croanie will hold half of the grape acreage that they used to secure the loan. Arapoulousis has also asked for help from the Labor Office, but they only offered to send them machinery, and machines cannot harvest the grapes. He returns to see Retief the following day to find out if Retief has discovered a way to help. When Mr. Karsh makes a scene about the missing luggage for the exchange students, Retief has Arapoulousis take Karsh away and \u201ctake care of him.\u201d When they return, Karsh is stumbling and needs support to stand up. Arapoulousis explains that Karsh fell. \nRetief sends the exchange students to Lovenbroy with Arapoulousis to help with the harvest. As the harvest is winding down, Arapoulousis tells Retief that Retief has won the award for the picking competition. Arapoulousis is also the person who judges the wine contest.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Hank Arapolous is a farmer from the planet Lovenbroy, who beseeches Retief to send laborers to help with their grape harvest. He is described as tall and broad with gray hair and tanned skin, and he says he is 28 in Lovenbroy years, or 42 in terrestrial years. He is friendly, honest, and informal, though he is worried throughout most of the story about his people and his planet. He asks Retief for help getting labor to assist with Lovenbroy\u2019s grape harvest so they don\u2019t default on their debt to another planet, Croanie. He also informs Retief about Lovenbroy\u2019s relationships and history with other planets, which helps Retief put the pieces together regarding what the Bogans are trying to do. He assists Retief with his plans and introduces him to Lovenbroy wine. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Hank Arapoulous is a farmer from Lovenbroy. He tends to the land and is very invested in the arts and architecture part of his culture as well. Although he hybridizes fruit as well for his job (apples the size of melons!), his love for his home planet comes first. He is a very stocky and sturdy man, around Retief\u2019s height. He is middle-aged, in his early 40s in Terrestrial years but only 28 in Lovenbroy years. He\u2019s a silver fox with gray hair and tan skin. \n\tArapoulous arrives at MUDDLE in need of help and assistance. The Bacchus wine, which he cultivates, has two varieties, red and black. The crop is only harvested every 12 years, but this year they have a shortage of harvesters. He asks Retief to send over some pickers since the other departments had already turned him down. \n\tArapoulous plays a very important role in this story as he introduces Retief to the diplomatic relations between Lovenbroy, Croanie, and the Borge. After explaining that the Lovenbroy are in debt to the Croanie (who came to their aid after a one-year war with the Boge), Retief soon realizes that a great plot is at hand. When all is discovered and Retief manages to thwart the Borge takeover of Lovenbroy, Arapoulous helps him interrogate and punish Karsh, the militaristic leader of the Borge boys. \n\tVictorious and proud, Arapoulous returns to Lovenbroy with 2,000 mighty helping hands. The Borge boys who were trained to take over Lovenbroy are now being used to harvest its mighty crop. Arapoulous is thrilled at the turn of events, especially since only hoped for 100 men, and is even more excited when he learns that Retief might be staying on Lovenbroy for a while. With his home safe from prying eyes and greedy hands, Arapoulous ends the story on a high note. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Hank Arapoulous is a representative from the planet Lovenbroy. He is a farmer who is very passionate about the Bacchus vines they grow. These vines produce a crop on a twelve-year rotation, and he comes to Retief seeking labor to help harvest the crop. Without the labor, they will not be able to pay back their debt to Croanie, the planet that owns the mortgage on Lovenbroy\u2019s vineyards. Hank tells Retief he is 28 years old, but later he learns Hank is closer to 42 because of the variation in the Terry years they use to track time on his planet. Hank is gregarious and passionate about the wine they produce, and he shares the red and black variations with Retief, who enjoys both. Retief agrees to help Hank, and during his inquiries, he discovers the Bogan plot to incite military action against d\u2019Land. Later, Hank helps Retief in bamboozling the Bogan representative, Mr. Gulver, by joining Karsh and the students on the ship bound for Lovenbroy. After Retief returns to Lovenbroy and wins the grape-picking competition, Hank rewards him with a visit from a local woman named Delinda.",

Then we'drepay it in sculpture, painting, furniture\u2014     Sorry, Hank. All we do here is work out itineraries for travelingside-shows, that kind of thing. Now, if you needed a troop of Groacinose-flute players\u2014     Can they pick grapes?     Nope. Anyway, they can't stand the daylight. Have you talked this overwith the Labor Office?     Sure did. They said they'd fix us up with all the electronicsspecialists and computer programmers we wanted\u2014but no field hands.Said it was what they classified as menial drudgery; you'd have thoughtI was trying to buy slaves.     The buzzer sounded. Miss Furkle's features appeared on the desk screen.     You're due at the Intergroup Council in five minutes, she said. Thenafterwards, there are the Bogan students to meet.     Thanks. Retief finished his glass, stood. I have to run, Hank, hesaid. Let me think this over. Maybe I can come up with something.Check with me day after tomorrow. And you'd better leave the bottleshere. Cultural exhibits, you know.      II     As the council meeting broke up, Retief caught the eye of a colleagueacross the table.

He snorted and walked away.   <doc-sep> A tall broad man with bronze skin and gray hair, wearing tight trousersof heavy cloth, a loose shirt open at the neck and a short jacket,stepped into the room. He had a bundle under his arm. He paused atsight of Retief, looked him over momentarily, then advanced and heldout his hand. Retief took it. For a moment the two big men stood, faceto face. The newcomer's jaw muscles knotted. Then he winced.     Retief dropped his hand and motioned to a chair.     That's nice knuckle work, mister, the stranger said, massaging hishand. First time anybody ever did that to me. My fault though. Istarted it, I guess. He grinned and sat down.     What can I do for you? Retief said.     You work for this Culture bunch, do you? Funny. I thought they wereall ribbon-counter boys. Never mind. I'm Hank Arapoulous. I'm a farmer.What I wanted to see you about was\u2014 He shifted in his chair. Well,out on Lovenbroy we've got a serious problem. The wine crop is justabout ready. We start picking in another two, three months. Now I don'tknow if you're familiar with the Bacchus vines we grow...?     No, Retief said. Have a cigar? He pushed a box across the desk.Arapoulous took one. Bacchus vines are an unusual crop, he said,puffing the cigar alight. Only mature every twelve years. In between,the vines don't need a lot of attention, so our time's mostly our own.We like to farm, though. Spend a lot of time developing new forms.Apples the size of a melon\u2014and sweet\u2014     Sounds very pleasant, Retief said. Where does the Libraries andEducation Division come in?     Arapoulous leaned forward. We go in pretty heavy for the arts. Folkscan't spend all their time hybridizing plants. We've turned all theland area we've got into parks and farms. Course, we left some sizableforest areas for hunting and such. Lovenbroy's a nice place, Mr.Retief.     It sounds like it, Mr. Arapoulous. Just what\u2014     Call me Hank. We've got long seasons back home. Five of 'em. Ouryear's about eighteen Terry months. Cold as hell in winter; eccentricorbit, you know. Blue-black sky, stars visible all day. We do mostlypainting and sculpture in the winter. Then Spring; still plenty cold.Lots of skiing, bob-sledding, ice skating; and it's the season forwoodworkers. Our furniture\u2014     I've seen some of your furniture, Retief said. Beautiful work.     Arapoulous nodded. All local timbers too. Lots of metals in our soiland those sulphates give the woods some color, I'll tell you. Thencomes the Monsoon. Rain\u2014it comes down in sheets. But the sun's gettingcloser. Shines all the time. Ever seen it pouring rain in the sunshine?That's the music-writing season. Then summer. Summer's hot. We stayinside in the daytime and have beach parties all night. Lots of beachon Lovenbroy; we're mostly islands. That's the drama and symphony time.The theatres are set up on the sand, or anchored off-shore. You havethe music and the surf and the bonfires and stars\u2014we're close to thecenter of a globular cluster, you know....     You say it's time now for the wine crop?     That's right. Autumn's our harvest season. Most years we have just theordinary crops. Fruit, grain, that kind of thing; getting it in doesn'ttake long. We spend most of the time on architecture, getting newplaces ready for the winter or remodeling the older ones. We spend alot of time in our houses. We like to have them comfortable. But thisyear's different. This is Wine Year.   <doc-sep> At the baggage warehouse Gulver looked glumly at the opened cases ofguns. No, of course not, he said dully. Not my baggage. Not mybaggage at all.     Arapoulous appeared, supporting the stumbling figure of Mr. Karsh.     What\u2014what's this? Gulver spluttered. Karsh? What's happened?     He had a little fall. He'll be okay, Arapoulous said.     You'd better help him to the ship, Retief said. It's ready to lift.We wouldn't want him to miss it.     Leave him to me! Gulver snapped, his eyes slashing at Karsh. I'llsee he's dealt with.     I couldn't think of it, Retief said. He's a guest of the Corps, youknow. We'll see him safely aboard.     Gulver turned, signaled frantically. Three heavy-set men in identicaldrab suits detached themselves from the wall, crossed to the group.     Take this man, Gulver snapped, indicating Karsh, who looked at himdazedly, reached up to rub his head.     We take our hospitality seriously, Retief said. We'll see him aboardthe vessel.     Gulver opened his mouth.     I know you feel bad about finding guns instead of school books inyour luggage, Retief said, looking Gulver in the eye. You'll be busystraightening out the details of the mix-up. You'll want to avoidfurther complications.     Ah. Ulp. Yes, Gulver said. He appeared unhappy.     Arapoulous went on to the passenger conveyor, turned to wave.     Your man\u2014he's going too? Gulver blurted.     He's not our man, properly speaking, Retief said. He lives onLovenbroy.     Lovenbroy? Gulver choked. But ... the ... I....     I know you said the students were bound for d'Land, Retief said. ButI guess that was just another aspect of the general confusion. Thecourse plugged into the navigators was to Lovenbroy. You'll be glad toknow they're still headed there\u2014even without the baggage.     Perhaps, Gulver said grimly, perhaps they'll manage without it.     By the way, Retief said. There was another funny mix-up. Therewere some tractors\u2014for industrial use, you'll recall. I believe youco-operated with Croanie in arranging the grant through MEDDLE. Theywere erroneously consigned to Lovenbroy, a purely agricultural world. Isaved you some embarrassment, I trust, Mr. Gulver, by arranging to havethem off-loaded at d'Land.     D'Land! You've put the CSU's in the hands of Boge's bitterest enemies!     But they're only tractors, Mr. Gulver. Peaceful devices. Isn't thatcorrect?     That's ... correct. Gulver sagged. Then he snapped erect. Hold theships! he yelled. I'm canceling the student exchange\u2014     His voice was drowned by the rumble as the first of the monstertransports rose from the launch pit, followed a moment later by thesecond, Retief watched them out of sight, then turned to Gulver.     They're off, he said. Let's hope they get a liberal education.      V     Retief lay on his back in deep grass by a stream, eating grapes. A tallfigure appeared on the knoll above him and waved.     Retief! Hank Arapoulous bounded down the slope and embraced Retief,slapping him on the back. I heard you were here\u2014and I've got newsfor you. You won the final day's picking competition. Over two hundredbushels! That's a record!     Let's get on over to the garden. Sounds like the celebration's aboutto start.     In the flower-crowded park among the stripped vines, Retief andArapoulous made their way to a laden table under the lanterns. A tallgirl dressed in loose white, and with long golden hair, came up toArapoulous.     Delinda, this is Retief\u2014today's winner. And he's also the fellow thatgot those workers for us.     Delinda smiled at Retief. I've heard about you, Mr. Retief. Weweren't sure about the boys at first. Two thousand Bogans, and allconfused about their baggage that went astray. But they seemed to likethe picking. She smiled again.     That's not all. Our gals liked the boys, Hank said. Even Bogansaren't so bad, minus their irons. A lot of 'em will be staying on. Buthow come you didn't tell me you were coming, Retief? I'd have laid onsome kind of big welcome.     I liked the welcome I got. And I didn't have much notice. Mr. Magnanwas a little upset when he got back. It seems I exceeded my authority.     Arapoulous laughed. I had a feeling you were wheeling pretty free,Retief. I hope you didn't get into any trouble over it.     No trouble, Retief said. A few people were a little unhappy withme. It seems I'm not ready for important assignments at Departmentallevel. I was shipped off here to the boondocks to get a little moreexperience.     Delinda, look after Retief, said Arapoulous. I'll see you later.I've got to see to the wine judging. He disappeared in the crowd.     Congratulations on winning the day, said Delinda. I noticed you atwork. You were wonderful. I'm glad you're going to have the prize.     Thanks. I noticed you too, flitting around in that white nightie ofyours. But why weren't you picking grapes with the rest of us?     I had a special assignment.     Too bad. You should have had a chance at the prize.     Delinda took Retief's hand. I wouldn't have anyway, she said. I'mthe prize.   "

        "Query": "What significance does Lovenbroy hold in the context of Cultural Exchange?",
        "Summary_1": "Lovenbroy is one of the members of the Nicodemean Cluster and part of the cultural life of the Galaxy. Lovenbroy is known for its exquisite wines produced from the Bacchus vines, which only mature once every twelve years. Lovenbroy is important for the Galaxy culture because, during the time when it is not raising and harvesting grapes and other crops, it makes important cultural contributions. They have created parks and farms and left sizable forests for hunting. They offer skiing, bob-sledding, and ice skating in the spring while it is still cold. They also create fine furniture, sculpture, and art. During the summer, they offer beach parties, drama, and symphonies. The land is full of minerals, which led Boge to land a force to strip-mine some of the resources. Lovenbroy fought back, but it took a year, and it lost many men. This has left Lovenbroy short-handed for this year\u2019s grape harvest. It also took a financial toll on Lovenbroy, and it had to borrow money from Croanie, mortgage its crops, and export its artwork. The loan is due during the harvest year, and without enough men to pick the grapes, Croanie will come in and take over half the vineyard land and mine it. Croanie is under obligation to Boge, and Boge is behind the scheme of sending \u201cexchange students\u201d supposedly to d\u2019Land but really to Lovenbroy to take its minerals. ",
        "Summary_2": "Lovenbroy is a small planet that depends on its grape crop and winemaking to sustain its economy. It is important to the story because a man from Lovenbroy asks Retief for help getting labor to harvest their grapes so they can pay their debts to Croanie. This interaction leads Retief to further investigate a series of events that has been set into motion wherein soldiers, weapons, and drilling equipment are being transported in disguise. In trying to right the wrongs that he discovers, Retief is also able to send two-thousand men to help with the harvest. Lovenbroy is also significant because it is where Retief is sent as punishment for his actions, though he doesn\u2019t seem to mind being stationed on the agreeable planet. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Lovenbroy is a beautiful, lush, and rich planet mostly made up of islands. It is the only place where Bacchus grapes can be grown, and its resources are highly coveted. Lovenbroy has five seasons throughout one Lovenbroy year (which is six months longer than a Terrestrial year). Their winters are long and harsh, with little to no sunlight all day long. This forced indoor time led to a very artistic culture springing up. Many spend the winters painting and sculpting. This necessary indoor time has made the Lovenbroy very keen on architecture. Spring is also pretty cold, but warm and light enough to woodwork and play a few sports. Then comes the season of music, where it rains all day but the sun constantly shines. The summer is incredibly hot, which forces people indoors again during the day, but able to play come the evening! Then it\u2019s autumn, which is harvest time for all crops, including the Bacchus grapes every 12 years. \n\tLovenbroy has many rich resources, most likely thanks to its mostly untouched landscape and erratic seasons. The land is ingrained with many minerals that have, so far, remained un-mined. Thanks to these minerals and metals in the soil, the trees (and then harvested timber) that are produced are colored differently. \n\tLovenbroy, being the home of so many invaluable resources, is fought for. A decade before the story began, Lovenbroy was invaded by the Boge who wanted to mine for minerals. After one year of war, the Lovenbroy managed to defeat the Boge, but it left them with a crippled economy and a depleted workforce. Croanie stepped in to help and gave them several loans. However, 10 years later, Lovenbroy is still in debt to Croanie. Harvesting the Bacchus grapes will give them enough revenue to pay off their loans, but they need more harvesters. \n\tLovenbroy is the main source of conflict in this story. Croanie and Boge work together to try and take over Lovenbroy and deplete the land of its resources. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Lovenbroy is a planet known for its vast vineyards of Bacchus vines used to produce delicious red and black wines. The vineyards cover mountains, stretch along riversides, and snake through beautiful gardens. Fertile grass springs up throughout the vineyards, and every twelve years, the entire population comes together to celebrate the crop and harvest the fruit together. Lovenbroy also has a rich source of minerals use to enrich their wine, and a few years ago one of their neighbors came to fight for control of these minerals. Lovenbroy ultimately won the battle, but they lost a lot of money and men in the fight, and they had to turn to the planet Croanie for financial assistance. Ultimately, they sold control of the mortgage on their vineyards to Croanie as well, thinking the twelve-year gap between harvests would be enough time to repay the debt. They were wrong, and they send a representative\u2014Hank Arapoulous\u2014to Corps HQ to seek additional labor to help pick the new harvest in time. This visit to Retief\u2019s office kickstarts the chain of events that lead to Retief\u2019s discovery of the Bogan plan to take military action against d\u2019Land.",

If we don't get a bigvintage, Croanie steps in. Lord knows what they'll do to the land. Thennext vintage time, with them holding half our grape acreage\u2014     You hocked the vineyards?     Yep. Pretty dumb, huh? But we figured twelve years was a long time.     On the whole, Retief said, I think I prefer the black. But the redis hard to beat....     What we figured was, maybe you Culture boys could help us out. A loanto see us through the vintage, enough to hire extra hands. Then we'drepay it in sculpture, painting, furniture\u2014     Sorry, Hank. All we do here is work out itineraries for travelingside-shows, that kind of thing. Now, if you needed a troop of Groacinose-flute players\u2014     Can they pick grapes?     Nope. Anyway, they can't stand the daylight. Have you talked this overwith the Labor Office?     Sure did. They said they'd fix us up with all the electronicsspecialists and computer programmers we wanted\u2014but no field hands.Said it was what they classified as menial drudgery; you'd have thoughtI was trying to buy slaves.     The buzzer sounded. Miss Furkle's features appeared on the desk screen.     You're due at the Intergroup Council in five minutes, she said. Thenafterwards, there are the Bogan students to meet.     Thanks. Retief finished his glass, stood. I have to run, Hank, hesaid. Let me think this over. Maybe I can come up with something.Check with me day after tomorrow. And you'd better leave the bottleshere. Cultural exhibits, you know.      II     As the council meeting broke up, Retief caught the eye of a colleagueacross the table.     Mr. Whaffle, you mentioned a shipment going to a place called Croanie.What are they getting?     Whaffle blinked. You're the fellow who's filling in for Magnan, overat MUDDLE, he said. Properly speaking, equipment grants are thesole concern of the Motorized Equipment Depot, Division of Loans andExchanges. He pursed his lips. However, I suppose there's no harm intelling you. They'll be receiving heavy mining equipment.     Drill rigs, that sort of thing?     Strip mining gear. Whaffle took a slip of paper from a breast pocket,blinked at it. Bolo Model WV/1 tractors, to be specific. Why is MUDDLEinterested in MEDDLE's activities?     Forgive my curiosity, Mr. Whaffle. It's just that Croanie cropped upearlier today. It seems she holds a mortgage on some vineyards overon\u2014     That's not MEDDLE's affair, sir, Whaffle cut in. I have sufficientproblems as Chief of MEDDLE without probing into MUDDLE'S business.     Speaking of tractors, another man put in, we over at the SpecialCommittee for Rehabilitation and Overhaul of Under-developed Nations'General Economies have been trying for months to get a request formining equipment for d'Land through MEDDLE\u2014     SCROUNGE was late on the scene, Whaffle said. First come, firstserved. That's our policy at MEDDLE. Good day, gentlemen. He strodeoff, briefcase under his arm.     That's the trouble with peaceful worlds, the SCROUNGE committeemansaid. Boge is a troublemaker, so every agency in the Corps is outto pacify her. While my chance to make a record\u2014that is, assistpeace-loving d'Land\u2014comes to naught. He shook his head.     What kind of university do they have on d'Land? asked Retief. We'resending them two thousand exchange students. It must be quite aninstitution.     University? D'Land has one under-endowed technical college.     Will all the exchange students be studying at the Technical College?     Two thousand students? Hah! Two      hundred     students would overtax thefacilities of the college.     I wonder if the Bogans know that?     The Bogans? Why, most of d'Land's difficulties are due to the unwisetrade agreement she entered into with Boge. Two thousand studentsindeed! He snorted and walked away.   <doc-sep>    CULTURAL EXCHANGE     BY KEITH LAUMER     It was a simple student exchange\u2014but     Retief gave them more of     an education than they expected!     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Worlds of If Science Fiction, September 1962.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      I     Second Secretary Magnan took his green-lined cape and orange-featheredberet from the clothes tree. I'm off now, Retief, he said. I hopeyou'll manage the administrative routine during my absence without anyunfortunate incidents.     That seems a modest enough hope, Retief said. I'll try to live up toit.     I don't appreciate frivolity with reference to this Division, Magnansaid testily. When I first came here, the Manpower UtilizationDirectorate, Division of Libraries and Education was a shambles. Ifancy I've made MUDDLE what it is today. Frankly, I question thewisdom of placing you in charge of such a sensitive desk, even for twoweeks. But remember. Yours is purely a rubber-stamp function.     In that case, let's leave it to Miss Furkle. I'll take a couple ofweeks off myself. With her poundage, she could bring plenty of pressureto bear.     I assume you jest, Retief, Magnan said sadly. I should expect evenyou to appreciate that Bogan participation in the Exchange Program maybe the first step toward sublimation of their aggressions into morecultivated channels.     I see they're sending two thousand students to d'Land, Retief said,glancing at the Memo for Record. That's a sizable sublimation.     Magnan nodded. The Bogans have launched no less than four militarycampaigns in the last two decades. They're known as the Hoodlums ofthe Nicodemean Cluster. Now, perhaps, we shall see them breaking thatprecedent and entering into the cultural life of the Galaxy.     Breaking and entering, Retief said. You may have something there.But I'm wondering what they'll study on d'Land. That's an industrialworld of the poor but honest variety.     Academic details are the affair of the students and their professors,Magnan said. Our function is merely to bring them together. Seethat you don't antagonize the Bogan representative. This willbe an excellent opportunity for you to practice your diplomaticrestraint\u2014not your strong point, I'm sure you'll agree.     A buzzer sounded. Retief punched a button. What is it, Miss Furkle?     That\u2014bucolic person from Lovenbroy is here again. On the small deskscreen, Miss Furkle's meaty features were compressed in disapproval.     This fellow's a confounded pest. I'll leave him to you, Retief,Magnan said. Tell him something. Get rid of him. And remember: hereat Corps HQ, all eyes are upon you.     If I'd thought of that, I'd have worn my other suit, Retief said.     Magnan snorted and passed from view. Retief punched Miss Furkle'sbutton.     Send the bucolic person in.   <doc-sep> At the baggage warehouse Gulver looked glumly at the opened cases ofguns. No, of course not, he said dully. Not my baggage. Not mybaggage at all.     Arapoulous appeared, supporting the stumbling figure of Mr. Karsh.     What\u2014what's this? Gulver spluttered. Karsh? What's happened?     He had a little fall. He'll be okay, Arapoulous said.     You'd better help him to the ship, Retief said. It's ready to lift.We wouldn't want him to miss it.     Leave him to me! Gulver snapped, his eyes slashing at Karsh. I'llsee he's dealt with.     I couldn't think of it, Retief said. He's a guest of the Corps, youknow. We'll see him safely aboard.     Gulver turned, signaled frantically. Three heavy-set men in identicaldrab suits detached themselves from the wall, crossed to the group.     Take this man, Gulver snapped, indicating Karsh, who looked at himdazedly, reached up to rub his head.     We take our hospitality seriously, Retief said. We'll see him aboardthe vessel.     Gulver opened his mouth.     I know you feel bad about finding guns instead of school books inyour luggage, Retief said, looking Gulver in the eye. You'll be busystraightening out the details of the mix-up. You'll want to avoidfurther complications.     Ah. Ulp. Yes, Gulver said. He appeared unhappy.     Arapoulous went on to the passenger conveyor, turned to wave.     Your man\u2014he's going too? Gulver blurted.     He's not our man, properly speaking, Retief said. He lives onLovenbroy.     Lovenbroy? Gulver choked. But ... the ... I....     I know you said the students were bound for d'Land, Retief said. ButI guess that was just another aspect of the general confusion. Thecourse plugged into the navigators was to Lovenbroy. You'll be glad toknow they're still headed there\u2014even without the baggage.     Perhaps, Gulver said grimly, perhaps they'll manage without it.     By the way, Retief said. There was another funny mix-up. Therewere some tractors\u2014for industrial use, you'll recall. I believe youco-operated with Croanie in arranging the grant through MEDDLE. Theywere erroneously consigned to Lovenbroy, a purely agricultural world. Isaved you some embarrassment, I trust, Mr. Gulver, by arranging to havethem off-loaded at d'Land.     D'Land! You've put the CSU's in the hands of Boge's bitterest enemies!     But they're only tractors, Mr. Gulver. Peaceful devices. Isn't thatcorrect?     That's ... correct. Gulver sagged. Then he snapped erect. Hold theships! he yelled. I'm canceling the student exchange\u2014     His voice was drowned by the rumble as the first of the monstertransports rose from the launch pit, followed a moment later by thesecond, Retief watched them out of sight, then turned to Gulver.     They're off, he said. Let's hope they get a liberal education.      V     Retief lay on his back in deep grass by a stream, eating grapes. A tallfigure appeared on the knoll above him and waved.     Retief! Hank Arapoulous bounded down the slope and embraced Retief,slapping him on the back. I heard you were here\u2014and I've got newsfor you. You won the final day's picking competition. Over two hundredbushels! That's a record!     Let's get on over to the garden. Sounds like the celebration's aboutto start.     In the flower-crowded park among the stripped vines, Retief andArapoulous made their way to a laden table under the lanterns. A tallgirl dressed in loose white, and with long golden hair, came up toArapoulous.     Delinda, this is Retief\u2014today's winner. And he's also the fellow thatgot those workers for us.     Delinda smiled at Retief. I've heard about you, Mr. Retief. Weweren't sure about the boys at first. Two thousand Bogans, and allconfused about their baggage that went astray. But they seemed to likethe picking. She smiled again.     That's not all. Our gals liked the boys, Hank said. Even Bogansaren't so bad, minus their irons. A lot of 'em will be staying on. Buthow come you didn't tell me you were coming, Retief? I'd have laid onsome kind of big welcome.     I liked the welcome I got. And I didn't have much notice. Mr. Magnanwas a little upset when he got back. It seems I exceeded my authority.     Arapoulous laughed. I had a feeling you were wheeling pretty free,Retief. I hope you didn't get into any trouble over it.     No trouble, Retief said. A few people were a little unhappy withme. It seems I'm not ready for important assignments at Departmentallevel. I was shipped off here to the boondocks to get a little moreexperience.     Delinda, look after Retief, said Arapoulous. I'll see you later.I've got to see to the wine judging. He disappeared in the crowd.     Congratulations on winning the day, said Delinda. I noticed you atwork. You were wonderful. I'm glad you're going to have the prize.     Thanks. I noticed you too, flitting around in that white nightie ofyours. But why weren't you picking grapes with the rest of us?     I had a special assignment.     Too bad. You should have had a chance at the prize.     Delinda took Retief's hand. I wouldn't have anyway, she said. I'mthe prize.   "

        "Query": "What significance does Croanie hold in the narrative of CULTURAL EXCHANGE?",
        "Summary_1": "Croanie is a member of the Nicodemean Cluster of the Galaxy and is an associate of Boge, a member known to be a troublemaker. They tried to steal minerals from Lovenbroy earlier by attacking them. Croanie is under obligation to Boge. Croanie is the world that gave Lovenbroy a loan when it needed money to help tide it over until its next grape harvest. Croanie gave Lovenbroy a mortgage on its crops and holds a security interest in half of the grape acreage that it will acquire if Lovenbroy cannot meet the loan payment that is coming due. This is the reason that Hank Arapoulous goes to MEDDLE and asks for help obtaining workers to go to Lovenbroy and harvest the crop. It also turns out that Croanie is involved in Boge\u2019s efforts to attack Lovenbroy and gain access to its minerals. Mr. Whaffle reveals to Retief that Croanie is set to receive a shipment of heavy mining equipment, but Croanie is best known for its oceans and fishing and has no ore. In addition, when the Bogan exchange students arrive without their luggage, Mr. Karsh says their luggage is coming from Croanie. When their luggage does arrive, it is full of weapons. The \u201ctractors\u201d that are being shipped to Croanie are really armored vehicles that are continental siege units that carry four men and have a half-megaton/second firepower. Mr. Whaffle reveals that the tractors are for transshipment and that Croanie is in a difficult situation, balance-of-payments-wise, with Boge. There is also an application for 2,000 more \u201cexchange students\u201d to be sent to Croanie.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Croanie is a planet that consists mostly of fisheries and is known for their seafood. They loaned another planet, Lovenbroy, some money when they were struggling, and the people of Croanie have also found themselves in debt to Boge, a nearby planet known as a local bully. Because of this, Croanie finds itself deeply entwined in Boge\u2019s web of interplanetary plots by transshipping siege units and/or mining equipment and letting Boge take advantage of their mortgage on Lovenbroy\u2019s best land. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Croanie is another planet that neighbors Lovenbroy and Boge. It is the home of many fisheries and seamen. Croanie has developed an alliance with the Bogans, who attempted to invade Lovenbroy ten years ago. When they failed, the Croanie swooped in and offered loans and assistance to the depleted and wounded Lovenbroy. \n\tLater on down the line, Croanie and the Bogans hatched a plot to take over Lovenbroy and mine their resources. The Croanie use grants and diplomatic immunity to acquire 500 Bolos, model WV M-1. These are essentially outfitted superpowered tanks that have a bulldozer blade attached (hence the ability to label them as tractors) to make demolition easier. Once Croanie acquired the \u201ctractors,\u201d Boge would send over 4,000 young Bogan boys to Lovenbroy who were trained and ready to invade. Together, their siege would completely overwhelm the Lovenbroy and destroy their home. \nThanks to Arapoulous coming to MUDDLE for help, Retief was able to piece together the random bits of the puzzle and thwart their plan. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Croanie is a mostly-aquatic planet known for its exports of seafood. They provide foot-long prawn to Lovenbroy. They also have close ties to the planet of Boge, whose inhabitants are nicknamed the \u201cHoodlums of the Nicodemean Cluster.\u201d Croanie owns the mortgage on Lovenbroy\u2019s vast vineyards after a battle over their minerals left them financially wrecked. A Croanie ship brings the luggage bearing the Bogans\u2019 weapons to meet the group of Bogan students who are set to fly to d\u2019Land to attend the Exchange Program. The students are actually soldiers, who will supposedly use the weapons to overtake d\u2019Land. They also are the recipients of a grant from the MEDDLE program that will supply them with 500 tractors\u2014an amount they cannot process with the facilities they have on their planet. They will send the excess tractors to Boge, which will use them in turn to attack d\u2019Land.",

Hehiccupped again. Can't travel without our baggage, y'know.     Suit yourself, Retief said. Where's the baggage now?     Coming in aboard a Croanie lighter.     Maybe you'd like to arrange for a meal for the students here.     Sure, Karsh said. That's a good idea. Why don't you join us? Karshwinked. And bring a few beers.     Not this time, Retief said. He watched the students, still emergingfrom Customs. They seem to be all boys, he commented. No femalestudents?     Maybe later, Karsh said. You know, after we see how the first bunchis received.     Back at the MUDDLE office, Retief buzzed Miss Furkle.     Do you know the name of the institution these Bogan students are boundfor?     Why, the University at d'Land, of course.     Would that be the Technical College?     Miss Furkle's mouth puckered. I'm sure I've never pried into thesedetails.     Where does doing your job stop and prying begin, Miss Furkle? Retiefsaid.

        "Query": "Can you give me a summary of the storyline in THE RECRUIT?",
        "Summary_1": "The story opens on a discussion at home between a husband and wife being overheard by their sixteen-year-old son, Wayne. They are distraught over their son\u2019s attitude and attribute it to his age and the buildup of repressed impulses. Wayne views is parents with contempt. He reveals that he has been called to be drafted and leaves them to go to the authorities taking the family automobile.\n\nArriving at the Youth Center, Wayne navigates the bureaucracy of being drafted which involves registering and being issued with a firearm and a switchblade. He bristles against the military authority figures at the youth center, deriding their appearance and position. Wayne is cocky and confident even as he is warned about the dangers of his mission. Wayne is assigned a mission that involves killing a known murderer and his girl. He has six hours of autonomy where he is privileged to operate outside of the normal rule of law.\n\nWayne makes his way to a rougher neighborhood and witnesses another teenager hunt down and brutally murder a vagrant with a baseball bat. Wayne enters the bar which contains his target. He locates and engages them, shooting the man and chasing the woman out of the bar into a crumbling apartment building. When he eventually corners her, she begs him to kill her quickly. Wayne however is overcome with a physical aversion to the violence he was intending to commit.\n\nWayne is later being evaluated back at the Youth Center. It is revealed that society engages teenagers to execute criminals as a preferred outlet for their aggressive impulses. Those that go through with an execution are initiated into the military.

        "Summary_2": "Wayne Seton is a young man with an irrepressible urge. At 16 years old, he\u2019s impatient, hormonal, and waiting for the draft, especially not that school is over. His mothers worries over him, but his father assures her that the draft is the right move. \nSeton receives his draft and quickly runs downstairs, grabs the keys to the car, and leaves, ignoring the fear in his father\u2019s eyes. \nHe arrives at the 947th Youth Center. After checking in at the reception, he makes his way to the armory. He picks out a revolver, a shoulder hoster, and a switchblade disguised as a comb. His arrogance shows through his interactions with the many adults working at the Youth Center. They warn him of the trails he\u2019ll face, and he simply laughs them off. \nFinally, he heads to the elevator that will take him to Captain Jack, the commander of this facility. Seton\u2019s nervousness finally shows in his clammy palms and racing thoughts. Captain Jack intimidates him and questions his nerve and willingness to complete the mission. Captain Jack raises his bear-shaped cane to Seton, a blade sticking out the end of it. He tells Seton he has only six hours before the curfew sets back in. His target is at the Four Aces Club; a pretty woman with brightly colored clothes as well as a larger man, who\u2019d killed five people. \nSeton begins his hunt, driving around town and searching for them. He\u2019s pulled over by a cop trying to enforce the curfew, but one look at his pass card sends shivers down the officer\u2019s spine, and Seton is sent on his way. \nOnce he\u2019s arrived at the club, a bum grabs onto him and asks Seton to protect him. A car rushes in, and a young man jumps out. He beats the bum with a baseball bat, then runs him over with his car. Seton watches in awe. \nFinally, he walks into the bar and stalks his prey. After the man put his hands on the girl, he pulled out his revolver and shot him. The girl escapes and he runs after her. \nShe leads him on an epic chase, eventually stopping at what is assumedly her home.\nShe begs him to shoot her first and then beat her once she\u2019s dead. Seton talks and talks, but his confidence fades. He realizes he feels bad for this girl and runs out, leaving her alive. \nSeton is examined by Doctor Burns back at the Youth Center, who questions him about his inability to complete the mission. He reveals that this system was set in place to rid the world of dangerous criminals and to expel the murderous impulses all people are born with. Since Seton failed, two men came in to take him away and treat him. He realizes that the others were like him; they had also refused to kill and had been given the same treatment.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Wayne is a teenage boy who lives with his parents, but doesn\u2019t respect them very much. Because he is 16, he is waiting for a draft call. His parents are worried about him, and suspect he has repressed some impulses to be violent, so they are a mix of relieved and concerned when Wayne tells them that he has received his call. Wayne takes the car that his parents were going to take for their night out, and heads toward the neon lights on the freeway. When he arrives at the Public Youth Center to check in for his draft call, he acts arrogantly to the sergeant at the reception desk. He heads to the armory to pick up two weapons: a Smith & Wesson .38, and a six-inch, spring-loaded Skelly switchblade. Afterwards, he heads to Captain Jack\u2019s office. Captain Jack is the first person Wayne encounters in the story who makes him nervous. The Captain gives Wayne permission to go without curfew or law for six hours, and assigns him a task: a \u201cbeast\u201d of a woman on the west side of town, at Four Aces Club, along with the man she is with. Wayne uses his signed pass to get past copy on his way there, driving through darker and darker streets, and  eventually makes it to the club. He ran into a drunk man who tried to ask Wayne for help, but some other teenagers pulled up a car, beat the man to death with a baseball bat, and split. Wayne disappeared into the club and caught eye of his targets. He was able to match the woman\u2019s description to the outfit Captain Jack said she would be wearing, and Wayne sits at a nearby table, watching the woman get nervous. He orders a drink; after he downs it, he gets up, and his targets try to run. He shoots the man before they all run out of the club, chasing each other through alleys and a building that was falling apart. He eventually cornered the woman in a pieced-together bedroom, and she begged him to kill her quickly. She is so tired of running from people sent to kill her that she would like it to be over as quickly as possible. Wayne pulls out his belt to whip her with, but after he swings it once, he starts to retreat. The woman still begs for him to kill her, but his attitude has completely shifted and he insists that he cannot, and runs away. When Wayne goes back to the Youth Center, the doctor in charge of \u201creadjustment\u201d of teenagers scolds Wayne for not killing the woman, both because he believes the two targeted people are terrible people, but also because that means Wayne did not get the violent energy out of his system. The team is sent to receive treatment and be sent back home, and Wayne realizes that these nights end like this more often than he had realized. ",

His father reminds Eva that Wayne\u2019s repressed impulses are not something they should be worrying about because the Youth Board takes care of those.\n\nWayne tells his parents that he just got his draft call, and he demands the car keys and leaves the house. He travels to the Youth Center. When he arrives, he chooses a gun and a knife for his weapons, and he meets up with Captain Jack. Captain Jack tells Wayne that he has one chance to prove himself, and he has six hours to complete his mission. Wayne needs to go to the Four Aces Club and murder two people who top the undesireable list. \n\nOutside of the club, he watches as a homeless person is beaten to death by a teenager. The bum calls out for help, but Wayne ignores his pleas.\n\nOnce he goes inside, he immediately recognizes his two targets, Red the psycho and a mousy girl. His gun fires accidentally, and the girl runs outside. Wayne chases her through dilapidated buildings and into her home where he sees the disgusting nest she sleeps in. Although he knows he is on a mission to bruise her and then kill her, and he has been asked to fulfill this duty, he cannot do it. He feels too badly for her. Even when she begs to be murdered so that she no longer has to live in fear of death, he refuses.\n\nWayne goes back to the Youth Center where Doctor Burns, the head of the readjustment staff at the Youth Center, tells him that he needed to get his impulses out of the way in a controlled environment. Now, he can\u2019t be trusted not to hurt someone else since everyone has those impulses inside of themselves.

I want to talk to you.     In the office, Arapoulous took a chair. Sorry if I'm rushing you,Retief, he said. But have you got anything for me?     Retief waved at the wine bottles.

Nitworth turned, staredout at the ramp where a Qornt ship rose slowly on a column of pale bluelight. The vibration increased as a second ship lifted, then a third.     Nitworth whirled on Magnan. What's this! Who ordered these recruits toembark without my permission?     I took the liberty of giving them an errand to run, Mr. Secretary,Retief said. There was that little matter of the Groaci infiltratingthe Sirenian System. I sent the boys off to handle it.     Call them back at once!     I'm afraid that won't be possible. They're under orders to maintaintotal communications silence until completion of the mission.     Nitworth drummed his fingers on the desk top. Slowly, a thoughtfulexpression dawned. He nodded.     This may work out, he said. I      should     call them back, but sincethe fleet is out of contact, I'm unable to do so, correct? Thus I canhardly be held responsible for any over-enthusiasm in chastising theGroaci.     He closed one eye in a broad wink at Magnan. Very well, gentlemen,I'll overlook the irregularity this time.

The story begins in a conventional domestic setting but quickly transitions to a Youth Center and then gritty underbelly of the city. The Youth Center is bureaucratic and clinical with Wayne making his way from registration to the Armory to his assignment. Later he returns to this center for psychological treatment. The inner-city area is known as Slumville and is filled with crumbling infrastructure and violent dealings. It is described as dark and mazelike with semi-abandoned buildings that are on the verge of collapse. The Four Aces Club where the main conflict of the story takes place is a seedy bar in Slumville where undesirables congregate. Smoky and filled with jazzy music, the club becomes a scene of tension and violence as Wayne confronts his targets there.",
        "Summary_2": "The Recruit by Bryce Walton takes place in a modern society, similar to the one we exist in now. The story starts in a normal suburban household. A mother, father, and one son coexist without too much tension. \nHowever, as the story progresses, this world continues to differ from ours. A curfew is set in place, keeping in the acceptable people and allowing the undesirables to be hunted. As the main character continues to explore the city, we see more and more of its darkness. It is grimy and gritty, filled with crime and scared citizens. \nSquatters have taken over abandoned buildings, and the feeling is truly man vs. man, citizen vs. citizen.\n",
        "Summary_3": "The story starts in the home of Wayne and his parents, which has at least two stories and is in the suburbs of some city. After a short drive on the freeway, Wayne arrives at the Public Youth Center where he navigates a series of rooms, first an armory with a wide variety of weapons, and then Captain Jack\u2019s office, which had its own sets of weapons, taxidermied animals, and menacing stone walls. After some more driving into town, Wayne heads into darker and darker streets that twist their way towards the club he was told his targets would be at. He parked his car in the alley across from the club, next to a large collection of garbage cans, where he encountered a homeless man. When he made it into the club, he found it to be very hazy and dark, even though it had been night outside already. He sat at his own table in the smoky environment for a while, until it was time to chase his targets. Once outside, the alley turned into a maze of other alleys, parking lots, ruined buildings, and other infrastructure that seems to be falling apart. He followed her up a crumbling staircase in a building that was barely standing, and eventually cornered her in a small room where she had made a makeshift bed to sleep on, created entirely from scraps of anything she could find, including paper and rags. After he left this building after not successfully killing his target, he finds himself back at the Youth Center where the story ends. ",

Once inside, he is served an alcoholic beverage even though he is only sixteen. \n\nIn his society, teenagers like Wayne are sent out into the streets to murder people who have committed crimes. The prevailing belief is that all humans have violent impulses inside of them, so allowing teenagers to murder legitimately terrible people will get rid of those impulses and allow for a peaceful society. In the past, the state was responsible for taking care of criminals, but at some point their way of dealing with violent offenders changed.

        "Query": "\"In what way is slang incorporated into THE RECRUIT?\"",
        "Summary_1": "Distinctive teenage or \u201cteener\u201d vernacular language is used extensively throughout the story. Wayne uses slang to communicate his dismissiveness of those in authority. People who live commonplace lives are \u201csquareheads\u201d and \u201cpunks\u201d. Some typical proper nouns are shortened \u201cOlds\u201d for Oldsmobile, \u201cCad\u201d for Cadillac. The effect is to cement the story in a future where language has evolved from its current state with teens communicating in a way that distinguishes them from other more conventional member of society. Wayne\u2019s interaction with the waiter is emblematic of this effect. By saying, \u201cBring me a Crusher,\u201d and then \u201cFade,\u201d it is signaled to the reader that Wayne views himself as a member of a select group with its own cant.",
        "Summary_2": "The author uses slang throughout the story as a way to designate actions/events that are unfamiliar and to fully immerse the reader. Although no clear definitions are given, the true meaning of the slang is discovered as the story unfolds. At first, the draft and make out are absolutely foreign terms. As the story continues, the reader learns that to make out is to take on the mission assigned to the youth by the Public Youth Center. These terms thrust the reader into the story and show how different this world is from ours.",
        "Summary_3": "Slang is the means by which the author denotes various categories of people throughout the story. In this world, people are categorized in large age groups. Wayne refers to people his parents\u2019 age as the Olds, and Wayne himself is referred to multiple times as a teener. This use of slang separates the world in the story from the world of the reader. It seems that Wayne likes to refer to things in casual ways, referring to the family car as a bolt bucket, and really takes the label of punk to heart when he is called that by Captain Jack. When Wayne arrives at the club where his targets are, the car that the other teenagers show up in is referred to as a Cad, presumably short for Cadillac. Another way language is used to delineate groups of people is in calling the hunted people beasts, and using animal imagery to describe them. The targets Wayne was after referred to as beasts, the woman as a mouse, and the man is a cat. This is one way these people are portrayed as less than human. Even during the chase, the woman is regularly referred to as a mouse, even as actual rats are running by as well. However, others are not entirely exempt from this use of animal imagery at the point of comparison, as Wayne is also compared to wild deer when he is chasing after the woman in the alley.",
        "Summary_4": "Slang words are used throughout the story, not only when Wayne is talking, but also when the narrator is explaining characters\u2019 actions. The specific word choices work to make the setting appear unique and mostly dreadful. \n\nWayne refers to his parents as \u201csquareheads\u201d as an insult. Wayne can\u2019t wait to distinguish himself from his parents. He finds them to be monotonous, overbearing, and lame. The slang term is meant to portray them in the light that Wayne sees them. They are not bad people, and they are deeply for their son. They\u2019re just normal, everyday parents, and Wayne wants a more adventurous life. \n\nIn a later scene, the narrator refers to a homeless person on the street as a \u201cstewbum\u201d. The word is definitely not a euphemism for alcoholic, and it doesn\u2019t make the character appear sympathetic. Instead, the use of the term stewbum suggests that he is inferior and is almost deserving of the violence he faces from a seemingly random teenager. \n\nIn the text, teenagers are referred to as \u201cteeners\u201d. Since teenagers have a very important role in this society, and it\u2019s definitely a rite of passage to fulfill the violent mission and purge the criminal that they\u2019ve been assigned to, this slang term makes teenagers seem like a separate class of people. Their ability or inability to make good on their draft card will change the course of their lives, so it\u2019s fitting that they are given a different name.\n\n",

Now it is all automatic, pure reflex. A sensation comes to me when I amburned; then I experience a burning pain. If the sensation is a tickle,I experience a tickle.     This morning I have what is known medically as a syndrome ... a groupof symptoms popularly referred to as a hangover ... Ahhh! Pardon meagain. Strangely ... now what was I saying? Oh, yes. Ha, ha. Strangelyenough, the reactions that come easiest to the people in this worldcame most difficult to me. Money-love, for example. It is a great thinghere, both among those who haven't got it and those who have.     I went out and got plenty of money. I walked invisible into a bank andcarried away piles of it. Then I sat and looked at it. I took the moneyto a remote room of the twenty room suite I have rented in the besthotel here in\u2014no, sorry\u2014and stared at it for hours.     Nothing happened. I didn't love the stuff or feel one way or the otherabout it. Yet all around me people are actually killing one another forthe love of it.     Anyway.... Ahhh. Pardon me. I got myself enough money to fill ten orfifteen rooms. By the end of the week I should have all eighteen sparerooms filled with money. If I don't love it then, I'll feel I havefailed. This alcohol is taking effect now.     Blgftury has been goading me for reports. To hell with his reports!I've got a lot more emotions to try, such as romantic love. I've beenstudying this phenomenon, along with other racial characteristics ofthese people, in the movies. This is the best place to see thesepeople as they really are. They all go into the movie houses and theredo homage to their own images. Very quaint type of idolatry.     Love. Ha! What an adventure this is becoming.     By the way, Joe, I'm forwarding that five dollars. You see, it won'tcost me anything. It'll come out of the pocket of the idiot who'swriting this letter. Pretty shrewd of me, eh?     I'm going out and look at that money again. I think I'm at lastlearning to love it, though not as much as I admire liquor. Well, onesimply must persevere, I always say.     Glmpauszn   <doc-sep> Outside in the corridor, Magnan came up to Retief, who stood talking toa tall man in a pilot's coverall.     I'll be tied up, sending through full details on my\u2014our\u2014yourrecruiting theme, Retief, Magnan said. Suppose you run into the cityto assist the new Verpp Consul in settling in.     I'll do that, Mr. Magnan. Anything else?     Magnan raised his eyebrows. You're remarkably compliant today, Retief.I'll arrange transportation.     Don't bother, Mr. Magnan. Cy here will run me over. He was the pilotwho ferried us over to Roolit I, you recall.     I'll be with you as soon as I pack a few phone numbers, Retief, thepilot said. He moved off. Magnan followed him with a disapproving eye.An uncouth sort, I fancied. I trust you're not consorting with hiskind socially.     I wouldn't say that, exactly, Retief said.

        "Query": "In what ways does Wayne engage with the other characters in THE RECRUIT?",
        "Summary_1": "Wayne is a cocky, arrogant sixteen-year-old defined by his lack of respect for authority. His main goal in life is to be drafted into the military and lead an adventuring life.\n\nHis unnamed parents care for their son but are nonplussed by his attitude and general demeanor of rebelliousness. They seem to live commonplace lives with domestic trips to the movie theatre or a neighborhood poker game. Wayne views this type of life as detestable. His interaction with his parents is crude and condescending.\n\nThe military officials that Wayne meets in the Youth Center also elicit Wayne\u2019s contempt. He views their desk jobs as an analog to his parents\u2019 \u201cpunkie\u201d existence. To Wayne, the only admirable way of life is one of high adventure. He disrespects most of the desk workers, but the commanding officer, Captain Jack, deflates his self-assurance.\n\nWayne is keenly intent on hunting his targets. He stares them down tensely before violently engaging them. female target, nicknamed the \u201cmouse\u201d, is revealed to be a woman without hope. She\u2019s tired of running and just wants to be put out of her misery. Surprisingly, at the moment of truth, Wayne cannot bring himself to execute the woman in cold blood, in his own words, \u201cpunking out\u201d. He admits to the doctor analyzing him after his assignment that he felt sorry for her.     \n",
        "Summary_2": "In the beginning, Wayne Seton\u2019s interactions are marked by his arrogance, ego, and desire to hunt. He treats his parents as one would children. He over-analyzes their behavior, and, instead of feeling pity for them, he finds them annoying and useless. He\u2019s desperate to break free of this house and this planet. He views himself highly and dreams about his future on Mars or other such grand adventures. \nHis behavior doesn\u2019t change when Seton finally arrives at the Youth Center. He continues to treat the officers with disrespect, although, as he meets with Captain Jack, he begins to become scared. \nHis desire to hunt and break free of his family drives him, as well as his belief that he is beyond all of this. He watches the other men kill the bum with awe and glee. It doesn\u2019t disgust him, rather it interests him. \nHowever, when it comes time to kill his own undesirable, he finds himself unable. He begins to feel pity, empathy, and sympathy. These emotions make it impossible for him to complete his mission. Although he tries to use his arrogance to hype himself up, he ends up admitting that he doesn\u2019t want to kill the woman and runs away. All bark, but no bite.\n",
        "Summary_3": "In the first half of the story, Wayne is very cocky in his interactions with other people. He clearly has no respect for his parents, thinks they lack intelligence, and is annoyed with their routines. He felt he could explode at any moment, so being cold and short with them when they had to interact with them is his way of keeping them out of the line of fire of his impulses. He insists on taking the family car, and is still high and mighty when he gets to the Public Youth Center, throwing sass at the sergeant at the reception desk as well as the corporal in the armory. It is only when he meets Captain Jack that he starts to show some humility and nervousness. His hands start to sweat, and the captain calls him a punk a number of times and then startles him, almost whacking Wayne with his cane. Once he gets to the club, Wayne is nervous interacting with the homeless alcoholic who encountering the alley, and is terrified by the other teenagers who arrived to kill this man. After he retreats into the club, Wayne finds a sense of superiority again as he flashes his official documents to be able to order a drink, after he spots his targets. His goal is to make them as uncomfortable as possible, so he sits right near them, and enjoys the opportunity to have a drink on the government\u2019s dime. After he decides to pursue his targets, he shoots the man once before both targets and Wayne make their way outside. Wayne taunts the woman as he chases her through the alley and the dilapidated buildings, and threatens her with what he intends to do to her once he has her cornered. Once he actually strikes her with his belt though, he retreats into himself and is very nervous all of a sudden, and runs away from the woman. He felt sorry for her, and told this to the doctor at the Youth Center as he is scolded. Wayne seems ashamed, apologizes for punking out, and quietly does what he is told by the doctor for the rest of the session.",
        "Summary_4": "Wayne looks down on the other characters in the story, including his own mother and father. He refers to them as squareheads, and he actually finds his mother\u2019s distress and her arguments with his father to be funny. In a brief scene where Wayne demands the car keys from his parents, it\u2019s clear that they are fearful of him. Instead of thanking them for allowing him to use the car, he repays them for their generosity by laughing at them and slamming the door in his mother\u2019s face. Wayne is fully aware that his mother is terrified of his draft call, and he does not allow her to hug him or give him words of encouragement or advice before he leaves the house. \n\nWhen he arrives at the Youth Center, he treats the man at the front desk poorly, and then proceeds to make fun of the corporal who tries to give him advice. Wayne has a bad attitude, and it affects his interactions with everyone. \n\nThe only person that Wayne does not feel like he can treat badly is Captain Jack. Captain Jack is in a serious position of authority, and that makes Wayne nervous. He answers his questions politely. \n\nIt is truly shocking when Wayne is unable to kill the mousy woman that he was assigned to purge. He has her cornered in an abandoned and run-down building, but he can\u2019t go through with the violence, no matter how much he wants to. In the meeting that takes place afterwards, he tells the doctor that he felt bad for the woman. Therefore, Wayne does have a conscience, even if he likes to pretend that he does not. \n",
        "Article": "   THE RECRUIT     BY BRYCE WALTON     It was dirty work, but it would     make him a man. And kids had a     right to grow up\u2014some of them!     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Worlds of If Science Fiction, July 1962.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      Wayne, unseen, sneered down from the head of the stairs.     The old man with his thick neck, thick cigar, evening highball, potgutand bald head without a brain in it. His slim mother with nervouslypolite smiles and voice fluttering, assuring the old man by her frailtythat he was big in the world. They were squareheads one and all,marking moron time in a gray dream. Man, was he glad to break out.     The old man said, He'll be okay. Let him alone.     But he won't eat. Just lies there all the time.     Hell, the old man said. Sixteen's a bad time. School over, waitingfor the draft and all. He's in between. It's rough.     Mother clasped her forearms and shook her head once slowly.     We got to let him go, Eva. It's a dangerous time. You got to rememberabout all these dangerous repressed impulses piling up with nowhere togo, like they say. You read the books.     But he's unhappy.     Are we specialists? That's the Youth Board's headache, ain't it? Whatdo we know about adolescent trauma and like that? Now get dressed orwe'll be late.     Wayne watched the ritual, grinning. He listened to their purposelessnoises, their blabbing and yakking as if they had something to say.Blab-blab about the same old bones, and end up chewing them in thesame old ways. Then they begin all over again. A freak sideshow all theway to nowhere. Squareheads going around either unconscious or witheyes looking dead from the millennium in the office waiting to retireinto limbo.     How come he'd been stuck with parental images like that? Onething\u2014when he was jockeying a rocket to Mars or maybe firing the pantsoff Asiatic reds in some steamy gone jungle paradise, he'd forget hispunkie origins in teeveeland.     But the old man was right on for once about the dangerous repressedimpulses. Wayne had heard about it often enough. Anyway there was nodoubt about it when every move he made was a restrained explosion.So he'd waited in his room, and it wasn't easy sweating it out alonewaiting for the breakout call from HQ.     Well, dear, if you say so, Mother said, with the old resigned sighthat must make the old man feel like Superman with a beerbelly.     They heard Wayne slouching loosely down the stairs and looked up.     Relax, Wayne said. You're not going anywhere tonight.     What, son? his old man said uneasily. Sure we are. We're going tothe movies.     He could feel them watching him, waiting; and yet still he didn'tanswer. Somewhere out in suburban grayness a dog barked, then wassilent.     Okay, go, Wayne said. If you wanta walk. I'm taking the familyboltbucket.     But we promised the Clemons, dear, his mother said.     Hell, Wayne said, grinning straight into the old man. I just got mydraft call.     He saw the old man's Adam's apple move. Oh, my dear boy, Mother criedout.     So gimme the keys, Wayne said. The old man handed the keys over. Hisunderstanding smile was strained, and fear flicked in his sagging eyes.     Do be careful, dear, his mother said. She ran toward him as helaughed and shut the door on her. He was still laughing as he whoomedthe Olds between the pale dead glow of houses and roared up the ramponto the Freeway. Ahead was the promising glitter of adventure-callingneon, and he looked up at the high skies of night and his eyes sailedthe glaring wonders of escape.   <doc-sep> He burned off some rubber finding a slot in the park-lot. He strodeunder a sign reading      Public Youth Center No. 947     and walked casuallyto the reception desk, where a thin man with sergeant's stripes and apansy haircut looked out of a pile of paperwork.     Where you think you're going, my pretty lad?     Wayne grinned down. Higher I hope than a typewriter jockey.     Well, the sergeant said. How tough we are this evening. You have apass, killer?     Wayne Seton. Draft call.     Oh. The sergeant checked his name off a roster and nodded. He wroteon a slip of paper, handed the pass to Wayne. Go to the Armory andcheck out whatever your lusting little heart desires. Then report toCaptain Jack, room 307.     Thanks, sarge dear, Wayne said and took the elevator up to the Armory.     A tired fat corporal with a naked head blinked up at tall Wayne.Finally he said, So make up your mind, bud. Think you're the only kidbreaking out tonight?     Hold your teeth, pop, Wayne said, coolly and slowly lighting acigarette. I've decided.     The corporal's little eyes studied Wayne with malicious amusement.Take it from a vet, bud. Sooner you go the better. It's a big city andyou're starting late. You can get a cat, not a mouse, and some babesare clever hellcats in a dark alley.     You must be a genius, Wayne said. A corporal with no hair and stilla counterboy. I'm impressed. I'm all ears, Dad.     The corporal sighed wearily. You can get that balloon headventilated, bud, and good.     Wayne's mouth twitched. He leaned across the counter toward theshelves and racks of weapons. I'll remember that crack when I getmy commission. He blew smoke in the corporal's face. Bring me aSmith and Wesson .38, shoulder holster with spring-clip. And throw ina Skelly switchblade for kicks\u2014the six-inch disguised job with thedouble springs.     The corporal waddled back with the revolver and the switchbladedisguised in a leather comb case. He checked them on a receipt ledger,while Wayne examined the weapons, broke open the revolver, twirled thecylinder and pushed cartridges into the waiting chamber. He slippedthe knife from the comb case, flicked open the blade and stared at itsgleam in the buttery light as his mouth went dry and the refractedincandescence of it trickled on his brain like melted ice, exciting andscary.     He removed his leather jacket. He slung the holster under his leftarmpit and tested the spring clip release several times, feeling theway the serrated butt dropped into his wet palm. He put his jacketback on and the switchblade case in his pocket. He walked toward theelevator and didn't look back as the corporal said, Good luck, tiger.     Captain Jack moved massively. The big stone-walled office, alive withstuffed lion and tiger and gunracks, seemed to grow smaller. CaptainJack crossed black-booted legs and whacked a cane at the floor. It hada head shaped like a grinning bear.     Wayne felt the assured smile die on his face. Something seemed toshrink him. If he didn't watch himself he'd begin feeling like a peaamong bowling balls.     Contemptuously amused little eyes glittered at Wayne from a shaggyhead. Shoulders hunched like stuffed sea-bags.     Wayne Seton, said Captain Jack as if he were discussing somethingin a bug collection. Well, well, you're really fired up aren't you?Really going out to eat 'em. Right, punk?     Yes, sir, Wayne said. He ran wet hands down the sides of his chinos.His legs seemed sheathed in lead as he bit inwardly at shrinking fearthe way a dog snaps at a wound. You big overblown son, he thought, I'llshow you but good who is a punk. They made a guy wait and sweat untilhe screamed. They kept a guy on the fire until desire leaped in him,ran and billowed and roared until his brain was filled with it. Butthat wasn't enough. If this muscle-bound creep was such a big boy,what was he doing holding down a desk?     Well, this is it, punk. You go the distance or start a butterflycollection.     The cane darted up. A blade snicked from the end and stopped an inchfrom Wayne's nose. He jerked up a shaky hand involuntarily and clampeda knuckle-ridged gag to his gasping mouth.     Captain Jack chuckled. All right, superboy. He handed Wayne hispasscard. Curfew's off, punk, for 6 hours. You got 6 hours to makeout.     Yes, sir.     Your beast is primed and waiting at the Four Aces Club on the WestSide. Know where that is, punk?     No, sir, but I'll find it fast.     Sure you will, punk, smiled Captain Jack. She'll be wearing yellowslacks and a red shirt. Black hair, a cute trick. She's with a heftypsycho who eats punks for breakfast. He's butchered five people.They're both on top of the Undesirable list, Seton. They got to go andthey're your key to the stars.     Yes, sir, Wayne said.     So run along and make out, punk, grinned Captain Jack.   <doc-sep> He walked through the wavering haze of smoke and liquored dizziness andstood until his eyes learned the dark. He spotted her red shirt andyellow legs over in the corner above a murky lighted table.     He walked toward her, watching her little subhuman pixie face lift.The eyes widened with exciting terror, turned even paler behind a redslash of sensuous mouth. Briefed and waiting, primed and eager forrunning, she recognized her pursuer at once. He sat at a table nearher, watching and grinning and seeing her squirm.     She sat in that slightly baffled, fearful and uncomprehending attitudeof being motionless, as though they were all actors performing in aweirdo drama being staged in that smoky thick-aired dive.     Wayne smiled with wry superiority at the redheaded psycho in a dirtyT-shirt, a big bruiser with a gorilla face. He was tussling his mouseheavy.     What's yours, teener? the slug-faced waiter asked.     Bring me a Crusher, buddyroo, Wayne said, and flashed his pass card.     Sure, teener.     Red nuzzled the mouse's neck and made drooly noises. Wayne watched andfed on the promising terror and helplessness of her hunted face. Shesat rigid, eyes fixed on Wayne like balls of frozen glass.     Red looked up and stared straight at Wayne with eyes like black buttonsimbedded in the waxlike skin of his face. Then he grinned all on oneside. One huge hand scratched across the wet table top like a furiouscat's.     Wayne returned the challenging move but felt a nervous twitch jerk athis lips. A numbness covered his brain like a film as he concentratedon staring down Red the psycho. But Red kept looking, his eyes brightbut dead. Then he began struggling it up again with the scared littlemouse.     The waiter sat the Crusher down. Wayne signed a chit; tonight he was inthe pay of the state.     What else, teener?     One thing. Fade.     Sure, teener, the waiter said, his breathy words dripping like syrup.     Wayne drank. Liquored heat dripped into his stomach. Fire tickled hisveins, became hot wire twisting in his head.     He drank again and forced out a shaky breath. The jazz beat thumpedfast and muted brass moaned. Drumpulse, stabbing trumpet raped theair. Tension mounted as Wayne watched her pale throat convulsing, thewhite eyelids fluttering. Red fingered at her legs and salivated at herthroat, glancing now and then at Wayne, baiting him good.     Okay, you creep, Wayne said.     He stood up and started through the haze. The psycho leaped and a tablecrashed. Wayne's .38 dropped from its spring-clip holster and the blastfilled the room. The psycho screamed and stumbled toward the doorholding something in. The mouse darted by, eluded Wayne's grasp and wasout the door.     Wayne went out after her in a laughing frenzy of release. He felt thecold strange breath of moist air on his sweating skin as he sprinteddown the alley into a wind full of blowing wet.     He ran laughing under the crazy starlight and glimpsed her now andthen, fading in and out of shadows, jumping, crawling, running with thelife-or-death animation of a wild deer.     Up and down alleys, a rat's maze. A rabbit run. Across vacant lots.Through shattered tenement ruins. Over a fence. There she was, falling,sliding down a brick shute.     He gained. He moved up. His labored breath pumped more fire. And herscream was a rejuvenation hypo in his blood.  "

        "Query": "How does the society in THE RECRUIT address the issue of violence?",
        "Summary_1": "The expository dialogue by Doctor Burns at the end of the story provides some insight into how this society views the tendency toward violence in its citizens and retributive criminal justice. The prevailing understanding is that adolescents (presumably adolescent men) are subjected to aggressive and violent impulses. The society seeks to provide these teens a preferred outlet for these impulses in the form of a violent act in service of the state. Typical this seems to be the execution of an undesirable member of society who is viewed as beyond redemption. This permitted brutality is thought to get it out of a teen\u2019s system and prepare him for a life as a contributing member in the state\u2019s military apparatus. The result of this situation is a dramatically violent society where untrained youths are recruited to act as vicious vigilantes who terrorize anyone labelled as undesirable. ",
        "Summary_2": " In the final passages of the story, Wayne Seton, the protagonist, sees a doctor after his failed attempt to eliminate two alleged criminals. Despite feeling the spark and need to hunt and kill earlier, when faced with a scared young woman, he was unable to complete his task. \nDoctor Burns, a member of the readjustment staff at the center where Seton was drafted, takes a look over Seton after he returned. Although Seton enjoyed the thrill of the chase, his empathy and sympathy got the better of him. \nAfter examining him, Dr. Burns reveals the reason why Seton was sent on this mission in the first place. In this abstract reality, those who have committed heinous crimes (in this case, paternal murder and multiple homicides) are labeled as unwanted and unable to change. Instead of sending them to prison for their crimes where they may spend the rest of their lives or receive the death penalty, they send young adults out to hunt them down. \nAt 16 years old, school ends for the teenagers in this society. Once school is over, all the young adults must wait for their draft to come in. \nThey believe that each person is born with a dangerous impulse to kill. If it can be expelled at a young age and used on a person who deserves it, then there\u2019s no risk of a violent crime later on. \nThe justice system is executed by everyday people, instead of a team of soldiers or the government. \nAs well, if the 16-year-olds complete their mission, they will be shot off to space and continue their work in the galaxy.\n",
        "Summary_3": "In this society, instead of imposing penalties like death row, the government uses teenagers to end the lives of the people the society has deemed the biggest criminals. Part of this is an attempt to acknowledge the violent impulses that they expect teenagers to have, so this program is meant to give teenagers an outlet to expend this energy in hopes of getting rid of it entirely. Violent tendencies are clearly expected of everyone, as part of a more primitive instinct of sorts. The two people that Wayne was given as targets both killed people outside of this designated time, and so society decided they had to die. There is this tension between government sanctioned murder and other murder. This opportunity for teenagers to address their aggression also serves as a sort of test, and their ability to successfully eliminate their targets determines their future in some way. Formally, this means that the teenagers are given their own choice of weapons, and a six-hour pass to do whatever they want, including breaking curfew and any other laws. However, what happens to them going forward depends on the success of killing their targets in the six hours.",
        "Summary_4": "When the children in this society turn sixteen, they are forced to take a draft call. They must go to a local Youth Center and take orders from an established captain. The kids choose the weapons they would like to use, and they head out to take down a dangerous individual or multiple individuals. When Wayne is stopped by a cop at the beginning of his mission, all he has to do is show the police officer the card he has, and he\u2019s free to continue on into the darkness. This means that his mission is sanctioned by the state. \n\nAfter Wayne fails to commit the beatings and murders that he\u2019s been assigned, he must receive some sort of treatment from a doctor. The thinking is that all people are born with impulses to commit violence, and those that cannot bring themselves to do it in a state sanctioned way are now in danger of hurting people that do not deserve it. The society asks the teenagers to kill the criminals because they believe it fulfills two necessities at once. Dangerous people are expelled from society, and adolescents can be trusted not to turn into violent individuals because they have already gotten it out of their systems.  \n",
        "Article": "   What is POSAT?     By PHYLLIS STERLING SMITH     Illustrated by ED ALEXANDER     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Galaxy Science Fiction September 1951.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      Of course coming events cast their shadows     before, but this shadow was 400 years long!      The following advertisement appeared in the July 1953 issue of severalmagazines:     MASTERY OF ALL KNOWLEDGE CAN BE YOURS!     What is the secret source of those profound     principles that can solve the problems of life?     Send for our FREE booklet of explanation.     Do not be a leaf in the wind! YOU     can alter the course of your life!     Tap the treasury of Wisdom through the ages!     The Perpetual Order of Seekers After Truth     POSAT     an ancient secret society     Most readers passed it by with scarcely a glance. It was, after all,similar to the many that had appeared through the years under thename of that same society. Other readers, as their eyes slid over thefamiliar format of the ad, speculated idly about the persistent andmildly mysterious organization behind it. A few even resolved to clipthe attached coupon and send for the booklet\u2014sometime\u2014when a pen orpencil was nearer at hand.     Bill Evans, an unemployed pharmacist, saw the ad in a copy of      YourLife and Psychology     that had been abandoned on his seat in the bus.He filled out the blanks on the coupon with a scrap of stubby pencil.You can alter the course of your life! he read again. He particularlyliked that thought, even though he had long since ceased to believeit. He actually took the trouble to mail the coupon. After all, hehad, literally, nothing to lose, and nothing else to occupy his time.     Miss Elizabeth Arnable was one of the few to whom the advertisementwas unfamiliar. As a matter of fact, she very seldom read a magazine.The radio in her room took the place of reading matter, and she alwaysliked to think that it amused her cats as well as herself. Readingwould be so selfish under the circumstances, wouldn't it? Not but whatthe cats weren't almost smart enough to read, she always said.     It just so happened, however, that she had bought a copy of the      Antivivisectionist Gazette     the day before. She pounced upon the POSATad as a trout might snap at a particularly attractive fly. Havingfilled out the coupon with violet ink, she invented an errand thatwould take her past the neighborhood post office so that she could postit as soon as possible.     Donald Alford, research physicist, came across the POSAT ad tucked atthe bottom of a column in      The Bulletin of Physical Research     . He wasengrossed in the latest paper by Dr. Crandon, a man whom he admiredfrom the point of view of both a former student and a fellow researchworker. Consequently, he was one of the many who passed over the POSATad with the disregard accorded to any common object.     He read with interest to the end of the article before he realized thatsome component of the advertisement had been noted by a region of hisbrain just beyond consciousness. It teased at him like a tickle thatcouldn't be scratched until he turned back to the page.     It was the symbol or emblem of POSAT, he realized, that had caught hisattention. The perpendicularly crossed ellipses centered with a smallblack circle might almost be a conventionalized version of the Bohratom of helium. He smiled with mild skepticism as he read through theprinted matter that accompanied it.     I wonder what their racket is, he mused. Then, because his typewriterwas conveniently at hand, he carefully tore out the coupon and insertedit in the machine. The spacing of the typewriter didn't fit the dottedlines on the coupon, of course, but he didn't bother to correct it.He addressed an envelope, laid it with other mail to be posted, andpromptly forgot all about it. Since he was a methodical man, it wasentrusted to the U.S. mail early the next morning, together with hisother letters.     Three identical forms accompanied the booklet which POSAT sent inresponse to the three inquiries. The booklet gave no more informationthan had the original advertisement, but with considerable morevolubility. It promised the recipient the secrets of the Cosmos and thekey that would unlock the hidden knowledge within himself\u2014if he wouldmerely fill out the enclosed form.     Bill Evans, the unemployed pharmacist, let the paper lie unanswered forseveral days. To be quite honest, he was disappointed. Although he hadmentally disclaimed all belief in anything that POSAT might offer, hehad watched the return mails with anticipation. His own resources werealmost at an end, and he had reached the point where intervention bysomething supernatural, or at least superhuman, seemed the only hope.     He had hoped, unreasonably, that POSAT had an answer. But time layheavily upon him, and he used it one evening to write the requestedinformation\u2014about his employment (ha!), his religious beliefs, hisreason for inquiring about POSAT, his financial situation. Withoutquite knowing that he did so, he communicated in his terse answers someof his desperation and sense of futility.     Miss Arnable was delighted with the opportunity for autobiographicalcomposition. It required five extra sheets of paper to convey all theinformation that she wished to give\u2014all about her poor, dear fatherwho had been a missionary to China, and the kinship that she felttoward the mystic cults of the East, her belief that her cats werereincarnations of her loved ones (which, she stated, derived from areligion of the Persians; or was it the Egyptians?) and in her completeand absolute acceptance of everything that POSAT had stated in theirbooklet. And what would the dues be? She wished to join immediately.Fortunately, dear father had left her in a comfortable financialsituation.     To Donald Alford, the booklet seemed to confirm his suspicion thatPOSAT was a racket of some sort. Why else would they be interested inhis employment or financial position? It also served to increase hiscuriosity.     What do you suppose they're driving at? he asked his wife Betty,handing her the booklet and questionnaire.     I don't really know what to say, she answered, squinting a little asshe usually did when puzzled. I know one thing, though, and that'sthat you won't stop until you find out!     The scientific attitude, he acknowledged with a grin.     Why don't you fill out this questionnaire incognito, though? shesuggested. Pretend that we're wealthy and see if they try to get ourmoney. Do they have anything yet except your name and address?     Don was shocked. If I send this back to them, it will have to be withcorrect answers!     The scientific attitude again, Betty sighed. Don't you ever let yourimagination run away with the facts a bit? What are you going to givefor your reasons for asking about POSAT?     Curiosity, he replied, and, pulling his fountain pen from his vestpocket, he wrote exactly that, in small, neat script.     It was unfortunate for his curiosity that Don could not see thecontents of the three envelopes that were mailed from the offices ofPOSAT the following week. For this time they differed.     Bill Evans was once again disappointed. The pamphlet that was enclosedgave what apparently meant to be final answers to life's problems. Theywere couched in vaguely metaphysical terms and offered absolutely nohelp to him.     His disappointment was tempered, however, by the knowledge that hehad unexpectedly found a job. Or, rather, it had fallen into his lap.When he had thought that every avenue of employment had been tried, aposition had been offered him in a wholesale pharmacy in the olderindustrial part of the city. It was not a particularly attractive placeto work, located as it was next to a large warehouse, but to him it washope for the future.     It amused him to discover that the offices of POSAT were located on theother side of the same warehouse, at the end of a blind alley. Blindalley indeed! He felt vaguely ashamed for having placed any confidencein them.     Miss Arnable was thrilled to discover that her envelope contained notonly several pamphlets, (she scanned the titles rapidly and found thatone of them concerned the sacred cats of ancient Egypt), but that itcontained also a small pin with the symbol of POSAT wrought in gold andblack enamel. The covering letter said that she had been accepted as anactive member of POSAT and that the dues were five dollars per month;please remit by return mail. She wrote a check immediately, and settledcontentedly into a chair to peruse the article on sacred cats.     After a while she began to read aloud so that her own cats could enjoyit, too.     Don Alford would not have been surprised if his envelope had showncontents similar to the ones that the others received. The foldedsheets of paper that he pulled forth, however, made him stiffen withsharp surprise.       Come here a minute, Betty, he called, spreading them out carefully onthe dining room table. What do you make of these?     She came, dish cloth in hand, and thoughtfully examined them, one byone. Multiple choice questions! It looks like a psychological test ofsome sort.     This isn't the kind of thing I expected them to send me, worriedDon. Look at the type of thing they ask. 'If you had discovereda new and virulent poison that could be compounded from commonhousehold ingredients, would you (1) publish the information in adaily newspaper, (2) manufacture it secretly and sell it as rodentexterminator, (3) give the information to the armed forces for useas a secret weapon, or (4) withhold the information entirely as toodangerous to be passed on?'     Could they be a spy ring? asked Betty. Subversive agents? Anxious tofind out your scientific secrets like that classified stuff that you'reso careful of when you bring it home from the lab?     Don scanned the papers quickly. There's nothing here that looks likean attempt to get information. Besides, I've told them nothing aboutmy work except that I do research in physics. They don't even knowwhat company I work for. If this is a psychological test, it measuresattitudes, nothing else. Why should they want to know my attitudes?     Do you suppose that POSAT is really what it claims to be\u2014a secretsociety\u2014and that they actually screen their applicants?     He smiled wryly. Wouldn't it be interesting if I didn't make the gradeafter starting out to expose their racket?     He pulled out his pen and sat down to the task of resolving thedilemmas before him.     His next communication from POSAT came to his business address and,paradoxically, was more personal than its forerunners.     Dear Doctor Alford:     We have examined with interest the information that you have sent tous. We are happy to inform you that, thus far, you have satisfied therequirements for membership in the Perpetual Order of Seekers AfterTruth. Before accepting new members into this ancient and honorablesecret society, we find it desirable that they have a personalinterview with the Grand Chairman of POSAT.     Accordingly, you are cordially invited to an audience with our GrandChairman on Tuesday, July 10, at 2:30 P.M. Please let us know if thisarrangement is acceptable to you. If not, we will attempt to makeanother appointment for you.     The time specified for the appointment was hardly a convenient onefor Don. At 2:30 P.M. on most Tuesdays, he would be at work in thelaboratory. And while his employers made no complaint if he took hisresearch problems home with him and worried over them half the night,they were not equally enthusiastic when he used working hours forpursuing unrelated interests. Moreover, the headquarters of POSAT wasin a town almost a hundred miles distant. Could he afford to take awhole day off for chasing will-o-wisps?     It hardly seemed worth the trouble. He wondered if Betty would bedisappointed if he dropped the whole matter. Since the letter had beensent to the laboratory instead of his home, he couldn't consult herabout it without telephoning.       Since the letter had been sent to the laboratory instead of his home!     But it was impossible!     He searched feverishly through his pile of daily mail for theenvelope in which the letter had come. The address stared up at him,unmistakably and fearfully legible. The name of his company. The numberof the room he worked in. In short, the address that he had never giventhem!     Get hold of yourself, he commanded his frightened mind. There's someperfectly logical, easy explanation for this. They looked it up in thedirectory of the Institute of Physics. Or in the alumni directory ofthe university. Or\u2014or\u2014     But the more he thought about it, the more sinister it seemed. Hislaboratory address was available, but why should POSAT take the troubleof looking it up? Some prudent impulse had led him to withhold thatparticular bit of information, yet now, for some reason of their own,POSAT had unearthed the information.     His wife's words echoed in his mind, Could they be a spy ring?Subversive agents?     Don shook his head as though to clear away the confusion. Hisconservative habit of thought made him reject that explanation as toomelodramatic.     At least one decision was easier to reach because of his doubts. Now heknew he had to keep his appointment with the Grand Chairman of POSAT.     He scribbled a memo to the department office stating that he would notbe at work on Tuesday.   <doc-sep> There was the feeling that she had encountered the fat man before,which was, of course, absurd. She had an excellent memory for faces andhis was not included in her gallery. The girl pulled her thin jacketcloser about her chilly body. Aren't you going to introduce your\u2014yourfriend to me, Gabe?     I don't know who he is, Gabe said almost merrily, except that he'sno friend of mine. Do you have a name, stranger?     Of course I have a name. The fat man extracted an identificationcard from his wallet and read it. Says here I'm Dominic Bianchi, andDominic Bianchi is a retail milgot dealer.... Only he isn't a retailmilgot dealer any more; the poor fellow went bankrupt a couple of weeksago, and now he isn't ... anything.     You saved our lives, the girl said. I'd like to give you some tokenof my\u2014of our appreciation. Her hand reached toward her credit-carrierwith deliberate insult. He might have saved her life, but onlycasually, as a by-product of some larger scheme, and her appreciationheld little gratitude.     The fat man shook his head without rancor. I have plenty of money,thank you, Mrs. Gabriel Lockard.... Come, he addressed her husband,if you get up, I'll drive you home. I warn you, be more careful in thefuture! Sometimes, he added musingly, I almost wish you would letsomething happen. Then my problem would not be any problem, would it?     Gabriel shivered. I'll be careful, he vowed. I promise\u2014I'll becareful.       When he was sure that his charge was safely tucked in for the night,the fat man checked his personal possessions. He then requested a taxidriver to take him to the nearest zarquil game. The driver accepted thecommission phlegmatically. Perhaps he was more hardened than the othershad been; perhaps he was unaware that the fat man was not a desperateor despairing individual seeking one last chance, but what was knowncolloquially as a flying dutchman, a man, or woman, who went fromone zarquil game to another, loving the thrill of the sport, if youcould call it that, for its own sake, and not for the futile hope itextended and which was its sole shred of claim to moral justification.Perhaps\u2014and this was the most likely hypothesis\u2014he just didn't care.     Zarquil was extremely illegal, of course\u2014so much so that there weremany legitimate citizens who weren't quite sure just what the wordimplied, knowing merely that it was one of those nameless horrors sodeliciously hinted at by the fax sheets under the generic term ofcrimes against nature. Actually the phrase was more appropriate tozarquil than to most of the other activities to which it was commonlyapplied. And this was one crime\u2014for it was crime in law as well asnature\u2014in which victim had to be considered as guilty as perpetrator;otherwise the whole legal structure of society would collapse.   <doc-sep> As I see it, Retief said, dribbling cigar ashes into an empty wineglass, you Qornt like to be warriors, but you don't particularly liketo fight.     We don't mind a little fighting\u2014within reason. And, of course, asQornt, we're expected to die in battle. But what I say is, why rushthings?     I have a suggestion, Magnan said. Why not turn the reins ofgovernment over to the Verpp? They seem a level-headed group.     What good would that do? Qornt are Qornt. It seems there's always oneamong us who's a slave to instinct\u2014and, naturally, we have to followhim.     Why?     Because that's the way it's done.     Why not do it another way? Magnan offered. Now, I'd like to suggestcommunity singing\u2014     If we gave up fighting, we might live too long. Then what wouldhappen?     Live too long? Magnan looked puzzled.     When estivating time comes there'd be no burrows for us. Anyway, withthe new Qornt stepping on our heels\u2014     I've lost the thread, Magnan said. Who are the new Qornt?     After estivating, the Verpp moult, and then they're Qornt, of course.The Gwil become Boog, the Boog become Rheuk, the Rheuk metamorphosizeinto Verpp\u2014     You mean Slun and Zubb\u2014the mild-natured naturalists\u2014will becomewarmongers like Qorn?     Very likely. 'The milder the Verpp, the wilder the Qorn,' as the oldsaying goes.     What do Qornt turn into? Retief asked.     Hmmmm. That's a good question. So far, none have survived Qornthood.     Have you thought of forsaking your warlike ways? Magnan asked. Whatabout taking up sheepherding and regular church attendance?     Don't mistake me. We Qornt like a military life. It's great sport tosit around roaring fires and drink and tell lies and then go dashingoff to enjoy a brisk affray and some leisurely looting afterward. Butwe prefer a nice numerical advantage. Not this business of tackling youTerrestrials over on Guzzum\u2014that was a mad notion. We had no idea whatyour strength was.     But now that's all off, of course, Magnan chirped. Now that we'vehad diplomatic relations and all\u2014     Oh, by no means. The fleet lifts in thirty days. After all, we'reQornt; we have to satisfy our drive to action.     But Mr. Retief is your leader now. He won't let you!     Only a dead Qornt stays home when Attack day comes. And even ifhe orders us all to cut our own throats, there are still the otherCenters\u2014all with their own leaders. No, gentlemen, the Invasion isdefinitely on.     Why don't you go invade somebody else? Magnan suggested. I couldname some very attractive prospects\u2014outside my sector, of course.     Hold everything, Retief said. I think we've got the basis of a dealhere....      V     At the head of a double column of gaudily caparisoned Qornt, Retiefand Magnan strolled across the ramp toward the bright tower of the CDTSector HQ. Ahead, gates opened, and a black Corps limousine emerged,flying an Ambassadorial flag under a plain square of white.     Curious, Magnan commented. I wonder what the significance of thewhite ensign might be?     Retief raised a hand. The column halted with a clash of accoutrementsand a rasp of Qornt boots. Retief looked back along the line. The highwhite sun flashed on bright silks, polished buckles, deep-dyed plumes,butts of pistols, the soft gleam of leather.     A brave show indeed, Magnan commented approvingly. I confess theidea has merit.     The limousine pulled up with a squeal of brakes, stood on two fat-tiredwheels, gyros humming softly. The hatch popped up. A portly diplomatstepped out.     Why, Ambassador Nitworth, Magnan glowed. This is very kind of you.     Keep cool, Magnan, Nitworth said in a strained voice. We'll attemptto get you out of this.     He stepped past Magnan's out-stretched hand and looked hesitantly atthe ramrod-straight line of Qornt, eighty-five strong\u2014and beyond, atthe eighty-five tall Qornt dreadnaughts.     Good afternoon, sir ... ah, Your Excellency, Nitworth said, blinkingup at the leading Qornt. You are Commander of the Strike Force, Iassume?     Nope, the Qornt said shortly.     I ... ah ... wish to request seventy-two hours in which to evacuateHeadquarters, Nitworth plowed on.     Mr. Ambassador. Retief said. This\u2014     Don't panic, Retief. I'll attempt to secure your release, Nitworthhissed over his shoulder. Now\u2014     You will address our leader with more respect! the tall Qornt hooted,eyeing Nitworth ominously from eleven feet up.     Oh, yes indeed, sir ... your Excellency ... Commander. Now, about theinvasion\u2014     Mr. Secretary, Magnan tugged at Nitworth's sleeve.     In heaven's name, permit me to negotiate in peace! Nitworth snapped.He rearranged his features. Now your Excellency, we've arranged toevacuate Smorbrod, of course, just as you requested\u2014     Requested? the Qornt honked.     Ah ... demanded, that is. Quite rightly of course. Ordered.Instructed. And, of course, we'll be only too pleased to follow anyother instructions you might have.     You don't quite get the big picture, Mr. Secretary, Retief said.This isn't\u2014     Silence, confound you! Nitworth barked. The leading Qornt looked atRetief. He nodded. Two bony hands shot out, seized Nitworth and stuffeda length of bright pink silk into his mouth, then spun him around andheld him facing Retief.     If you don't mind my taking this opportunity to brief you, Mr.Ambassador, Retief said blandly. I think I should mention that thisisn't an invasion fleet. These are the new recruits for the PeaceEnforcement Corps.     Magnan stepped forward, glanced at the gag in Ambassador Nitworth'smouth, hesitated, then cleared his throat. We felt, he said, thatthe establishment of a Foreign Brigade within the P. E. Corps structurewould provide the element of novelty the Department has requestedin our recruiting, and at the same time would remove the stigma ofTerrestrial chauvinism from future punitive operations.     Nitworth stared, eyes bulging. He grunted, reaching for the gag, caughtthe Qornt's eye on him, dropped his hands to his sides.     I suggest we get the troops in out of the hot sun, Retief said.Magnan edged close. What about the gag? he whispered.     Let's leave it where it is for a while, Retief murmured. It may saveus a few concessions.  "

        "Query": "Can you give me a summary of The Monster Maker's storyline?",
        "Summary_1": "\u201cClick\u201d Hathaway, a photographer, is on a spaceship with \u201cIrish\u201d Marnagan, the ship\u2019s pilot, as the ship is hit by a meteor and crashes\n\nAfter the crash, Hathaway jokes about getting a shot of Marnagan emerging from the wreckage, which Marnagan takes offense to, pointing out he could have been dead; Hathaway says he took it for granted that Marnagan would survive.  Marnagan states that they could walk the entire diameter of the planet they are on in four hours, but Hathaway points out that he has only an hour of oxygen.  Hathaway states that he has photo evidence that the meteor that hit their ship was thrown at them, probably by Gunther, the person Marnagan is trying to capture, but Marnagan redirects their priorities to oxygen, food, and a way back to earth.\n\nAs they walk in search of help, they notice that there is human-made gravity on the planet.  Immediately after making that discovery, they encounter an enormous herd of dangerous beasts.  When Marnagan discovers his gun is ineffective as a weapon, they flee to a nearby cave for protection, as the cave is too small for the beasts to enter.\n\nMarnagan asks Hathaway to take a picture of him with the beasts.  Hathaway snaps several pictures of Marnagan posing at a safe distance.  Hathaway then says that between the \u201cnatural\u201d meteors, gravity, and beasts, their crash will look accidental rather than like murder.  He shows Marnagan the pictures he shot, intending to use the beasts as part of his argument, but Marnagan protests that his film is \u201clousy\u201d as only Marnagan, appears in the shots and not the beasts.  When Hathaway confirms this is so, he is insistent that the film cannot lie.  If the beasts do not appear in the photos, they don\u2019t exist.\n\nWhen they emerge from the cave and the animals are gone, the men are at first elated.  Hathaway quickly realizes, though, that with their oxygen running low and limiting the time they have to find Gunther\u2019s base and fresh oxygen, they must get the beasts to return so that they can follow the beasts to their source--Gunther\u2019s base.\n\nThe men concentrate on the beasts and the beasts reappear; Hathaway and Marnagan locate a source point and head toward it.  Marnagan believes he is being attacked by a beast, but when Hathaway reminds him the monsters are fake, Marnagan is able to resist the telepathic message.  Marnagan enters the cave where it appears the animals are coming from and finds an air-lock door and a tunnel before he is captured by a guard.  He tells the guard his partner is dead.\n\nHathaway creeps in through the air-lock door to see Marnagan held at gunpoint.  Hathaway fools the guard into believing he is armed, takes his gun, and gets the guard to guide him and Marnagan to oxygen.  They then use photos of Marnagan, inserted in the telepath machines, to take over Gunther\u2019s fortress and capture him.  The story ends with Hathaway taking a triumphant posed picture of Marnagan.",
        "Summary_2": "Click Hathaway and Irish Marnagan are on patrol, looking for the space pirate Gunther that no one has ever seen before. Marnagan is an Interplanetary Patrolman from Luna Base who hired Hathaway to travel with him and film the pirate's capture. He wants to use the film footage to teach Junior Patrolmen how to get out of difficult situations. While Hathaway is filming, a meteor strikes their spaceship, knocking it down to an asteroid. The ship splits open, so there is no way for them to leave the asteroid. They both have 60 minutes of oxygen remaining. At first, they think the meteor was an accident, but then Hathaway remembers that it was red-hot and glowing before it struck them, and he knows that meteors in space are never glowing hot. Hathaway is convinced that Gunther lobbed the meteor at them to make them crash. As they begin walking on the surface of the meteor, they notice a change in the gravity in one place and realize that they have stumbled upon Gunther\u2019s hideout. Then a horde of monsters comes charging at them, making Hathaway and Marnagan run for their lives and hide in a small cave. Marnagan fires his gun at the beasts, but it does not affect them.\n\nMarnagan has Hathaway film him facing the beasts. Hathaway has invented a film that develops itself when exposed to light. He pulls the film out of his camera for them to view, and both are surprised to find that the monsters are not on it. Hathaway thinks that the monsters are not real since they do not show up on the film. He believes they have just been tricked into thinking they are real. Marnagan agrees and decides to walk out among the monsters. When he does, the monsters disappear. Hathaway says that the monsters are still dangerous because as long as people think they are real, they might be frightened to death or commit suicide to avoid being caught by them. He also concludes that if they believe the monsters are real, they will return. \n\nBoth men say they believe in the monsters to draw them out again so that they can see where they come from. They find the opening to the hideout, and Marnagan goes in first since he has a gun, but a guard catches him. Hathaway hears the guard over the audio system and sneaks up on the guard and threatens him to make him throw down his weapon. Marnagan and Hathaway find the telepathic station from which the images of the monsters are sent. Hathaway feeds his film into the telepathic station. When he confronts Gunther, the telepathic station shows an image of 500 Interplanetary Patrolmen marching toward them, but it\u2019s really just Marnagan and 499 images of him. The guards run away as Hathaway films them. Since the film won\u2019t record the telepathic images, it will look like Marnagan singlehandedly fought off all of Gunther\u2019s guards.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Click Hathaway has been hired to document the journey that \u201cIrish\u201d Marnagan has embarked upon to kill Gunther, a space pirate. Their ship is struck by meteors and lands on an asteroid, where they begin to realize they are being manipulated by someone, most likely Gunther himself. They notice that someone has created a \u201csuper-gravity\u201d setup that pulled their ship down, and after being chased into a cave by monstrous beasts they realize via Hathaway\u2019s self-developing film that the creatures only exist in their minds. Once they figure this out they are able to follow the monsters to their source: Gunther\u2019s fortress inside the asteroid. \n\nMarnagan enters first and is caught by a guard, and tells the guard that his partner is already dead while Hathaway sneaks in. They capture and truss up the guard and replace their oxygen tanks before heading into the fortress proper. They piece together how Gunther has been pulling in ships (including their own) to steal their cargo, and using the telepathic creatures to scare off tourists and inadvertent travelers. They find the machine used to create the creatures and concoct a plan. \n\nHathaway walks toward what he presumes to be Gunther\u2019s residence and allows himself to be captured. He is brought to Gunther, who calls his bluff when Hathaway tells him that patrols have arrived. They hear screams from the plaza and look out to see a line of five-hundred patrolmen. Gunther orders his troops to hold the patrolmen back and they stay to fight, but are vastly outnumbered and easily defeated by the patrolmen. During the battle, Gunther starts shooting a pistol wildly and Hathaway knocks him out with a paperweight before Marnagan enters the building. \n\nWe learn that the line of patrolmen was made up of duplicates of Marnagan created by the telepathic sending station that created the monsters. As the story closes, Marnagan is tracking down the remaining pirates while Hathaway follows him to get some great footage. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Interplanetary Patrolman Irish Marnagan and photographer Click Hathaway are on a mission to apprehend a space pirate named Gunther, when a meteor hits their ship, and they crash-land. Marnagan had hired Click to document his capture of Gunther as an educational video for Junior Patrolmen. Click realizes they have an hour left in their oxygen supplies, so they set about to find food, air, and a way to return to Earth. Click suspects the crash was engineered by Gunther himself. As they walk along the meteor, they begin to realize gravity behaves strangely there, and Click wonders if that, too, has been engineered by Gunther. Before he can think on this too deeply, they encounter a horde of monsters of all shapes and sizes coming for them over a hill. Marnagan shoots at them, but they are immune to his shots. Marnagan and Click hide in a nearby cave to hatch a plan. Marnagan poses for some pictures pretending to battle the monsters. Click posits a theory that the strange gravity and meteor attack they\u2019d encountered earlier was Gunther\u2019s way of crashing ships on his asteroid\u2014an effective weapon in an age with primitive space-battle weaponry and a good way to gather supplies while being short on crew. The monsters had been sent to finish the job. When they sit down to examine Click\u2019s footage, they see that there are no monsters in any of the shots. This leads Click to develop another theory\u2014if the monsters weren\u2019t really there, then neither were they! Marnagan tests his theory by walking out of the cave into the middle of the monsters. Because he believes they do not exist, they vanish completely, and the two men realize Gunther\u2019s plan to scare to death anyone who might happen upon his asteroid. At the same time, they are running out of oxygen, and Click says they must bring the monsters back in order to follow them back to Gunther\u2019s base. They bring them back by believing in them, but protect themselves by not being afraid of them. They fight their way through the fake monsters until Marnagan discovers a door leading to a tunnel, and he drops into it. A guard stops Marnagan, and Click uses his camera as a fake weapon to trick the guard into dropping his weapon. After procuring oxygen tanks, Click and Marnagan discover the telepathic sending station from which Gunther transmitted the monster images to ward off visitors. Click has the idea to use this technology to their advantage and trick Gunther and his men into believing the entire Patrol has come to the asteroid. Marnagan stays behind to imitate the 500-man Patrol, while Click goes to Gunther\u2019s hideout to film the fake Patrol\u2019s attack. Marnagan\u2019s fake Patrol defeats Gunther\u2019s men, Click disables Gunther, and Marnagan realizes that Click\u2019s film portrays him as a hero (the film did not capture the telepathically-induced Patrol\u2014only Marnagan storming their ranks). Marnagan gets his educational video, and Click gets his news headline.",
        "Article": "What do you      do     ? Steffens asked.     Elb replied quickly, with characteristic simplicity: We can do verylittle. A certain amount of physical knowledge was imparted to us atbirth by the Makers. We spend the main part of our time expanding thatknowledge wherever possible. We have made some progress in the naturalsciences, and some in mathematics. Our purpose in being, you see, isto serve the Makers. Any ability we can acquire will make us that muchmore fit to serve when the Makers return.     When they return? It had not occurred to Steffens until now that therobots expected the Makers to do so.     Elb regarded him out of the band of the circling eye. I see you hadsurmised that the Makers were not coming back.     If the robot could have laughed, Steffens thought it would have, then.But it just stood there, motionless, its tone politely emphatic.     It has always been our belief that the Makers would return. Why elsewould we have been built?     Steffens thought the robot would go on, but it didn't. The question, toElb, was no question at all.     Although Steffens knew already what the robot could not possibly haveknown\u2014that the Makers were gone and would never come back\u2014he was along time understanding. What he did was push this speculation into theback of his mind, to keep it from Elb. He had no desire to destroy afaith.     But it created a problem in him. He had begun to picture for Elb thestructure of human society, and the robot\u2014a machine which did not eator sleep\u2014listened gravely and tried to understand. One day Steffensmentioned God.     God? the robot repeated without comprehension. What is God?     Steffens explained briefly, and the robot answered:     It is a matter which has troubled us. We thought at first that youwere the Makers returning\u2014 Steffens remembered the brief lapse, theseeming disappointment he had sensed\u2014but then we probed your mindsand found that you were not, that you were another kind of being,unlike either the Makers or ourselves. You were not even\u2014 Elb caughthimself\u2014you did not happen to be telepaths. Therefore we troubledover who made you. We did detect the word 'Maker' in your theology,but it seemed to have a peculiar\u2014 Elb paused for a long while\u2014anuntouchable, intangible meaning which varies among you.     Steffens understood. He nodded.     The Makers were the robots' God, were all the God they needed. TheMakers had built them, the planet, the universe. If he were to ask themwho made the Makers, it would be like their asking him who made God.     It was an ironic parallel, and he smiled to himself.     But on that planet, it was the last time he smiled.   <doc-sep> After a while, convinced that there was no danger, Steffens had theship brought down. When the crew came out of the airlock, they were metby the robots, and each man found himself with a robot at his side,humbly requesting to be of service. There were literally thousands ofthe robots now, come from all over the barren horizon. The mass of themstood apart, immobile on a plain near the ship, glinting in the sunlike a vast, metallic field of black wheat.     The robots had obviously been built to serve. Steffens began to      feel     their pleasure, to sense it in spite of the blank, expressionlessfaces. They were almost like children in their eagerness, yet they werestill reserved. Whoever had built them, Steffens thought in wonder, hadbuilt them well.     Ball came to join Steffens, staring at the robots through the clearplastic of his helmet with baffledly widened eyes. A robot moved outfrom the mass in the field, allied itself to him. The first to speakhad remained with Steffens.     Realizing that the robot could hear every word he was saying, Ballwas for a while apprehensive. But the sheer unreality of standing andtalking with a multi-limbed, intelligent hunk of dead metal upon thebare rock of a dead, ancient world, the unreality of it slowly died.It was impossible not to like the things. There was something in theirvery lines which was pleasant and relaxing.     Their builders, Steffens thought, had probably thought of that, too.     There's no harm in them, said Ball at last, openly, not minding ifthe robots heard. They seem actually glad we're here. My God, whoeverheard of a robot being glad?     Steffens, embarrassed, spoke quickly to the nearest mechanical: I hopeyou will forgive us our curiosity, but\u2014yours is a remarkable race. Wehave never before made contact with a race like yours. It was saidhaltingly, but it was the best he could do.     The robot made a singularly human nodding motion of its head.     I perceive that the nature of our construction is unfamiliar to you.Your question is whether or not we are entirely 'mechanical.' I amnot exactly certain as to what the word 'mechanical' is intended toconvey\u2014I would have to examine your thought more fully\u2014but I believethat there is fundamental similarity between our structures.     The robot paused. Steffens had a distinct impression that it wasdisconcerted.     I must tell you, the thing went on, that we ourselves are\u2014curious.It stopped suddenly, struggling with a word it could not comprehend.Steffens waited, listening with absolute interest. It said at length:     We know of only two types of living structure. Ours, which is largelymetallic, and that of the      Makers     , which would appear to be somewhatmore like yours. I am not a\u2014doctor\u2014and therefore cannot acquaint youwith the specific details of the Makers' composition, but if you areinterested I will have a doctor brought forward. It will be glad to beof assistance.     It was Steffens' turn to struggle, and the robot waited patiently whileBall and the second robot looked on in silence. The Makers, obviously,were whoever or whatever had built the robots, and the doctors,Steffens decided, were probably just that\u2014doctor-robots, designedspecifically to care for the apparently flesh-bodies of the Makers.     The efficiency of the things continued to amaze him, but the questionhe had been waiting to ask came out now with a rush:     Can you tell us where the Makers are?     Both robots stood motionless. It occurred to Steffens that he couldn'treally be sure which was speaking. The voice that came to him spokewith difficulty.     The Makers\u2014are not here.     Steffens stared in puzzlement. The robot detected his confusion andwent on:     The Makers have gone away. They have been gone for a very long time.     Could that be      pain     in its voice, Steffens wondered, and then thespectre of the ruined cities rose harsh in his mind.     War. The Makers had all been killed in that war. And these had not beenkilled.     He tried to grasp it, but he couldn't. There were robots here in themidst of a radiation so lethal that      nothing     ,      nothing     could live;robots on a dead planet, living in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide.     The carbon dioxide brought him up sharp.     If there had been life here once, there would have been plant life aswell, and therefore oxygen. If the war had been so long ago that thefree oxygen had since gone out of the atmosphere\u2014good God, how oldwere the robots? Steffens looked at Ball, then at the silent robots,then out across the field to where the rest of them stood. The blackwheat. Steffens felt a deep chill.     Were they immortal?   <doc-sep> Would you like to see a doctor?     Steffens jumped at the familiar words, then realized to what the robotwas referring.     No, not yet, he said, thank you. He swallowed hard as the robotscontinued waiting patiently.     Could you tell me, he said at last, how old you are? Individually?     By your reckoning, said his robot, and paused to make thecalculation, I am forty-four years, seven months, and eighteen days ofage, with ten years and approximately nine months yet to be alive.     Steffens tried to understand that.     It would perhaps simplify our conversations, said the robot, ifyou were to refer to me by a name, as is your custom. Using thefirst\u2014letters\u2014of my designation, my name would translate as Elb.     Glad to meet you, Steffens mumbled.     You are called 'Stef,' said the robot obligingly. Then it added,pointing an arm at the robot near Ball: The age of\u2014Peb\u2014is seventeenyears, one month and four days. Peb has therefore remaining somethirty-eight years.     Steffens was trying to keep up. Then the life span was obviously aboutfifty-five years. But the cities, and the carbon dioxide? The robot,Elb, had said that the Makers were similar to him, and therefore oxygenand plant life would have been needed. Unless\u2014     He remembered the buildings on Tyban IV.     Unless the Makers had not come from this planet at all.     His mind helplessly began to revolve. It was Ball who restored order.     Do you build yourselves? the exec asked.     Peb answered quickly, that faint note of happiness again apparent, asif the robot was glad for the opportunity of answering.     No, we do not build ourselves. We are made by the\u2014 another pause fora word\u2014by the      Factory     .     The Factory?     Yes. It was built by the Makers. Would you care to see it?     Both of the Earthmen nodded dumbly.     Would you prefer to use your\u2014skiff? It is quite a long way from here.     It was indeed a long way, even by skiff. Some of the Aliencon crew wentalong with them. And near the edge of the twilight zone, on the otherside of the world, they saw the Factory outlined in the dim light ofdusk. A huge, fantastic block, wrought of gray and cloudy metal, lay ina valley between two worn mountains. Steffens went down low, circlingin the skiff, stared in awe at the size of the building. Robots movedoutside the thing, little black bugs in the distance\u2014moving aroundtheir birthplace.  "

        "Query": "How does Hathaway's occupation contribute to the plot of The Monster Maker?",
        "Summary_1": "Hathaway\u2019s photography is the reason he is initially selected to go along on the mission to capture the outlaw Gunther.  Unlike the character Marnagan, who is repeatedly described as physically very large and strong, Hathaway is not on the mission for his physical prowess, but is there to document Marnagan\u2019s capture of Gunther for training of Junior Patrolmen in the future  Hathaway has also invented self-developing film which seems like a cross between Polaroid pictures and a digital camera, as it has to be put into a micro-viewer at the camera\u2019s base to be seen.  This film allows Hathaway and Marnagan, the active partner on the mission, to view Hathaway\u2019s pictures immediately and notice the absence of beasts from Hathaway\u2019s pictures.  This allows for the revelation that the beasts are telepathic projections into the men\u2019s minds and sets up the final \u201cbattle\u201d in the story, in which telepathic projections of Marnagan, created by the same projectors that created the beasts, along with photos from Hathaway\u2019s film, defeat Gunther\u2019s guards and enable Hathaway and Marnagan to capture Gunther.  While nothing could have been accomplished without Marnagan, Hathaway\u2019s photography is essential to the successful completion of the mission.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Hathaway is a filmmaker and has been hired by Marnagan to accompany him on his trip to try to track down the pirate Gunther. Marnagan wants the encounter on film so that it can be used to train Junior Patrolmen. Throughout the story, Hathaway films several incidents that prove to be useful later. He is filming the meteor when it strikes their spaceship, and by reviewing the footage, he realizes that the meteor is glowing hot, which is never the case with meteors in space, and concludes that it must have been aimed at them. After he films the monsters and reviews his film, he realizes that the monsters are not real, which enables Marnagan and Hathaway to exit the cave where they are hiding. Later, when a guard has Marnagan, Hathaway holds his camera out like a weapon to make the guard drop his gun. Hathaway\u2019s profession also helps him think of a way to use the telepathic station against Gunther\u2019s guards when he films Marnagan in various movements and then feeds his film into the machine to become thought emanations. The images make the guards believe that 500 Interplanetary Patrolmen are on the asteroid and marching toward them. The guards panic and run because they think they are outnumbered.",
        "Summary_3": "Click Hathaway is a photographer, which is very significant to the story for several reasons. First, it is the reason he is on the voyage, having been hired by Marnagan to document his takedown of Gunther. Even more importantly, however, it is Hathaway\u2019s constant photo taking combined with his use of the self-developing film he invented that reverses the fortunes of Click and Irish and allows them to succeed. After they try to distract themselves from their terror by taking a fun photo montage of Marnagan and the monsters hunting them, Hathaway realizes that the monsters don\u2019t show up on the photos and surmises that they aren\u2019t real, which allows them to enact their plan. After they trick Gunther and his forces, Hathaway continues to document Marnagan as he gleefully takes out the pirates. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Click Hathaway is a photography and filmmaker with Cosmic Films, responsible for making news reels. He is commissioned by Marnagan to accompany him on his mission to apprehend the space pirate Gunther. Click takes a variety of shots of Marnagan at key points throughout their journey\u2014from the time they are hit by Gunther\u2019s rogue meteor to when they take refuge from the pursuant monsters in a cave and making their plan. Click\u2019s purpose is to help Marnagan make an educational video he can use to train those in the Junior Patrol on how to handle difficult situations. For his own purposes, Click would like an exciting news reel to show Cosmic Films and hopefully boost his career. After Click deduces the monsters are a telepathic construction of some device of Gunther\u2019s creation, he and Marnagan are able to use this knowledge to penetrate Gunther\u2019s hideout and use the technology against his men by making them believe Marnagan is the 500-men Patrol coming to defeat them. Click uses this great battle to make an exciting news reel, which in turn gives Marnagan the footage he needs to make his educational video.",

[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Planet Stories Spring 1944.

Click Hathaway's camera was loaded and he stood there listeningto it rack-spin film between his fingers, and he knew he was getting adamned sweet picture of everything that was happening.     The picture of Marnagan hunched huge over the control-console,wrenching levers, jamming studs with freckled fists. And out in thedark of the fore-part there was space and a star-sprinkling and thismeteor coming like blazing fury.     Click Hathaway felt the ship move under him like a sensitive animal'sskin. And then the meteor hit. It made a spiked fist and knocked therear-jets flat, and the ship spun like a cosmic merry-go-round.     There was plenty of noise. Too damned much. Hathaway only knew he waspicked up and hurled against a lever-bank, and that Marnagan wasn'tlong in following, swearing loud words. Click remembered hanging on tohis camera and gritting to keep holding it. What a sweet shot that hadbeen of the meteor! A sweeter one still of Marnagan beating hell out ofthe controls and keeping his words to himself until just now.     It got quiet. It got so quiet you could almost hear the asteroidsrushing up, cold, blue and hard. You could hear your heart kicking atom-tom between your sick stomach and your empty lungs.     Stars, asteroids revolved. Click grabbed Marnagan because he was thenearest thing, and held on. You came hunting for a space-raider and youended up cradled in a slab-sized Irishman's arms, diving at a hunk ofmetal death. What a fade-out!     Irish! he heard himself say. Is this IT?     Is this      what     ? yelled Marnagan inside his helmet.     Is this where the Big Producer yells CUT!?     Marnagan fumed. I'll die when I'm damned good and ready. And when I'mready I'll inform you and you can picture me profile for Cosmic Films!     They both waited, thrust against the shipside and held by a hand ofgravity; listening to each other's breathing hard in the earphones.     The ship struck, once. Bouncing, it struck again. It turned end overand stopped. Hathaway felt himself grabbed; he and Marnagan rattledaround\u2014human dice in a croupier's cup. The shell of the ship burst,air and energy flung out.     Hathaway screamed the air out of his lungs, but his brain was thinkingquick crazy, unimportant things. The best scenes in life never reachfilm, or an audience. Like this one, dammit! Like      this     one! Hisbrain spun, racketing like the instantaneous, flicking motions of hiscamera.   <doc-sep> That was the sweetest shot Hathaway ever took. Marnagan and themonsters!     Only now it was only Marnagan.     No more monsters.     Marnagan smiled a smile broader than his shoulders. Hey, Click, lookat me! I'm in one piece. Why, hell, the damned things turned tail andran away!     Ran, hell! cried Hathaway, rushing out, his face flushed andanimated. They just plain vanished. They were only imaginativefigments!     And to think we let them hole us in that way, Click Hathaway, youcoward!     Smile when you say that, Irish.     Sure, and ain't I always smilin'? Ah, Click boy, are them tears inyour sweet grey eyes?     Damn, swore the photographer, embarrassedly. Why don't they putwindow-wipers in these helmets?     I'll take it up with the Board, lad.     Forget it. I was so blamed glad to see your homely carcass in onehunk, I couldn't help\u2014Look, now, about Gunther. Those animals are partof his set-up. Explorers who land here inadvertently, are chased backinto their ships, forced to take off. Tourists and the like. Nothingsuspicious about animals. And if the tourists don't leave, the animalskill them.     Shaw, now. Those animals can't kill.     Think not, Mr. Marnagan? As long as we believed in them they couldhave frightened us to death, forced us, maybe, to commit suicide. Ifthat isn't being dangerous\u2014     The Irishman whistled.     But, we've got to      move     , Irish. We've got twenty minutes of oxygen.In that time we've got to trace those monsters to their source,Gunther's Base, fight our way in, and get fresh oxy-cannisters. Clickattached his camera to his mid-belt. Gunther probably thinks we'redead by now. Everyone else's been fooled by his playmates; they neverhad a chance to disbelieve them.     If it hadn't been for you taking them pictures, Click\u2014     Coupled with your damned stubborn attitude about the accident\u2014 Clickstopped and felt his insides turning to water. He shook his head andfelt a film slip down over his eyes. He spread his legs out to steadyhimself, and swayed. I\u2014I don't think my oxygen is as full as yours.This excitement had me double-breathing and I feel sick.     Marnagan's homely face grimaced in sympathy. Hold tight, Click. Theguy that invented these fish-bowls didn't provide for a sick stomach.     Hold tight, hell, let's move. We've got to find where those animalscame from! And the only way to do that is to get the animals to comeback!     Come back? How?     They're waiting, just outside the aura of our thoughts, and if webelieve in them again, they'll return.     Marnagan didn't like it. Won't\u2014won't they kill us\u2014if they come\u2014ifwe believe in 'em?     Hathaway shook a head that was tons heavy and weary. Not if we believein them to a      certain point     . Psychologically they can both be seen andfelt. We only want to      see     them coming at us again.           Do     we, now?     With twenty minutes left, maybe less\u2014     All right, Click, let's bring 'em back. How do we do it?     Hathaway fought against the mist in his eyes. Just think\u2014I will seethe monsters again. I will see them again and I will not feel them.Think it over and over.     Marnagan's hulk stirred uneasily. And\u2014what if I forget to rememberall that? What if I get excited...?     Hathaway didn't answer. But his eyes told the story by just looking atIrish.     Marnagan cursed. All right, lad. Let's have at it!     The monsters returned.   <doc-sep> Click shrugged. Still doubt it? Okay. Look. He tapped his camera anda spool popped out onto his gloved palm. Holding it up, he strippedit out to its full twenty inch length, held it to the light while itdeveloped, smiling. It was one of his best inventions. Self-developingfilm. The first light struck film-surface, destroyed one chemical,leaving imprints; the second exposure simply hardened, secured theimpressions. Quick stuff.     Inserting the film-tongue into a micro-viewer in the camera's base,Click handed the whole thing over. Look.     Marnagan put the viewer up against the helmet glass, squinted. Ah,Click. Now, now. This is one lousy film you invented.     Huh?     It's a strange process'll develop my picture and ignore the asteroidmonsters complete.     What!     Hathaway grabbed the camera, gasped, squinted, and gasped again:Pictures in montage; Marnagan sitting down, chatting conversationallywith      nothing     ; Marnagan shooting his gun at      nothing     ; Marnaganpretending to be happy in front of      nothing     .     Then, closeup\u2014of\u2014NOTHING!     The monsters had failed to image the film. Marnagan was there, his hairlike a red banner, his freckled face with the blue eyes bright in it.Maybe\u2014     Hathaway said it, loud: Irish! Irish! I think I see a way out of thismess! Here\u2014     He elucidated it over and over again to the Patrolman. About the film,the beasts, and how the film couldn't be wrong. If the film said themonsters weren't there, they weren't there.     Yeah, said Marnagan. But step outside this cave\u2014     If my theory is correct I'll do it, unafraid, said Click.     Marnagan scowled. You sure them beasts don't radiate ultra-violet orinfra-red or something that won't come out on film?     Nuts! Any color      we     see, the camera sees. We've been fooled.     Hey, where      you     going? Marnagan blocked Hathaway as the smaller mantried pushing past him.     Get out of the way, said Hathaway.     Marnagan put his big fists on his hips. If anyone is going anywhere,it'll be me does the going.     I can't let you do that, Irish.     Why not?     You'd be going on my say-so.     Ain't your say-so good enough for me?     Yes. Sure. Of course. I guess\u2014     If you say them animals ain't there, that's all I need. Now, standaside, you film-developing flea, and let an Irishman settle theirbones. He took an unnecessary hitch in trousers that didn't existexcept under an inch of porous metal plate. Your express purpose onthis voyage, Hathaway, is taking films to be used by the Patrol laterfor teaching Junior Patrolmen how to act in tough spots. First-handeducation. Poke another spool of film in that contraption and give meprofile a scan. This is lesson number seven: Daniel Walks Into TheLion's Den.     Irish, I\u2014     Shut up and load up.     Hathaway nervously loaded the film-slot, raised it.     Ready, Click?     I\u2014I guess so, said Hathaway. And remember, think it hard, Irish.Think it hard. There aren't any animals\u2014     Keep me in focus, lad.     All the way, Irish.     What do they say...? Oh, yeah. Action. Lights. Camera!     Marnagan held his gun out in front of him and still smiling took one,two, three, four steps out into the outside world. The monsters werewaiting for him at the fifth step. Marnagan kept walking.     Right out into the middle of them....  "

        "Query": "Can you describe the connection between Hathaway and Marnagan in The Monster Maker?",
        "Summary_1": "Despite their clear differences, Hathaway and Marnagan are a solid team who work well together and depend on each other.  We first see this in the opening scene of the story where Hathaway is physically clinging to Marnagan in his distress during the crash sequence.  After the crash, Hathaway is more concerned with taking photos of Marnagan emerging from the crash than helping him emerge from the rubble, not because he doesn\u2019t care about his companion, but because he sees his companion as so strong, it doesn\u2019t occur to him to be concerned for his physical safety.  This points to one of their key differences--while Marnagan is immediately concerned for Hathaway\u2019s safety and assumes Hathaway would reciprocate, Hathaway sees Marnagan as much stronger than himself, nearly invulnerable.\n\nWe see Hathaway and Marnagan\u2019s collaborative relationship continue when they are faced with the beasts.  They are both afraid; Hathaway is the first to spot the secure hiding place of the cave and hails Marnagan to run there.  Marnagan then proposes that he pose \u201cwith\u201d the beasts--standing at a safe distance with them in the background--and Hathaway agrees.  They continue to argue about what to do while Hathaway develops the film as part of his argument.  When Hathaway presents the developed film as evidence, Marnagan teases him about his invention being \u201clousy\u201d, as only he (Marnagan) shows in the photos, but the monsters do not.  This joke sets up Hathaway\u2019s realization that the beasts are telepathic projections rather than physical beings, leading the men to debate which of them will lead the hunt for oxygen.  While Hathaway knows his partner is physically stronger and he is already suffering from oxygen deprivation, he doesn\u2019t want to risk Marnagan\u2019s safety if his deduction proves wrong.  Marnagan, however, shows his trust in Hathaway by insisting that he (Marnagan) lead, confident that if Hathaway says the monsters aren\u2019t there, they are indeed not.\n\nWhen Marnagan briefly succumbs to the telepathic illusion of the beasts, Hathaway is able to talk him down.  Just by listening to Hathaway\u2019s words, Marnagan is able to convince himself again that the beasts are not real.  Marnagan then convinces the guard he encounters that Hathaway died in the ship crash, allowing Hathaway to sneak in, capture the guard, and get both the men oxygen.  They use their teamwork in a last instance to defeat the principal antagonist of the story, Gunther.  Hathaway is captured by more of Gunther\u2019s guards and taken to him, but is already prepared.  He shows Gunther that Gunther\u2019s men are being overwhelmed and defeated by five hundred armed Patrol men, causing Gunther to pull out a weapon and fire wildly until Hathaway knocks him unconscious.  We then are told that the \u201cfive hundred Patrol men\u201d are telepathic illusions of Marnagan projected by the same projectors that created the images of the beasts, supplied with photos of Marnagan shot by Hathaway.  Once again their teamwork proves crucial to the success of the mission.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Marnagan hired Hathaway to film his search for the elusive pirate Gunther. Marnagan plans to use the film to train Junior Patrolmen how to get out of a difficult situation. The two men are also friends who joke with each other. When Marnagan points out that he could have been killed in the crash, Hathaway frowns and turns pale. When Hathaway first speculates that Gunther caused the meteor to hit their spaceship, Marnagan isn\u2019t convinced that is true, but as they begin making discoveries about the asteroid\u2019s gravity and monsters, Marnagan trusts Hathaway\u2019s theories enough to leave the cave and walk among the monsters. When Marnagan returns unscathed, Hathaway breaks down in tears of relief to see that he is safe. Later, when a guard is holding Marnagan at gunpoint, Hathaway risks his life to save Marnagan by using his camera as a pretend weapon to take the guard\u2019s weapon. He then forces the guard to drag Marnagan, unconscious from lack of oxygen, to get a replacement oxygen tank. The two men also compliment each other when they defeat Gunther and his men.",
        "Summary_3": "At the beginning of the story, Hathaway and Marnagan are colleagues; Marnagan has hired Hathaway to document his mission to hunt down Gunther. As the story goes on, they become very dependent on one another in order to survive. They both try to put themselves in harm\u2019s way in order to protect the other (Hathaway wanting to leave the cave first in case the monsters are real, Marnagan telling the guard that the monsters already killed his partner, etc.) multiple times and value the contributions the other makes to their plans. The events of the story bring them much closer, and they effectively save each other\u2019s lives. \n",

Together, they seek out Gunther the space pirate and Click documents the journey. Their relationship is mutually beneficial\u2014Marnagan is the brawn, and Click is the brain. They work together to escape the monsters, and, ultimately, to defeat Gunther and his men and procure the footage both of them want for their individual purposes.

You came hunting for a space-raider and youended up cradled in a slab-sized Irishman's arms, diving at a hunk ofmetal death. What a fade-out!     Irish! he heard himself say. Is this IT?     Is this      what     ? yelled Marnagan inside his helmet.     Is this where the Big Producer yells CUT!?     Marnagan fumed. I'll die when I'm damned good and ready. And when I'mready I'll inform you and you can picture me profile for Cosmic Films!     They both waited, thrust against the shipside and held by a hand ofgravity; listening to each other's breathing hard in the earphones.     The ship struck, once. Bouncing, it struck again. It turned end overand stopped. Hathaway felt himself grabbed; he and Marnagan rattledaround\u2014human dice in a croupier's cup. The shell of the ship burst,air and energy flung out.     Hathaway screamed the air out of his lungs, but his brain was thinkingquick crazy, unimportant things. The best scenes in life never reachfilm, or an audience. Like this one, dammit! Like      this     one! Hisbrain spun, racketing like the instantaneous, flicking motions of hiscamera.   <doc-sep> Click shrugged. Still doubt it? Okay. Look. He tapped his camera anda spool popped out onto his gloved palm. Holding it up, he strippedit out to its full twenty inch length, held it to the light while itdeveloped, smiling. It was one of his best inventions. Self-developingfilm. The first light struck film-surface, destroyed one chemical,leaving imprints; the second exposure simply hardened, secured theimpressions. Quick stuff.     Inserting the film-tongue into a micro-viewer in the camera's base,Click handed the whole thing over. Look.     Marnagan put the viewer up against the helmet glass, squinted. Ah,Click. Now, now. This is one lousy film you invented.     Huh?     It's a strange process'll develop my picture and ignore the asteroidmonsters complete.     What!     Hathaway grabbed the camera, gasped, squinted, and gasped again:Pictures in montage; Marnagan sitting down, chatting conversationallywith      nothing     ; Marnagan shooting his gun at      nothing     ; Marnaganpretending to be happy in front of      nothing     .     Then, closeup\u2014of\u2014NOTHING!     The monsters had failed to image the film. Marnagan was there, his hairlike a red banner, his freckled face with the blue eyes bright in it.Maybe\u2014     Hathaway said it, loud: Irish! Irish! I think I see a way out of thismess! Here\u2014     He elucidated it over and over again to the Patrolman. About the film,the beasts, and how the film couldn't be wrong. If the film said themonsters weren't there, they weren't there.     Yeah, said Marnagan. But step outside this cave\u2014     If my theory is correct I'll do it, unafraid, said Click.     Marnagan scowled. You sure them beasts don't radiate ultra-violet orinfra-red or something that won't come out on film?     Nuts! Any color      we     see, the camera sees. We've been fooled.     Hey, where      you     going? Marnagan blocked Hathaway as the smaller mantried pushing past him.     Get out of the way, said Hathaway.     Marnagan put his big fists on his hips. If anyone is going anywhere,it'll be me does the going.     I can't let you do that, Irish.     Why not?     You'd be going on my say-so.     Ain't your say-so good enough for me?     Yes. Sure. Of course. I guess\u2014     If you say them animals ain't there, that's all I need. Now, standaside, you film-developing flea, and let an Irishman settle theirbones. He took an unnecessary hitch in trousers that didn't existexcept under an inch of porous metal plate. Your express purpose onthis voyage, Hathaway, is taking films to be used by the Patrol laterfor teaching Junior Patrolmen how to act in tough spots. First-handeducation. Poke another spool of film in that contraption and give meprofile a scan. This is lesson number seven: Daniel Walks Into TheLion's Den.     Irish, I\u2014     Shut up and load up.     Hathaway nervously loaded the film-slot, raised it.     Ready, Click?     I\u2014I guess so, said Hathaway. And remember, think it hard, Irish.Think it hard. There aren't any animals\u2014     Keep me in focus, lad.     All the way, Irish.     What do they say...? Oh, yeah. Action. Lights. Camera!     Marnagan held his gun out in front of him and still smiling took one,two, three, four steps out into the outside world. The monsters werewaiting for him at the fifth step. Marnagan kept walking.     Right out into the middle of them....   <doc-sep> That was the sweetest shot Hathaway ever took. Marnagan and themonsters!     Only now it was only Marnagan.     No more monsters.     Marnagan smiled a smile broader than his shoulders. Hey, Click, lookat me! I'm in one piece. Why, hell, the damned things turned tail andran away!     Ran, hell! cried Hathaway, rushing out, his face flushed andanimated. They just plain vanished. They were only imaginativefigments!     And to think we let them hole us in that way, Click Hathaway, youcoward!     Smile when you say that, Irish.     Sure, and ain't I always smilin'? Ah, Click boy, are them tears inyour sweet grey eyes?     Damn, swore the photographer, embarrassedly. Why don't they putwindow-wipers in these helmets?     I'll take it up with the Board, lad.     Forget it. I was so blamed glad to see your homely carcass in onehunk, I couldn't help\u2014Look, now, about Gunther. Those animals are partof his set-up. Explorers who land here inadvertently, are chased backinto their ships, forced to take off. Tourists and the like. Nothingsuspicious about animals. And if the tourists don't leave, the animalskill them.     Shaw, now. Those animals can't kill.     Think not, Mr. Marnagan? As long as we believed in them they couldhave frightened us to death, forced us, maybe, to commit suicide. Ifthat isn't being dangerous\u2014     The Irishman whistled.     But, we've got to      move     , Irish. We've got twenty minutes of oxygen.In that time we've got to trace those monsters to their source,Gunther's Base, fight our way in, and get fresh oxy-cannisters. Clickattached his camera to his mid-belt. Gunther probably thinks we'redead by now. Everyone else's been fooled by his playmates; they neverhad a chance to disbelieve them.     If it hadn't been for you taking them pictures, Click\u2014     Coupled with your damned stubborn attitude about the accident\u2014 Clickstopped and felt his insides turning to water. He shook his head andfelt a film slip down over his eyes. He spread his legs out to steadyhimself, and swayed. I\u2014I don't think my oxygen is as full as yours.This excitement had me double-breathing and I feel sick.     Marnagan's homely face grimaced in sympathy. Hold tight, Click. Theguy that invented these fish-bowls didn't provide for a sick stomach.     Hold tight, hell, let's move. We've got to find where those animalscame from! And the only way to do that is to get the animals to comeback!     Come back? How?     They're waiting, just outside the aura of our thoughts, and if webelieve in them again, they'll return.     Marnagan didn't like it. Won't\u2014won't they kill us\u2014if they come\u2014ifwe believe in 'em?     Hathaway shook a head that was tons heavy and weary. Not if we believein them to a      certain point     . Psychologically they can both be seen andfelt. We only want to      see     them coming at us again.           Do     we, now?     With twenty minutes left, maybe less\u2014     All right, Click, let's bring 'em back. How do we do it?     Hathaway fought against the mist in his eyes. Just think\u2014I will seethe monsters again. I will see them again and I will not feel them.Think it over and over.     Marnagan's hulk stirred uneasily. And\u2014what if I forget to rememberall that? What if I get excited...?     Hathaway didn't answer. But his eyes told the story by just looking atIrish.     Marnagan cursed. All right, lad. Let's have at it!     The monsters returned.  "

        "Query": "How does the ship crash involving Hathaway and Marnagan in the beginning of The Monster Maker impact the rest of the plot?",
        "Summary_1": "The crash of Hathaway and Marnagan\u2019s ship is the precipitating event for the events that follow, but it is also more than that.  Hathaway states shortly after the crash that the meteor that hit their ship was deliberately aimed at them with force, based on it being \u201chot and glowing\u201d at the time of the collision.  Hathaway hypothesizes at that time that Gunther, the man Marnagan is trying to capture on their mission, had engineered the crash.  A short time later, when walking along the surface of the planet, Hathaway notices sudden weight loss.  After he and Marnagan test it and confirm that it really happened, they conclude that their ship was not only hit by a meteor, it was dragged down to the planet by an unnatural amount of gravity, more than the planet is generating.  They then meet horrifying, dangerous monsters, but these are revealed in short order to be telepathic projections.  They are able to dispel the images of the monsters by their own belief that the monsters are not really there, then summon them back by imagining that they are there, but that the monsters cannot harm them.  In this way, the monsters lead them to Gunther, who is captured when Marnagan and Hathaway use the telepathic projectors that generated the \u201cmonster\u201d images to generate hundreds of images of Marnagan, making it appear that there is an army ready to take over Gunther\u2019s base and capture or kill all his men.  All of this flows from the initial crash engineered by Gunther with the propelled meteor and the area of super-gravity that pulled the ship down to the planet.  Gunther hoped to make the ship disappear and Marnagan and Hathaway along with it.  Instead, they crashed on the single planet where they could find him and had to take on an immediate quest to search for him in order to survive, as they had limited oxygen and needed to find the only other humans on the planet in order to replenish their supply.",
        "Summary_2": "The crash in the opening scene sets up the conflict with Gunther in the climax of the story. Gunther is responsible for the meteor that strikes the spaceship and makes it crash on the asteroid. He is also responsible for the monsters that first terrify Hathaway and Marnagan and that later lead the men to his hideout inside the asteroid. Hathaway speculates that Gunther crashes or pulls ships onto his asteroid. Gunther is short on men, and space weapons are inaccurate, so he uses super-gravity to crash the ships. The people die from a lack of air or food or their injuries from the crash. Since there are no signs of weapons, if the Patrol ever shows up, it looks like the people died of accidental deaths rather than murder. The crash makes it possible for Marnagan to finally reach Gunter, a space pirate that no one has ever seen before.",
        "Summary_3": "The crash of Hathaway\u2019s and Marnagan\u2019s ship in the opening scene of the story is significant both because it brings them to the asteroid where Gunther is hiding, and because it helps them figure out how Gunther is stealing cargo. Their ship is brought down at great speed by meteorites that Gunther and his troops launch at it, and then pulled in by a super-gravity situation they have set up. Hathaway and Marnagan realize the gravity is at play when they seem to lose weight as they get further from the ship. Their own ship wreck experience points them toward discovering how to get to Gunther. \n",
        "Summary_4": "The crash at the beginning of the story is perpetuated by a meteor that Click later determines was sent as a projectile by Gunther himself. He presumes this was done in conjunction with the artificial gravity of the asteroid base in order to fell cargo ships to gather supplies for Gunther and his limited crew of fellow pirates. This crash sets in motion the action that forces Marnagan and Click to confront the monsters, whom Click soon realizes are telepathically imposed and not real at all. Because of this encounter with the monsters, Click discovers a way to defeat Gunther and his forces while dealing with limited resources and using his own technology against him. The crash also provides a dramatic moment in Click\u2019s film.",
        "Article": "They sat, staring at the monsters for about a minute. Hathaway feltfunny about something; didn't know what. Something about these monstersand Gunther and\u2014     Which one will you be having? asked Irish, casually. A red one or ablue one?     Hathaway laughed nervously. A pink one with yellow ruffles\u2014Good God,now you've got      me     doing it. Joking in the face of death.     Me father taught me; keep laughing and you'll have Irish luck.     That didn't please the photographer. I'm an Anglo-Swede, he pointedout.     Marnagan shifted uneasily. Here, now. You're doing nothing butsitting, looking like a little boy locked in a bedroom closet, so takeme a profile shot of the beasties and myself.     Hathaway petted his camera reluctantly. What in hell's the use? Allthis swell film shot. Nobody'll ever see it.     Then, retorted Marnagan, we'll develop it for our own benefit; whilewaitin' for the U.S. Cavalry to come riding over the hill to ourrescue!     Hathaway snorted. U.S. Cavalry.     Marnagan raised his proton-gun dramatically. Snap me this pose, hesaid. I paid your salary to trot along, photographing, we hoped,my capture of Gunther, now the least you can do is record peacenegotiations betwixt me and these pixies.     Marnagan wasn't fooling anybody. Hathaway knew the superficial palaverfor nothing but a covering over the fast, furious thinking runningaround in that red-cropped skull. Hathaway played the palaver, too, buthis mind was whirring faster than his camera as he spun a picture ofMarnagan standing there with a useless gun pointed at the animals.     Montage. Marnagan sitting, chatting at the monsters. Marnagan smilingfor the camera. Marnagan in profile. Marnagan looking grim, withoutmuch effort, for the camera. And then, a closeup of the thrashing deathwall that holed them in. Click took them all, those shots, not sayinganything. Nobody fooled nobody with this act. Death was near and theyhad sweaty faces, dry mouths and frozen guts.     When Click finished filming, Irish sat down to save oxygen, and used itup arguing about Gunther. Click came back at him:     Gunther drew us down here, sure as Ceres! That gravity change we feltback on that ridge, Irish; that proves it. Gunther's short on men. So,what's he do; he builds an asteroid-base, and drags ships down. Spacewar isn't perfect yet, guns don't prime true in space, trajectoryis lousy over long distances. So what's the best weapon, whichdispenses with losing valuable, rare ships and a small bunch of men?Super-gravity and a couple of well-tossed meteors. Saves all around.It's a good front, this damned iron pebble. From it, Gunther strikesunseen; ships simply crash, that's all. A subtle hand, with all aces.     Marnagan rumbled. Where is the dirty son, then!     He didn't have to appear, Irish. He sent\u2014them. Hathaway nodded atthe beasts. People crashing here die from air-lack, no food, or fromwounds caused at the crackup. If they survive all that\u2014the animalstend to them. It all looks like Nature was responsible. See how subtlehis attack is? Looks like accidental death instead of murder, if thePatrol happens to land and finds us. No reason for undue investigation,then.     I don't see no Base around.   <doc-sep>    The Monster Maker     By RAY BRADBURY     Get Gunther, the official orders read. It     was to laugh!

        "Query": "What role do the telepathic projectors play in The Monster Maker?",
        "Summary_1": "Telepathy plays an interesting role in this story.  Rather than telepathy being used by one character to discern the thoughts of another character, as is often the case, we instead have machines creating telepathic projections.  It is fitting, then, that since machines are creating the telepathic projections, a machine can also defeat them.  The camera does not \"see\" through interpreting images or trying to understand them.  It only records light and shadow.  For this reason, it remains unaffected by telepathy--it can only record what is there, not what is projected into the mind.\n\nHathaway and Marnagan become trapped in a small cave by what they believe are dangerous wild beasts.  Marnagan asks Hathaway to take his pictures as Marnagan poses against the backdrop of the beasts.  When Marnagan looks at the photos and complains that the beasts do not appear, Hathaway realizes that the beasts are not physically real, but only telepathic projections in the men's minds.  He and Marnagan are then able to dismiss the beasts and bring them back at will in order to let the projections lead them to their source.\n\nTelepathy plays a significant role again when Hathaway and Marnagan formulate a plan to capture Gunther, the person Marnagan is on a mission to capture and the man that caused their crash.  While the two of them could easily overpower Gunther if he were alone, there are at least fifty guards with him at his base.  Hathaway realizes they can photograph Marnagan in poses as though he's taking over the base and use those images in the telepathic projector against the guards and Gunther.  The telepathic projector turns one Marnagan into five hundred, allowing the two men to easily capture the base and Gunther while the guards flee.  The guards are likely aware of the telepathic projectors, but do not suspect that Hathaway and Marnagan have managed to turn the projectors to their own ends.  By using the projectors, Hathaway and Marnagan are able to turn a very dangerous situation into an easy victory. ",
        "Summary_2": "The telepathic projectors create the illusion that the asteroid is populated with a horde of hideous monsters. This impression frightens people whose spaceships crash onto the asteroid so that they will be too afraid to search for the hideout of Gunther and his guards. Hathaway realizes that the monsters are simply images that disappear when people no longer believe they are real when he examines his film of Marnagan with the monsters in the background. When he reviews his film, only Marnagan is visible, so Hathaway realizes that the monsters are not real. Gunther\u2019s telepathic projectors protect him and his men; he needs this added protection because he only has a few men, and Gunther himself is old and crippled, unable to defend himself or move on his own. Just as the telepathic projectors give him protection, they are also his undoing at the end of the story when Hathaway and Marnagan use the projectors against him. They feed in a film that makes it look like 500 Interplanetary Patrolmen are marching toward Gunter\u2019s headquarters, but in reality, it\u2019s only Marnagan with his image reproduced 499 times. Also, Hathaway and Marnagan are able to trick the projector into producing the monsters again to discover where they are coming from. This leads them to find Gunther\u2019s lair where they defeat him.",
        "Summary_3": "The crash of Hathaway\u2019s and Marnagan\u2019s ship in the opening scene of the story is significant both because it brings them to the asteroid where Gunther is hiding, and because it helps them figure out how Gunther is stealing cargo.

        "Summary_4": "The telepathic projectors are Marnagan\u2019s and Click\u2019s most important discovery in the story. They are the source of the monsters that had previously pursued the two after crash-landing on the asteroid. After realizing the monsters are fake, Click proposes that they can push through their ranks by simply disbelieving in their ability to harm them. This turns out to be true, and they are able to make their way to Gunther\u2019s hideaway, where they find oxygen tanks to support them in their next steps. By commandeering use of the projectors for their own purposes, Marnagan and Click are able to trick Gunther\u2019s men into believing Marnagan is the 500-men Patrol come to capture Gunther and defeat his ranks. Marnagan does his best acting like the men, and their images are projected telepathically into the minds of Gunther\u2019s men, who are subsequently defeated. In turn, this provides the footage that both Marnagan and Click desired when they initially began their quest.",
        "Article": "What do you      do     ? Steffens asked.     Elb replied quickly, with characteristic simplicity: We can do verylittle. A certain amount of physical knowledge was imparted to us atbirth by the Makers. We spend the main part of our time expanding thatknowledge wherever possible. We have made some progress in the naturalsciences, and some in mathematics. Our purpose in being, you see, isto serve the Makers. Any ability we can acquire will make us that muchmore fit to serve when the Makers return.     When they return? It had not occurred to Steffens until now that therobots expected the Makers to do so.     Elb regarded him out of the band of the circling eye. I see you hadsurmised that the Makers were not coming back.     If the robot could have laughed, Steffens thought it would have, then.But it just stood there, motionless, its tone politely emphatic.     It has always been our belief that the Makers would return. Why elsewould we have been built?     Steffens thought the robot would go on, but it didn't. The question, toElb, was no question at all.     Although Steffens knew already what the robot could not possibly haveknown\u2014that the Makers were gone and would never come back\u2014he was along time understanding. What he did was push this speculation into theback of his mind, to keep it from Elb. He had no desire to destroy afaith.     But it created a problem in him. He had begun to picture for Elb thestructure of human society, and the robot\u2014a machine which did not eator sleep\u2014listened gravely and tried to understand. One day Steffensmentioned God.     God? the robot repeated without comprehension. What is God?     Steffens explained briefly, and the robot answered:     It is a matter which has troubled us. We thought at first that youwere the Makers returning\u2014 Steffens remembered the brief lapse, theseeming disappointment he had sensed\u2014but then we probed your mindsand found that you were not, that you were another kind of being,unlike either the Makers or ourselves. You were not even\u2014 Elb caughthimself\u2014you did not happen to be telepaths. Therefore we troubledover who made you. We did detect the word 'Maker' in your theology,but it seemed to have a peculiar\u2014 Elb paused for a long while\u2014anuntouchable, intangible meaning which varies among you.     Steffens understood. He nodded.     The Makers were the robots' God, were all the God they needed. TheMakers had built them, the planet, the universe. If he were to ask themwho made the Makers, it would be like their asking him who made God.     It was an ironic parallel, and he smiled to himself.     But on that planet, it was the last time he smiled.   <doc-sep> I wished I had been born a couple of hundred years ago\u2014before peoplestarted playing around with nuclear energy and filling the air withradiations that they were afraid would turn human beings into hideousmonsters. Instead, they developed the psi powers that had always beenlatent in the species until we developed into a race of supermen. Idon't know why I say      we     \u2014in 1960 or so, I might have been consideredsuperior, but in 2102 I was just the Faradays' idiot boy.     Exploring space should have been my hope. If there had been anythinguseful or interesting on any of the other planets, I might have founda niche for myself there. In totally new surroundings, the psi powersgeared to another environment might not be an advantage. But by thetime I was ten, it was discovered that the other planets were justbarren hunks of rock, with pressures and climates and atmospheresdrastically unsuited to human life. A year or so before, the hyperdrivehad been developed on Earth and ships had been sent out to explore thestars, but I had no hope left in that direction any more.     I was an atavism in a world of peace and plenty. Peace, because peoplecouldn't indulge in war or even crime with so many telepaths runningaround\u2014not because, I told myself, the capacity for primitive behaviorwasn't just as latent in everybody else as the psi talent seemed latentin me. Tim must be right, I thought\u2014I must have some undreamed-ofpower that only the right circumstances would bring out. But what wasthat power?     For years I had speculated on what my potential talent might be,explored every wild possibility I could conceive of and found noneproductive of even an ambiguous result with which I could fool myself.As I approached adulthood, I began to concede that I was probablynothing more than what I seemed to be\u2014a simple psi-negative. Yet, fromtime to time, hope surged up again, as it had today, in spite of myknowledge that my hope was an impossibility. Who ever heard of latentpsi powers showing themselves in an individual as old as twenty-six?     I was almost alone in the parks where I used to walk, because peopleliked to commune with one another those days rather than with nature.Even gardening had very little popularity. But I found myself most athome in those woodland\u2014or, rather, pseudo-woodland\u2014surroundings,able to identify more readily with the trees and flowers than I couldwith my own kind. A fallen tree or a broken blossom would excite moresympathy from me than the minor catastrophes that will beset anyhousehold, no matter how gifted, and I would shy away from bloodynoses or cut fingers, thus giving myself a reputation for callousnessas well as extrasensory imbecility.     However, I was no more callous in steering clear of human breakdownsthan I was in not shedding tears over the household machines when theybroke down, for I felt no more closely akin to my parents and siblingsthan I did to the mechanisms that served and, sometimes, failed us.   <doc-sep> After a while, convinced that there was no danger, Steffens had theship brought down. When the crew came out of the airlock, they were metby the robots, and each man found himself with a robot at his side,humbly requesting to be of service. There were literally thousands ofthe robots now, come from all over the barren horizon. The mass of themstood apart, immobile on a plain near the ship, glinting in the sunlike a vast, metallic field of black wheat.     The robots had obviously been built to serve. Steffens began to      feel     their pleasure, to sense it in spite of the blank, expressionlessfaces. They were almost like children in their eagerness, yet they werestill reserved. Whoever had built them, Steffens thought in wonder, hadbuilt them well.     Ball came to join Steffens, staring at the robots through the clearplastic of his helmet with baffledly widened eyes. A robot moved outfrom the mass in the field, allied itself to him. The first to speakhad remained with Steffens.     Realizing that the robot could hear every word he was saying, Ballwas for a while apprehensive. But the sheer unreality of standing andtalking with a multi-limbed, intelligent hunk of dead metal upon thebare rock of a dead, ancient world, the unreality of it slowly died.It was impossible not to like the things. There was something in theirvery lines which was pleasant and relaxing.     Their builders, Steffens thought, had probably thought of that, too.     There's no harm in them, said Ball at last, openly, not minding ifthe robots heard. They seem actually glad we're here. My God, whoeverheard of a robot being glad?     Steffens, embarrassed, spoke quickly to the nearest mechanical: I hopeyou will forgive us our curiosity, but\u2014yours is a remarkable race. Wehave never before made contact with a race like yours. It was saidhaltingly, but it was the best he could do.     The robot made a singularly human nodding motion of its head.     I perceive that the nature of our construction is unfamiliar to you.Your question is whether or not we are entirely 'mechanical.' I amnot exactly certain as to what the word 'mechanical' is intended toconvey\u2014I would have to examine your thought more fully\u2014but I believethat there is fundamental similarity between our structures.     The robot paused. Steffens had a distinct impression that it wasdisconcerted.     I must tell you, the thing went on, that we ourselves are\u2014curious.It stopped suddenly, struggling with a word it could not comprehend.Steffens waited, listening with absolute interest. It said at length:     We know of only two types of living structure. Ours, which is largelymetallic, and that of the      Makers     , which would appear to be somewhatmore like yours. I am not a\u2014doctor\u2014and therefore cannot acquaint youwith the specific details of the Makers' composition, but if you areinterested I will have a doctor brought forward. It will be glad to beof assistance.     It was Steffens' turn to struggle, and the robot waited patiently whileBall and the second robot looked on in silence. The Makers, obviously,were whoever or whatever had built the robots, and the doctors,Steffens decided, were probably just that\u2014doctor-robots, designedspecifically to care for the apparently flesh-bodies of the Makers.     The efficiency of the things continued to amaze him, but the questionhe had been waiting to ask came out now with a rush:     Can you tell us where the Makers are?     Both robots stood motionless. It occurred to Steffens that he couldn'treally be sure which was speaking. The voice that came to him spokewith difficulty.     The Makers\u2014are not here.     Steffens stared in puzzlement. The robot detected his confusion andwent on:     The Makers have gone away. They have been gone for a very long time.     Could that be      pain     in its voice, Steffens wondered, and then thespectre of the ruined cities rose harsh in his mind.     War. The Makers had all been killed in that war. And these had not beenkilled.     He tried to grasp it, but he couldn't. There were robots here in themidst of a radiation so lethal that      nothing     ,      nothing     could live;robots on a dead planet, living in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide.     The carbon dioxide brought him up sharp.     If there had been life here once, there would have been plant life aswell, and therefore oxygen. If the war had been so long ago that thefree oxygen had since gone out of the atmosphere\u2014good God, how oldwere the robots? Steffens looked at Ball, then at the silent robots,then out across the field to where the rest of them stood. The blackwheat. Steffens felt a deep chill.     Were they immortal?  "

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in Doctor Universe?",
        "Summary_1": "Grannie Annie,  a prolific science fiction novelist, goes to see Billy at a men\u2019s club. The two sit down to have a drink in an empty portion of the club, but they only have a minute to chat before Grannie Annie remembers she has an appointment at the Satellite Theater. She insists that Billy come with her. \n\nGrannie Annie forces Billy to take a seat in the audience, and she takes her place backstage. The show is called \u201cDoctor Universe and His Nine Geniuses,\u201d and it\u2019s a type of gameshow. People and creatures on nine different planets tune into the program, and they ask the geniuses questions. If the show\u2019s experts cannot answer the question, the listener gets a sum of money. Grannie Annie is there to serve as the guest star. \n\nThe show goes off without a hitch. The only remarkable thing that Billy notices is that the audience appears to be mesmerized by Dr. Universe. \n\nGrannie Annie tells Billy that while she was writing a sequel to her latest novel, she met Ezra Karn, and he told her about the Green Flames. The Green Flame is a radioactive rock originally found on Mercury, and the rock\u2019s Gamma Rays have the power to make people and creatures have a strong desire for a leader. Grannie Annie included these fantastical ideas in her recent novel, but her manuscript was stolen. Now, she\u2019s concerned that the rocks and rays will be used by an authoritarian leader. \n\nIn the middle of their conversation, Grannie Annie and Billy are attacked by someone with a heat ray. The pair leaves Swamp City, followed by the enemy. They travel and find Ezra Karn in his home. \n\nKarn takes his friends to the spaceship where the Green Flames are stored. The precious resource is behind impenetrable glass, and it\u2019s clear that whoever controls it made sure it was safe. \n\nKarn is an avid Doctor Universe fan, and he off-handedly tells Grannie Annie and Billy that they ought to make the man the king. Grannie Annie realizes that Doctor Universe is in fact the person hoarding the Green Flames, and he\u2019s using his quiz show to control the minds of the masses so that he can take over as dictator. \n\nWithout warning, Billy and his friends feel an invisible force pushing them and holding down their bodies. They recognize force as the Varsoom, and the only way to stop it is to make them laugh. Grannie Annie builds a machine that allows the group to interrupt Doctor Universe\u2019s broadcast. \n\nWhen Doctor Universe comes on the radio again, Grannie Annie reads one of her science fiction books to the invisible creatures. The plan works, and the Varsoom laugh wildly, which ruins the Doctor\u2019s plans to take over the universe. Grannie Annie says it won\u2019t deter her from writing her novels, and she invites Billy to come along for the research portion of her next project. \n\n",
        "Summary_2": "The story starts in a club on Venus, in Swamp City. The narrator is surprised to hear from a member of the staff that there is a woman here to see him--his friend Grannie Annie, who is known by lovers of science fiction novels by her pen name, Annabella C. Flowers. As they catch up over drinks, she interrupts to lead them to a Doctor Universe quiz show at the Satellite Theater. In this game show, she acts as an expert in the history of the solar system alongside members of various interplanetary races. After the seemingly innocuous show, there is a racist attack on a Martian outside of the theater. Grannie Annie finds a location to fill Billy (the narrator) in on a theory. She tells him about Ezra Karn, a prospector she met while doing research for one of her books. He found a large supply of Green Flame, a radioactive Mercurian rock that has opiate-like effects on those who are exposed to it. It had been used under some dictatorships to control populations. Grannie Annie had written a novel about Green Flame, but she thought someone had stolen the manuscript and was going through with the plot, using the rocks to affect people\u2019s mindsets. Billy suspects Doctor Universe is the one with the evil plan, but Grannie is less convinced. The two had to run after they were shot at and headed out to find Ezra and the Green Flame. Traveling on pack animals and then in canoes through the swampland with some Venetian guides, Billy was increasingly stressed by the state of the world. They found Ezra after being attacked by a hunter-bird that had been sent after them. His two-room hut was equipped with the latest visi set, allowing him to watch the Doctor Universe program. He agreed to take them to the ship where he had seen the Green Flame after the show. When they arrived, they found the ship outfitted with a self-operating broadcasting unit which was well-protected behind unbreakable glass. The group had already started to feel the effects of the radiation, feeling despondent, but they knew they had to do something. Grannie realizes that Billy was right, and Doctor Universe was the one with the evil plan. After the camp was attacked by the Varsoom, an energy being native to the area of Venus they were in, Grannie had an idea. The only way to escape the Varsoom attack was to make them laugh, so she rigged Ezra\u2019s visi set to be able to insert the sound of them laughing into the broadcast of the game show. The group could not find a way to make them laugh, until Grannie read them her book. Their laughter made it into the broadcast, thwarting Doctor Universe\u2019s plans for becoming dictator of the solar system. In the end, Grannie decides she wants to keep writing novels and invites Billy on a trip to Mars for background research for her next book.",
        "Summary_3": "Billy is playing pool when his grandmother attempts to enter the male-only Spacemen\u2019s Club in Venus. He runs out to meet her in the lobby then takes her up to the grille where she won\u2019t be seen. They share a drink, while he asks her what she\u2019s doing in town. Grannie Annie, better known as Annabella C. Flowers, is a popular science fiction writer. Before she can explain her arrival, she rushes to the Satellite Theater, taking Billy with her. She\u2019s a participant in the Doctor Universe game show, and she wants Billy to watch. \nAfter the show is over, a racist interaction takes place. The I.P. comes around to break it up, but not before one Kagor was seriously hurt. \nGrannie Annie takes Billy into another restaurant and finally explains herself. She was writing a sequel for her last book and was doing research on Venus. There she met Ezra Karn, an older man with plenty of stories to tell. He told her of the Green Flames, an ore that released gamma rays stronger than any drug known to man. They made people receptive and easily manipulated. \nShe wrote a book about it and included many facts that Karn told her, including the location of the remaining Green Flames. The manuscript was stolen, and now she believes that this person is using the Geren Flame to control people. \nBilly immediately thinks the suspect is Doctor Universe, but Grannie blows him off. She thinks that someone has figured out a way to broadcast the emissions. A heat ray blasts toward them, almost killing Grannie Annie. They rush to the hydrocar and get out of there. \nFinally, they reach Level Five close to Vansoom territory, where Karn lives. The Vansooms are energy creatures, extremely dangerous, and volatile. They take a boat, where a trained hunter-bird attacks them. They survive thanks to Grannie\u2019s shooting skills. They meet Karn at last and he agrees to show them to the shipwreck after they listen to the latest Doctor Universe gameshow. \nThey reach the ship and see that someone has added to it. A network of wires ran across the shipwreck, protected by impenetrable glass. As was the Green Flames. Since they weren\u2019t able to destroy it, the team sets up camp and hatches a new plan. \nAfter being attacked by the Vansooms, they realize that laughter is the only way to fend them off. Grannie Annie decides to broadcast the Vansooms\u2019 laughter over the next Doctor Universe gameshow, where he is to announce his incoming dictatorship. They spend the next day attempting to make the Vansoom\u2019s laugh but only succeed when Grannie Annie reads a chapter from her most popular novel. They broadcast their laughter over Doctor Universe and override his cry for power. \nThey make their way back home, a longer journey thanks to the Vansoom, and are greeted by the news that Doctor Universe failed.

Overall intellectual lethargy and a clear preference to be led by a despot or dictator. Theorizing that this behavior is the result of exposure to a unique radiation of the Green Flame rock, Annie and Billy investigate in the back country of Venus. As they hunt for an answer they are threatened by would-be assassins who are intent on stopping them. \n\nEventually they uncover that quiz show host, Doctor Universe, is amplifying radiation from a cache of Green Flame and broadcasting it throughout the solar system through his visi program. Annie foils his scheme by broadcasting the laughter of the Varsoom as Doctor Universe tries to announce himself as System Dictator. The story ends as Grannie Annie heads off to Mars with Billy Boy understanding that he was fated to join her in her next adventure.",
        "Article": "What is it you wish? he barked. I understood in my discussions withthe other ... ah ... civilian there'd be no further need for theseirritating conferences.     I've just learned you're placing more students abroad, Mr. Gulver. Howmany this time?     Two thousand.     And where will they be going?     Croanie. It's all in the application form I've handed in. Your job isto provide transportation.     Will there be any other students embarking this season?     Why ... perhaps. That's Boge's business. Gulver looked at Retief withpursed lips. As a matter of fact, we had in mind dispatching anothertwo thousand to Featherweight.     Another under-populated world\u2014and in the same cluster, I believe,Retief said. Your people must be unusually interested in that regionof space.     If that's all you wanted to know, I'll be on my way. I have matters ofimportance to see to.     After Gulver left, Retief called Miss Furkle in. I'd like to have abreak-out of all the student movements that have been planned under thepresent program, he said. And see if you can get a summary of whatMEDDLE has been shipping lately.     Miss Furkle compressed her lips. If Mr. Magnan were here, I'm surehe wouldn't dream of interfering in the work of other departments.I ... overheard your conversation with the gentleman from the CroanieLegation\u2014     The lists, Miss Furkle.     I'm not accustomed, Miss Furkle said, to intruding in mattersoutside our interest cluster.     That's worse than listening in on phone conversations, eh? But nevermind. I need the information, Miss Furkle.     Loyalty to my Chief\u2014     Loyalty to your pay-check should send you scuttling for the materialI've asked for, Retief said. I'm taking full responsibility. Nowscat.     The buzzer sounded. Retief flipped a key. MUDDLE, Retief speaking....     Arapoulous's brown face appeared on the desk screen.     How-do, Retief. Okay if I come up?     Sure, Hank. I want to talk to you.     In the office, Arapoulous took a chair. Sorry if I'm rushing you,Retief, he said. But have you got anything for me?     Retief waved at the wine bottles. What do you know about Croanie?     Croanie? Not much of a place. Mostly ocean. All right if you likefish, I guess. We import our seafood from there. Nice prawns in monsoontime. Over a foot long.     You on good terms with them?     Sure, I guess so. Course, they're pretty thick with Boge.     So?     Didn't I tell you? Boge was the bunch that tried to take us over herea dozen years back. They'd've made it too, if they hadn't had a lot ofbad luck. Their armor went in the drink, and without armor they're easygame.     Miss Furkle buzzed. I have your lists, she said shortly.     Bring them in, please.   <doc-sep> Outside the day was beginning to wane. The Venusians, apparentlyunawed by the presence of the space ship, had already started a fireand erected the tents. We left the vessel to find a spell of broodingdesolation heavy over the improvised camp. And the evening meal thistime was a gloomy affair. When it was finished, Ezra Karn lit his pipeand switched on the portable visi set. A moment later the silence ofthe march was broken by the opening fanfare of the Doctor Universeprogram.     Great stuff, Karn commented. I sent in a couple of questions once,but I never did win nothin'. This Doctor Universe is a great guy. Oughtto make him king or somethin'.     For a moment none of us made reply. Then suddenly Grannie Annie leapedto her feet.     Say that again! she cried.     The old prospector looked startled. Why, I only said they ought tomake this Doctor Universe the big boss and....     That's it! Grannie paced ten yards off into the gathering darknessand returned quickly. Billy-boy, you were right. The man behind this      is     Doctor Universe. It was he who stole my manuscript and devised amethod to amplify the radiations of the Green Flames in the freighter'shold. He lit on a sure-fire plan to broadcast those radiations in sucha way that millions of persons would be exposed to them simultaneously.Don't you see?     I didn't see, but Grannie hurried on.     What better way to expose civilized life to the Green Flamesradiations than when the people are in a state of relaxation. TheDoctor Universe quiz program. The whole System tuned in on them, butthey were only a blind to cover up the transmission of the radiationsfrom the ore. Their power must have been amplified a thousandfold, andtheir wave-length must lie somewhere between light and the supersonicscale in that transition band which so far has defied exploration....     But with what motive? I demanded. Why should...?     Power! the old woman answered. The old thirst for dictatorialcontrol of the masses. By presenting himself as an intellectual genius,Doctor Universe utilized a bizarre method to intrench himself in theminds of the people. Oh, don't you see, Billy-boy? The Green Flames'radiations spell doom to freedom, individual liberty.     I sat there stupidly, wondering if this all were some wild dream.     And then, as I looked across at Grannie Annie, the vague light over thetents seemed to shift a little, as if one layer of the atmosphere haddropped away to be replaced by another.     There it was again, a definite movement in the air. Somehow I got theimpression I was looking around that space rather than through it. Andsimultaneously Ezra Karn uttered a howl of pain. An instant later theold prospector was rolling over and over, threshing his arms wildly.     An invisible sledge hammer descended on my shoulder. The blow wasfollowed by another and another. Heavy unseen hands held me down.Opposite me Grannie Annie and the Venusians were suffering similarpunishment, the latter screaming in pain and bewilderment.     It's the Varsoom! Ezra Karn yelled. We've got to make 'em laugh. Ouronly escape is to make 'em laugh!     He struggled to his feet and began leaping wildly around the camp fire.Abruptly his foot caught on a log protruding from the fire; he trippedand fell headlong into a mass of hot coals and ashes. Like a jumpingjack he was on his feet again, clawing dirt and soot from his eyes.     Out of the empty space about us there came a sudden hush. The unseenblows ceased in mid-career. And then the silence was rent by wildlaughter. Peal after peal of mirthful yells pounded against our ears.For many moments it continued; then it died away, and everything waspeaceful once more.     Grannie Annie picked herself up slowly. That was close, she said. Iwouldn't want to go through that again.     Ezra Karn nursed an ugly welt under one eye. Those Varsoom got a funnysense of humor, he growled.   <doc-sep> Inside the freighter's narrow corridor Grannie faced me with eyesfilled with excitement.     Billy-boy, she said, we've got two problems now. We've got to stopDoctor Universe, and we've got to find a way of getting out of here.Right now we're nicely bottled up.     As if in answer to her words the visi set revealed the face of the quizmaster on the screen. He was saying:           Remember tomorrow at this same hour I will have a message ofunparalleled importance for the people of the nine planets. Tomorrownight I urge you, I command you, to tune in.          With a whistling intake of breath the old woman turned to one of theVenusians.     Bring all our equipment in here, she ordered. Hurry!     She untied the ribbon under her chin and took off her cap. She rolledup her sleeves, and as the Venusians came marching into the space shipwith bundles of equipment, she fell to work.     Silently Ezra Karn and I watched her. First she completely dismantledthe visi set, put it together again with an entirely altered hookup.Next she unrolled a coil of flexible copper mesh which we had broughtalong as a protective electrical screening against the marsh insects.She fastened rubberite suction cups to this mesh at intervals of everytwelve inches or more, carried it down to the freighter's hold andfastened it securely against the stepto glass wall.     Trailing a three-ply conduit up from the hold to the corridor sheselected an induction coil, several Micro-Wellman tubes and a quantityof wire from a box of spare parts. Dexterously her fingers moved in andout, fashioning a complicated and curious piece of apparatus.     At length she finished.     It's pretty hay-wire, she said, but I think it will work. Now I'lltell you what I'm going to do. When Doctor Universe broadcasts tomorrownight, he's going to announce that he has set himself up as supremedictator. He'll have the Green Flame radiations coming from this shipunder full power. I'm going to insert into his broadcast\u2014the laughingof the Varsoom!     You're going to what?     Broadcast the mass laughter from those invisible creatures out there.Visualize it, Billy-boy! At the dramatic moment when Doctor Universemakes his plea for System-wide power, he will be accompanied by wildpeals of laughter. The whole broadcast will be turned into a burlesque.     How you going to make 'em laugh? interrupted Karn.     We must think of a way, Grannie replied soberly.     I, for one, am glad that no representative of the InterstellarPsychiatry Society witnessed our antics during the early hours of thatmorning and on into the long reaches of the afternoon, as we vainlytried to provoke the laughter of the Varsoom. All to no avail. Uttersilence greeted our efforts. And the time was growing close to thescheduled Doctor Universe program.     Ezra Karn wiped a bead of perspiration from his brow. Maybe we've gotto attract their attention first, he suggested. Miss Flowers, whydon't you go up on the roof and read to 'em? Read 'em something fromone of your books, if you've got one along. That ought to make 'em situp and take notice.     For a moment the old woman gazed at him in silence. Then she got to herfeet quickly.     I'll do it, she said. I'll read them the attack scene from      MurderOn A Space Liner     .  "

        "Summary_1": "Grannie Annie is a small elderly woman who wears a bonnet and dresses in black. She smokes tobacco and her choice of beverage is whiskey. She is a very well-known science fiction writer, and her work is highly sought after by publishers. Her pen name is Annabella C. Flowers. Her writing includes some repetition. Each novel includes a beautiful woman for the protagonist to fall in love with. Still, Grannie Annie always does her research. If she\u2019s writing about a colony on Venus, she spends weeks there to truly get to know the place before she portrays the setting in her book. \n\nGrannie Annie is bold and intelligent. Although she does not first suspect that Doctor Universe is the wannabe dictator, as soon as Karn mentions that he thinks the Doctor should be king, everything clicks, and Annie recognizes him as the villain. She is a quick thinker and a tinkerer as well. She is able to build a contraption that interrupts Doctor Universe\u2019s broadcast in very little time. \n\nWhen the Varsoom laugh at her novel, she gets angry. She clearly takes pride in her work and doesn\u2019t like feeling like a laughingstock. Annie is not a quitter. When Billy asks her if she will continue writing, she already has the idea for her next piece ready to go. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Grannie Annie is a science fiction author who writes under the pen name Annabella C. Flowers. She is very prolific, and also quite well-known. She is dedicated to doing the right research to make her stories as accurately detailed as possible, and often travels to visit the locations she is writing about so that she has lived in those places before she tries to represent them. Because she is a popular figure, she also participates in other public-facing events, such as the Doctor Universe broadcast at the beginning of the story. She is fond of Billy, the narrator, and they clearly trust each other. Physically, she is very slight, but very expressive, and wears very distinctive clothing. Those who know her personally know she is a fireball in terms of her personality, and her readers are constantly hungry for her adventuresome writing. It\u2019s possible that she has written the most science fiction of anyone in her day, and this left her quite well-off, financially. She is also a creative thinker outside of her writing and was the one to come up with the plan to disrupt the Doctor Universe broadcast near the end of the story. Not only did she set up the equipment to be able to include the laughing sounds from the Varsoom, but it was she that eventually got the Varsoom to laugh. Although at first she was insulted that they would laugh at her story, she quickly dusted herself off and knew she would continue writing, and exploring the world while she did it.",

        "Article": "Outside the day was beginning to wane. The Venusians, apparentlyunawed by the presence of the space ship, had already started a fireand erected the tents. We left the vessel to find a spell of broodingdesolation heavy over the improvised camp. And the evening meal thistime was a gloomy affair. When it was finished, Ezra Karn lit his pipeand switched on the portable visi set. A moment later the silence ofthe march was broken by the opening fanfare of the Doctor Universeprogram.     Great stuff, Karn commented. I sent in a couple of questions once,but I never did win nothin'. This Doctor Universe is a great guy. Oughtto make him king or somethin'.     For a moment none of us made reply. Then suddenly Grannie Annie leapedto her feet.     Say that again! she cried.     The old prospector looked startled. Why, I only said they ought tomake this Doctor Universe the big boss and....     That's it! Grannie paced ten yards off into the gathering darknessand returned quickly. Billy-boy, you were right. The man behind this      is     Doctor Universe. It was he who stole my manuscript and devised amethod to amplify the radiations of the Green Flames in the freighter'shold. He lit on a sure-fire plan to broadcast those radiations in sucha way that millions of persons would be exposed to them simultaneously.Don't you see?     I didn't see, but Grannie hurried on.     What better way to expose civilized life to the Green Flamesradiations than when the people are in a state of relaxation. TheDoctor Universe quiz program. The whole System tuned in on them, butthey were only a blind to cover up the transmission of the radiationsfrom the ore. Their power must have been amplified a thousandfold, andtheir wave-length must lie somewhere between light and the supersonicscale in that transition band which so far has defied exploration....     But with what motive? I demanded. Why should...?     Power! the old woman answered. The old thirst for dictatorialcontrol of the masses. By presenting himself as an intellectual genius,Doctor Universe utilized a bizarre method to intrench himself in theminds of the people. Oh, don't you see, Billy-boy? The Green Flames'radiations spell doom to freedom, individual liberty.     I sat there stupidly, wondering if this all were some wild dream.     And then, as I looked across at Grannie Annie, the vague light over thetents seemed to shift a little, as if one layer of the atmosphere haddropped away to be replaced by another.     There it was again, a definite movement in the air. Somehow I got theimpression I was looking around that space rather than through it. Andsimultaneously Ezra Karn uttered a howl of pain. An instant later theold prospector was rolling over and over, threshing his arms wildly.     An invisible sledge hammer descended on my shoulder. The blow wasfollowed by another and another. Heavy unseen hands held me down.Opposite me Grannie Annie and the Venusians were suffering similarpunishment, the latter screaming in pain and bewilderment.     It's the Varsoom! Ezra Karn yelled. We've got to make 'em laugh. Ouronly escape is to make 'em laugh!     He struggled to his feet and began leaping wildly around the camp fire.Abruptly his foot caught on a log protruding from the fire; he trippedand fell headlong into a mass of hot coals and ashes. Like a jumpingjack he was on his feet again, clawing dirt and soot from his eyes.     Out of the empty space about us there came a sudden hush. The unseenblows ceased in mid-career. And then the silence was rent by wildlaughter. Peal after peal of mirthful yells pounded against our ears.For many moments it continued; then it died away, and everything waspeaceful once more.     Grannie Annie picked herself up slowly. That was close, she said. Iwouldn't want to go through that again.     Ezra Karn nursed an ugly welt under one eye. Those Varsoom got a funnysense of humor, he growled.   <doc-sep> A tall man, clad in a claw-hammer coat, came out from the wings andadvanced to the footlights.     People of Swamp City, he said, bowing, permit me to introducemyself. I am Doctor Universe, and these are my nine experts.     There was a roar of applause from the      Satellite     audience. When it hadsubsided, the man continued:     As most of you are familiar with our program, it will be unnecessaryto give any advance explanation. I will only say that on this stage arenine visi sets, each tuned to one of the nine planets. At transmittingsets all over these planets listeners will appear and voice questions.These questions, my nine experts will endeavor to answer. For everyquestion missed, the sender will receive a check for one thousand      planetoles     .     One thing more. As usual we have with us a guest star who will matchher wits with the experts. May I present that renowned writer ofscience fiction, Annabella C. Flowers.     From the left wing Grannie Annie appeared. She bowed and took her placeon the dais.     The Doctor's program began. The operator of the Earth visi twisted hisdials and nodded. Blue light flickered on the pantascope panel tocoalesce slowly into the face of a red-haired man. Sharp and dear hisvoice echoed through the theater:           Who was the first Earthman to titter the sunward side of Mercury?          Doctor Universe nodded and turned to Grannie Annie who had raised herhand. She said quietly:     Charles Zanner in the year 2012. In a specially constructedtracto-car.     And so it went. Questions from Mars, from Earth, from Saturn flowed inthe visi sets. Isolated miners on Jupiter, dancers in swank Plutoniancafes strove to stump the experts. With Doctor Universe offeringbantering side play, the experts gave their answers. When they failed,or when the Truthicator flashed a red light, he announced the name ofthe winner.     It grew a little tiresome after a while and I wondered why Grannie hadbrought me here. And then I began to notice things.     The audience in the      Satellite     seemed to have lost much of itsoriginal fervor. They applauded as before but they did so only at thesignal of Doctor Universe. The spell created by the man was complete.     Pompous and erect, he strode back and forth across the stage like ageneral surveying his army. His black eyes gleamed, and his thin lipswere turned in a smile of satisfaction.     When the last question had been answered I joined the exit-movingcrowd. It was outside under the street marquee that a strange incidentoccurred.     A yellow-faced Kagor from the upper Martian desert country shuffled by,dragging his cumbersome third leg behind him. Kagors, of course, had anunpleasant history of persecution since the early colonization days ofthe Red Planet. But the thing that happened there was a throw back toan earlier era.     Someone shouted, Yah, yellow-face! Down with all Kagors! As oneman the crowd took up the cry and surged forward. The helpless Kagorwas seized and flung to the pavement. A knife appeared from nowhere,snipped the Martian's single lock of hair. A booted foot bludgeonedinto his mouth.     Moments later an official hydrocar roared up and a dozen I.P. menrushed out and scattered the crowd. But a few stragglers lingered toshout derisive epithets.     Grannie Annie came out from behind the box office then. She took my armand led me around a corner and through a doorway under a sign that readTHE JET. Inside was a deep room with booths along one wall. The placewas all but deserted.     In a booth well toward the rear the old lady surveyed me with sobereyes.     Billy-boy, did you see the way that crowd acted?     I nodded. As disgraceful an exhibition as I've ever seen. The I.P. menought to clamp down.     The I.P. men aren't strong enough.     She said it quietly, but there was a glitter in her eyes and a harshline about her usually smiling lips.     What do you mean?   <doc-sep>   Doctor Universe     By CARL JACOBI     Grannie Annie, who wrote science fiction     under the nom de plume of Annabella C. Flowers,     had stumbled onto a murderous plot more     hair-raising than any she had ever concocted.     And the danger from the villain of the piece     didn't worry her\u2014I was the guy he was shooting at.     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Planet Stories Fall 1944.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      I was killing an hour in the billiard room of the      Spacemen's Club     in Swamp City when the Venusian bellboy came and tapped me on theshoulder.     Beg pardon, thir, he said with his racial lisp, thereth thome one tothee you in the main lounge. His eyes rolled as he added, A lady!     A woman here...! The      Spacemen's     was a sanctuary, a rest club wherein-coming pilots and crewmen could relax before leaving for anothervoyage. The rule that no females could pass its portals was strictlyenforced.     I followed the bellhop down the long corridor that led to the mainlounge. At the threshold I jerked to a halt and stared incredulously.     Grannie Annie!     There she stood before a frantically gesticulating desk clerk, leaningon her faded green umbrella. A little wisp of a woman clad in avoluminous black dress with one of those doily-like caps on her head,tied by a ribbon under her chin. Her high-topped button shoes wereplanted firmly on the varpla carpet and her wrinkled face was set incalm defiance.     I barged across the lounge and seized her hand. Grannie Annie! Ihaven't seen you in two years.     Hi, Billy-boy, she greeted calmly. Will you please tell thisfish-face to shut up.     The desk clerk went white. Mithter Trenwith, if thith lady ith afriend of yourth, you'll have to take her away. It'th abtholutelyagainth the ruleth....     Okay, okay, I grinned. Look, we'll go into the grille. There's noone there at this hour.     In the grille an equally astonished waiter served us\u2014me a lime rickeyand Grannie Annie her usual whisky sour\u2014I waited until she had tossedthe drink off at a gulp before I set off a chain of questions:     What the devil are you doing on Venus? Don't you know women aren'tallowed in the      Spacemen's     ? What happened to the book you werewriting?     Hold it, Billy-boy. Laughingly she threw up both hands. Sure, I knewthis place had some antiquated laws. Pure fiddle-faddle, that's whatthey are. Anyway, I've been thrown out of better places.     She hadn't changed. To her publishers and her readers she might beAnnabella C. Flowers, author of a long list of science fiction novels.But to me she was still Grannie Annie, as old-fashioned as last year'shat, as modern as an atomic motor. She had probably written more drivelin the name of science fiction than anyone alive.     But the public loved it. They ate up her stories, and they clamored formore. Her annual income totaled into six figures, and her publisherssat back and massaged their digits, watching their earnings mount.     One thing you had to admit about her books. They may have been dimenovels, but they weren't synthetic. If Annabella C. Flowers wrote anovel, and the locale was the desert of Mars, she packed her carpet bagand hopped a liner for Craterville. If she cooked up a feud between twoexpeditions on Callisto, she went to Callisto.     She was the most completely delightful crackpot I had ever known.     What happened to      Guns for Ganymede     ? I asked. That was the title ofyour last, wasn't it?  "

        "Query": "What is the importance of the Green Flames in Doctor Universe?",
        "Summary_1": "The Green Flames are highly important to the narrative because without them, Doctor Universe would not be able to try and take over the universe. The Green Flames originally come from planet Mercury. When earthlings or other creatures come in contract with the rock\u2019s Gamma rays, their brains instantly desire control from leadership. The element\u2019s power is immense but also subtle. \n\nThe Green Flames have already been used to institute a dictatorship, as with the cautionary tail of Vennox. Vennox forced each creature to keep two of the rocks in each house, and he used their powers to make them servile. When the government was overthrown, the Green Flames were destroyed. \n\nEzra Karn finds the Green Flames hidden away in a spaceship in the Varsoom district of Venus. Doctor Universe has secured the resource and its power when he broadcasts his weekly quiz show, \u201cDoctor Universe and His Nine Geniuses.\u201d The show is a hit on multiple planets, and the quiz master urges his followers to tune in to each broadcast. The Green Flames lead listeners to believe that he is a supreme being and deserves to be in a position of power. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Green Flame is not well understood by the scientific community in the story, but it plays an important role in the history of political power in the system, as well as the contemporary political situation that Grannie Annie is navigating. The rock was originally found on Mercury, and its composition is only partially understood, but it is clear that all types of life forms are affected by the drug-like effects of its radiation. Initially, it appears to just drain some energy, but with increased exposure, the beings search for more direction and guidance, a desire that can be fulfilled by political power of dictators. In fact, it had been used specifically for this purpose on Earth, Venus, and Mars by a dictator named Vennox I. He required that two pieces of Green Flame were in every household, which ensure that the people wanted to look to him for guidance. The stash of this rock that was found in an abandoned ship on the surface of Venus is the last remaining supply, as it was mostly destroyed after the dictatorship ended. When Grannie Annie found out about the supply, through a prospector named Ezra Karn, she decided to use it as part of the plot for her newest novel. However, Doctor Universe used the details of the story to devise his own plot to use the Green Flame to try to start his own dictatorship. He used broadcast technology to extend the effects of the radioactive rock, so that it affected anyone who watched his quiz show. In the end, the plan is not successful, because Billy and Grannie Annie and their team were able to thwart his efforts.",
        "Summary_3": "The Green Flames are a radioactive ore that can and have been used to cause great harm. They emit gamma rays that are incredibly suggestive and powerful when consumed. Vennox I, a dictatorship that ruled over three planets in 2710, used the Green Flames to control their people. \nBy placing the ores in every house, they were able to manipulate and oppress their people. The Green Flames\u2019 power can erase all freedom and individual liberty from a planet. \nWith this kind of power, it\u2019s no wonder that they were all destroyed after Vennox I was overthrown. However, a ship containing a tank full of them crashed, leaving some untouched. Their discovery led to Doctor Universe\u2019s attempt at dictatorship. Luckily, he was foiled along the way.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Green Flame is a type of rock with a specific type of radiation. When a lifeform is exposed to this radiation, its brain begins to deteriorate and display an acute lack of energy that increases with exposure. \n\nThe rocks were outlawed as part of a push for democratized government and supposedly destroyed centuries ago but a large quantity of the rocks were discovered on Venus.\n\nNow as populations are agitating for dictatorial government, it is suspected that it is due to the influence of Green Flame.\n\nIt was revealed that augmented Green Flame radiation was being broadcast through Doctor Universe's quiz show.",

Those Varsoom got a funnysense of humor, he growled.   <doc-sep> Inside the freighter's narrow corridor Grannie faced me with eyesfilled with excitement.     Billy-boy, she said, we've got two problems now. We've got to stopDoctor Universe, and we've got to find a way of getting out of here.Right now we're nicely bottled up.     As if in answer to her words the visi set revealed the face of the quizmaster on the screen. He was saying:           Remember tomorrow at this same hour I will have a message ofunparalleled importance for the people of the nine planets. Tomorrownight I urge you, I command you, to tune in.          With a whistling intake of breath the old woman turned to one of theVenusians.     Bring all our equipment in here, she ordered. Hurry!     She untied the ribbon under her chin and took off her cap. She rolledup her sleeves, and as the Venusians came marching into the space shipwith bundles of equipment, she fell to work.     Silently Ezra Karn and I watched her. First she completely dismantledthe visi set, put it together again with an entirely altered hookup.Next she unrolled a coil of flexible copper mesh which we had broughtalong as a protective electrical screening against the marsh insects.She fastened rubberite suction cups to this mesh at intervals of everytwelve inches or more, carried it down to the freighter's hold andfastened it securely against the stepto glass wall.     Trailing a three-ply conduit up from the hold to the corridor sheselected an induction coil, several Micro-Wellman tubes and a quantityof wire from a box of spare parts. Dexterously her fingers moved in andout, fashioning a complicated and curious piece of apparatus.     At length she finished.     It's pretty hay-wire, she said, but I think it will work. Now I'lltell you what I'm going to do. When Doctor Universe broadcasts tomorrownight, he's going to announce that he has set himself up as supremedictator. He'll have the Green Flame radiations coming from this shipunder full power. I'm going to insert into his broadcast\u2014the laughingof the Varsoom!     You're going to what?     Broadcast the mass laughter from those invisible creatures out there.Visualize it, Billy-boy! At the dramatic moment when Doctor Universemakes his plea for System-wide power, he will be accompanied by wildpeals of laughter. The whole broadcast will be turned into a burlesque.     How you going to make 'em laugh? interrupted Karn.     We must think of a way, Grannie replied soberly.     I, for one, am glad that no representative of the InterstellarPsychiatry Society witnessed our antics during the early hours of thatmorning and on into the long reaches of the afternoon, as we vainlytried to provoke the laughter of the Varsoom. All to no avail. Uttersilence greeted our efforts. And the time was growing close to thescheduled Doctor Universe program.     Ezra Karn wiped a bead of perspiration from his brow. Maybe we've gotto attract their attention first, he suggested. Miss Flowers, whydon't you go up on the roof and read to 'em? Read 'em something fromone of your books, if you've got one along. That ought to make 'em situp and take notice.     For a moment the old woman gazed at him in silence. Then she got to herfeet quickly.     I'll do it, she said. I'll read them the attack scene from      MurderOn A Space Liner     .   <doc-sep> For a moment the old lady sat there in silence; then she leaned back,closed her eyes, and I knew there was a story coming.     My last book,      Death In The Atom     , hit the stands last January,she began. When it was finished I had planned to take a six months'vacation, but those fool publishers of mine insisted I do a sequel.Well, I'd used Mars and Pluto and Ganymede as settings for novels, sofor this one I decided on Venus. I went to Venus City, and I spent sixweeks in-country. I got some swell background material, and I met EzraKarn....     Who? I interrupted.     An old prospector who lives out in the deep marsh on the outskirts ofVarsoom country. To make a long story short, I got him talking abouthis adventures, and he told me plenty.     The old woman paused. Did you ever hear of the Green Flames? sheasked abruptly.     I shook my head. Some new kind of ...     It's not a new kind of anything. The Green Flame is a radio-activerock once found on Mercury. The      Alpha     rays of this rock are similarto radium in that they consist of streams of material particlesprojected at high speed. But the character of the      Gamma     rays hasnever been completely analyzed. Like those set up by radium, they areelectromagnetic pulsations, but they are also a strange combination of      Beta     or cathode rays with negatively charged electrons.     When any form of life is exposed to these      Gamma     rays from the GreenFlame rock, they produce in the creature's brain a certain lassitudeand lack of energy. As the period of exposure increases, this conditiondevelops into a sense of impotence and a desire for leadership orguidance. Occasionally, as with the weak-willed, there is a spirit ofintolerance. The Green Flames might be said to be an inorganic opiate,a thousand times more subtle and more powerful than any known drug.     I was sitting up now, hanging on to the woman's every word.     Now in 2710, as you'd know if you studied your history, the threeplanets of Earth, Venus, and Mars were under governmental bondage. Thecruel dictatorship of Vennox I was short-lived, but it lasted longenough to endanger all civilized life.     The archives tell us that one of the first acts of the overthrowinggovernment was to cast out all Green Flames, two of which Vennox hadordered must be kept in each household. The effect on the people wasimmediate. Representative government, individual enterprise, freedomfollowed.     Grannie Annie lit a cigarette and flipped the match to the floor.     To go back to my first trip to Venus. As I said, I met Ezra Karn, anold prospector there in the marsh. Karn told me that on one of histravels into the Varsoom district he had come upon the wreckage ofan old space ship. The hold of that space ship was packed with GreenFlames!     If Grannie expected me to show surprise at that, she was disappointed.I said, So what?     So everything, Billy-boy. Do you realize what such a thing would meanif it were true? Green Flames were supposedly destroyed on all planetsafter the Vennox regime crashed. If a quantity of the rock were inexistence, and it fell into the wrong hands, there'd be trouble.     Of course, I regarded Karn's story as a wild dream, but it madecorking good story material. I wrote it into a novel, and a week afterit was completed, the manuscript was stolen from my study back onEarth.     I see, I said as she lapsed into silence. And now you've come to theconclusion that the details of your story were true and that someone isattempting to put your plot into action.     Grannie nodded. Yes, she said. That's exactly what I think.     I got my pipe out of my pocket, tamped Martian tobacco into the bowland laughed heartily. The same old Flowers, I said. Tell me, who'syour thief ... Doctor Universe?     She regarded me evenly. What makes you say that?     I shrugged.     The way the theater crowd acted. It all ties in.     The old woman shook her head. No, this is a lot bigger than a simplequiz program. The theater crowd was but a cross-section of what ishappening all over the System. There have been riots on Earth and Mars,police officials murdered on Pluto and a demand that government byrepresentation be abolished on Jupiter. The time is ripe for a militarydictator to step in.     And you can lay it all to the Green Flames. It seems incredible that asingle shipload of the ore could effect such a wide ranged area, but inmy opinion someone has found a means of making that quantity a thousandtimes more potent and is transmiting it      en masse     .     If it had been anyone but Grannie Annie there before me, I wouldhave called her a fool. And then all at once I got an odd feeling ofapproaching danger.     Let's get out of here, I said, getting up.       Zinnng-whack!       All right!     On the mirror behind the bar a small circle with radiating cracksappeared. On the booth wall a scant inch above Grannie's head thefresco seemed to melt away suddenly.     A heat ray!     Grannie Annie leaped to her feet, grasped my arm and raced for thedoor. Outside a driverless hydrocar stood with idling motors. The oldwoman threw herself into the control seat, yanked me in after her andthrew over the starting stud.     An instant later we were plunging through the dark night.  "

        "Query": "What is the connection between Billy and Grannie Annie in the story of Doctor Universe?",
        "Summary_1": "When Grannie Annie shows up at the men\u2019s club to see Billy, the two friends have not seen each other in two years. It is immediately clear that Grannie Annie runs the show in their relationship, in part because Billy is willing to risk his reputation at the men\u2019s club in order to make his elderly friends happy. Within minutes, Billy is whisked away to the theater to watch Annie guest star on Doctor Universe\u2019s show, even though she does not explain the plan to him and he has little interest in being an audience member.\n\nAlthough the rest of the world knows Grannie Annie as Annabella C. Flowers, the name she uses to publish her science fiction novels, Billy would never address her so formally. There is an obvious feeling of trust between the two characters. When Grannie Annie gets her novel stolen and worries that there\u2019s a dictator about to take over the universe, she finds Billy to help her solve the case. Similarly, when Grannie Annie spills her guts about her far-fetched theory about her novel inspiring an evil villain to use the Green Flames to control millions of beings, Billy believes her right off the bat. \n\nThe pair get along very well, and it\u2019s clear that\u2019s the case when Grannie Annie asks Billy to accompany her on her next trip to research her upcoming novel. Billy simply can\u2019t say no to his friend, whom he deeply admires. \n",
        "Summary_2": "At the time that the story takes place, Billy and Grannie Annie had not seen each other in two years. Even so, they trust one another confidently. At the beginning of the story, we see that Grannie Annie has approached Billy to talk about her concerns for the political climate based on the manuscript of one of her novels. Billy admits to the reader that her story of what was happening, told by anyone else, would be hard to believe, but from her he knows there has to be some truth to it. He also trusts her enough to go along on her expedition to find Ezra, the abandoned ship, and the Green Flame. They know each other well enough ability to know that Grannie\u2019s usual drink is a whiskey sour. At the end of the story, although Billy says he does not want to join on a trip to Mars, he admits to the reader that he knows he will join on another adventure, following Grannie wherever she goes.",
        "Summary_3": "Grannie Annie is Billy\u2019s grandma and confidante. Billy is a little shyer than she is, however they play off of each other and he gains confidence on the journey. This is best shown at the end when she asks if he will come to Mars with her, and he initially says no. Then, he thinks to himself, Of course, I\u2019ll go. \nGrannie Annie shows up at the exclusive, men-only club Billy was playing at and knew he would come with her. Billy acts as her sidekick and trusted partner throughout the story. Despite their age gap, it\u2019s fair to say that their friendship and camaraderie will last a long time.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Billy and Annie are old friends who have had multiple past adventures throughout the solar system. They relate to each other easily and have a sense of mutual respect. Grannie often travels throughout the solar system to gather material for her novels. Billy has often joined her as a partner in her adventures. Billy admires Annie's no-nonsense attitude and commitment to realism. He is brought into the plot to foil Doctor Universe's scheme and aids Annie in accomplishing her plan.",
        "Article": "Outside the day was beginning to wane. The Venusians, apparentlyunawed by the presence of the space ship, had already started a fireand erected the tents. We left the vessel to find a spell of broodingdesolation heavy over the improvised camp. And the evening meal thistime was a gloomy affair. When it was finished, Ezra Karn lit his pipeand switched on the portable visi set. A moment later the silence ofthe march was broken by the opening fanfare of the Doctor Universeprogram.     Great stuff, Karn commented. I sent in a couple of questions once,but I never did win nothin'. This Doctor Universe is a great guy. Oughtto make him king or somethin'.     For a moment none of us made reply. Then suddenly Grannie Annie leapedto her feet.     Say that again! she cried.     The old prospector looked startled. Why, I only said they ought tomake this Doctor Universe the big boss and....     That's it! Grannie paced ten yards off into the gathering darknessand returned quickly. Billy-boy, you were right. The man behind this      is     Doctor Universe. It was he who stole my manuscript and devised amethod to amplify the radiations of the Green Flames in the freighter'shold. He lit on a sure-fire plan to broadcast those radiations in sucha way that millions of persons would be exposed to them simultaneously.Don't you see?     I didn't see, but Grannie hurried on.     What better way to expose civilized life to the Green Flamesradiations than when the people are in a state of relaxation. TheDoctor Universe quiz program. The whole System tuned in on them, butthey were only a blind to cover up the transmission of the radiationsfrom the ore. Their power must have been amplified a thousandfold, andtheir wave-length must lie somewhere between light and the supersonicscale in that transition band which so far has defied exploration....     But with what motive? I demanded. Why should...?     Power! the old woman answered. The old thirst for dictatorialcontrol of the masses. By presenting himself as an intellectual genius,Doctor Universe utilized a bizarre method to intrench himself in theminds of the people. Oh, don't you see, Billy-boy? The Green Flames'radiations spell doom to freedom, individual liberty.     I sat there stupidly, wondering if this all were some wild dream.     And then, as I looked across at Grannie Annie, the vague light over thetents seemed to shift a little, as if one layer of the atmosphere haddropped away to be replaced by another.     There it was again, a definite movement in the air. Somehow I got theimpression I was looking around that space rather than through it. Andsimultaneously Ezra Karn uttered a howl of pain. An instant later theold prospector was rolling over and over, threshing his arms wildly.     An invisible sledge hammer descended on my shoulder. The blow wasfollowed by another and another. Heavy unseen hands held me down.Opposite me Grannie Annie and the Venusians were suffering similarpunishment, the latter screaming in pain and bewilderment.     It's the Varsoom! Ezra Karn yelled. We've got to make 'em laugh. Ouronly escape is to make 'em laugh!     He struggled to his feet and began leaping wildly around the camp fire.Abruptly his foot caught on a log protruding from the fire; he trippedand fell headlong into a mass of hot coals and ashes. Like a jumpingjack he was on his feet again, clawing dirt and soot from his eyes.     Out of the empty space about us there came a sudden hush. The unseenblows ceased in mid-career. And then the silence was rent by wildlaughter. Peal after peal of mirthful yells pounded against our ears.For many moments it continued; then it died away, and everything waspeaceful once more.     Grannie Annie picked herself up slowly. That was close, she said. Iwouldn't want to go through that again.     Ezra Karn nursed an ugly welt under one eye. Those Varsoom got a funnysense of humor, he growled.   <doc-sep> A tall man, clad in a claw-hammer coat, came out from the wings andadvanced to the footlights.     People of Swamp City, he said, bowing, permit me to introducemyself. I am Doctor Universe, and these are my nine experts.     There was a roar of applause from the      Satellite     audience. When it hadsubsided, the man continued:     As most of you are familiar with our program, it will be unnecessaryto give any advance explanation. I will only say that on this stage arenine visi sets, each tuned to one of the nine planets. At transmittingsets all over these planets listeners will appear and voice questions.These questions, my nine experts will endeavor to answer. For everyquestion missed, the sender will receive a check for one thousand      planetoles     .     One thing more. As usual we have with us a guest star who will matchher wits with the experts. May I present that renowned writer ofscience fiction, Annabella C. Flowers.     From the left wing Grannie Annie appeared. She bowed and took her placeon the dais.     The Doctor's program began. The operator of the Earth visi twisted hisdials and nodded. Blue light flickered on the pantascope panel tocoalesce slowly into the face of a red-haired man. Sharp and dear hisvoice echoed through the theater:           Who was the first Earthman to titter the sunward side of Mercury?          Doctor Universe nodded and turned to Grannie Annie who had raised herhand. She said quietly:     Charles Zanner in the year 2012. In a specially constructedtracto-car.     And so it went. Questions from Mars, from Earth, from Saturn flowed inthe visi sets. Isolated miners on Jupiter, dancers in swank Plutoniancafes strove to stump the experts. With Doctor Universe offeringbantering side play, the experts gave their answers. When they failed,or when the Truthicator flashed a red light, he announced the name ofthe winner.     It grew a little tiresome after a while and I wondered why Grannie hadbrought me here. And then I began to notice things.     The audience in the      Satellite     seemed to have lost much of itsoriginal fervor. They applauded as before but they did so only at thesignal of Doctor Universe. The spell created by the man was complete.     Pompous and erect, he strode back and forth across the stage like ageneral surveying his army. His black eyes gleamed, and his thin lipswere turned in a smile of satisfaction.     When the last question had been answered I joined the exit-movingcrowd. It was outside under the street marquee that a strange incidentoccurred.     A yellow-faced Kagor from the upper Martian desert country shuffled by,dragging his cumbersome third leg behind him. Kagors, of course, had anunpleasant history of persecution since the early colonization days ofthe Red Planet. But the thing that happened there was a throw back toan earlier era.     Someone shouted, Yah, yellow-face! Down with all Kagors! As oneman the crowd took up the cry and surged forward. The helpless Kagorwas seized and flung to the pavement. A knife appeared from nowhere,snipped the Martian's single lock of hair. A booted foot bludgeonedinto his mouth.     Moments later an official hydrocar roared up and a dozen I.P. menrushed out and scattered the crowd. But a few stragglers lingered toshout derisive epithets.     Grannie Annie came out from behind the box office then. She took my armand led me around a corner and through a doorway under a sign that readTHE JET. Inside was a deep room with booths along one wall. The placewas all but deserted.     In a booth well toward the rear the old lady surveyed me with sobereyes.     Billy-boy, did you see the way that crowd acted?     I nodded. As disgraceful an exhibition as I've ever seen. The I.P. menought to clamp down.     The I.P. men aren't strong enough.     She said it quietly, but there was a glitter in her eyes and a harshline about her usually smiling lips.     What do you mean?   <doc-sep> Grannie spilled a few shreds of Martian tobacco onto a paper and deftlyrolled herself a cigarette.     It wasn't      Guns     , it was      Pistols     ; and it wasn't      Ganymede     , it was      Pluto     .     I grinned. All complete, I'll bet, with threats against the universeand beautiful Earth heroines dragged in by the hair.     What else is there in science fiction? she demanded. You can't haveyour hero fall in love with a bug-eyed monster.     Up on the wall a clock chimed the hour. The old woman jerked to herfeet.     I almost forgot, Billy-boy. I'm due at the      Satellite     Theater in tenminutes. Come on, you're going with me.     Before I realized it, I was following her through the lounge and out tothe jetty front. Grannie Annie hailed a hydrocar. Five minutes later wedrew up before the big doors of the      Satellite     .     They don't go in for style in Swamp City. A theater to the grizzledcolonials on this side of the planet meant a shack on stilts over themuck,      zilcon     wood seats and dingy atobide lamps. But the place waspacked with miners, freight-crew-men\u2014all the tide and wash of humanitythat made Swamp City the frontier post it is.     In front was a big sign. It read:     ONE NIGHT ONLY     DOCTOR UNIVERSE AND HIS     NINE GENIUSES     THE QUESTION PROGRAM OF     THE SYSTEM     As we strode down the aisle a mangy-looking Venusian began to pound atinpan piano in the pit. Grannie Annie pushed me into a seat in thefront row.     Sit here, she said. I'm sorry about all this rush, but I'm one ofthe players in this shindig. As soon as the show is over, we'll gosomewhere and talk. She minced lightly down the aisle, climbed thestage steps and disappeared in the wings.     That damned fossilized dynamo, I muttered. She'll be the death of meyet.     The piano struck a chord in G, and the curtain went rattling up. On thestage four Earthmen, two Martians, two Venusians, and one Mercuriansat on an upraised dais. That is to say, eight of them sat. TheMercurian, a huge lump of granite-like flesh, sprawled there, palpablyuncomfortable. On the right were nine visi sets, each with its newimproved pantascope panel and switchboard. Before each set stood anEarthman operator.  "

        "Query": "What is the fate of Ezra Karn in the narrative of Doctor Universe?",
        "Summary_1": "\nGrannie Annie first meets Ezra Karn when she goes to Venus City to research the setting for her novel. Ezra Karn is a prospector who lives in a deep marsh in Varsoom country. Grannie Annie learns that the Green Flames were not all destroyed after the last dictatorship when he tells her that he stumbled upon the resource in an abandoned spaceship. \n\nGrannie Annie and Billy find Karn at his hut in the marsh. They ask Karn to take them to the Green Flames, and after some hesitation, he agrees. He knows that the only way to defeat the Varsoom is to make them laugh, but he does not know what exactly they think is funny. He is a huge fan of Doctor Universe, and he never misses a show. \n\nEzra Karn successfully takes Grannie Annie and Billy to the spaceship he previously found. Within moments of laying eyes on it, Karl yells out in pain. He rolls around on the ground, trying to stand but failing. He informs his companions that the force he is dealing with is the Varsoom, and the only way to end the madness is to make them laugh. \n\nWhen it\u2019s time to interrupt Doctor Universe\u2019s broadcast to stop him from taking over the universe, it is Karn\u2019s idea to have Grannie Annie read her book to the Varsoom. He does not realize that they will find it funny, but he does think it\u2019s a good way to get the invisible creatures\u2019 attention. He essentially saves everyone, since Grannie Annie\u2019s book makes the Varsoom laugh and laugh and make it impossible for Doctor Universe to control the minds of the masses. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Ezra is only present for a small part of the story, but he already knew Grannie Annie as they had met in Venus City. Ezra is a prospector, and he finds his home in the swamps where the Varsoom live. When Grannie Annie and Billy make it to the swamplands and marshes, they find Ezra, and Grannie Annie asks him to guide the group to the spaceship that held the Green Flames he had told her about. He agrees, though he warns the group about the Varsoom, an energy life form that could potentially be dangerous. He refuses to miss a showing of Doctor Universe\u2019s quiz show, but guides the group after the show is over. Ezra was the first person to see the ship they were looking for, and asked about the broadcasting apparatus that was built on top of it. He circled the ship with Grannie as the group split up to survey the area, and once they entered the ship, Ezra tried using his pistol to break the glass that was protecting the equipment. Eventually, after camp was set up, he watched Doctor Universe again as he smoked his pipe. When Ezra suggests that Doctor Universe is a wonderful person to be made a leader, Grannie realizes that Billy was right about Doctor Universe wanting to take over. Ezra, along with the rest of the group, experienced extreme pain as the Varsoom showed up. Ezra reminded the group that they needed to make these beings laugh, and as he did a silly dance, he tripped and fell, which did the trick. Ezra and Billy watch Grannie set up the altered visi set to disrupt the broadcast following day. He set up a lamp for Grannie when she started to read her book to the Varsoom, and once they have the laughter they needed, he turned on the equipment so that the microphone could add the laughter of the Varsoom to the Doctor Universe broadcast.",
        "Summary_3": "Ezra Karn is an elderly explorer, filled to the brim with stories and adventures galore. He first met Grannie Annie while she was researching the sequel to her latest novel. She visited Venus and Karn to fully immerse herself in the culture. His stories were so ludicrous and wonderful that she decided to turn them into her next novel. Once her manuscript was stolen and the secret stash of Golden Flame revealed, Ezra Karn was thrust into the adventure alongside Billy-Boy, her grandson. \nKarn is a devoted fan of Doctor Universe\u2019s gameshow and never missed a single broadcast. He leads their crew into the Vansoom territory, despite his anxiety. Only he and one other man had ever escaped their territory alive. \nHis guidance leaves them safe and sound, and, though he is attacked by the Vansoom, he\u2019s able to stop them by making them laugh. \nWithout Karn, they would have never discovered how to draw the Vansooms\u2019 attention and make them laugh. If they hadn\u2019t known how to make them laugh, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to defeat Doctor Universe and his evil plan.\n",

Those Varsoom got a funnysense of humor, he growled.   <doc-sep> Inside the freighter's narrow corridor Grannie faced me with eyesfilled with excitement.     Billy-boy, she said, we've got two problems now. We've got to stopDoctor Universe, and we've got to find a way of getting out of here.Right now we're nicely bottled up.     As if in answer to her words the visi set revealed the face of the quizmaster on the screen. He was saying:           Remember tomorrow at this same hour I will have a message ofunparalleled importance for the people of the nine planets. Tomorrownight I urge you, I command you, to tune in.          With a whistling intake of breath the old woman turned to one of theVenusians.     Bring all our equipment in here, she ordered. Hurry!     She untied the ribbon under her chin and took off her cap. She rolledup her sleeves, and as the Venusians came marching into the space shipwith bundles of equipment, she fell to work.     Silently Ezra Karn and I watched her. First she completely dismantledthe visi set, put it together again with an entirely altered hookup.Next she unrolled a coil of flexible copper mesh which we had broughtalong as a protective electrical screening against the marsh insects.She fastened rubberite suction cups to this mesh at intervals of everytwelve inches or more, carried it down to the freighter's hold andfastened it securely against the stepto glass wall.     Trailing a three-ply conduit up from the hold to the corridor sheselected an induction coil, several Micro-Wellman tubes and a quantityof wire from a box of spare parts. Dexterously her fingers moved in andout, fashioning a complicated and curious piece of apparatus.     At length she finished.     It's pretty hay-wire, she said, but I think it will work. Now I'lltell you what I'm going to do. When Doctor Universe broadcasts tomorrownight, he's going to announce that he has set himself up as supremedictator. He'll have the Green Flame radiations coming from this shipunder full power. I'm going to insert into his broadcast\u2014the laughingof the Varsoom!     You're going to what?     Broadcast the mass laughter from those invisible creatures out there.Visualize it, Billy-boy! At the dramatic moment when Doctor Universemakes his plea for System-wide power, he will be accompanied by wildpeals of laughter. The whole broadcast will be turned into a burlesque.     How you going to make 'em laugh? interrupted Karn.     We must think of a way, Grannie replied soberly.     I, for one, am glad that no representative of the InterstellarPsychiatry Society witnessed our antics during the early hours of thatmorning and on into the long reaches of the afternoon, as we vainlytried to provoke the laughter of the Varsoom. All to no avail. Uttersilence greeted our efforts. And the time was growing close to thescheduled Doctor Universe program.     Ezra Karn wiped a bead of perspiration from his brow. Maybe we've gotto attract their attention first, he suggested. Miss Flowers, whydon't you go up on the roof and read to 'em? Read 'em something fromone of your books, if you've got one along. That ought to make 'em situp and take notice.     For a moment the old woman gazed at him in silence. Then she got to herfeet quickly.     I'll do it, she said. I'll read them the attack scene from      MurderOn A Space Liner     .   <doc-sep> It didn't make sense, of course. But nothing made sense in this madventure. Grannie Annie opened her duffel bag and drew out a copy ofher most popular book. With the volume under her arm, she mounted theladder to the top of the envelope. Ezra Karn rigged up a radite searchlamp, and a moment later the old woman stood in the center of a circleof white radiance.     Karn gripped my arm. This is it, he said tensely. If this fails ...     His voice clipped off as Grannie began to read. She read slowlyat first, then intoned the words and sentences faster and moredramatically.     And out in the swamp a vast hush fell as if unseen ears were listening.     ...      the space liner was over on her beam ends now as another shotfrom the raider's vessel crashed into the stern hold. In the controlcabin Cuthbert Strong twisted vainly at his bonds as he sought to freehimself. Opposite him, lashed by strong Martian vinta ropes to thegravascope, Louise Belmont sobbed softly, wringing her hands in muteappeal.          A restless rustling sounded out in the marsh, as if hundreds of bodieswere surging closer. Karn nodded in awe.     She's got 'em! he whispered. Listen. They're eatin' up every word.     I heard it then, and I thought I must be dreaming. From somewhere outin the swamp a sound rose into the thick air. A high-pitched chuckle,it was. The chuckle came again. Now it was followed by another andanother. An instant later a wave of low subdued laughter rose into theair.     Ezra Karn gulped. Gripes! he said. They're laughing already.      They're laughing at her book!     And look, the old lady's gettin' sore.     Up on the roof of the envelope Grannie Annie halted her reading toglare savagely out into the darkness.     The laughter was a roar now. It rose louder and louder, peal after pealof mirthful yells and hysterical shouts. And for the first time in mylife, I saw Annabella C. Flowers mad. She stamped her foot; she shookher fist at the unseen hordes out before her.     Ignorant slap-happy fools! she screamed. You don't know good sciencefiction when you hear it.     I turned to Karn and said quietly, Turn on the visi set. DoctorUniverse should be broadcasting now. Tune your microphone to pull inas much of that laughter as you can.  "

        "Summary_1": "O\u2019Rielly is an apprentice maintaining Burner Four during his first flight on a spaceship traveling between Venus and Earth. The story begins when his supervisor, Burner Chief Callahan, alerts O\u2019Rielly that one of the controls on his burner has slipped, so he sets about resetting the controls to prevent the ship from crashing when it starts its descent toward Earth. He searches his watch room and around the burner looking for a mouse or anyone who might have moved the control. He thinks about Captain Millicent Hatwoody, the ship\u2019s commander nicknamed \u201cOld Woman\u201d, and worries she will exile him to a distant moon if she discovers the issue. During his search, he discovers a stowaway Venusian woman named Trillium on his bunk bed, and she tells him she had moved the control in order to escape the burner room where she was hiding. O\u2019Rielly is struck by her beauty and allows her to shower in his bathroom. While she is showering, Callahan to interrogate O\u2019Rielly and instructs him to take a shower because Captain Hatwoody is bringing a guest to tour the facilities. He reminds O\u2019Rielly of the history of the Earth women\u2019s supremacy over men, which began as a response to the Earth men\u2019s infatuation with Venusian women. When they established dominance, the Earth women returned the Venusian women to their planet. Consequently, the Venusian men warned of war if any Earth men attempted to contact Venusian women. For their part, Venusian women would be killed if they tried to leave. To soften the threat, Venus agreed to let Earth purchase products at a lower cost. O\u2019Rielly reminds Callahan that no Earth man has seen a Venusian woman in 125 years, and Callahan tells the story\u2014an Earth man disguised himself as a Venusian in order to visit his love, a Venusian woman named Berta. When Trillium returns, she reveals that she is Berta\u2019s granddaughter. She hides again before Captain Hatwoody arrives. The captain and her guest, a Venusian ambassador named Dimdooly, investigate the burner, and their interactions reveal conflicting attitudes towards gender superiority on Earth versus Venus. As they leave, Trillium reveals herself, and Dimdooly recognizes her as the Venusian president\u2019s granddaughter. Captain Hatwoody then calls the presidents of both planets, who begin to blame each other and threaten war. Trillium explains that it was Berta, the president\u2019s wife, who taught her how to stowaway, as she had done so herself 125 years prior. She reveals her purpose for stowing away was to draw attention to her revolutionary vision\u2014to convince Earth to stop purchasing products from Venus, thus stopping their cash flow to fund wars. She explains the wars distract Venusian men, and that is why the women are attracted to Earth men. While the president balks, his wife orders him to step aside as she has been elected new President of Venus, and the Venusian women are taking over. Trillium is rewarded with Dimdooly\u2019s ambassadorship, and Callahan and O\u2019Rielly are sent back to work. ",

O\u2019Rielly does not view women of power with respect, but he treats this woman differently and is attracted to her. There is a gender-based arrangement where women from Venus are no longer allowed on Earth, so her presence is highly illegal.\n\nCallahan (O\u2019Rielly\u2019s superior) comes into the room and discovers the woman from Venus, thinking she is named Berta.

The President of Venus tries to convince Trillium that people from Earth stole her away, but Trillium is clear that she learned from Berta (his wife) how to execute her plan. Trillium was raising awareness to Earth to stop trade with Venus to stop funding their wars.\n\nThe President of Earth cancels all trade with Venus. Berta becomes the new President of Venus through a unanimous vote. There are only females on the planet to vote, as all Venus men are at war for 10 months at a time with only 2 weeks home inbetween. Her husband is furious and does not believe women should hold power.\n\nAmbassador Dimdooly proposes marriage to Trillium aboard the spaceship. The President of Earth welcomes the idea of a female ambassador travelling Earth to create a new trade treaty. Trillium is given the role of the new Personal Ambassador in Dimdooly\u2019s place.\n\nThe Captain is tasked with giving O\u2019Rielly and Callahan a suitable reward for \u201caiding in the revolution\u201d. She chooses five minutes of leisure before they must return to their duties.\n",
        "Summary_3": "The story takes place aboard a spaceship, at a distant point in the future when women rule Earth, men rule Venus, and the two planets have a tenuous relationship based on old economic treaties, restrictions, and fears they have about one another. Apprentice Burnerman O\u2019Rielly can\u2019t figure out how one of the burners he was in charge of on a spaceship had a control slip, until he discovers that it was caused by a stowaway: a beautiful woman from Venus, who has a strange and powerful effect on O\u2019Rielly. \n\nHe tries to keep her hidden but she is discovered by his superior, Callahan, who seems to know a lot about the last Earth man to stow away to Venus 125 years ago, and who mistakes the stowaway, Trillium, for her own grandmother, Berta. Trillium seems to want to be found, and is soon revealed to the ship\u2019s Captain, Millicent Hatwoody, and an ambassador from Venus, Dimdooly. Hatwoody alerts the presidents of both Earth and Venus to the situation, and they disagree about what has happened and whose fault it is. The president of Earth thinks Trillium stowing away on an Earth vessel is tantamount to an act of war, while the president of Venus (Trillium\u2019s grandfather) thinks she must have been kidnapped by the Earth men on the ship.\n\nTrillium clarifies that she intentionally stowed away, with help from her grandmother, Berta, in order to ask the president of Earth to stop buying anything from Venus. The women of Venus want the men to stop leaving to fight in wars that the male-dominated government make up reasons to start just to keep the men occupied, and they want Earth to stop funding the wars. As her grandfather is telling Trillium that things are going to stay as they are, the Earth president says she has dissolved all trade with Venus, and Berta enters her husband\u2019s office and announces that the women of Venus have unanimously voted for Berta to take over the presidency and women to unseat the men from power. She has her female enforcers remove her husband. \n\nOn the spaceship, Dimdooly tells Trillium that he loves her and proposes. She is then given his ambassadorship. O\u2019Rielly and Callahan, heavily implied to be the man who stowed away to Venus 125 years ago and met Berta, are no longer under the Venus woman trance, and now the men of Venus are. As the presidents of Venus and Earth congratulate and thank each other, Berta asks that O\u2019Rielly and Callahan be rewarded for accidentally helping with their plan. Captain Hatwoody awards them each five minutes of leisure time, and Callahan thinks they\u2019re lucky to be alive. \n\nAs the story ends, O\u2019Rielly gets Callahan to tell him why the women of Venus didn\u2019t keep him there if they were lonely, and Callahan reveals that because he didn\u2019t have the \u201cearth beards\u201d that men of Venus have to clutch and tickle the women\u2019s ears, he wasn\u2019t of much use to them. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Apprentice Burnerman O\u2019Rielly discovers that one of the burners he is responsible for has been reset, but he can\u2019t figure out how that happened since no one has passed through his room outside the burner room to get to it. When he returns to his watch room, a beautiful woman from Venus is on his bunk. She explains that she changed the setting because she was in the burner room and couldn\u2019t open the door when it grew too warm for her. \n\nO\u2019Rielly\u2019s superior, Chief Callahan, arrives to see what caused the problem. Callahan discovers the woman from Venus. He reminds O\u2019Rielly that the first flight from Earth to Venus was made one thousand years ago, and the men from Earth immediately fell in love with the women from Venus and brought some of them back to Earth. Women on Earth were angered by the Earthmen\u2019s behaviors and took over the control of Earth. They took the Venus women back to Venus and warned that there would be a war if any of them came back to Earth. The last time an Earthman was near a Venus woman was 125 years ago when he stuffed himself into a luggage bag and made himself a pair of fake ear beards with worms in them to make them move so he could pass himself off as a Venus man. \n\nThe girl from Venus steps out of the shower, and Callahan calls her \u201cBerta,\u201d but she says her name is \u201cTrillium\u201d and that her grandmother\u2019s name is Berta. Trillium is said to look just as Berta did 125 years ago. O\u2019Rielly hides Trillium under his cot just before Captain Hatwoody enters to check on the burner problem. She is also escorting the Dimdooly, the Personal Assistant of the President of Venus, on a ship tour. Just as the Ambassador and Hatwoody are leaving, Trillium makes a loud bump, and they discover her. The Ambassador is certain she has been kidnapped, but Trillium explains that she stowed away.\n\nHatwoody takes everyone to her office where she calls the presidents of both Earth and Venus. The president of Venus is Trillium\u2019s grandfather. He says she couldn\u2019t have stolen away on her own and demands the truth, so she explains that her grandmother, his wife, told her how to do it. Trillium explains she stowed away to bring the cause of the Venus women to Earth\u2019s attention. She wants Earth to stop trading with Venus so that Venus won\u2019t have the money to keep sending its men to wars for all but two weeks every year. The Venus president\u2019s wife interrupts and declares she\u2019s taking over the presidency; she orders her women to take her husband away and appoints Trillium her new ambassador. O\u2019Rielly realizes Callahan was the last Earthman to meet a Venus woman in person and was the one who tried to stow away to Venus. He was caught because his fake ear beards didn\u2019t grab hold of Berta\u2019s ears like real ones do.\n",

        "Query": "What is the backdrop of the story IMAGE OF SPLENDOR?",
        "Summary_1": "The story takes place on a spaceship that shuttles between Earth and Venus. The ship is commanded by Captain Hatwoody, a stern woman who represents the matriarchy that has taken over Earth. The majority of the story\u2019s narrative happens in Apprentice Burnerman O\u2019Rielly\u2019s watch room. This is a simple room equipped with a bunk bed and bathing facilities, which includes a shower. From this room, he is able to maintain careful stewardship of Burner Four, which helps power the ship. When Callahan notifies O\u2019Rielly that one of his controls has slipped, O\u2019Rielly investigates the burner to find the culprit of the situation. After he discovers Trillium, she uses his bathing facilities to wash herself of the stink from the burner room where she was stowing away. After Callahan enters the watch room and learns of Trillium\u2019s presence, he encourages her to hide again because of Captain Hatwoody\u2019s impending visit. She hides beneath O\u2019Rielly\u2019s bunk. After Captain Hatwoody and her guest, Ambassador Dimdooly, stumble upon Trillium, the captain demands that they all follow her to her office. In her office, she convenes a conference with the presidents of Earth and Venus. After Berta\u2014Trillium\u2019s grandmother, the wife of the current Venusian president, and Callahan\u2019s former love interest\u2014reveals herself as the new ruler of Venus, O\u2019Rielly and Callahan are given a five-minute break and sent back to their former duties managing the burners below.",
        "Summary_2": "The story takes place on a spacecraft led by the female Captain Hatwoody. The main settings are in O\u2019Rielly\u2019s bunk room, shower, burner room four, and the command center of the craft. It is described as quite a large ship with many rooms and crew. The craft is on a mission to deliver the Personal Ambassador to the President of Venus to Earth from the planet of Venus. The spacecraft is in transit during the story, and there are no settings on either of the planets themselves, only the ship.\n",
        "Summary_3": "The setting of the story includes multiple areas of a spaceship, including one of its burner rooms, the watch room, bunk, locker, and shower of O\u2019Rielly, and Captain Hatwoody\u2019s office. The ship is in outer space, approaching but not yet within Earth\u2019s orbit. Several other locations are described, either involving characters who are communicating remotely (the presidents of Earth and Venus talking to Captain Hatwoody from their offices on their respective planets via video panels), or describing past events (Callahan describing his adventures stowing away while on vacation and traveling to Venus). Several past events are also discussed that include Earth, Venus, and/or spacecrafts. The story is set over 1,000 years in the future. \n",
        "Summary_4": "The story is set on an Earth spaceship in the future one thousand years after Earth completed its first successful flight to Venus. It specifically starts in Burnerman O\u2019Rielly\u2019s watch room outside burner room number four for which he is responsible. The ship is returning to Earth, and burner number four has a fusion control reading that is two points low. This can cause the ship to crash on landing. The ship has futuristic features including an electronic shower that can cleanse a person and his clothes in a matter of minutes and video conference calls. On the initial flight from Earth to Venus, the Earthmen discovered the beauty of the Venus women and immediately fell in love with them. They took some Venus women back to Earth, and men there abandoned everything, even their wives and families, to try to be with the Venus women. Earth women were angry at how the men acted and took control of the planet; they also sent all the Venus women back to their home planet. Now Earth and Venus trade with each other, but Earthmen and Venus women are not allowed to be together because doing so can spark a war between the two planets. Earth has a female president, and women hold all the positions of authority over men. Venus has a male president who is very traditional and does not agree with the women of Venus that their men need to be home for more than two weeks every year and spend the rest of their time fighting in wars. Venus men look down on Earthmen for being subservient to women.",

His fur, which should have been alustrous black, was a dull gray, and his eyes were wet and sad. Histail drooped. His voice was little more than a faint whimper, even atfull volume.     Begging your most honored pardon most humbly, important sir. I am abeing of Stortul XII, having sold my last few possessions to travelto Ghryne for the miserable purpose of obtaining an interview withyourself.     I said, I'd better tell you right at the outset that we're alreadycarrying our full complement of Stortulians. We have both a male and afemale now and\u2014     This is known to me. The female\u2014is her name perchance Tiress?     I glanced down at the inventory chart until I found the Stortulianentry. Yes, that's her name.     The little being immediately emitted a soul-shaking gasp. It is she!It is she!     I'm afraid we don't have room for any more\u2014     You are not in full understanding of my plight. The female Tiress,she is\u2014was\u2014my own Fire-sent spouse, my comfort and my warmth, my lifeand my love.     Funny, I said. When we signed her three years ago, she said she wassingle. It's right here on the chart.     She lied! She left my burrow because she longed to see the splendorsof Earth. And I am alone, bound by our sacred customs never to remarry,languishing in sadness and pining for her return. You      must     take me toEarth!     But\u2014     I must see her\u2014her and this disgrace-bringing lover of hers. I mustreason with her. Earthman, can't you see I must appeal to her innerflame?      I must bring her back!          My face was expressionless. You don't really intend to join ourorganization at all\u2014you just want free passage to Earth?     Yes, yes! wailed the Stortulian. Find some other member of my race,if you must! Let me have my wife again, Earthman! Is your heart a deadlump of stone?   <doc-sep> Don't you see, the lady continued. Everything that Xartal put onpaper has been seen by one or more of these cockatoos. The cockatoosare like Earth parrots all right, but not only have they the powerof copying speech, they also have the ability to recreate a mentalimage of what they have seen. In other words their brains form apowerful photographic impression of the object. That impression isthen transmitted simultaneously in telepathic wavelengths to commonfoci. That eyrie might be likened to a cinema screen, receiving brainvibrations from a hundred different sources that blend into the lightfield to form what are apparently three-dimensional images.     The Larynx manager nodded slowly. I see, he said. But why don't thebirds reconstruct images from the actual person. Why use drawings?     Probably because the drawings are exaggerated in certain details andmade a greater impression on their brains, Grannie replied.     Up on the eyrie a strange performance was taking place. The duplicateof Grannie Annie was bowing to the duplicate of Jimmy Baker, and theimage of Ezra Karn was playing leap frog with the image of Antlers Park.     Then abruptly the screen before me blurred and went blank.     Sorry, the operator said. I've used too much power already. Have togive the generators a chance to build it up again.     Nodding, I turned and motioned to Karn. We went back downstairs.     That explains something at any rate, the old prospector said. Buthow about that Red spot fever?     On Jimmy Baker's desk was a large file marked: FEVER VICTIMS. I openedit and found it contained the case histories of those men who had beenattacked by the strange malady.     Reading them over, I was struck by one detail. Each patient hadreceived the first symptoms, not while working in the mines, but whilesleeping or lounging in the barracks.     Five minutes later Karn and I were striding down a white ramp thatled to the nearest barracks. The building came into sight, a lowrectangular structure, dome-roofed to withstand the violent winds.     Inside double tiers of bunks stretched along either wall. In thosebunks some thirty men lay sleeping.     The far wall was taken up by a huge window of denvo-quartz. As I stoodthere, something suddenly caught Ezra Karn's eye. He began to walktoward that window.     Look here, he said.     Six feet up on that window a small almost imperceptible button of dullmetal had been wedged into an aperture cut in the quartz. The centralpart of the button appeared to be a powerful lens of some kind, and asI seized it and pulled it loose, I felt the hum of tiny clock work.     All at once I had it! Red spot fever. Heat fever from the infra-redrays of Jupiter's great spot. Someone had constructed this lens toconcentrate and amplify the power of those rays. The internal clockworkserved a double purpose. It opened a shutter, and it rotated the lensslowly so that it played for a time on each of the sleeping men.     I slid the metal button in my pocket and left the barracks at a run.Back in the visiscreen room, I snapped to the operator:     Turn it on!     The kite car swam into view in the screen above the instrument panel.I stared with open eyes. Jimmy Baker no longer was in the car, norwas Xartal, the Martian. Grannie Annie was there, but seated at thecontrols was Antlers Park, the manager of Interstellar Voice.  "

        "Summary_1": "Callahan is Burner Chief on the ship and has been flying as a professional Burnerman for 125 years. Berta is the first lady of Venus, and the grandmother of Trillium. When O\u2019Rielly is trying to hide Trillium in his shower, Callahan tells the story of when women first took control of Earth: They were not pleased that Earth men were so entranced by Venusian women, and so they took over leadership of the planet and sent all Venusian women back to their own planet. Likewise, Venusian men banned Earth men from interacting with Venusian women under threat of war. This led to an agreement where Earth and Venus could conduct trade together for cheaper prices. Callahan suggests that he was the last man to touch a Venusian woman, and he did so by hiding himself inside a large bag and sneaking through customs disguised as a Venusian man with a long, fake beard. The woman he was sneaking in to see turned out to be Berta, and Callahan says she ultimately rejected him because she could tell his beard was fake, and Venusian women loved to be tickled by real beards. \n",

Berta stowed away on a spaceship 125 years ago.\n\nCallahan thinks that Trillium is Berta when he first catches her in O\u2019Rielly\u2019s bunk room. Callahan appears to have had a history with Berta 125 years ago when she stowed away aboard a spaceship. \n\nCallahan and Berta do not interact often in the story, but Callahan is eager to be present when she is discovered by the Captain and to know how the situation will play out given that women from Venus are not allowed to travel to Earth.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Callahan is an older officer aboard the ship, and Berta is an older woman of Venus, married to its longtime ruler. As Callahan references the tale of the Earth man who stowed away to Venus 125 years ago, it becomes clearer and clearer that he is likely the man in question. When he first sees Trillium, he mistakes her for Berta, and she says that she is her granddaughter but looks like Berta did 125 years earlier. It later turns out that Berta coached Trillium to use Callahan\u2019s stowaway method (hiding in a ditty bag) for their plan. Though Callahan was as taken with Berta as O\u2019Rielly is with Trillium, at the conclusion of the story we learn that Callahan was sent away from Venus due to his lack of ear beards, and resultant inability to tickle women\u2019s ears. However, he always remembers Berta and assists her granddaughter, and after Berta is elected president she asks that he be rewarded for this. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Callahan is the Earthman who is the last known man to interact with a Venus woman 125 years ago, and Berta is the Venus woman he fell for. He tells O\u2019Rielly that the last Earth guy who tried to stay with a Venus woman hid in a large luggage bag to be shipped to Venus and attached to himself a pair of fake ear beards with Jupiter wiggle worms in them to make the beards move. At the time of the story, Callahan is O\u2019Rielly\u2019s commanding officer who catches O\u2019Rielly with a Venus woman on the ship. When he sees the Venus woman, he calls her Berta, but Trillium explains that her grandmother is named Berta, and everyone says she looks just like her grandmother did 125 years ago. Callahan tries to prevent Captain Hatwoody from discovering Trillium is there; when she does make the discovery and contacts the presidents of Earth and Venus, the president of Venus confirms that Trillium is his granddaughter. Trillium reveals that her grandmother, Berta, explained to her how to stow away on the ship and that her grandmother was the Venus woman that the Earthman 125 years ago was trying to see. As the video conference continues, Berta enters the room where the president of Venus is and announces that she has been elected president of Venus by all the women on Venus and is replacing him. She also says that Callahan and O\u2019Rielly are proof that Venus women are no longer a threat to Earth\u2019s peace, and she asks the Earth president to reward them for their assistance in Venus\u2019s revolution. Callahan reveals to O\u2019Rielly that his disguise was discovered because his ear beards didn\u2019t reach out and grab Berta around the ears when he kissed her.",
        "Article": "Venus boys rared up and served notice that if Earth ever got any funnynotions, right away there wouldn't be enough Earth left to hide in anatom's eyebrow. Touchy as hornets on a hot griddle, them Venus guys.Crazier than bed bugs about war. Could smell a loose dollar a millionlight years away too. Finagled around until they finally cooked up adeal.     No Venus dames allowed within fifty miles of their port. Earth guysstay inside the high-voltage fence. Any dame caught trying to leaveVenus thrown to the tigers for supper. Same for any Earth guy caughtaround a Venus dame. In return, Earth could buy practically everythingat bargain basement prices.     Oh, I was shown the history films in pre-flight, O'Rielly said, stilldreamily. But not a peek of any Venus dame.     Pray heaven you'll never lay eyes on one nor have one get within tenfoot of you! Even though you'd know she'd be your damnation wouldn'tmake a whit difference\u2014you'd still act sappier than thirty-sevenangels flying on vino. Callahan suddenly stared at O'Rielly. Holyhollering saints!     Now, now, Burner Chief Callahan, sir, O'Rielly responded with an airylaugh. No Earth guy for a hundred twenty-five years been near one andlived to tell it, has he?     So the whispers run, Callahan murmured with a queer flame dancinginto his eyes. So the old whispers still run.     Never a name, though. Never how it was done. O'Rielly snorted.Probably just a goofy tale set loose by some old space bum.     Oh? Callahan bristled up like a bad name had been bandied about.Seen them ditty bags Venus bigwigs have, ain't you? Some big enough tostuff a cow in. Notice how nobody ever dares question a bigwig's bags,even through customs? Just run 'em through the big Geiger that tellswhether there's any fusionable junk inside. Well, our boy got himselfone of them bags, stuffed himself inside and joined a bigwig's pile of'em.     Didn't pull it whilst on the Venus port during a layover either, whena crew check would of turned him up missing. Pulled it on vacation.Started on the Earth end. Made himself a pair of beards to paste on hisears of course. Wove Jupiter wiggle worms in to keep the beards moving.Wasn't like the real thing, but good enough to flimflam Venus guys.     With suddenly enlivened interest O'Rielly looked at Callahan. Hey, howcome you know so much?     Hah? What? Callahan blinked like waking from a trance; even groanedto himself, something that sounded like, Blabbering like I'd hada nip myself\u2014or one of them dillies was radiating nearby. ThenCallahan glared fit to drill holes in O'Rielly's head. Look! I wasa full Burnerman before you was born. Been flying the spaces hundredtwenty-five years now. Had more chances to hear more\u2014just hear more,you hear! Only tried to clear your mind about Venus dames so you couldput your brain on your control mess. So now put it! If you ain't highon vino and ain't been made nuts by a Venus dame, what answer do wefeed the Old Woman?     Search me, Apprentice Burnerman O'Rielly responded cheerfully.     Of all the loony apprentices I ever had to answer the Old Woman for!Awp, lemme out where I can think of something to save me own neck atleast!     Was all O'Rielly could do to keep from rolling on the deck with glee.Old Callahan had been flimflammed for fair! The dear little stowawaywas saved! And O'Rielly would now think of grand ways to save herlovely neck and his own forever.     O'Rielly's shower door, however, opened abruptly. O'Rielly had notopened it. O'Rielly, however, suffered a cruel stab of dismay. Surelyhis dear stowaway had been listening through the door. Why didn't shehave brains enough to stay hid until Callahan was gone!     At sight of her, of course, Callahan's eyes near popped from his oldhead. Berta!     Oh, I'm Trillium, she assured Callahan sweetly. But Grandmamma'sname is Berta and people say I'm just like she was a hundred andtwenty-five years ago.   <doc-sep> Dimdooly\u2014the mighty, the lordly, who had sneered at the sight of mereEarthmen kowtowing to a mere woman\u2014swelled up fit to blow his gaskets,then all the gas went out of him. His ear beards, however, still hadenough zip left to flutter like butterflies. Yes, Trillium dear. Ilove only you. Please marry me at your earliest convenience.     Well, Grandmamma, Trillium said with a highly self-satisfied air, itworks. And just like you said, Earthmen meant nothing once I knew weVenus women had our own men in our power.     Those crewmen there, Grandmamma President said, seem to be proofenough that we Venus women no longer radiate any threat to Earth'stranquility.     Yes, ma'am, O'Rielly sure felt like proof of something all of a sudden.Worse than the hangover from that crap game with Venus vino. He lookedaway from Trillium and took a look at Callahan. Old guy looked awayfrom Grandmamma President like he was packing the second biggestheadache in history.     Hmmmm, yes, Madame President of Earth observed. Reactions agreeperfectly with the psychoanalytical research project we have beenconducting on the subject of the Venus female influence. MadamePresident of Venus, congratulations on your victory!     Long may the superior sex reign on Venus too! We shall be delighted toreceive an Ambassadoress to discuss a new trade treaty at your earliestconvenience.     Thank you for cancelling the old trade agreements at the psychologicalmoment, Grandmamma President said cordially. What with thecommunications mixup, we managed to have the scenes on these panelsbroadcast throughout all Venus. When the rug went out from under thetop man, the tide really turned in our favor. Now, Trillium, you takeover Dimmy's credentials.     The Ambassadorial Suite, too, Madame President of Earth saidgraciously. Anything else now, Berta?     I should like, Grandmamma President Berta said charmingly, thatMr. O'Rielly and Mr. Callahan be suitably rewarded for assisting ourrevolution better than they knew.     Of course, Madame President of Earth was delighted to oblige. Nodoubt Captain Hatwoody knows what reward would satisfy their needsbest.     The Madame Presidents switched to a private circuit, Trillium draggedDimdooly off somewhere and the Old Woman eyed O'Rielly and Callahan.Especially she eyed Callahan, like running chilled drills through hisold conniving brain. I award the pair of you five minutes leisurebefore returning to your stations.     Oh, well, O'Rielly muttered, once he and Callahan were safely beyondearshot, could have been rewarded worse, I suppose.     What you expect for being flimflammed by a foreign dame, the rings ofSaturn? Lucky we ain't programmed to be hung, shot and thrown to thecrows for breakfast. Callahan's old pick-and-shovel face wore a littlegrin like the cat that nobody could prove ate the canary.     You\u2014I mean, that Earth guy a hundred twenty-five years ago, O'Riellysaid in sudden thought. If Venus dames wanted to be loved so bad, whydid Trillium's Grandmamma let him go?     Venus guys wasn't so busy playing war all the time, Callahan mumbled,like to himself, they'd of found out the answer centuries ago. Yep,guess our boy was the only guy on Earth or Venus to find out and live.Dames bossing both planets now, though, his old secret won't be onemuch longer. Venus dames could of let it out centuries ago themselvesbut didn't, just to spite Earth probably. Later, was part of organizingto take over Venus, I guess.     O'Rielly still had memories of the way he had felt about Trilliumbefore her revolution. All right, Callahan, why did 'our boy' leaveGrandmamma?     Yes, ma'am, Callahan sighed like he hadn't heard a word O'Riellysaid, you could sweet-talk 'em, kiss 'em and hold 'em tighter'nBilly-be-damned. And that's all.     I'm not sure, O'Rielly said, what you mean by, 'that's all.'     Anybody ever seen anybody but a Venus guy come built with ear beards?Course not.     But I thought our boy was wearing the best fakes ever.     Ain't nothing can match the natural growed-on variety, no, ma'am.Venus guy kisses a Venus dame, his beards grabs her roundst the ears.     So what?     Tickles 'em, boy, tickles 'em!    <doc-sep>   IMAGE OF SPLENDOR     By LU KELLA       From Venus to Earth, and all the way between,       it was a hell of a world for men ... and       Apprentice Burnerman O'Rielly particularly.       [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Planet Stories Summer 1955.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      The intercom roared fit to blow O'Rielly back to Venus. Burner Four!     On my way, sir!     At the first flash of red on the bank of meters Apprentice BurnermanO'Rielly had slammed the safety helmet on his head; he was alreadythrowing open the lock to the burner room. The hot, throbbing rumblewhipped around him and near crushed his breath away. Power! Power ofthe universe trapped here and ready to destroy its captors given onechance! Swiftly O'Rielly unlocked the controls and reset them. Thethrobbing rumble changed tone.     Old Callahan's voice crackled now through the helmet's ear contact.Well, Mr. O'Rielly?     Fusion control two points low, sir.     O'Rielly wondered had Callahan passed out, was so long before the oldBurner Chief demanded hoarsely, Didn't you lock them controls beforeblast-off?     If every control hadn't been locked in correct setting, O'Riellyanswered from his own angry bewilderment, the error would haveregistered before blast-off\u2014wouldn't it, sir?     So a control reset itself in flight, hey?     I don't know yet, sir.     Well, Mr. O'Rielly, you better know before we orbit Earth!     The icy knot in O'Rielly's stomach jerked tighter. A dozen burners onthis ship; why did something crazy have to happen to O'Rielly's? In ahundred years, so the instructors\u2014brisk females all\u2014had told O'Riellyin pre-flight school, no control had ever been known to slip. But onehad moved here. Not enough to cause serious trouble this far out fromEarth. On blast-down, though, with one jet below peak, the uneventhrust could throw the ship, crash it, the whole lovely thing and allaboard gone in a churning cloud.     Sweat pouring off him, O'Rielly prowled around his burner. Design ofthe thing had been bossed by dames of course; what on Earth wasn't anymore? Anyway, nobody could get to a burner except through its watchroom. Anyone entered or left there, a bell clanged, lights flashedand a meter registered beside the Burnerman's bunk and on the BurnerChief's console up in the flight room full of beautifully efficientofficers. Ever since Venus blast-off O'Rielly had been in Four's watchroom. Nobody had passed through. O'Rielly knew it. Callahan knew it.By now the Old Woman herself, Captain Millicent Hatwoody, had probablyinquired what was in charge of Burner Four.     Well, ma'am, O'Rielly searched every cranny where even a three-tailedmouse of Venus could have stowed away. His first flight, and O'Riellysaw himself washed out, busted to sweeper on the blast-off stands ofsome God-forsaken satellite. He staggered back into his watch room. Andhis brain was suddenly taken apart and slapped together again. Feltthat way.     She was sitting on his bunk. No three-tailed mouse. No Old Womaneither. Oh, she was a female human, though, this creature at whichO'Rielly stood gaping. Yes, ma'am!     I was in your burner room. Her voice matched the rest of her, a blendof loveliness unlike anything outside a guy's most secret dreams. Icouldn't stand the heat any longer and I couldn't open that big door.So I moved one of your controls a tiny bit. All the noise in there,naturally you couldn't hear me walk out while your back was turnedresetting the control.  "

        "Query": "What was the intention of Trillium when she boarded the ship without permission in IMAGE OF SPLENDOR?",
        "Summary_1": "Trillium is the granddaughter of the President of Venus and his wife, Berta. One-hundred twenty-five years ago, Berta learned from Callahan\u2019s example how to stowaway and break the rules devised between the two planets. She taught her granddaughter how to do the same, so Trillium took this knowledge to implement her own plan. Trillium represents the women of Venus, who are tired of the lack of attention they receive from Venusian men; the men are far more interested in war and harbor misogynistic attitudes towards women. Likewise, the women rulers of Earth treat men as their inferiors as a result of their lust for Venusian women. When Trillium is discovered, this triggers a meeting between the two presidents of Earth and Venus, and the president of Earth announces that her presence on the ship signifies a breach in their rules. Therefore, the special arrangement between the two planets is ended, and Earth no longer recognizes Dimdooly\u2019s ambassadorship. As the Venusian president resists, he also learns that his wife Berta has been elected the new President of Venus, and that women will now take over just as they did on Earth. She orders her husband to be taken away. After Dimdooly loses his position, he announces his love for Trillium, which confirms her plan to regain the amorous attentions of Venusian men has worked. As a reward for her role in the revolution, Trillium receives Dimdooly\u2019s ambassadorship.\n",
        "Summary_2": "She wanted to bring attention to her cause as a revolutionary and explain that if Earth would stop buying things from Venus, then they would stop funding Venus\u2019 wars like they have been for the past 10,000 years. Trillium explains that women of Venus would like the men of Venus to instead remain on the planet and do useful work. \nHowever, it turns out that Trillium is part of a larger plan for her grandmother to overthrow her grandfather as President of Venus, which they succeed in doing.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Trillium\u2019s plan, which she undertook at her grandmother\u2019s behest and with her assistance, was to stow away on the Earth ship to draw the Earth president\u2019s attention to her cause. Berta and Trillium want to beseech Earth\u2019s government to stop supporting Venus\u2019s economy and funding their constant warfare. The women of Venus want the men of Venus to spend time with them rather than constantly going into battle, and Berta and Trillium have devised a way to get Earth to cooperate in their efforts to switch control of Venus from men to women. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Trillium plans to follow her grandmother\u2019s plan and stow away on the ship and travel to Earth. She stows away because that is the only way that the women of Venus can get the attention of Earth\u2019s president. She wants Earth to agree to stop trade with Venus so that Venus will no longer have the money to keep its men in wars all the time. She claims that Venus men are so excited all the time about going to war that they don\u2019t have time for the Venus women. It is the Venus women\u2019s desire to be loved that makes them so irresistible to Earthmen. Although the Venus government allows its men two weeks at home from war each year, the Venus women want their men for longer than that so that the men can do useful work. As a result of the stowaway incident, the president of Earth cancels all trade agreements with Venus. Once Venus women have the Venus men under their power, they no longer have any interest in Earthmen. When Trillium\u2019s grandmother becomes president of Venus, she makes Trillium the new Ambassador to Earth.",
        "Article": "Seeming to grind her teeth, the Old O Woman turned abruptly to leaveO'Rielly's watch room. Was all O'Rielly could do to keep from bustingout laughing for joy.     Old Woman had been flimflammed for fair! Dear Trillium was saved! Andbetwixt O'Rielly's grand brain and Callahan's great experience she'd behappy forever.     A fine loud thump, however, was now heard. Old Woman whirled back andyanked open the doors under O'Rielly's bunk.     Of all the sappy hiding places! Callahan yelped, in surprise ofcourse.     Trillium? His Excellency bellowed as if stung by one of thesabre-tailed hornets of his native planet. Trillium!     Trillium, O'Rielly pleaded in loving anguish, why do you have tokeep coming out of hiding just when nobody's going to find you?     Her eyes merely became deep pools in which O'Rielly would have gladlydrowned himself if he could.       There are rewards, the Old Woman said with the deadly coldness ofouter space, for Earthmen found in a Venus woman's company, and forher leaving her planet.     Shut up! His Excellency's ear beards were standing straight outsideways. I'll handle this!     May I remind His Excellency, the Old Woman snapped, that I representEarth and her dominion of space gained by right of original flight!     May I remind the Captain, His Excellency declared fit to be heardback to his planet, that I am the Personal Ambassador of the Presidentof Venus and this thing can mean war!     Yes! War in which people will actually die! As His Excellency paledat that grisly remark, the Old Woman spoke through her teeth atO'Rielly, Callahan and Trillium. All right, come along!     O'Rielly joined the death march gladly. He felt the way Callahanlooked: ready to wrap his arms around Trillium's brave loveliness andprotect it to his last breath of life.     Old Woman led the way to her office. Jabbed some buttons on her desk.Panels on opposite walls lit up.     Presidents of Earth and Venus, please, the Old Woman stated evenly.Interplanetary emergency.     Highly groomed flunkies appeared on the panels and were impersonallypleasant.     Madame President's office. She is in a Cabinet meeting.     Mr. President's office. He is in personal command of our glorious warefforts.     Old Woman sighed through her teeth. Venus woman aboard this ship.Stowaway. Rattle that around your belfries.     The flunkies' faces went slack with shock, then were replaced by ablizzard of scrambled faces and torrents of incoherent voices.     Finally on the Earth panel appeared the famous classic features. Thefacts, if you please, Captain Hatwoody.     The Venus panel finally held steady on universally notorious features,that were as fierce as an eagle's, in a fancy war helmet. Trillium! Myown granddaughter? Impossible! Dimdooly, Mr. President roared at hisExcellency, what's this nonsense?     Some loud creature is interfering, Madame President snapped withannoyance.     Blasted fools still have the circuits crossed, Mr. President swore.Some silly female cackling now!     The parties in the panels saw each other now. Each one's left hand on adesk moved toward a big red button marked, ROCKETS.     So, Mr. President said evenly. Another violation by your Earthmen.     By your granddaughter, at least, Madame President replied coolly.     An innocent child, Mr. President snapped, obviously kidnapped bythose two idiotic Earthmen there!     Oh, no, Grandpapa, Trillium said swiftly; I stole away all bymyself, and Mr. O'Rielly and Callahan have been very helpful.     Impossible! Grandpapa President's ear beards stood near straight upas he roared, You couldn't have stolen away by yourself! Trillium,tell the truth!     Very well. Grandmamma told me how.   <doc-sep> Obviously Trillium's poor little brain has been drugged, HisExcellency Dimdooly declared. Grandmamma Berta wouldn't know the firstthing about such things!     Impossible! Grandpapa President agreed. I've been married to herfor a hundred and twenty-four and a half years and she's the finestrattle-brain I ever knew!     She learned, Trillium stated emphatically, a hundred and twenty-fiveyears ago.     Hundred twenty-five, Grandpapa president growled like a boilingvolcano. The year some Earthman.... Never did catch the devil....Berta? Impossible!     Madame President's shapely finger now rested full on the button thatcould launch the fleets of war rockets that had been pre-aimed for athousand years. I'm afraid your Ambassador is unwelcome now, MadamePresident stated coolly. Your granddaughter's actions have every markof an invasion tactic by your government.     What do you mean, her actions? Grandpapa President's finger now laypoised on the button that had been waiting a thousand years to blowEarth out of the universe. My grandchild was kidnapped by men underyour official command! Weren't you, Trillium dear?     No. One of us stowing away was the only way we Venus women could bringour cause to the attention of Earth's President. If Earth will onlystop buying from Venus, you won't have any money to squander on yourwars any longer no matter what happens to we revolutionaries!     Revolutionaries? Such claptrap! And what's wrong with my wars? Peoplehave to have something to keep their minds off their troubles! Nobodyaround here gets hurt. Oh, maybe a few scratches here and there. Butnobody on Venus dies from the things any more.     But Venus men are so excited all the time about going to war theyhaven't time for us women. That's why we always radiated such a fatalattraction for Earthmen. We want to be loved! We want our own men homedoing useful work!     Well, they do come home and do useful work! Couple weeks every tenmonths. Proven to be a highly efficient arrangement.     More boys to run off to your old wars and more girls to stay home andbe lonely!     Now you just listen to me, Trillium! Grandpapa President was allVenus manhood laying down the law. That's the way things have been onVenus for ten thousand years and all the women in the universe can'tchange it!     I have been in constant contact with my Cabinet during theseconversations, Madame President said crisply. Earth is terminatingall trade agreements with Venus as of this instant.     What? Grandpapa's beards near pulled his ears off. It's not legal!You can't get away with this!     Take your finger off that trigger, boy! a heavenly voice similar toTrillium's advised from the Venus panel.     Whereupon Grandpapa glared to one side. Berta! What are you doinghere? I am deciding matters of the gravest interplanetary nature!     Were. Features more beautifully mature than Trillium's crowded ontothe panel too. From now on I'm doing the deciding.     Nonsense! You're only my wife!     And new President of Venus, elected by unanimous vote of all women.     Impossible! The men run Venus! Nobody's turning this planet intoanother Earth where a man can't even sneeze unless some woman says so!     Take him away, girls, Berta ordered coolly, whereupon her spouse wasyanked from view.     His bellows, however, could be heard yet. Unhand me, you foolcreatures! Guards! Guards!     Save your breath, Berta advised him. And while you're in the cooler,enjoy this latest batch of surrender communiques. We women are incontrol everywhere now.     Dimmy, Trillium was saying firmly to His Excellency, you have beataround the bush with me long enough. Now say it!   <doc-sep> Dimdooly\u2014the mighty, the lordly, who had sneered at the sight of mereEarthmen kowtowing to a mere woman\u2014swelled up fit to blow his gaskets,then all the gas went out of him.

        "Query": "How do Captain Hatwoody and Ambassador Dimdooly's relationship evolve in the course of the story IMAGE OF SPLENDOR?",
        "Summary_1": "Captain Hatwoody is the commander of the ship that ferries between Earth and Venus. She is a stern, efficient Earth woman with a vocal disdain for men. Behind her back, the men of her crew refer to her as \u201cthe Old Woman.\u201d Ambassador Dimdooly is a Venusian who works as the right-hand man of the President of Venus. Similar to Hatwoody\u2019s disgust for men, Ambassador Dimdooly harbors a deep-seated misogyny. Both characters\u2019 innate sexism is reflected in the social orders of their individual planets and are the result of over one-hundred years of conflict. Captain Hatwoody plays gracious host to Ambassador Dimdooly when he visits the ship, even referring to him as \u201cExcellency.\u201d However, their tensions are revealed when together they inspect Burner Four after visiting O\u2019Rielly in his watch room. They each make snarky comments to each other about the inferiority of the others\u2019 respective gender. Their attitudes are reflected later during the confrontational meeting between the presidents of Earth and Venus in Captain Hatwoody\u2019s office. These two characters\u2019 interactions are essential in highlighting the gender conflict that explodes at the story\u2019s end when both Earth and Venusian women solidify their rule over their respective planets.\n",
        "Summary_2": "The male staff on the ship call Captain Hatwoody \u201cOld Woman\u201d and she is described in language that suggests she is cold and unfeeling. This appears to be a product of their failing to recognize her power as a superior and their discomfort with having a woman in charge. \nAmbassador Dimdooly is the Personal Ambassador to the President of Venus. He speaks down to the Captain as a \u201clesser gender\u201d. After the discovery of Trillium he bades to handle it himself, because he knows that she is the granddaughter of the President and that her stowing away could be cause for war.\nThe Captain and the Ambassador have tense interactions. The Ambassador does not think the Captain should be in a position of power as a woman and looks down upon the male staff on the ship that stand at her command. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The relationship between Captain Hatwoody and Ambassador Dimdooly is a tense professional relationship between two high-ranking officials from societies with disparate cultural values and gender norms. Dimdooly is from Venus, where men are in control of the government and considered the dominant sex, and Hatwoody is from Earth, where the opposite is true. Dimdooly is an Ambassador being shown around the ship of which Hatwoody is the captain. Dimdooly appears to be disgusted at the male crew members taking orders from a woman, and he and the captain disagree about who should get \u201cprecedence\u201d in terms of who will shower first and where based on which of them has the superior status. Their interactions are characterized by an icy civility throughout the story. ",
        "Summary_4": "Captain Hatwoody is giving Ambassador Dimdooly a tour of Earth\u2019s ship. When Hatwoody orders Callahan and O\u2019Rielly to attention, Dimdooly sneers at the sight of the two men being subservient to a woman. He acts as if he would never allow a woman to tell him what to do. He also refers to Hatwoody as \u201cthe lesser gender,\u201d which shows that he considers himself superior to women. When Trillium is discovered on board, and Hatwoody starts to handle the situation, he tells Hatwoody to \u201cshut up\u201d and states that he will take care of the matter since he is the \u201cPersonal Ambassador of the President of Venus\u201d and that the incident can lead to war between the two planets. When Berta takes over the presidency for Venus, Trillium orders Dimdooly to stop beating around the bush with her and say what he means, so Dimdooly confesses he loves Trillium and asks her to marry him at her earliest convenience. Trillium then states that Earthmen have no power over Venus women when Venus women have control over their Venus men.",
        "Article": "Seeming to grind her teeth, the Old O Woman turned abruptly to leaveO'Rielly's watch room. Was all O'Rielly could do to keep from bustingout laughing for joy.     Old Woman had been flimflammed for fair! Dear Trillium was saved! Andbetwixt O'Rielly's grand brain and Callahan's great experience she'd behappy forever.     A fine loud thump, however, was now heard. Old Woman whirled back andyanked open the doors under O'Rielly's bunk.     Of all the sappy hiding places! Callahan yelped, in surprise ofcourse.     Trillium? His Excellency bellowed as if stung by one of thesabre-tailed hornets of his native planet. Trillium!     Trillium, O'Rielly pleaded in loving anguish, why do you have tokeep coming out of hiding just when nobody's going to find you?     Her eyes merely became deep pools in which O'Rielly would have gladlydrowned himself if he could.       There are rewards, the Old Woman said with the deadly coldness ofouter space, for Earthmen found in a Venus woman's company, and forher leaving her planet.     Shut up! His Excellency's ear beards were standing straight outsideways. I'll handle this!     May I remind His Excellency, the Old Woman snapped, that I representEarth and her dominion of space gained by right of original flight!     May I remind the Captain, His Excellency declared fit to be heardback to his planet, that I am the Personal Ambassador of the Presidentof Venus and this thing can mean war!     Yes! War in which people will actually die! As His Excellency paledat that grisly remark, the Old Woman spoke through her teeth atO'Rielly, Callahan and Trillium. All right, come along!     O'Rielly joined the death march gladly. He felt the way Callahanlooked: ready to wrap his arms around Trillium's brave loveliness andprotect it to his last breath of life.     Old Woman led the way to her office. Jabbed some buttons on her desk.Panels on opposite walls lit up.     Presidents of Earth and Venus, please, the Old Woman stated evenly.Interplanetary emergency.     Highly groomed flunkies appeared on the panels and were impersonallypleasant.     Madame President's office. She is in a Cabinet meeting.     Mr. President's office. He is in personal command of our glorious warefforts.     Old Woman sighed through her teeth. Venus woman aboard this ship.Stowaway. Rattle that around your belfries.     The flunkies' faces went slack with shock, then were replaced by ablizzard of scrambled faces and torrents of incoherent voices.     Finally on the Earth panel appeared the famous classic features. Thefacts, if you please, Captain Hatwoody.     The Venus panel finally held steady on universally notorious features,that were as fierce as an eagle's, in a fancy war helmet. Trillium! Myown granddaughter? Impossible! Dimdooly, Mr. President roared at hisExcellency, what's this nonsense?     Some loud creature is interfering, Madame President snapped withannoyance.     Blasted fools still have the circuits crossed, Mr. President swore.Some silly female cackling now!     The parties in the panels saw each other now. Each one's left hand on adesk moved toward a big red button marked, ROCKETS.     So, Mr. President said evenly. Another violation by your Earthmen.     By your granddaughter, at least, Madame President replied coolly.     An innocent child, Mr. President snapped, obviously kidnapped bythose two idiotic Earthmen there!     Oh, no, Grandpapa, Trillium said swiftly; I stole away all bymyself, and Mr. O'Rielly and Callahan have been very helpful.     Impossible! Grandpapa President's ear beards stood near straight upas he roared, You couldn't have stolen away by yourself! Trillium,tell the truth!     Very well. Grandmamma told me how.   <doc-sep>   IMAGE OF SPLENDOR     By LU KELLA       From Venus to Earth, and all the way between,       it was a hell of a world for men ... and       Apprentice Burnerman O'Rielly particularly.       [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Planet Stories Summer 1955.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      The intercom roared fit to blow O'Rielly back to Venus. Burner Four!     On my way, sir!     At the first flash of red on the bank of meters Apprentice BurnermanO'Rielly had slammed the safety helmet on his head; he was alreadythrowing open the lock to the burner room. The hot, throbbing rumblewhipped around him and near crushed his breath away. Power! Power ofthe universe trapped here and ready to destroy its captors given onechance! Swiftly O'Rielly unlocked the controls and reset them. Thethrobbing rumble changed tone.     Old Callahan's voice crackled now through the helmet's ear contact.Well, Mr. O'Rielly?     Fusion control two points low, sir.     O'Rielly wondered had Callahan passed out, was so long before the oldBurner Chief demanded hoarsely, Didn't you lock them controls beforeblast-off?     If every control hadn't been locked in correct setting, O'Riellyanswered from his own angry bewilderment, the error would haveregistered before blast-off\u2014wouldn't it, sir?     So a control reset itself in flight, hey?     I don't know yet, sir.     Well, Mr. O'Rielly, you better know before we orbit Earth!     The icy knot in O'Rielly's stomach jerked tighter. A dozen burners onthis ship; why did something crazy have to happen to O'Rielly's? In ahundred years, so the instructors\u2014brisk females all\u2014had told O'Riellyin pre-flight school, no control had ever been known to slip. But onehad moved here. Not enough to cause serious trouble this far out fromEarth. On blast-down, though, with one jet below peak, the uneventhrust could throw the ship, crash it, the whole lovely thing and allaboard gone in a churning cloud.     Sweat pouring off him, O'Rielly prowled around his burner. Design ofthe thing had been bossed by dames of course; what on Earth wasn't anymore? Anyway, nobody could get to a burner except through its watchroom. Anyone entered or left there, a bell clanged, lights flashedand a meter registered beside the Burnerman's bunk and on the BurnerChief's console up in the flight room full of beautifully efficientofficers. Ever since Venus blast-off O'Rielly had been in Four's watchroom. Nobody had passed through. O'Rielly knew it. Callahan knew it.By now the Old Woman herself, Captain Millicent Hatwoody, had probablyinquired what was in charge of Burner Four.     Well, ma'am, O'Rielly searched every cranny where even a three-tailedmouse of Venus could have stowed away. His first flight, and O'Riellysaw himself washed out, busted to sweeper on the blast-off stands ofsome God-forsaken satellite. He staggered back into his watch room. Andhis brain was suddenly taken apart and slapped together again. Feltthat way.     She was sitting on his bunk. No three-tailed mouse. No Old Womaneither. Oh, she was a female human, though, this creature at whichO'Rielly stood gaping. Yes, ma'am!     I was in your burner room. Her voice matched the rest of her, a blendof loveliness unlike anything outside a guy's most secret dreams. Icouldn't stand the heat any longer and I couldn't open that big door.So I moved one of your controls a tiny bit. All the noise in there,naturally you couldn't hear me walk out while your back was turnedresetting the control.   <doc-sep> Dimdooly\u2014the mighty, the lordly, who had sneered at the sight of mereEarthmen kowtowing to a mere woman\u2014swelled up fit to blow his gaskets,then all the gas went out of him. His ear beards, however, still hadenough zip left to flutter like butterflies. Yes, Trillium dear. Ilove only you. Please marry me at your earliest convenience.     Well, Grandmamma, Trillium said with a highly self-satisfied air, itworks. And just like you said, Earthmen meant nothing once I knew weVenus women had our own men in our power.     Those crewmen there, Grandmamma President said, seem to be proofenough that we Venus women no longer radiate any threat to Earth'stranquility.     Yes, ma'am, O'Rielly sure felt like proof of something all of a sudden.Worse than the hangover from that crap game with Venus vino. He lookedaway from Trillium and took a look at Callahan. Old guy looked awayfrom Grandmamma President like he was packing the second biggestheadache in history.     Hmmmm, yes, Madame President of Earth observed. Reactions agreeperfectly with the psychoanalytical research project we have beenconducting on the subject of the Venus female influence. MadamePresident of Venus, congratulations on your victory!     Long may the superior sex reign on Venus too! We shall be delighted toreceive an Ambassadoress to discuss a new trade treaty at your earliestconvenience.     Thank you for cancelling the old trade agreements at the psychologicalmoment, Grandmamma President said cordially. What with thecommunications mixup, we managed to have the scenes on these panelsbroadcast throughout all Venus. When the rug went out from under thetop man, the tide really turned in our favor. Now, Trillium, you takeover Dimmy's credentials.     The Ambassadorial Suite, too, Madame President of Earth saidgraciously. Anything else now, Berta?     I should like, Grandmamma President Berta said charmingly, thatMr. O'Rielly and Mr. Callahan be suitably rewarded for assisting ourrevolution better than they knew.     Of course, Madame President of Earth was delighted to oblige. Nodoubt Captain Hatwoody knows what reward would satisfy their needsbest.     The Madame Presidents switched to a private circuit, Trillium draggedDimdooly off somewhere and the Old Woman eyed O'Rielly and Callahan.Especially she eyed Callahan, like running chilled drills through hisold conniving brain. I award the pair of you five minutes leisurebefore returning to your stations.     Oh, well, O'Rielly muttered, once he and Callahan were safely beyondearshot, could have been rewarded worse, I suppose.     What you expect for being flimflammed by a foreign dame, the rings ofSaturn? Lucky we ain't programmed to be hung, shot and thrown to thecrows for breakfast. Callahan's old pick-and-shovel face wore a littlegrin like the cat that nobody could prove ate the canary.     You\u2014I mean, that Earth guy a hundred twenty-five years ago, O'Riellysaid in sudden thought. If Venus dames wanted to be loved so bad, whydid Trillium's Grandmamma let him go?     Venus guys wasn't so busy playing war all the time, Callahan mumbled,like to himself, they'd of found out the answer centuries ago. Yep,guess our boy was the only guy on Earth or Venus to find out and live.Dames bossing both planets now, though, his old secret won't be onemuch longer. Venus dames could of let it out centuries ago themselvesbut didn't, just to spite Earth probably. Later, was part of organizingto take over Venus, I guess.     O'Rielly still had memories of the way he had felt about Trilliumbefore her revolution. All right, Callahan, why did 'our boy' leaveGrandmamma?     Yes, ma'am, Callahan sighed like he hadn't heard a word O'Riellysaid, you could sweet-talk 'em, kiss 'em and hold 'em tighter'nBilly-be-damned. And that's all.     I'm not sure, O'Rielly said, what you mean by, 'that's all.'     Anybody ever seen anybody but a Venus guy come built with ear beards?Course not.

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in QUEST OF THIG?",
        "Summary_1": "Three aliens from the planet Ortha, Thig, Kam and their Commander, Torp, have landed on Long Island to see if Earth is viable for the Orthans to take over. Thig captures a passing man, an author named Lewis Terry, and brings him back to the spaceship, where Torp decides that Thig should impersonate Terry to learn more about Earth. Terry\u2019s knowledge is transferred to Thig, a process that kills Terry and arms Thig with with all of his memories. He is given plastic surgery to look like Terry, and he goes to live with Terry\u2019s family. \n\nHe is greeted by Terry\u2019s three young children and his wife, Ellen; the children\u2019s affection and Ellen\u2019s kiss lead to sensations that confuse but excite Thig. The story then jumps ahead 12 weeks to when they return from their vacation, Thig having experienced many new emotions and sensations and having become very attached to Terry\u2019s family. He knows that he must report to his Orthan colleagues, but has misgivings about doing so. Upon his arrival back to the ship, he tells Torp that Earth is ideal for their purposes, and Torp commends him and says he\u2019ll recommend that Ortha take it over and eradicate the humans. Thig suggests that they instead disarm and exile the humans, and train them in the ways of Ortha. Torp responds angrily that they don\u2019t need to waste their time with anyone outside the Orthan \u201cHorde\u201d. He asks Kam to check his blood for disease. \n\nThig realizes that he loves Ellen and wants to protect her and the earthlings and says as much to Kam, who attempts to subdue him. After a struggle over Kam\u2019s blaster, Thig kills him. Torp sees what he has done and flies into the type of rage Orthans don\u2019t ascribe to, bludgeoning Thig until he thinks he is dead. Thig takes a blaster from a case above him and kills Torp. He reads in the ship log that Torp has written that Earth is not viable, because it infected Thig with a disease that led to him killing Kam and made it necessary for Torp to kill him. Thig puts the ship on autopilot toward Ortha, takes one of the small auxiliary ships, and heads back to Earth. \n\nHe experiences many emotions, and regrets how callous he was when he first arrived on Earth and captured Lewis Terry. He vows to live as Terry in repayment to his family, and thinks knowing that Ellen doesn\u2019t really love him, Thig, will be his punishment while he strives to make her happy. As he heads toward Long Island, the idea for a story develops in his mind. This one is about a cowboy that visits other worlds, worlds like the ones Thig has seen. He thinks maybe he could write this, and then reminds himself to remember that he is Lewis Terry now. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story begins with the protagonist Thig, who is an alien from the planet Ortha, on a mission to investigate Earth\u2019s suitability to be colonized by the conquering Horde he represents. Thig is a bit shorter than the average human with a thick, muscular body and reddish hair. His spaceship is hidden below the sand at a Long Island beach, and after he emerges, he hides behind the brush along a nearby road. He sees a human that looks remarkably like himself. This human turns out to be a Western writer named Lewis Terry, who lives nearby with his wife and children. Lew, as his wife calls him, had been out fishing as he tried to plot out new stories to fund his proposed trip out West, where he could gather research to make his writing more believable. Thig knocks him out and takes him back to his ship, where he and his fellow Orthans Kam and Torp begin the process of transferring Lew\u2019s memories, thoughts, and emotions into Thig\u2019s mind. This allows him to disguise himself as he researches Earth\u2019s environment and the humans that populate it. After undergoing plastic surgery to better mimic Lew\u2019s appearance, Thig returns to Lew\u2019s home, guided by his memories of the past and human emotions. Thig meets Lew\u2019s children and experiences emotions of love for the first time. These feelings are further complicated when he meets Ellen, Lew\u2019s wife, who kisses him and floods Thig\u2019s new Lew-mind with romantic emotions. Thig shows Ellen the treasures he has brought with him from Mars, and Ellen says they can now afford to pay for their trip out West. They spend the next three months exploring the West, during which time Thig plunges deeper into human emotion and is overwhelmed by the beauty of Earth. Upon his return to the ship, Thig attempts to convince Kam and Torp to change their plans about destroying humankind, and they think Thig has contracted some kind of disease. When Kam goes to test Thig, Thig kills him with a decomposition blaster; in turn, Torp beats Thig until he thinks he has killed him. Torp then returns to his desk and makes a note that Earth is probably not suitable for the Horde due to a mysterious disease that had overtaken Thig. Thig kills Torp and returns to Earth in an escape vessel, sending the ship back to Ortha with Torp\u2019s message. Torp goes back to Ellen and the children, intending to spend the rest of his life living as Lewis Terry.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Thig appears naked on Long Island and waits for an Earthman to come near. Lewis Terry, a writer of Westerns, walks by Thig. He went out on his boat to fish, and Thig jumps out at Terry and kills him.\nThig is excited to help his people, the Orthans, discover a new place to inhabit. On planet Ortha, everything is done to serve the Horde. The creatures have no families. They instead devote their lives to society. \nOn the spaceship, Thig takes over Terry\u2019s body and gains all of his knowledge. He then undergoes surgery to correct the scars that Terry sustained during the attack. When he exits the spaceship, Thig is surprised to learn that he now holds all of Terry\u2019s childhood memories and understandings about the world around him. \n\nHe approaches Terry\u2019s home and is greeted by his children and his wife. Thig feels pleasure from this interaction, something he has never experienced before. When Ellen talks to Thig, he naturally responds like Terry would without even thinking about it. The family heads out on a vacation in the West.\n\nAfter several weeks, Thig\u2019s family arrives back at home. He loved building relationships with his wife and children, and soon he will need to talk to his fellow Orthans and let them know that Earth is a perfect place for them to take over. He worries about what will become of Terry\u2019s family. Thig enjoys being an Earthman because he is allowed to feel and express emotions and experience the uncertainty of life that does not exist on Ortha. \n\nWhen Thig leaves the house to go to the spaceship, his mind keeps coming up with ideas for new Western novels. He can\u2019t help it since he still has many of Terry\u2019s old thoughts. Torp decides it\u2019s time to head back to Ortha. He will recommend killing all humans. Thig disagrees, and Torp becomes angry. He assumes that Thig has contracted a disease, and he tells Kam to test him. The ship blasts off, and in a fit of rage, Thig chokes Kam. They wrestle over Kam\u2019s weapon, and Thig makes Kam shoot himself in the torso. Torp comes into the room and hits Thig over the head with a gun. \n\nTorp leaves Thig bleeding and alone in the laboratory. When he wakes up, he is injured, but he manages to grab a weapon. When Torp comes back in the room, he begins shrieking. Thig shoots the commander. \n\nThig finds Torp\u2019s note that says that Earth holds some disease that causes insanity, and therefore it is not appropriate for colonization. He sets the spaceship for Ortha and takes an auxiliary ship back to Earth. Happiness overtakes him as he heads back to his new home. He has zero regrets about leaving Ortha forever. Thig now believes in God, and realizes that his duty is to take care of Terry\u2019s family for the rest of his life. He thinks up a Western plot about a cowboy who visits another planet.\n",

When they reach Earth, Thig goes out to look for a human specimen that he can capture and take back to the space cruiser to drain the person\u2019s memory and knowledge to help them determine whether Earth will be a suitable planet for Orthan colonization. Thig captures Lewis Terry, a fiction writer with writer\u2019s block and taking the day off to go fishing. Terry bears an uncanny likeness to Thig, and Torp decides to transfer Terry\u2019s knowledge to Thig and have Thig explore Earth to determine whether it will be appropriate for the Orthans. They make the transfer, but Terry dies. They perform plastic surgery to make Thig look even more like Terry; then Thig returns to Terry\u2019s home.\n\nTerry\u2019s children and wife greet him, and Thig realizes he has a warm response to them even though Orthans have no emotions or sentimentality. When Terry\u2019s wife, Ellen, tells him he received a check for $50 for one of her stories, Thig immediately comments that the story was worth $100\u2014and is stunned to realize he is thinking like Terry, not himself. He shows Ellen the stones he dug up from an old wooden box that he remembered learning about in Terry\u2019s childhood, and she exclaims they are worth a fortune and will finance a travel trailer and their trip out West.\n\nAfter returning from their western trip, Thig realizes he needs to report back to Torp about whether Earth is an appropriate planet for the Orthans. He knows it is perfect and that the Orthans will destroy every Earth person, and he begins to wonder why they would have to destroy them. As he makes his way to the space cruiser, he comes up with a new Western story to write.\n\nWhen Thig makes his report to Torp, Torp agrees that Earth is perfect for the Orthans and grows angry when Thig asks if they couldn\u2019t just disarm the Earth people rather than destroying all of them. Torp orders Kam to check Thig\u2019s blood for disease. The space cruiser blasts off, and Thig thinks about Ellen and her children with Lewis Terry and realizes he loves them and must protect them. He tells Torp and Kam to turn back\u2014that there is a woman who needs him and the Horde from Ortha doesn\u2019t need Earth. Thig fights and kills Kam, but Torp realizes what is happening and catches Thig off-guard. Torp beats Thig almost to death, and when Thig regains consciousness, he kills Torp and returns to Earth via a lifeboat. Thig decides that he must be Lewis Terry, not Thig, from now on, and he begins to develop another story about the old West.",
        "Article": "   QUEST OF THIG     By BASIL WELLS     Thig of Ortha was the vanguard of the conquering     HORDE. He had blasted across trackless space     to subdue a defenseless world\u2014only to meet on     Earth emotions that were more deadly than weapons.     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Planet Stories Fall 1942.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      Thig carefully smoothed the dark sand and seaweed of the lonely beachover the metal lid of the flexible ringed tunnel that linked the grubbyship from another planet with the upper air. He looked out across theheaving waters of the Sound toward Connecticut. He stared appraisinglyaround at the luxuriant green growth of foliage further inland; andstarted toward the little stretch of trees and brush, walking carefullybecause of the lesser gravitation.     Thig was shorter than the average Earthman\u2014although on Ortha hewas well above the average in height\u2014but his body was thick andpowerfully muscled. His skull was well-shaped and large; his featureswere regular, perhaps a trifle oversize, and his hair and eyes werea curiously matching blend of reddish brown. Oddest of all, he woreno garments, other than the necessary belt and straps to support hisrod-like weapon of white metal and his pouches for food and specimens.     The Orthan entered the narrow strip of trees and crossed to thelittle-used highway on the other side. Here he patiently sat down towait for an Earthman or an Earthwoman to pass. His task now was tobring a native, intact if possible, back to the carefully buried spacecruiser where his two fellows and himself would drain the creature'smentality of all its knowledge. In this way they could learn whether aplanet was suited for colonization by later swarms of Orthans.     Already they had charted over a hundred celestial bodies but of themall only three had proven worthy of consideration. This latest planet,however, 72-P-3 on the chart, appeared to be an ideal world in everyrespect. Sunlight, plenty of water and a dense atmospheric envelopemade of 72-P-3 a paradise among planets.     The explorer from another world crouched into the concealment of aleafy shrub. A creature was approaching. Its squat body was coveredwith baggy strips of bluish cloth and it carried a jointed rod of metaland wood in its paw. It walked upright as did the men of Ortha.     Thig's cold eyes opened a trifle wider as he stared into the thing'sstupid face. It was as though he was looking into a bit of polishedmetal at the reflection of himself!     The Earthman was opposite now and he must waste no more precioustime. The mighty muscles of the Orthan sent him hurtling across theintervening space in two prodigious bounds, and his hands clampedacross the mouth and neck of the stranger....   <doc-sep> The mild shocks went on\u2014whether from projectiles or energy-charges,would be hard to find out and it didn't matter; whatever was hittingthe      Quest III's     shell was doing it at velocities where thedistinction between matter and radiation practically ceases to exist.     But that shell was tough. It was an extension of the gravitic drivefield which transmitted the engines' power equally to every atom ofthe ship; forces impinging on the outside of the field were similarlytransmitted and rendered harmless. The effect was as if the vessel andall space inside its field were a single perfectly elastic body. Ameteoroid, for example, on striking it rebounded\u2014usually vaporized bythe impact\u2014and the ship, in obedience to the law of equal and oppositeforces, rebounded too, but since its mass was so much greater, itsdeflection was negligible.     The people in the      Quest III     would have felt nothing at all ofthe vicious onslaught being hurled against them, save that theirinertialess drive, at its normal thrust of two hundred gravities,was intentionally operated at one half of one per cent efficiency toprovide the illusion of Earthly gravitation.     One of the officers said shakily, It's as if they've been lying inwait for us. But why on Earth\u2014     That, said the captain grimly, is what we have to find out. Why\u2014onEarth. At least, I suspect the answer's there.     The      Quest III     bored steadily on through space, decelerating. Even ifone were no fatalist, there seemed no reason to stop decelerating orchange course. There was nowhere else to go and too little fuel leftif there had been; come what might, this was journey's end\u2014perhapsin a more violent and final way than had been anticipated. All aroundwheeled the pigmy enemies, circling, maneuvering, and attacking,always attacking, with the senseless fury of maddened hornets. Theinterstellar ship bore no offensive weapons\u2014but suddenly on one of thevision screens a speck of light flared into nova-brilliance, dazzlingthe watchers for the brief moment in which its very atoms were tornapart.     Knof Jr. whooped ecstatically and then subsided warily, but no one waspaying attention to him. The men on the      Quest III's     bridge lookedquestions at each other, as the thought of help from outside flashedinto many minds at once. But Captain Llud said soberly, It must havecaught one of their own shots, reflected. Maybe its own, if it scoredtoo direct a hit.     He studied the data so far gathered. A few blurred pictures had beengot, which showed cylindrical space ships much like the      Quest III     ,except that they were rocket-propelled and of far lesser size. Theirsize was hard to ascertain, because you needed to know their distanceand speed\u2014but detector-beam echoes gave the distance, and likewise, bythe Doppler method, the velocity of directly receding or approachingships. It was apparent that the enemy vessels were even smaller thanGwar Den had at first supposed\u2014not large enough to hold even one man.Tiny, deadly hornets with a colossal sting.     Robot craft, no doubt, said Knof Llud, but a chill ran down his spineas it occurred to him that perhaps the attackers weren't of humanorigin. They had seen no recognizable life in the part of the galaxythey had explored, but one of the other      Quests     might have encounteredand been traced home by some unhuman race that was greedy and able toconquer.   <doc-sep> What is it you wish? he barked. I understood in my discussions withthe other ... ah ... civilian there'd be no further need for theseirritating conferences.     I've just learned you're placing more students abroad, Mr. Gulver. Howmany this time?     Two thousand.     And where will they be going?     Croanie. It's all in the application form I've handed in. Your job isto provide transportation.     Will there be any other students embarking this season?     Why ... perhaps. That's Boge's business. Gulver looked at Retief withpursed lips. As a matter of fact, we had in mind dispatching anothertwo thousand to Featherweight.     Another under-populated world\u2014and in the same cluster, I believe,Retief said. Your people must be unusually interested in that regionof space.     If that's all you wanted to know, I'll be on my way. I have matters ofimportance to see to.     After Gulver left, Retief called Miss Furkle in. I'd like to have abreak-out of all the student movements that have been planned under thepresent program, he said. And see if you can get a summary of whatMEDDLE has been shipping lately.     Miss Furkle compressed her lips. If Mr. Magnan were here, I'm surehe wouldn't dream of interfering in the work of other departments.I ... overheard your conversation with the gentleman from the CroanieLegation\u2014     The lists, Miss Furkle.     I'm not accustomed, Miss Furkle said, to intruding in mattersoutside our interest cluster.     That's worse than listening in on phone conversations, eh? But nevermind. I need the information, Miss Furkle.     Loyalty to my Chief\u2014     Loyalty to your pay-check should send you scuttling for the materialI've asked for, Retief said. I'm taking full responsibility. Nowscat.     The buzzer sounded. Retief flipped a key. MUDDLE, Retief speaking....     Arapoulous's brown face appeared on the desk screen.     How-do, Retief. Okay if I come up?     Sure, Hank. I want to talk to you.     In the office, Arapoulous took a chair. Sorry if I'm rushing you,Retief, he said. But have you got anything for me?     Retief waved at the wine bottles. What do you know about Croanie?     Croanie? Not much of a place. Mostly ocean. All right if you likefish, I guess. We import our seafood from there. Nice prawns in monsoontime. Over a foot long.     You on good terms with them?     Sure, I guess so. Course, they're pretty thick with Boge.     So?     Didn't I tell you? Boge was the bunch that tried to take us over herea dozen years back. They'd've made it too, if they hadn't had a lot ofbad luck. Their armor went in the drink, and without armor they're easygame.     Miss Furkle buzzed. I have your lists, she said shortly.     Bring them in, please.  "

        "Query": "What is the story of Thig and how does it unfold?",
        "Summary_1": "Thig is the protagonist of the story, a native of the planet Ortha. He is described as shorter than an average human man (though tall for an Orthan man), and thick-bodied with well-developed muscles, average-to-large facial features, and reddish brown eyes. At the beginning of the story, he and two other Orthans, Kam and Torp, are on a mission to find planets considered viable for the Orthans to take over. Thig kidnaps a human man, Lewis Terry, and the Orthans transfer his memories to Thig and surgically alter him to look like Terry. Thig assumes his identity and joins his family posing as Terry. He begins to feel new sensations and emotions around Terry\u2019s wife, Ellen, and their kids, and travels with them on a three-month vacation during which he learns what it feels like to be human and to care for a family. When they return and he must make his report to the other Orthans, he truthfully reports that Earth would be ideal to take over but has second thoughts when Torp says he\u2019ll recommend that they conquer Earth and decimate the population. When his pleas to consider just disarming and exiling the humans are met with scorn, Thig becomes angry and ultimately realizes that he loves Ellen and wants to go back to save Earth. He kills both of his Orthan colleagues and sends the ship back toward Ortha as he takes an auxiliary ship back to Long Island. Along the way, he experiences many emotions including regret for his former callousness and taking Lewis Terry away from his family. Instead of the robotic being who initially exhibited coldness and indifference at the beginning of the story, he now experiences remorse and selflessness as he decides to give Ellen and the kids the life they deserve even though he\u2019ll always know who he is and what he has done. ",
        "Summary_2": "Thig is an Orthan from the planet Ortha, who visits Earth on a research mission with fellow Horde members Kam and Torp. Thig looks very similar to his research victim, a Western fiction writer named Lewis Terry, except he is a bit shorter, has a thick, muscular body, and has unusual reddish-brown hair on his head that matches his eyebrow hair. He wears no clothes, except some straps and pockets used for carrying his weapons and food; he is disturbed by Lew\u2019s human clothes, which he considers impractical. Thig captures Lew and Kam and Torp help him transfer his memories, thoughts, and human emotions to better disguise himself as he researches Earth\u2019s suitability for Horde habitation. Throughout the story, Thig struggles with processing his newly-acquired human emotions as they conflict with the mind programming of the Horde, which tells him that all of life is to be lived exclusively for the benefit and maintenance of the Horde. Thig goes on a three-month excursion with Lew\u2019s family, during which time he falls in love with Ellen and discovers the beauty of Earth. He tries to convince Kam and Torp to abandon their mission, and when they try to test Thig for disease, he kills them both and returns to Earth to spend his existence as Lewis Terry.",
        "Summary_3": "Thig is an Orthan who has spent his entire life devoted to the Horde. He has no family or friends, and he has never experienced love or real emotions. He is essentially part of an ant colony, and he spends every day working for the good of society and neglecting his own individuality. \n\nThig is sent to Earth to investigate whether the planet will be a good place to relocate the Orthans. He must find a human and kill him in order to take over his mind and body . Thig quickly finds his victim in Lewis Terry, chokes him, takes him back to the ship, and gains all of his knowledge and his appearance.\nThig is originally on Earth strictly for the mission, but once he joins Terry\u2019s family, he immediately begins to have feelings for Terry\u2019s wife, Ellen, and his three children. As Terry, Thig is affectionate, he takes part in real conversations, and he thinks about plots for Western novels. \n\nHe truly discovers the joy of living on Earth on his three month vacation with Terry\u2019s family. They take in the landscape and enjoy their time together. \n\nWhen he returns, he knows he has to tell Torp and Kam, two other Orthans on the mission, that Earth is a paradise and the other Orthans would love it. However, he wants nothing to do with the mass killing of humans. Although he originally follows through with his plan and returns to the spaceship, he almost immediately regrets his decision. He does not want to see Earth taken over by the Orthans. He finds the strength to fight off Kam and Torp and heads back to Earth, his new home. \nThig realizes that his entire outlook on life has changed, and he can\u2019t go back to being a cog in a machine. He feels real guilt for killing Terry, and he knows the only way to make it up to him is to take care of Ellen and the children for the rest of his life. He will leave the Orthans to colonize another planet, but he feels positive that they will stay away from Earth when the spaceship with two dead bodies returns to his home planet with a note that says that Earth carries a deadly disease. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Thig is a man from Ortha who travels around the galaxy with two other men, looking for another planet that the Orthans can occupy. He lands on Earth and captures a human, Lewis Terry, to take to the space cruiser. Thig looks so much like the human that the Orthans decide to transfer the human\u2019s knowledge and memories to Thig and let him explore the planet in the guise of the man. When Thig encounters the human\u2019s family, he begins to have warm feelings for them, although all feelings and emotions have been removed from the Orthans for hundreds of thousands of years. After the family spends three months on a trip out West, Thig has changed. Instead of thinking only of the good of the Horde of Orthans, he now questions that single-minded devotion and considers the Orthans mindless bees who don\u2019t know the pleasure of thinking for themselves and making their own decisions as the Earthmen do. When the family returns home from the trip out West, he reports what he has learned to Torp, who declares that the planet is suitable and the humans must be destroyed. Thig asks if the Orthans couldn\u2019t just disarm the humans and exile them to a less desirable continent, and Torp thinks he must be sick and orders Kam to check Thig\u2019s blood for disease. As they launch into space, Thig is overwhelmed with the desire to protect Ellen; he realizes he loves her. After defeating Kam and Torp and heading back to Earth, he realizes that he thinks like Lewis Terry and must BE Lewis Terry. His Orthan values and identity no longer matter.",
        "Article": "You have done well, announced Torp when Thig had completed his reporton the resources and temperatures of various sections of Terra. We nowhave located three worlds fit for colonization and so we will return toOrtha at once.     I will recommend the conquest of this planet, 72-P-3 at once and thecomplete destruction of all biped life upon it. The mental aberrationsof the barbaric natives might lead to endless complications if theywere permitted to exist outside our ordered way of life. I imagine thatthree circuits of the planet about its primary should prove sufficientfor the purposes of complete liquidation.     But why, asked Thig slowly, could we not disarm all the natives andexile them on one of the less desirable continents, Antarctica forexample or Siberia? They are primitive humans even as our race was oncea race of primitives. It is not our duty to help to attain our owndegree of knowledge and comfort?     Only the good of the Horde matters! shouted Torp angrily. Shall arace of feeble-witted beasts, such as these Earthmen, stand in the wayof a superior race? We want their world, and so we will take it. TheLaw of the Horde states that all the universe is ours for the taking.     Let us get back to Ortha at once, then, gritted out Thig savagely.Never again do I wish to set foot upon the soil of this mad planet.There are forces at work upon Earth that we of Ortha have longforgotten.     Check the blood of Thig for disease, Kam, ordered Torp shortly. Hiswords are highly irrational. Some form of fever perhaps native to thisworld. While you examine him I will blast off for Ortha.     Thig followed Kam into the tiny laboratory and found a seat beside thesquat scientist's desk. His eyes roamed over the familiar instrumentsand gauges, each in its own precise position in the cases along thewalls. His gaze lingered longest on the stubby black ugliness ofa decomposition blaster in its rack close to the deck. A blast ofthe invisible radiations from that weapon's hot throat and flesh orvegetable fiber rotted into flaky ashes.     The ship trembled beneath their feet; it tore free from the feebleclutch of the sand about it, and they were rocketing skyward. Thig'sbroad fingers bit deep into the unyielding metal of his chair. Suddenlyhe knew that he must go back to Earth, back to Ellen and the childrenof the man he had helped destroy. He loved Ellen, and nothing muststand between them! The Hordes of Ortha must find some other world, anempty world\u2014this planet was not for them.     Turn back! he cried wildly. I must go back to Earth. There is awoman there, helpless and alone, who needs me! The Horde does not needthis planet.     Kam eyed him coldly and lifted a shining hypodermic syringe from itscase. He approached Thig warily, aware that disease often made a maniacof the finest members of the Horde.     No human being is more important than the Horde, he stated baldly.This woman of whom you speak is merely one unit of the millions wemust eliminate for the good of the Horde.     Then it was that Thig went berserk. His fists slashed into the thickjaw of the scientist and his fingers ripped at the hard cords overlyingthe Orthan's vital throat tubes. His fingers and thumb gouged deep intoKam's startled throat and choked off any cry for assistance before itcould be uttered.     Kam's hand swept down to the holster swung from his intricate harnessand dragged his blaster from it. Thig's other hand clamped over his andfor long moments they swayed there, locked together in silent deadlystruggle. The fate of a world hung in the balance as Kam's other handfought against that lone arm of Thig.   <doc-sep> There it is, announced Thig, dropping the limp body of the capturedEarthman to the metal deck-plates. It is a male of the species thatmust have built the cities we saw as we landed.     He resembles Thig, announced Kam. But for the strange covering hewears he might be Thig.     Thig will be this creature! announced Torp. With a psychic relay wewill transfer the Earthman's memories and meager store of knowledge tothe brain of Thig! He can then go out and scout this world withoutarousing suspicion. While he is gone, I will take Kam and explore thetwo inner planets.     You are the commander, said Thig. But I wish this beast did not wearthese clumsy sheathing upon his body. On Ortha we do not hamper the useof our limbs so.     Do not question the word of your commander, growled Torp, swellingout his thick chest menacingly. It is for the good of our people thatyou disguise yourself as an Earthman.     For the good of the Horde, Thig intoned almost piously as he liftedTerry's body and headed for the laboratory.     Service for the Horde was all that the men of Ortha knew. Carefullycultured and brought to life in the laboratories of their Horde, theyknew neither father nor mother. Affection and love were entirelylacking in their early training and later life. They were trainedantlike from childhood that only the growth and power of the Hordewere of any moment. Men and women alike toiled and died like unfeelingrobots of flesh and bone for the Horde. The Horde was their religion,their love-life, their everything!     So it was that the bodies of the Earthman and the Orthan were strappedon two parallel tables of chill metal and the twin helmets, linked toone another by the intricacies of the psychic relay, put upon theirheads.     For ten hours or more the droning hum of the relay sucked Terry's braindry of knowledge. The shock upon the nervous system of the Earthmanproved too violent and his heart faltered after a time and stoppedcompletely. Twice, with subtle drugs they restored pseudo-life to hisbody and kept the electrical impulses throbbing from his torturedbrain, but after the third suspension of life Thig removed his helmet.     There is nothing more to learn, he informed his impassive comrades.Now, let us get on with the plastic surgery that is required. My newbody must return to its barbaric household before undue attention isaroused. And when I return I will take along some of the gleamingbaubles we found on the red planet\u2014these people value them highly.     An hour later, his scars and altered cartilage already healed andpainless, Thig again scraped sand over the entrance to the space shipand set out along the moonlit beach toward the nearest path runninginland to his home.     Memory was laying the country bare about him, Terry's own childhoodmemories of this particular section of Long Island. Here was the placewhere Jake and Ted had helped him dig for the buried treasure thatold 'Notch-ear' Beggs had told them so exactly about. Remembrance ofthat episode gave Thig an idea about the little lump of jewels in hispocket. He had found them in a chest along the beach!     He was coming up on the porch now and at the sound of his foot onthe sagging boards the screen door burst open and three littleEarth-creatures were hugging at his legs. An odd sensation, that hisacquired memories labeled as pleasure, sent a warm glow upward fromaround his heart.     Then he saw the slender red-haired shape of a woman, the mate of thedead man he knew, and confusion struck his well-trained brain. Menhad no mates on Ortha, sex had been overthrown with all the otherprimitive impulses of barbarism; so he was incapable of understandingthe emotions that swept through his acquired memory.     Unsteadily he took her in his arms and felt her warm lips pressed,trembling, against his own. That same hot wave of pulsing blood chokedachingly up into his throat.     Lew, dear, Ellen was asking, where have you been all day? I calledup at the landing but you were not there. I wanted to let you know thatSaddlebag Publications sent a check for $50 for Reversed Revolversand three other editors asked for shorts soon.   <doc-sep> The scales swung in favor of Kam. Slowly the flaring snout of hisweapon tilted upward until it reached the level of Thig's waist. Thigsuddenly released his grip and dragged his enemy toward him. A suddenreversal of pressure on Kam's gun hand sent the weapon swivellingabout full upon its owner's thick torso. Thig's fingers pressed downupon Kam's button finger, down upon the stud set into the grip of thedecomposition blaster, and Kam's muscles turned to water. He shrieked.     Before Thig's eyes half of his comrade's body sloughed away into foulcorruption that swiftly gave way to hardened blobs of dessicatedmatter. Horror for what he had done\u2014that he had slain one of his ownHorde\u2014made his limbs move woodenly. All of his thoughts were dulledfor the moment. Painfully slow, he turned his body around toward thecontrol blister, turned around on leaden feet, to look full into thenarrowed icy eyes of his commander.     He saw the heavy barrel of the blaster slashing down against hisskull but he could not swing a fraction of an inch out of the way.His body seemed paralyzed. This was the end, he thought as he waitedstupidly for the blow to fall, the end for Ellen and the kids and allthe struggling races of Earth. He would never write another cowboyyarn\u2014they would all be dead anyhow soon.     Then a thunderclap exploded against his head and he dropped endlesslytoward the deck. Blows rained against his skull. He wondered if Torpwould ever cease to hammer at him and turn the deadly ray of the weaponupon him. Blood throbbed and pounded with every blow....  "

        "Query": "What is the backdrop of the tale QUEST OF THIG?",
        "Summary_1": "The story is set in multiple locations, including Long Island, New York, an Orthan spaceship and smaller auxiliary ship, parts of the American West, and outer space. The ship from Ortha lands on Long Island in New York, and this is where Thig captures Lewis Terry and takes him to the Orthans\u2019 spaceship, before settling in with his family, posing as Terry. This area of Long Island is near the beach and the sound, and is described as lush and green. The Terry family lives in a small grey house that is somewhat run down. While we don\u2019t travel out west on the Terry family vacation, we do experience bits of it in Thig\u2019s memory, including the Grand Canyon in Arizona and unspecified desert terrain. The story then takes us back to the ship, and a small laboratory aboard the ship, and then inside a smaller ship as it heads back to Long Island. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Lew\u2019s family lives near a beach on Long Island. When the story begins, Thig emerges from his spaceship, which is buried below this beach. He sees dense, green brush beyond the beach running along a highway with little traffic. This is where he chooses to hide and waits to overtake Lew. Thig\u2019s interactions with Kam and Torp take place on the spaceship below the beach surface; this is also where they kill Lew during the brain transfer with Thig. Thig reunites as Lew with Ellen and their children at their beach home and joins them on an epic, three-month journey out West where he sees the Grand Canyon and is overwhelmed by the beauty of the desert with its sagebrush and cacti and variety of colors. Later, Torp charts a path back to Ortha, where they will report their findings. Thig kills Torp and Kam aboard the spaceship, and then he commandeers an escape vessel to make his way back to Earth and back to Ellen and the children.",
        "Summary_3": "Most of the story, The Quest of Thig, takes place on Long Island. When Thig first appears on Earth, he is standing in the seaweed and sand, looking out at the Long Island Sound. There are trees and lots of greenery along the shoreline. He notes that this planet appears to be perfect for the Orthans because it has sunlight, lots of water, and a dense atmosphere. \n\nTerry\u2019s little gray house has a dilapidated front porch and a screen door. There is an old swing that creaks when it\u2019s used. The family owns a gray car and a trailer.  Ellen makes simple meals for her family in their kitchen. \nDuring the family\u2019s trip out West, they visit the Grand Canyon where they see red dunes in the desert and sagebrush and cacti. \n\nThe other setting in the story is the Orthans\u2019 spaceship. When Thig takes Terry\u2019s body back to his spaceship to take over his body and mind, there are two parallel metal tables in the operation room. Both Thig and Terry\u2019s body wear helmets to transfer the information from one to the other. Later in the story, Thig is taken to the laboratory on the ship to get his blood checked for a disease. The lab is neatly set up with instruments hanging from the wall and weapons hanging from the ceiling. There is also a control room on board. The space ship also has six auxiliary miniature spaceships nested inside the larger vessel. \n",
        "Summary_4": "There are three settings in the story, two of which are present in the story and the third is remembered. The first setting is the space cruiser that brings the Orthans to Earth. The space cruiser lands on a beach across the Sound from Connecticut. It is buried in the sand to prevent it from being seen by the Earthmen. It contains a laboratory with instruments and gauges that enable the Orthans to capture the memories and knowledge of another species. It is also outfitted with their decomposition blasters that reduce living organisms to flaky ashes. There is also a control room where Torp guides the space cruiser on its travels through the galaxy and keeps the ship\u2019s log detailing its journeys and findings. Wastes are disposed of with a refuse lock. The ship carries auxiliary lifeboats, which are basically miniatures of the larger ship, for emergencies.\n\nThe setting on Earth is based in Connecticut where the space cruiser lands on a beach. There is sand at the beach, trees and shrubs, highways, and other manmade features. It also features Lewis Terry\u2019s cottage where he lives with his family. It is a weathered small gray house with sagging boards, a front porch, and a porch swing. When the family visits the West, they stop at the Grand Canyon, and Thig is breathless when he sees its beauty. He also notes the sun-painted red peaks in the desert and beautiful starry nights.\n\nThig remembers Ortha as dull, gray, and black and associates it with a monotonous routine.\n",

That was the Doppler effect as the star'sradial velocity changed relative to the      Quest III     , as for forty hoursthe ship had decelerated.     They had seen many such stars come near out of the galaxy's glitteringbackdrop, and had seen them dwindle, turn red and go out as the      QuestIII     drove on its way once more, lashed by despair toward the speed oflight, leaving behind the mockery of yet another solitary and lifelessluminary unaccompanied by worlds where men might dwell. They had grownsated with the sight of wonders\u2014of multiple systems of giant stars, ofnebulae that sprawled in empty flame across light years.     But now unwonted excitement possessed the hundred-odd members of the      Quest III's     crew. It was a subdued excitement; men and women, theycame and stood quietly gazing into the big vision screens that showedthe oncoming star, and there were wide-eyed children who had been bornin the ship and had never seen a planet. The grownups talked in lowvoices, in tones of mingled eagerness and apprehension, of what mightlie at the long journey's end. For the      Quest III     was coming home; thesun ahead was      the     Sun, whose rays had warmed their lives' beginning.   <doc-sep>    QUEST OF THIG     By BASIL WELLS     Thig of Ortha was the vanguard of the conquering     HORDE.

[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Planet Stories Fall 1942.

He looked out across theheaving waters of the Sound toward Connecticut. He stared appraisinglyaround at the luxuriant green growth of foliage further inland; andstarted toward the little stretch of trees and brush, walking carefullybecause of the lesser gravitation.     Thig was shorter than the average Earthman\u2014although on Ortha hewas well above the average in height\u2014but his body was thick andpowerfully muscled. His skull was well-shaped and large; his featureswere regular, perhaps a trifle oversize, and his hair and eyes werea curiously matching blend of reddish brown. Oddest of all, he woreno garments, other than the necessary belt and straps to support hisrod-like weapon of white metal and his pouches for food and specimens.     The Orthan entered the narrow strip of trees and crossed to thelittle-used highway on the other side. Here he patiently sat down towait for an Earthman or an Earthwoman to pass. His task now was tobring a native, intact if possible, back to the carefully buried spacecruiser where his two fellows and himself would drain the creature'smentality of all its knowledge. In this way they could learn whether aplanet was suited for colonization by later swarms of Orthans.     Already they had charted over a hundred celestial bodies but of themall only three had proven worthy of consideration. This latest planet,however, 72-P-3 on the chart, appeared to be an ideal world in everyrespect. Sunlight, plenty of water and a dense atmospheric envelopemade of 72-P-3 a paradise among planets.     The explorer from another world crouched into the concealment of aleafy shrub. A creature was approaching. Its squat body was coveredwith baggy strips of bluish cloth and it carried a jointed rod of metaland wood in its paw. It walked upright as did the men of Ortha.     Thig's cold eyes opened a trifle wider as he stared into the thing'sstupid face. It was as though he was looking into a bit of polishedmetal at the reflection of himself!     The Earthman was opposite now and he must waste no more precioustime.

He must remember that always. He had destroyed the real Terry andnow, for the rest of his life, he must make up to the dead man's family.     The knowledge that Ellen's love was not really meant for him would bea knife twisting in his heart but for her sake he must endure it. Herdreams and happiness must never be shattered.     The bulge of Earth was flattening out now and he could see the outlinesof Long Island in the growing twilight.     A new plot was growing in the brain of Lewis Terry, a yarn about acowboy suddenly transported to another world. He smiled ironically.He had seen those other worlds. Perhaps some day he would write aboutthem....     He was Lewis Terry! He must remember that!   "

        "Query": "How do the customs of Ortha contrast with those that Thig encounters on Earth in QUEST OF THIG?",
        "Summary_1": "The society on Ortha has discarded what they consider to be primal or barbaric tendencies and customs. Their children are raised in laboratories never knowing their parents and are not shown love or affection. They are taught to value loyalty to the Orthan \u201cHordes\u201d over everything, and to believe that they are entitled to anything in the universe that they desire, with no regard to those outside the Hordes. They don\u2019t have mates or have sex, though they do walk around naked. Free thought and primal urges are discouraged, and Orthan society has attempted to filter out any behavior they consider to be barbaric in favor of a robotic, obedient populace. By contrast, Thig discovers that humans feel the full gamut of emotions, think for themselves, and feel empathy rather than the dispassionate callousness Ortha demands. \n",
        "Summary_2": "The Orthans are a race totally committed to the advancement of the Horde, which travels around the universe seeking to find new planets to overthrow and inhabit. Over the years, their minds have been programmed to think only of the good of the Horde, with no thought to sentimental emotions or feelings. When Thig receives Lewis Terry\u2019s mind, he also receives his mentality, his thoughts, his memories, and his emotions. He experiences for the first time how humans feel. He describes the warmth of hugging Lew\u2019s children, and the choking-warm sensation of kissing his wife, Ellen. He feels awe when standing before the Grand Canyon and learns to feel excitement about the unpredictability of human behavior and emotion. He feels love, hate, and sadness. All of these emotions stand in stark contrast to the Orthan way of life, which is carefully regimented and devoid of any of these kinds of feelings.",
        "Summary_3": "On Ortha, the aliens are raised in the laboratories of their Horde. The Orthans function in a collective society. They do not believe in the individual. There are no families, no romantic relationships or sex, and no friends. Everything that is done must be done for the greater society, much like an ant farm. The Orthans are looking for a new planet to colonize, and they send out Torp, Kam, and Thig on the mission.\n\nOrthans are incapable of feeling emotions and all of their primitive impulses have been done away with. The aliens are part of a strict caste system where they are only allowed to have certain thoughts according to their position in the Horde. They have acted this way for over one hundred thousand years. \n\nOrthans believe they are superior to Earthmen, whom they see as feeble and weak. They believe they have the right to take whatever planet is best for them, and killing billions of Earthmen means nothing to them. \n",
        "Summary_4": "On Ortha, men are loyal to the Horde, and that is all they care about. They are cultured and brought to life in laboratories, so there are no fathers or mothers and no affection and love. From childhood on, males and females in Ortha are taught that the only important thing is the growth and power of the Horde. Men and women have no feelings outside of their devotion to the Horde. Men have no mates and children, which prevents Thig from first understanding the warm feeling that sweeps over him when Lewis Terry\u2019s children greet him and Ellen kisses him on the first night he goes to their home. On Ortha, men have no independent ideas or interests; everything they think and do is to maintain the Horde. For this reason, their civilization has remained static for a hundred thousand years.\n\nOn Earth, men and women love each other and marry and have children. Men are focused on the well-being of their families and their own lives rather than on the well-being of their population as a whole. Earthmen have independent thoughts and make their own decisions. People are unpredictable, and uncertainty adds interest to everyday life.\n",
        "Article": "   QUEST OF THIG     By BASIL WELLS     Thig of Ortha was the vanguard of the conquering     HORDE. He had blasted across trackless space     to subdue a defenseless world\u2014only to meet on     Earth emotions that were more deadly than weapons.     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Planet Stories Fall 1942.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      Thig carefully smoothed the dark sand and seaweed of the lonely beachover the metal lid of the flexible ringed tunnel that linked the grubbyship from another planet with the upper air. He looked out across theheaving waters of the Sound toward Connecticut. He stared appraisinglyaround at the luxuriant green growth of foliage further inland; andstarted toward the little stretch of trees and brush, walking carefullybecause of the lesser gravitation.     Thig was shorter than the average Earthman\u2014although on Ortha hewas well above the average in height\u2014but his body was thick andpowerfully muscled. His skull was well-shaped and large; his featureswere regular, perhaps a trifle oversize, and his hair and eyes werea curiously matching blend of reddish brown. Oddest of all, he woreno garments, other than the necessary belt and straps to support hisrod-like weapon of white metal and his pouches for food and specimens.     The Orthan entered the narrow strip of trees and crossed to thelittle-used highway on the other side. Here he patiently sat down towait for an Earthman or an Earthwoman to pass. His task now was tobring a native, intact if possible, back to the carefully buried spacecruiser where his two fellows and himself would drain the creature'smentality of all its knowledge. In this way they could learn whether aplanet was suited for colonization by later swarms of Orthans.     Already they had charted over a hundred celestial bodies but of themall only three had proven worthy of consideration. This latest planet,however, 72-P-3 on the chart, appeared to be an ideal world in everyrespect. Sunlight, plenty of water and a dense atmospheric envelopemade of 72-P-3 a paradise among planets.     The explorer from another world crouched into the concealment of aleafy shrub. A creature was approaching. Its squat body was coveredwith baggy strips of bluish cloth and it carried a jointed rod of metaland wood in its paw. It walked upright as did the men of Ortha.     Thig's cold eyes opened a trifle wider as he stared into the thing'sstupid face. It was as though he was looking into a bit of polishedmetal at the reflection of himself!     The Earthman was opposite now and he must waste no more precioustime. The mighty muscles of the Orthan sent him hurtling across theintervening space in two prodigious bounds, and his hands clampedacross the mouth and neck of the stranger....   <doc-sep> You have done well, announced Torp when Thig had completed his reporton the resources and temperatures of various sections of Terra. We nowhave located three worlds fit for colonization and so we will return toOrtha at once.     I will recommend the conquest of this planet, 72-P-3 at once and thecomplete destruction of all biped life upon it. The mental aberrationsof the barbaric natives might lead to endless complications if theywere permitted to exist outside our ordered way of life. I imagine thatthree circuits of the planet about its primary should prove sufficientfor the purposes of complete liquidation.     But why, asked Thig slowly, could we not disarm all the natives andexile them on one of the less desirable continents, Antarctica forexample or Siberia? They are primitive humans even as our race was oncea race of primitives. It is not our duty to help to attain our owndegree of knowledge and comfort?     Only the good of the Horde matters! shouted Torp angrily. Shall arace of feeble-witted beasts, such as these Earthmen, stand in the wayof a superior race? We want their world, and so we will take it. TheLaw of the Horde states that all the universe is ours for the taking.     Let us get back to Ortha at once, then, gritted out Thig savagely.Never again do I wish to set foot upon the soil of this mad planet.There are forces at work upon Earth that we of Ortha have longforgotten.     Check the blood of Thig for disease, Kam, ordered Torp shortly. Hiswords are highly irrational. Some form of fever perhaps native to thisworld. While you examine him I will blast off for Ortha.     Thig followed Kam into the tiny laboratory and found a seat beside thesquat scientist's desk. His eyes roamed over the familiar instrumentsand gauges, each in its own precise position in the cases along thewalls. His gaze lingered longest on the stubby black ugliness ofa decomposition blaster in its rack close to the deck. A blast ofthe invisible radiations from that weapon's hot throat and flesh orvegetable fiber rotted into flaky ashes.     The ship trembled beneath their feet; it tore free from the feebleclutch of the sand about it, and they were rocketing skyward. Thig'sbroad fingers bit deep into the unyielding metal of his chair. Suddenlyhe knew that he must go back to Earth, back to Ellen and the childrenof the man he had helped destroy. He loved Ellen, and nothing muststand between them! The Hordes of Ortha must find some other world, anempty world\u2014this planet was not for them.     Turn back! he cried wildly. I must go back to Earth. There is awoman there, helpless and alone, who needs me! The Horde does not needthis planet.     Kam eyed him coldly and lifted a shining hypodermic syringe from itscase. He approached Thig warily, aware that disease often made a maniacof the finest members of the Horde.     No human being is more important than the Horde, he stated baldly.This woman of whom you speak is merely one unit of the millions wemust eliminate for the good of the Horde.     Then it was that Thig went berserk. His fists slashed into the thickjaw of the scientist and his fingers ripped at the hard cords overlyingthe Orthan's vital throat tubes. His fingers and thumb gouged deep intoKam's startled throat and choked off any cry for assistance before itcould be uttered.     Kam's hand swept down to the holster swung from his intricate harnessand dragged his blaster from it. Thig's other hand clamped over his andfor long moments they swayed there, locked together in silent deadlystruggle. The fate of a world hung in the balance as Kam's other handfought against that lone arm of Thig.   <doc-sep> There it is, announced Thig, dropping the limp body of the capturedEarthman to the metal deck-plates. It is a male of the species thatmust have built the cities we saw as we landed.     He resembles Thig, announced Kam. But for the strange covering hewears he might be Thig.     Thig will be this creature! announced Torp. With a psychic relay wewill transfer the Earthman's memories and meager store of knowledge tothe brain of Thig! He can then go out and scout this world withoutarousing suspicion. While he is gone, I will take Kam and explore thetwo inner planets.     You are the commander, said Thig. But I wish this beast did not wearthese clumsy sheathing upon his body. On Ortha we do not hamper the useof our limbs so.     Do not question the word of your commander, growled Torp, swellingout his thick chest menacingly. It is for the good of our people thatyou disguise yourself as an Earthman.     For the good of the Horde, Thig intoned almost piously as he liftedTerry's body and headed for the laboratory.     Service for the Horde was all that the men of Ortha knew. Carefullycultured and brought to life in the laboratories of their Horde, theyknew neither father nor mother. Affection and love were entirelylacking in their early training and later life. They were trainedantlike from childhood that only the growth and power of the Hordewere of any moment. Men and women alike toiled and died like unfeelingrobots of flesh and bone for the Horde. The Horde was their religion,their love-life, their everything!     So it was that the bodies of the Earthman and the Orthan were strappedon two parallel tables of chill metal and the twin helmets, linked toone another by the intricacies of the psychic relay, put upon theirheads.     For ten hours or more the droning hum of the relay sucked Terry's braindry of knowledge. The shock upon the nervous system of the Earthmanproved too violent and his heart faltered after a time and stoppedcompletely. Twice, with subtle drugs they restored pseudo-life to hisbody and kept the electrical impulses throbbing from his torturedbrain, but after the third suspension of life Thig removed his helmet.     There is nothing more to learn, he informed his impassive comrades.Now, let us get on with the plastic surgery that is required. My newbody must return to its barbaric household before undue attention isaroused. And when I return I will take along some of the gleamingbaubles we found on the red planet\u2014these people value them highly.     An hour later, his scars and altered cartilage already healed andpainless, Thig again scraped sand over the entrance to the space shipand set out along the moonlit beach toward the nearest path runninginland to his home.     Memory was laying the country bare about him, Terry's own childhoodmemories of this particular section of Long Island. Here was the placewhere Jake and Ted had helped him dig for the buried treasure thatold 'Notch-ear' Beggs had told them so exactly about. Remembrance ofthat episode gave Thig an idea about the little lump of jewels in hispocket. He had found them in a chest along the beach!     He was coming up on the porch now and at the sound of his foot onthe sagging boards the screen door burst open and three littleEarth-creatures were hugging at his legs. An odd sensation, that hisacquired memories labeled as pleasure, sent a warm glow upward fromaround his heart.     Then he saw the slender red-haired shape of a woman, the mate of thedead man he knew, and confusion struck his well-trained brain. Menhad no mates on Ortha, sex had been overthrown with all the otherprimitive impulses of barbarism; so he was incapable of understandingthe emotions that swept through his acquired memory.     Unsteadily he took her in his arms and felt her warm lips pressed,trembling, against his own. That same hot wave of pulsing blood chokedachingly up into his throat.     Lew, dear, Ellen was asking, where have you been all day? I calledup at the landing but you were not there. I wanted to let you know thatSaddlebag Publications sent a check for $50 for Reversed Revolversand three other editors asked for shorts soon.  "

When Thig assumes Terry\u2019s identity, some of the first sensations he experiences result from Ellen kissing him. On their travels throughout the American West, Thig bonds with her and with her children. He learns to understand new experiences and emotions throughout his time with Ellen, and he observes that she seems to know how he\u2019s feeling without him telling her. When Thig ultimately realizes that he wants to go back to Earth, it is because he loves Ellen and wants to save her and humanity.

He travels with her and the children out West, where she demonstrates the feeling of breathless wonder at the beauty of nature when they visit the Grand Canyon. He feels love for Ellen, and that feeling changes everything Thig thought he knew. When he returns to the ship after spending three months with Ellen, he feels the strong urge to return to her and spend the rest of his life with her.

In the beginning, Thig is only interested in finding a new home for his people, the Orthans. However, from their first hug alone, Thig begins to have feelings for Ellen. He likes the way that she offers him food and coffee and knows when something is bothering him. He is pleased with her excitement when he shows her the treasure he found at the beach. Thig loves spending the three months with Ellen and her children in their trailer exploring the West.

        "Article": "Home again, whispered Ellen as she stood beside Thig twelve weekslater and gazed tearfully at the weathered little gray house. She kneltbeside the front stoop and reached for the key hidden beneath it.     The west was wonderful; tremendous, vast and beautiful, she wenton as they climbed the steps, but nowhere was there any place asbeautiful as our own little strip of sky and water.     Thig sank into a dusty old swing that hung on creaking chains from theexposed rafters of the porch roof. He looked down at the dusty gray carand the bulbous silvery bulk of the trailer that had been their livingquarters for almost three months. Strange thoughts were afloat in thechaos of his cool Orthan brain.     Tonight or tomorrow night at the latest he must contact his two fellowsand report that Earth was a planetary paradise. No other world,including Ortha, was so well-favored and rich. An expeditionary forceto wipe the grotesque civilizations of Earth out of existence would,of course, be necessary before the first units of new Hordes could belanded. And there Thig balked. Why must they destroy these people,imperfect though their civilization might be, to make room for theHordes?     Thig tried to tell himself that it was the transmitted thoughts of thedead Earthman that made him feel so, but he was not too sure. For threemonths he had lived with people who loved, hated, wept and sacrificedfor reasons that he had never known existed. He had learned the headyglory of thinking for himself and making his own decisions. He hadexperienced the primitive joy of matching his wits and tongue againstthe wits of other unpredictable human beings. There was no abruptdivision of men and women into definite classes of endeavor. A laborerthought the same thoughts that a governor might think. Uncertaintyadded zest to every day's life.     The Orthan had come to question the sole devotion of the individual tothe Horde to the exclusion of all other interests. What, he wondered,would one new world\u2014or a hundred\u2014populated by the Hordes add tothe progress of humanity? For a hundred thousand years the Orthancivilization had remained static, its energies directed into certainwell-defined channels. They were mindless bees maintaining their vastmechanical hives.     There was that moment on the brink of the Grand Canyon when Ellen hadcaught his arm breathlessly at all the beauty spread away there beneaththem. There were mornings in the desert when the sun painted in luridred the peaks above the harsh black-and-whites of the sagebrush andcactus slopes. There was the little boy, his body burning with fever,who nestled trustingly against his tense man's body and slept\u2014the sonof Ellen and the man he had destroyed.     Thig groaned. He was a weakling to let sentimentality so get the betterof his judgment. He would go now to the space ship and urge them toblast off for Ortha. He sprang off the porch and strode away down theroad toward the beach.     The children ran to him; wanted to go along. He sent them away harshlybut they smiled and waved their brown little hands. Ellen came to thedoor and called after him.     Hurry home, dear, she said. I'll have a bite ready in about an hour.     He dared not say anything, for his voice would have broken and shewould have known something was wrong. She was a very wise sort ofperson when something was troubling him. He waved his stubby paw of ahand to show that he had heard, and blindly hurried toward the Sound.     Oddly enough, as he hurried away along the narrow path through theautumn woods, his mind busied itself with a new epic of the west thatlived no longer. He mentally titled it: Rustlers' Riot and blockedin the outlines of his plot. One section of his brain was that of thecareless author of gunslinging yarns, a section that seemed to besapping the life from his own brain. He knew that the story would neverbe written, but he toyed with the idea.

        "Summary_1": "Joe and Harvey land on Planetoid 42 and enter a bar. They see Genius, an incredible looking creature with six limbs, and immediately become interested in him. They tell the bartender, Johnson, that they\u2019re very thirsty, so he sells them each eight glasses of water, and they guzzle them down. Harvey and Joe are horrified to find out that the water is highly expensive. Johnson explains that the water must be purified. When the pair leaves, they find a pipe in a small pond and realize that Johnson has undoubtedly swindled them. The sweet water is readily available and it is transported directly to the saloon via this pipe. \n\nHarvey and Joe head back to the bar. Joe comes down with a sudden illness, and it\u2019s clear that this is a con the men use all the time. Johnson recognizes that Joe has asteroid fever and becomes frightened. Harvey explains that the only medication that will provide an instant cure is the one they happen to be selling: La-anago Yergis.\n\nJoe is instantly cured once Harvey pours the special liquid into his mouth. Johnson is flabbergasted and wants to purchase an entire case. While in the privacy of their ship, Joe and Harvey discuss their joint desire to purchase Genius. They believe they could make a fortune off of him if they featured him in an exhibit. \n\nJohnson accepts the fake solution and informs Harvey and Joe that his restaurant is open. After looking at the menu, the men are astounded at the low prices. However, they soon find out that they have been taken advantage of when they receive a bill for a very large sum of money. They learn that the fine print they missed on the menu explains the charge. When Joe tells Johnson they won\u2019t pay the bill, Johnson reminds them that he is in fact the Sheriff as well as the saloon owner and the mayor. \n\nHarvey requests to purchase Genius, and Johnson agrees. In a last ditch effort to recoup some more money, Harvey brings up an invention they have on their ship that Johnson must see. Joe brings back a radio that was supposedly created by a famous doctor. It is special because it broadcasts from the fourth dimension. They convince Johnson that he is the perfect person to make sense of the garbled transmissions. Johnson pays extra for the special batteries it takes.\n\nJust as Harvey and Joe make it back to the ship with Genius, the creature informs them that he cannot leave the planet because another planet\u2019s pressure would squish him to death. And yes, he admits, Johnson was fully aware of this fact when he sold him. \n\nWhen Harvey does the math involved in the various exchanges of goods, he realizes that after all that time and the several cons they engaged in, he and Joe made a measly four cents. The men take off on their ship and head to Mars. \n\n",
        "Summary_2": "Harvey and Joe are interplanetary conmen. They sell fraudulent snake-oil to unsuspecting marks. They arrive on Planetoid 42, a nearly uninhabited asteroid, with a desperate need for water. They come upon the only habitation on the planet and receive water that they are grossly overcharged for. They deal with Johnson, the lone authority on the planet, who is a grifter himself. They duo and Johnson proceed to swindle each other out of money using various schemes and deceptions. As they leave the planet Harvey and Joe realize that they have broke completely even, losing as much money as they gained.",
        "Summary_3": "Harvey Ellswroth and Joe Mallon land on this Planetoid 42 in search of water. These solar salesmen travel the galaxy selling their miraculous elixir, which isn\u2019t so miraculous after all. They find water and are served by Johnson, the barmen, sheriff, and general chief of the land. After drinking eight glasses, their thirst is quenched and they\u2019re ready to pay. At the sight of the large check, they are rightfully appalled, until Johnson explains the reason behind it. The water on this planet is so bitter that it must undergo a rigorous purification process to make it drinkable. Harvey and Joe believe him and pay their sum. They ask if they can fill up the water tank for their spaceship as well, and Johnson points them to the pond. The water there is bitter, but they haul it back and forth. Joe notices a reflection not too far from them and discovers another pond with sweet drinkable water. They realize that they\u2019ve been conned by Johnson. \nThey rush back to the bar to confront him when they meet his son, Jed. Jed is huge, and Harvey and Joe abandon their plan. Quickly, Harvey changes course and asks Jed if he\u2019s feeling ill. Jed feigns illness and collapses, while Johnson assumes it\u2019s the notorious asteroid fever. Harvey rushes to the ship to grab their miraculous cure and forces Joe to drink it. He rises, convincing Johnson of its powers. Johnson quickly asks to buy cases of it, and Harvey agrees, supplying it at a great price. The men run back to the ship to prepare the vials. Harvey is supplementing them with the bitter water, so they save more snake oil. \nJohnson invites them to eat at his restaurant when they return with the medicine. He cons them yet again here by including a hefty fee at the bottom of the paycheck for the entertainment that Genius provided. \nHarvey and Joe still decide to barter further and arrange a monetary transaction in exchange for Genius. Johnson agrees though he admits he will miss him. At this, Harvey decides on one last con and sends Joe to pick up their most prized possession. A radio that can reach the fourth dimension. Johnson buys into it and sits down to attempt to translate garbled English. Harvey, Joe, and Genius leave quickly before Johnson realizes the radio is nothing more than tomfoolery. \nHowever, the last con is played on Harvey and Joe, as Genius reveals he is unable to leave this planet due to atmospheric pressure differences. Harvey and Joe leave him behind. \nThey count their money and realize they haven\u2019t made any real profit. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Harvey Ellsworth and Joe Mallon have landed on Planetoid 42, somewhere between Mars and Ganymede, out of water and in need of supplies. They find a saloon manned by a six-armed life-form and a bartender named Johnson. Harvey and Joe ask for water, which they get, but are charged forty buckos, presumably because there is a high price to get water filtered in this area. The men are astounded but Harvey tries to be understanding of the unusual situation, and pays Johnson the money he asks for. It turns out that Johnson is not just the bartender, but also the mayor, among other jobs. He works out a deal for the men to fill their tanks with purified water, claims to give them a bargain price, and sends his assistant out to the pumps to help the men. Although purified water is expensive, unpurified water used as battery fluid is free, and Johnson points the men to the body of water where they can find what they need. As Joe and Harvey are collecting battery water, they find pipes that carry purified water to the saloon from a clean pool\u2014Johnson had lied about the purification system, and thus charged them way more than the water was worth (twice), so Harvey decides they need revenge. Joe pretends to get asteroid fever, which terrifies Johnson, and Harvey concocts a fake medicine using some of the bitter water to convince Johnson to buy a case from him. The back-and-forth of cons continues: Johnson lures them into a meal with inexpensive food but an expensive hidden surcharge for service and entertainment. Then, Harvey \u201cconvinces\u201d Johnson to sell him Genius, his assistant, and Joe and Harvey convince Johnson to buy a radio that they inserted a scrambler into, claiming it had hidden knowledge from the fourth dimension. This whole time, Johnson acts as though he doesn\u2019t have any interest in things he wants to buy, for as long as he can maintain that appearance. However, Joe and Harvey will often get him interested by the end, with Johnson becoming upset when he can\u2019t have what he wants. In the end, it turns out Genius can\u2019t actually leave Planetoid 42, because he would be crushed by a larger planet\u2019s gravity, and Joe and Harvey leave somewhat dejected, hoping that they managed to make some amount of money from the whole ordeal. It turns out they broke exactly even, so they had a good laugh of frustration and went on to Mars to try another plan.\n\n",

He turned to thebartender apologetically. Don't mind my friend. His adrenal glands aresometimes overactive. You were going to say\u2014?   <doc-sep> Bob Parker had received that ethergram three weeks ago. And if TheInterplanetary Hauling & Moving Co., hadn't been about to go on therocks (chiefly due to the activities of Saylor & Saylor, a rival firm)neither Bob nor Queazy would have thought of sending an answeringethergram to Burnside stating that they would fill the order. Itwas, plainly, a hair-brained request. And yet, if by some chancethere was such a rigidly specified asteroid, their financial worrieswould be over. That they had actually discovered the asteroid, usingtheir mass-detectors in a weight-elimination process, seemed likean incredible stroke of luck. For there are literally millions ofasteroids in the asteroid belt, and they had been out in space onlythree weeks.     The asteroid in your back yard idea had been Bob Parker's originally.Now it was a fad that was sweeping Earth, and Burnside wasn't the firstrich man who had decided to hold a wedding on top of an asteroid.Unfortunately, other interplanetary moving companies had cashed in onthat brainstorm, chiefly the firm of the Saylor brothers\u2014which personsBob Parker intended to punch in the nose some day. And would havebefore this if he hadn't been lanky and tall while they were giants.Now that he and Queazy had found the asteroid, they were desperate toget it to its destination, for fear that the Saylor brothers might getwind of what was going on, and try to beat them out of their profits.Which was not so far-fetched, because the firm of Saylor & Saylor madeno pretense of being scrupulous.     Now they scuffed along the smooth-plane topside of the asteroid, themagnets in their shoes keeping them from stepping off into space. Theycame to the broad base of the asteroid-wedge, walked over the edge anddown the twelve-foot thickness. Here they squatted, and Bob Parkerhappily clamped the atomic-whirl spectroscope to the rough surface.By the naked eye, they could see iron ore, quartz crystals, cinnabar,but he had the spectroscope and there was no reason why he shouldn'tuse it. He satisfied himself as to the exterior of the asteroid, andthen sent the twin beams deep into its heart. The beams crossed, toreatoms from molecules, revolved them like an infinitely fine powder. Theradiations from the sundered molecules traveled back up the beams tothe atomic-whirl spectroscope. Bob watched a pointer which moved slowlyup and up\u2014past tungsten, past iridium, past gold\u2014     Bob Parker said, in astonishment, Hell! There's something screwy aboutthis business. Look at that point\u2014     Neither he nor Queazy had the opportunity to observe the pointer anyfurther. A cold, completely disagreeable feminine voice said,     May I ask what you interlopers are doing on my asteroid?     Bob started so badly that the spectroscope's settings were jarred andthe lights in its interior died. Bob twisted his head around as far ashe could inside the aquarium\u2014the glass helmet, and found himselflooking at a space-suited girl who was standing on the edge of theasteroid below.     Ma'am, said Bob, blinking, did you say something?     Queazy made a gulping sound and slowly straightened. He automaticallyreached up as if he would take off his hat and twist it in his hands.     I said, remarked the girl, that you should scram off of my asteroid.And quit poking around at it with that spectroscope. I've already takena reading. Cinnabar, iron ore, quartz crystals, tungsten.

        "Query": "What is the connection between Harvey and Joe in the story \"Grifters' Asteroid\"?",
        "Summary_1": "Harvey and Joe are business partners and conmen. Although they are both important players in their various ruses, Harvey is definitely the brains behind the operation. Joe is willing to listen to Harvey\u2019s instructions and play along in order to get money out of their victims. However, he is also a bit more hot-headed than his partner, and it\u2019s up to Harvey to calm Joe down when he gets flustered because they are taken advantage of. When Joe finds out about the sweet water that Johnson lied about, he is instantly irate. Later, when Johnson tricks them into ordering loads of food at his restaurant, Joe is furious and threatens not to pay the bill. In both instances, Harvey recognizes that the pair was fooled fair and square and all they can do is accept the loss. \n\nIt is obvious that the two have been working together for a long time because they are able to communicate using very few words and gestures. They both know their playbook of tricks, and it is easy for each of the men to tip the other off to their thoughts. After meeting Genius, Harvey and Joe immediately agree that they should try and acquire the creature. Both men are money-minded and they see dollar signs when they lay their eyes on an alien as peculiar as him. When the duo wants to sell their medicine, Joe pretends to come down with symptoms of asteroid fever, and Harvey doesn\u2019t miss a beat. Within moments he asks Joe if he\u2019s feeling okay and goes to fetch the fake panacea that they peddle. \n\n",
        "Summary_2": "Harvey and Joe are conmen and partners. They work together to deceive and swindle people out of their money using various schemes. Harvey is a fast-talker and smooth operator. Joe is more emotionally charged and tends to complain to Harvey often about the state of affairs they find themselves in. Joe often questions Harvey's approach but falls in line in order to execute his plan.  Even though they work well together, they also fall prey to the deceptions that are set up by Johnson.",
        "Summary_3": "Harvey and Joe are colleagues and friends. They work together as solar salesmen, who con people by selling them their fake cure for all ailments. Their experience together makes them very effective conmen. \n\tIt\u2019s clear through their rapport and previously devised tricks that they have been working together for a long time. When Joe feigned being sick to sell the medicine, Harvey guided Johnson along with them and convinced him entirely of the medicine\u2019s success.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Harvey Ellsworth and Joe Mallon have very complementary personalities: when we meet them, they show us that Harvey is the levelheaded one who tries to see the best in people, but Joe is much more reactive and has less of a performative air to his demeanor. They know each other quite well, enough that they are able to communicate with each other discreetly to give each other direction while trying to run a con. Harvey is the one who holds on to hope in an interesting sense: he is able to take previous experiences to formulate plans for current predicaments, in a way that means he is not easily rattled. This presents itself in Harvey acting as sort of a leader of the duo, and Harvey comes up with plans and directs Joe as needed. Harvey steers a lot of the conversations they have with others, and when it\u2019s just the two of them, Harry spends a lot of time scolding Joe for his attitude. Even though Harvey tries to see the best in Johnson at the beginning of the story, he eventually agrees with Joe\u2019s anger once they realize that Johnson did not need to purify the water that he had sold them. However, whereas Joe was angry at the treatment they were receiving, Harvey more directly wanted revenge. In the end, when they leave Planetoid 42, we see them connect about their history again, excited to run another con together.",

He turned to thebartender apologetically. Don't mind my friend. His adrenal glands aresometimes overactive. You were going to say\u2014?   <doc-sep> It was on the sixth trip that Joe caught a glimpse of Jupiter-shine ona bright surface off to the left. The figure, 750, with the bucko signin front of it, was still doing acrobatics inside his skull and keepinga faint suspicion alive in him. So he called Harvey and they went toinvestigate.     Among the skimpy ground-crawling vines, they saw a long slender moundthat was unmistakably a buried pipe.     What's this doing here? Harvey asked, puzzled. I thought Johnson hadto transport water in pails.     Wonder where it leads to, Joe said uneasily.     It leads      to     the saloon, said Harvey, his eyes rapidly tracing thepipe back toward the spaceport. What I am concerned with is where itleads      from     .     Five minutes later, panting heavily from the unaccustomed exertion ofscrambling through the tangle of planetorial undergrowth, they burstinto the open\u2014before a clear, sparkling pool.     Mutely, Harvey pointed out a pipe-end jutting under the water.     I am growing suspicious, he said in a rigidly controlled voice.     But Joe was already on his knees, scooping up a handful of water andtasting it.     Sweet! he snarled.     They rushed back to the first pool, where Joe again tasted a sample.His mouth went wry. Bitter! He uses only one pool, the sweet one! Theonly thing that needs purifying around here is that blasted mayor'sconscience.     The asteroidal Poobah has tricked us with a slick come-on, saidHarvey slowly. His eyes grew cold. Joseph, the good-natured artist inme has become a hard and merciless avenger. I shall not rest until wehave had the best of this colonial con-man! Watch your cues from thispoint hence.     Fists clenched, the two returned to the saloon. But at the door theystopped and their fists unclenched.     Thought you gents were leaving, the mayor called out, seeing themfrozen in the doorway. Glad you didn't. Now you can meet my son, Jed.Him and me are the whole Earthman population of Johnson City.     You don't need any more, said Harvey, dismayed.     Johnson's eight-foot son, topped by a massive roof of sun-bleached hairand held up by a foundation that seemed immovable, had obviously beenborn and raised in low gravity. For any decent-sized world would havekept him down near the general dimensions of a man.     He held out an acre of palm. Harvey studied it worriedly, put his ownhand somewhere on it, swallowed as it closed, then breathed again whenhis fingers were released in five units instead of a single compressedone.     Pleased to meet you, piped a voice that had never known a denseatmosphere.     The pursuit of vengeance, Harvey realized, had taken a quick andunpleasant turn. Something shrewd was called for....     Joseph! he exclaimed, looking at his partner in alarm. Don't youfeel well?     Even before the others could turn to him, Joe's practiced eyes weregently crossing. He sagged against the door frame, all his featuresdrooping like a bloodhound's.     Bring him in here! Johnson cried. I mean, get him away! He's comingdown with asteroid fever!     Of course, replied Harvey calmly. Any fool knows the first symptomsof the disease that once scourged the universe.     What do you mean,      once     ? demanded Johnson. I come down with itevery year, and I ain't hankering to have it in an off-season. Get himout of here!     In good time. He can't be moved immediately.     Then he'll be here for months!     Harvey helped Joe to the counter and lifted him up on it. The mayor andhis gigantic offspring were cowering across the room, trying to breathein tiny, uncontaminating gasps.     You'll find everything you want in the back room, Johnson saidfrantically, sulfopyridine, mustard plasters, rubs, inhalers, suctioncups\u2014     Relics of the past, Harvey stated. One medication is all modern manrequires to combat the dread menace, asteroid fever.     What's that? asked the mayor without conviction.     Instead of replying, Harvey hurried outside to the ungainly second-handrocket ship in the center of the shabby spaceport. He returned within afew minutes, carrying a bottle.   <doc-sep> Joe was still stretched out on the bar, panting, his eyes slowlycrossing and uncrossing. Harvey lifted the patient's head tenderly,put the bottle to his lips and tilted it until he was forced to drink.When Joe tried to pull away, Harvey was inexorable. He made his partnerdrink until most of the liquid was gone. Then he stepped back andwaited for the inevitable result.     Joe's performance was better than ever. He lay supine for severalmoments, his face twisted into an expression that seemed doomedto perpetual wryness. Slowly, however, he sat up and his featuresstraightened out.     Are\u2014are you all right? asked the mayor anxiously.     Much better, said Joe in a weak voice.     Maybe you need another dose, Harvey suggested.     Joe recoiled. I'm fine now! he cried, and sprang off the bar to proveit.     Astonished, Johnson and his son drew closer. They searched Joe's face,and then the mayor timidly felt his pulse.     Well, I'll be hanged! Johnson ejaculated.           La-anago Yergis     never fails, my friend, Harvey explained. Byactual test, it conquers asteroid fever in from four to twenty-threeminutes, depending on the severity of the attack. Luckily, we caughtthis one before it grew formidable.     The mayor's eyes became clouded mirrors of an inward conflict. If youdon't charge too much, he said warily, I might think of buying some.     We do not sell this unbelievable remedy, Harvey replied with dignity.It sells itself.     'Course, I'd expect a considerable reduction if I bought a wholecase, said Johnson.     That would be the smallest investment you could make, compared withthe vast loss of time and strength the fever involves.     How much? asked the mayor unhappily.     For you, since you have taken us in so hospitably, a mere five hundredbuckos.     Johnson did not actually stagger back, but he gave the impression ofdoing so. F-four hundred, he offered.     Not a red cent less than four seventy-five, Harvey said flatly.     Make it four fifty, quavered Johnson.     I dislike haggling, said Harvey.     The final price, however, was four hundred and sixty-nine buckos andfifty redsents. Magnanimously, Harvey added: And we will include,      gratis     , an elegant bottle-opener, a superb product of Mercurianhandicraftsmanship.     Johnson stabbed out a warning finger. No tricks now. I want a taste ofthat stuff. You're not switching some worthless junk on me.     Harvey took a glass from the bar and poured him a generous sample. Themayor sniffed it, grimaced, then threw it down his gullet. The ensuingminute saw a grim battle between a man and his stomach, a battle whichthe man gradually won.     There ain't no words for that taste, he gulped when it was safe totalk again.     Medicine, Harvey propounded, should taste like medicine. To Joe hesaid: Come, my esteemed colleague. We must perform the sacred task towhich we have dedicated ourselves.     With Joe stumbling along behind, he left the saloon, crossed theclearing and entered the ship. As soon as they were inside, Joe droppedhis murderous silence and cried:     What kind of a dirty trick was that, giving me poison instead of thatsnake oil?     That was not poison, Harvey contradicted quietly. It was      La-anagoYergis     extract, plus.     Plus what\u2014arsenic?     Now, Joseph! Consider my quandary when I came back here to manufactureour specific for all known ailments, with the intention of sellingyonder asteroidal tin-horn a bill of medical goods\u2014an entire case,mind you. Was I to mix the extract with the water for which we had beenswindled to the tune of ten buckos a liter? Where would our profit havebeen, then? No; I had to use the bitter free water, of course.     But why use it on me? Joe demanded furiously.     Harvey looked reprovingly at his gangling partner. Did Johnson ask totaste it, or did he not? One must look ahead, Joseph. I had to producethe same      medicine     that we will now manufacture. Thus, you were aguinea pig for a splendid cause.     Okay, okay, Joe said. But you shoulda charged him more.     Joseph, I promise you that we shall get back every redsent of whichthat swindler cheated us, besides whatever other funds or valuables hepossesses. We could not be content with less.     Well, we're starting all right, admitted Joe. How about that thingwith six arms? He looks like a valuable. Can't we grab him off?     Harvey stopped filling bottles and looked up pensively.     I have every hope of luring away the profitable monstrosity.Apparently you have also surmised the fortune we could make with him.At first I purpose to exhibit him on our interplanetary tours with ourstreamlined panacea; he would be a spectacular attraction for bucolicsuckers.

        "Query": "What does Genius mean in the context of GRIFTERS' ASTEROID?",
        "Summary_1": "Genius is an important character because he is used to illustrate just how brilliant Johnson is. The man is clearly intelligent because he has positioned himself as the sheriff, the barman, and the mayor of Planetoid 42. He also makes money by fooling gullible outsiders into paying high prices for water and food. However, his idea to sell Genius over and over again is perhaps the most shrewd. His asking price for the remarkable creature is in the 600s, much more than he\u2019s able to charge for water or dishes at his restaurant. Johnson pretends that he\u2019s attached to Genius and would hate to see him go, yet he cannot turn down the incredible sum of money. \n\nEach time Genius is sold to naive buyers, he ends up making his way right back to Johnson\u2019s bar, and Johnson profits all of the money. Genius cannot leave the planet because the pressure in other habitats is too much for his unique body to handle. If one of the buyers insisted on bringing him aboard their ship, he would turn up dead and useless to them anyway. Therefore, they always send the poor creature back to Johnson and lose out on their plans to make loads of money off of him. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Genius is an alien being with 6 arms. He serves Johnson on Planetoid 42 as an all-around servant. He is coveted by and eventually purchased by Harvey and Joe to be exploited for profit off world. Unfortunately for the pair, after his purchase Genius explains that he cannot leave the planet because the higher atmospheric pressure of an off world environment would kill him. Johnson continually \"sells\" genius to unsuspecting visitors to the planet as a source of income only to have him return.",
        "Summary_3": "Genius is the many-armed native that works for Johnson and his son. His 30 fingers and dexterous abilities make him a hot commodity to Harvey and Joe. After they watch him bartend, using some hands to pour glasses, other to sweep the floor, and even more to complete other duties, they start brainstorming all the ways he could be helpful onboard their ship. Or, on the other hand, how much they could get for him once he\u2019s sold. \nEventually, Harvey and Joe decide to make an offer on Genius. Johnson sells his worker for a little over half a thousand buckos. Despite selling him to Harvey and Joe, Johnson forgot to include one minute detail. Genius is unable to leave their small planet, due to the gravity he grew up on. Any bigger atmospheric pressure would crush him. \nGenius is yet another example of the many cons Johnson pulled on Harvey and Joe.\n",
        "Summary_4": "The character of Genius acts as a symbol of the things that visitors do not understand about Planetoid 42, and how Johnson uses this to his advantage when he tries to make money off of visitors. When humans first encounter him, Genius seems like an incredible and one-of-a-kind creature who fascinates the visitors, sometimes prompting them to want to take him to zoo. Johnson uses this to his advantage to set a trap, and allows visitors to buy Genius off of him before they realize that Genius can\u2019t actually leave the planetoid. Not only does he look interesting, but he is also very talented and uses his six hands to accomplish many tasks at once. He is able to carry boxes while cleaning, and makes for an incredible waiter as he is able to play instruments while serving food. Johnson has to rely on the idea that the visitors will not think about Genius\u2019 inability to adapt to other planets\u2019 environments, and focus only on his uniqueness. Genius also represents how Johnson leaves out small pieces of information in strategic places. For instance, there is no reason to assume that Genius is able to speak based on the majority of the story, but once he arrived at Joe and Harvey\u2019s ship he explains to them that he cannot go with them. It seems he is a piece of Johnson\u2019s plot, as his assistant, as opposed to being more of an independent character who makes his own decisions, but there is not enough information to say for sure.",
        "Article": "The air-lock door was still wide open when Click reached it, his headswimming darkly, his lungs crammed with pain-fire and hell-rockets. Helet himself down in, quiet and soft. He didn't have a weapon. He didn'thave a weapon. Oh, damn, damn!     A tunnel curved, ending in light, and two men silhouetted in thatyellow glare. Marnagan, backed against a wall, his helmet cracked,air hissing slowly out of it, his face turning blue. And the guard, aproton gun extended stiffly before him, also in a vac-suit. The guardhad his profile toward Hathaway, his lips twisting: I think I'll letyou stand right there and die, he said quietly. That what Guntherwanted, anway. A nice sordid death.     Hathaway took three strides, his hands out in front of him.     Don't move! he snapped. I've got a weapon stronger than yours. Onetwitch and I'll blast you and the whole damned wall out from behindyou! Freeze!     The guard whirled. He widened his sharp eyes, and reluctantly, droppedhis gun to the floor.     Get his gun, Irish.     Marnagan made as if to move, crumpled clumsily forward.     Hathaway ran in, snatched up the gun, smirked at the guard. Thanks forposing, he said. That shot will go down in film history for candidacting.     What!     Ah: ah! Keep your place. I've got a real gun now. Where's the doorleading into the Base?     The guard moved his head sullenly over his left shoulder.     Click was afraid he would show his weak dizziness. He needed air.Okay. Drag Marnagan with you, open the door and we'll have air. Doubletime! Double!     Ten minutes later, Marnagan and Hathaway, fresh tanks of oxygen ontheir backs, Marnagan in a fresh bulger and helmet, trussed the guard,hid him in a huge trash receptacle. Where he belongs, observed Irishtersely.     They found themselves in a complete inner world; an asteroid nothingmore than a honey-comb fortress sliding through the void unchallenged.Perfect front for a raider who had little equipment and wasshort-handed of men. Gunther simply waited for specific cargo ships torocket by, pulled them or knocked them down and swarmed over them forcargo. The animals served simply to insure against suspicion and theswarms of tourists that filled the void these days. Small fry weren'twanted. They were scared off.     The telepathic sending station for the animals was a great bank ofintricate, glittering machine, through which strips of colored filmwith images slid into slots and machine mouths that translated theminto thought-emanations. A damned neat piece of genius.     So here we are, still not much better off than we were, growledIrish. We haven't a ship or a space-radio, and more guards'll turnup any moment. You think we could refocus this doohingey, project themonsters inside the asteroid to fool the pirates themselves?     What good would that do? Hathaway gnawed his lip. They wouldn't foolthe engineers who created them, you nut.     Marnagan exhaled disgustedly. Ah, if only the U.S. Cavalry would comeriding over the hill\u2014   <doc-sep>    GRIFTERS' ASTEROID     By H. L. GOLD     Harvey and Joe were the slickest con-men ever     to gyp a space-lane sucker. Or so they thought!     Angus Johnson knew differently. He charged them     five buckos for a glass of water\u2014and got it!     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Planet Stories May 1943.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      Characteristically, Harvey Ellsworth tried to maintain his dignity,though his parched tongue was almost hanging out. But Joe Mallon, withno dignity to maintain, lurched across the rubbish-strewn patch of landthat had been termed a spaceport. When Harvey staggered pontificallyinto the battered metalloy saloon\u2014the only one on Planetoid 42\u2014histall, gangling partner was already stumbling out, mouthing somethingincoherent. They met in the doorway, violently.     We're delirious! Joe cried. It's a mirage!     What is? asked Harvey through a mouthful of cotton.     Joe reeled aside, and Harvey saw what had upset his partner. He stared,speechless for once.     In their hectic voyages from planet to planet, the pair of panaceapurveyors had encountered the usual strange life-forms. But never hadthey seen anything like the amazing creature in that colonial saloon.     Paying no attention to them, it was carrying a case of liquor in twohands, six siphons in two others, and a broom and dustpan in theremaining pair. The bartender, a big man resembling the plumpishHarvey in build, was leaning negligently on the counter, ordering thisimpossible being to fill the partly-emptied bottles, squeeze fruitjuice and sweep the floor, all of which the native did simultaneously.     Nonsense, Harvey croaked uncertainly. We have seen enough queerthings to know there are always more.     He led the way inside. Through thirst-cracked lips he rasped:Water\u2014quick!     Without a word, the bartender reached under the counter, brought outtwo glasses of water. The interplanetary con-men drank noisily, askedfor more, until they had drunk eight glasses. Meanwhile, the bartenderhad taken out eight jiggers and filled them with whiskey.     Harvey and Joe were breathing hard from having gulped the water sofast, but they were beginning to revive. They noticed the bartender'simpersonal eyes studying them shrewdly.     Strangers, eh? he asked at last.     Solar salesmen, my colonial friend, Harvey answered in his usuallush manner. We purvey that renowned Martian remedy,      La-anagoYergis     , the formula for which was recently discovered by ourselves inthe ancient ruined city of La-anago. Medical science is unanimous inproclaiming this magic medicine the sole panacea in the entire historyof therapeutics.     Yeah? said the bartender disinterestedly, polishing the chaserglasses without washing them. Where you heading?     Out of Mars for Ganymede. Our condenser broke down, and we've gonewithout water for five ghastly days.     Got a mechanic around this dumping ground you call a port? Joe asked.     We did. He came near starving and moved on to Titan. Ships don't landhere unless they're in trouble.     Then where's the water lead-in? We'll fill up and push off.     Mayor takes care of that, replied the saloon owner. If you gents'refinished at the bar, your drinks'll be forty buckos.     Harvey grinned puzzledly. We didn't take any whiskey.     Might as well. Water's five buckos a glass. Liquor's free with everychaser.     Harvey's eyes bulged. Joe gulped. That\u2014that's robbery! the lanky manmanaged to get out in a thin quaver.     The barkeeper shrugged. When there ain't many customers, you gottamake more on each one. Besides\u2014     Besides nothing! Joe roared, finding his voice again. You dirtycrook\u2014robbing poor spacemen! You\u2014        You dirty crook! Joe roared. Robbing honest spacemen!        Harvey nudged him warningly. Easy, my boy, easy. He turned to thebartender apologetically. Don't mind my friend. His adrenal glands aresometimes overactive. You were going to say\u2014?   <doc-sep> Unwillingly, Joe agreed. While Genius retreated to a safe distance,they entered the ship and blasted off. Within a few minutes theautomatic steering pilot had maneuvered them above the plane of theasteroid belt.     I got kind of dizzy, Joe said, there were so many deals back andforth. How much did we make on the sucker?     A goodly amount, I wager, Harvey responded. He took out a pencil andpaper. Medicine, 469.50; radio, 1,000; batteries, 199. Total\u2014let'ssee\u20141668 buckos and 50 redsents. A goodly sum, as I told you.     He emptied his pockets of money, spread it out on the astrogation tableand began counting. Finished, he looked up, troubled.     How much did we have when we landed, Joseph?     Exactly 1668 buckos, Joe answered promptly.     I can't understand it, said Harvey. Instead of double our capital,we now have only 1668 buckos and 50 redsents!     Feverishly, he returned to his pencil and paper.     Drinking water, 790; battery water, free; meal, 328; planetoid man,550. Total: 1668 buckos! He stared at the figures. We paid out almostas much as we took in, he said bitterly. Despite our intensiveefforts, we made the absurd sum of fifty redsents.     Why, the dirty crook! Joe growled.     But after a few moments of sad reflection, Harvey became philosophical.Perhaps, Joseph, we are more fortunate than we realize. We were,after all, completely in Johnson's power. The more I ponder, the moreI believe we were lucky to escape. And, anyhow, we did make fiftyredsents on the swindler. A moral victory, my boy.     Joe, who had been sunk desparingly into a chair, now stood up slowlyand asked: Remember that bottle-opener we gave him?     Certainly, Harvey explained. What about it?     How much did it cost us?     Harvey's eyebrows puckered. Suddenly he started laughing. You'reright, Joseph. We paid forty-six redsents for it on Venus. So, afterall that transacting of business, we made four redsents!     Four redsents, hell! Joe snapped. That was the sales tax!     He glared; then a smile lifted his mouth. You remember those yokels onMars' Flatlands, and the way they worshipped gold?           Goldbricks!      Harvey said succinctly.     Grinning, Joe set the robot-controls for Mars.   "

        "Query": "How does Johnson prove himself to be a strong adversary against Joe and Harvey in GRIFTERS' ASTEROID?",
        "Summary_1": "Joe and Harvey are professional conmen, so they are quite good at swindling innocent victims. They make their money by peddling a fake panacea called La-anago Yergis. The men regularly partake in an act where Joe falls ill and Harvey has to come to his rescue with the extract. Although Johnson falls for this trick and purchases an entire case of the medicine, he also does a great job of getting Harvey and Joe back. At the end of the story, the opposing sides come out basically even in terms of financial gains. \n\nJohnson first demonstrates that he can take advantage of Harvey and Joe when he gives them each eight glasses of water before letting them know that he charges a lot for each glass. The men say they\u2019re thirsty, so he is happy to give them as much as they\u2019d like to drink. Although Johnson says that the water costs so much because it must be specially purified, the truth is that he has access to an entire body of water and there really isn\u2019t any reason to charge so much.\n\nLater, Johnson convinces Harvey and Joe that they\u2019re hungry enough to sit down at his restaurant even though neither one had even mentioned food. He allows them to order their food and believe that they\u2019re getting an incredible deal until he tells them about the fine print on the menu. Harvey and Joe are forced to fork over hundreds of dollars for their meal, and when they threaten to walk out, Johnson reminds them that he is the sheriff on Planetoid 42, and he has the power to arrest them. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Johnson has a number of schemes that he uses to swindle Harvey and Joe. He initially charges them for water that he claims is expensively purified when in fact it is naturally drinkable. He overcharges them for a meal using a menu with ludicrously fine print. Finally he sells them Genius even though they can't take him off world. In the end Johnson proves that he is just a good a grifter as Harvey and Joe because he manages to extract exactly as much money out of the pair as they do out of him.",
        "Summary_3": "Joe and Harvey arrive on this planet in need of water for their ship and in the hopes that they will be able to make a profit off of it. From the get-go, we know that these men are scheming cons, but Johnson is the first to make a move. He cons them into paying more for the water than was necessary and from there the battle only grows. \nWith every con Joe and Harvey pull, Johnson is right back with them. Although they may stump him in the end with the ingenious radio that picks up the fourth dimension, he got the last laugh what with Genius being unable to leave. \nAs well, when Joe and Harvey count their money in the end, they realize they\u2019re leaving with the same amount they arrived with. Johnson was not only a formidable foe but possibly their equal in terms of scheming qualities.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Throughout the story, the two groups of people (Joe and Harvey, the travelers, and Johnson and Genius, the locals) are constantly trying to trick one another in ways that the others do not see coming. Joe and Harvey think that they are excellent conmen; they say they are salesman who are traveling, but show throughout the story that they are the type to find the best deal for themselves in any way possible. Johnson, the man who runs the bar and the legal system on Planetoid 42, is ready to rise to the occasion. In fact, at the end of the story, they break even and neither side has actually gained any money. Whenever Joe and Harvey are trying to pull one of their scams, Johnson maintains an uninterested air and tries to not give away any interest in anything the visitors may have to sell him. He always acts as if he needs to be convinced by something, and does not let on what he is trying to pull something over on Joe and Harvey. He also finds very sneaky ways of getting money from them, playing on the visitors\u2019 limited knowledge of the planetoid and its environment. This is how he originally sells them on the idea that he has to charge for water, but it is not his only tactic. He presents them with a menu that has very inexpensive prices for food, but does not mention the extremely small print on the bottom of the menu that shows an exorbitant service charge for the entertainment. These types of ploys have something in common: he tries to set up a situation to make it look very normal for his environment on the planetoid, but hides the information necessary for visitors to make an informed decision. This includes selling Genius near the end of the story, which is a con he has apparently run many times. Because he expects visitors to not think about the biology of the creatures who live on the planetoid, he is able to sell the flashy exterior, in this case his assistant\u2019s capabilities, while there is always a hidden piece of information underneath.",
        "Article": "Joe was still stretched out on the bar, panting, his eyes slowlycrossing and uncrossing. Harvey lifted the patient's head tenderly,put the bottle to his lips and tilted it until he was forced to drink.When Joe tried to pull away, Harvey was inexorable. He made his partnerdrink until most of the liquid was gone. Then he stepped back andwaited for the inevitable result.     Joe's performance was better than ever. He lay supine for severalmoments, his face twisted into an expression that seemed doomedto perpetual wryness. Slowly, however, he sat up and his featuresstraightened out.     Are\u2014are you all right? asked the mayor anxiously.     Much better, said Joe in a weak voice.     Maybe you need another dose, Harvey suggested.     Joe recoiled. I'm fine now! he cried, and sprang off the bar to proveit.     Astonished, Johnson and his son drew closer. They searched Joe's face,and then the mayor timidly felt his pulse.     Well, I'll be hanged! Johnson ejaculated.           La-anago Yergis     never fails, my friend, Harvey explained. Byactual test, it conquers asteroid fever in from four to twenty-threeminutes, depending on the severity of the attack. Luckily, we caughtthis one before it grew formidable.     The mayor's eyes became clouded mirrors of an inward conflict. If youdon't charge too much, he said warily, I might think of buying some.     We do not sell this unbelievable remedy, Harvey replied with dignity.It sells itself.     'Course, I'd expect a considerable reduction if I bought a wholecase, said Johnson.     That would be the smallest investment you could make, compared withthe vast loss of time and strength the fever involves.     How much? asked the mayor unhappily.     For you, since you have taken us in so hospitably, a mere five hundredbuckos.     Johnson did not actually stagger back, but he gave the impression ofdoing so. F-four hundred, he offered.     Not a red cent less than four seventy-five, Harvey said flatly.     Make it four fifty, quavered Johnson.     I dislike haggling, said Harvey.     The final price, however, was four hundred and sixty-nine buckos andfifty redsents. Magnanimously, Harvey added: And we will include,      gratis     , an elegant bottle-opener, a superb product of Mercurianhandicraftsmanship.     Johnson stabbed out a warning finger. No tricks now. I want a taste ofthat stuff. You're not switching some worthless junk on me.     Harvey took a glass from the bar and poured him a generous sample. Themayor sniffed it, grimaced, then threw it down his gullet. The ensuingminute saw a grim battle between a man and his stomach, a battle whichthe man gradually won.     There ain't no words for that taste, he gulped when it was safe totalk again.     Medicine, Harvey propounded, should taste like medicine. To Joe hesaid: Come, my esteemed colleague. We must perform the sacred task towhich we have dedicated ourselves.     With Joe stumbling along behind, he left the saloon, crossed theclearing and entered the ship. As soon as they were inside, Joe droppedhis murderous silence and cried:     What kind of a dirty trick was that, giving me poison instead of thatsnake oil?     That was not poison, Harvey contradicted quietly. It was      La-anagoYergis     extract, plus.     Plus what\u2014arsenic?     Now, Joseph! Consider my quandary when I came back here to manufactureour specific for all known ailments, with the intention of sellingyonder asteroidal tin-horn a bill of medical goods\u2014an entire case,mind you. Was I to mix the extract with the water for which we had beenswindled to the tune of ten buckos a liter? Where would our profit havebeen, then? No; I had to use the bitter free water, of course.     But why use it on me? Joe demanded furiously.     Harvey looked reprovingly at his gangling partner. Did Johnson ask totaste it, or did he not? One must look ahead, Joseph. I had to producethe same      medicine     that we will now manufacture. Thus, you were aguinea pig for a splendid cause.     Okay, okay, Joe said. But you shoulda charged him more.     Joseph, I promise you that we shall get back every redsent of whichthat swindler cheated us, besides whatever other funds or valuables hepossesses. We could not be content with less.     Well, we're starting all right, admitted Joe. How about that thingwith six arms? He looks like a valuable. Can't we grab him off?     Harvey stopped filling bottles and looked up pensively.     I have every hope of luring away the profitable monstrosity.Apparently you have also surmised the fortune we could make with him.At first I purpose to exhibit him on our interplanetary tours with ourstreamlined panacea; he would be a spectacular attraction for bucolicsuckers. Later, a brief period of demonstrating his abilities on theaudio-visiphone. Then our triumph\u2014we shall sell him at a stupendousfigure to the zoo!   <doc-sep> It was on the sixth trip that Joe caught a glimpse of Jupiter-shine ona bright surface off to the left. The figure, 750, with the bucko signin front of it, was still doing acrobatics inside his skull and keepinga faint suspicion alive in him. So he called Harvey and they went toinvestigate.     Among the skimpy ground-crawling vines, they saw a long slender moundthat was unmistakably a buried pipe.     What's this doing here? Harvey asked, puzzled. I thought Johnson hadto transport water in pails.     Wonder where it leads to, Joe said uneasily.     It leads      to     the saloon, said Harvey, his eyes rapidly tracing thepipe back toward the spaceport. What I am concerned with is where itleads      from     .     Five minutes later, panting heavily from the unaccustomed exertion ofscrambling through the tangle of planetorial undergrowth, they burstinto the open\u2014before a clear, sparkling pool.     Mutely, Harvey pointed out a pipe-end jutting under the water.     I am growing suspicious, he said in a rigidly controlled voice.     But Joe was already on his knees, scooping up a handful of water andtasting it.     Sweet! he snarled.     They rushed back to the first pool, where Joe again tasted a sample.His mouth went wry. Bitter! He uses only one pool, the sweet one! Theonly thing that needs purifying around here is that blasted mayor'sconscience.     The asteroidal Poobah has tricked us with a slick come-on, saidHarvey slowly. His eyes grew cold. Joseph, the good-natured artist inme has become a hard and merciless avenger. I shall not rest until wehave had the best of this colonial con-man! Watch your cues from thispoint hence.     Fists clenched, the two returned to the saloon. But at the door theystopped and their fists unclenched.     Thought you gents were leaving, the mayor called out, seeing themfrozen in the doorway. Glad you didn't. Now you can meet my son, Jed.Him and me are the whole Earthman population of Johnson City.     You don't need any more, said Harvey, dismayed.     Johnson's eight-foot son, topped by a massive roof of sun-bleached hairand held up by a foundation that seemed immovable, had obviously beenborn and raised in low gravity. For any decent-sized world would havekept him down near the general dimensions of a man.     He held out an acre of palm. Harvey studied it worriedly, put his ownhand somewhere on it, swallowed as it closed, then breathed again whenhis fingers were released in five units instead of a single compressedone.     Pleased to meet you, piped a voice that had never known a denseatmosphere.     The pursuit of vengeance, Harvey realized, had taken a quick andunpleasant turn. Something shrewd was called for....     Joseph! he exclaimed, looking at his partner in alarm. Don't youfeel well?     Even before the others could turn to him, Joe's practiced eyes weregently crossing. He sagged against the door frame, all his featuresdrooping like a bloodhound's.     Bring him in here! Johnson cried. I mean, get him away! He's comingdown with asteroid fever!     Of course, replied Harvey calmly. Any fool knows the first symptomsof the disease that once scourged the universe.     What do you mean,      once     ? demanded Johnson. I come down with itevery year, and I ain't hankering to have it in an off-season. Get himout of here!     In good time. He can't be moved immediately.     Then he'll be here for months!     Harvey helped Joe to the counter and lifted him up on it. The mayor andhis gigantic offspring were cowering across the room, trying to breathein tiny, uncontaminating gasps.

        "Query": "What is the backdrop of the story GRIFTERS' ASTEROID?",
        "Summary_1": "Planetoid 42 is a place without much to offer besides a port. It is heavily polluted, covered in plants that are similar to vines, and boasts only one saloon. It is home to only two humans, Johnson and his son Jeb, and Genius, a fantastic creature with six limbs that is unlike anything Joe and Harvey have ever seen before. The planet has gravity, which made it possible for Jed to grow to eight feet tall. Genius is also able to thrive on Planetoid 42 while he would perish on other planets with more gravity. \n\nAlthough Johnson says that the water must be purified so it doesn\u2019t taste bitter, the truth is that there\u2019s a large pool with sweet water on the planet. Johnson insists that he has to charge a lot of money for water in part because he has very few customers. The planet is mostly deserted and people only show up to his bar if they\u2019re in trouble.Johnson makes the rules because he is in charge of everything. He is the sheriff, fire chief, mayor, justice of the peace, and restaurateur. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story is set on Planetoid 42. It is a small and extremely sparsely populated asteroid. It has nearly no infrastructure. Most of the narrative takes place in the spaceport/saloon/restaurant operated by Johnson. The world is technologically simple and has very few resources.\n\nThe story takes place in an unspecified future where space travel is commonplace and alien races have been discovered. Joe and Harvey remark that they have traveled from planet to planet and seen numerous strange life forms.",
        "Summary_3": "Grifter\u2019s Asteroid by H.L. Gold takes place on a small planetoid somewhere in the universe. Because of its small size, there are only two Earthmen on it, Johnson and his large son. There are the Native peoples as well, one of which is Genius, Johnson\u2019s employee. \nThis small planet does not have many resources to its name. Due to its small size and remote location, there are no radios or satellites that Johnson can use to catch up on political battles or other earthly drama. \nThere are two water sources, one which is bitter and must be purified to drink, and the other which is sweet and fresh. \nThere\u2019s no mechanic or any other repairman on this planet. Even the spaceport is nothing more than a small stretch of land. This planet has a similar feel to that of a Midwestern rural town.\n",
        "Summary_4": "The story takes place on Planetoid 42, a small and mostly deserted location that lies somewhere between Mars and Ganymede. Because it is small, the gravitational pull is much lower than the larger planets that humans are used to. It is not very well developed in the sense of infrastructure, and there are not many buildings\u2014in fact, only two humans live there, Johnson and his son, although Genius grew up on the planetoid. The saloon is where we encounter our protagonists for the first time, and it is located on a poorly kept stretch of land covered in trash. Outside of the saloon are the water tanks where Johnson keeps his filtered water to sell the people passing through. There are at least two bodies of water outside, one with bitter water that is used for battery fluid, and one that has clean water that Johnson keeps a secret. These locations are connected through sets of pipes that allow Johnson to keep his freshwater tanks full. Most of the story takes place inside the saloon itself. It is at the bar where Joe and Harvey found water to drink at the beginning of the story, this is the bar that Joe lies on when he pretends to have asteroid fever, and this was the area that served as the restaurant where they ate.

He turned to thebartender apologetically. Don't mind my friend. His adrenal glands aresometimes overactive. You were going to say\u2014?   <doc-sep> Bob Parker came to, the emptiness of remote starlight in his face. Heopened his eyes. He was slowly revolving on an axis. Sometimes the Sunswept across his line of vision. A cold hammering began at the base ofhis skull, a sensation similar to that of being buried alive. There wasno asteroid, no girl, no Queazy. He was alone in the vastness of space.Alone in a space-suit.     Queazy! he whispered. Queazy! I'm running out of air!     There was no answer from Queazy. With sick eyes, Bob studied theoxygen indicator. There was only five pounds pressure. Five pounds!That meant he had been floating around out here\u2014how long? Days atleast\u2014maybe weeks! It was evident that somebody had given him a doseof spastic rays, enough to screw up every muscle in his body to thesnapping point, putting him in such a condition of suspended animationthat his oxygen needs were small. He closed his eyes, trying to fightagainst panic. He was glad he couldn't see any part of his body. He wasprobably scrawny. And he was hungry!     I'll starve, he thought. Or suffocate to death first!     He couldn't keep himself from taking in great gulps of air. Minutes,then hours passed. He was breathing abnormally, and there wasn't enoughair in the first place. He pleaded continually for Queazy, hopingthat somehow Queazy could help, when probably Queazy was in the samecondition. He ripped out wild curses directed at the Saylor brothers.Murderers, both of them! Up until this time, he had merely thought ofthem as business rivals. If he ever got out of this\u2014     He groaned. He never would get out of it! After another hour, he wasgasping weakly, and yellow spots danced in his eyes. He called Queazy'sname once more, knowing that was the last time he would have strengthto call it.     And this time the headset spoke back!     Bob Parker made a gurgling sound. A voice came again, washed withstatic, far away, burbling, but excited. Bob made a rattling sound inhis throat. Then his eyes started to close, but he imagined that he sawa ship, shiny and small, driving toward him, growing in size againstthe backdrop of the Milky Way. He relapsed, a terrific buzzing in hisears.     He did not lose consciousness. He heard voices, Queazy's and thegirl's, whoever she was. Somebody grabbed hold of his foot. Hisaquarium was unbuckled and good air washed over his streaming face.The sudden rush of oxygen to his brain dizzied him. Then he was lyingon a bunk, and gradually the world beyond his sick body focussed in hisclearing eyes and he knew he was alive\u2014and going to stay that way, forawhile anyway.     Thanks, Queazy, he said huskily.     Queazy was bending over him, his anxiety clearing away from hissuddenly brightening face.     Don't thank me, he whispered. We'd have both been goners if ithadn't been for her. The Saylor brothers left her paralyzed likeus, and when she woke up she was on a slow orbit around her ship.She unstrapped her holster and threw it away from her and it gaveher enough reaction to reach the ship. She got inside and used thedirection-finder on the telaudio and located me first. The Saylorsscattered us far and wide. Queazy's broad, normally good-humored facetwisted blackly. The so and so's didn't care if we lived or died.     Bob saw the girl now, standing a little behind Queazy, looking down athim curiously, but unhappily. Her space-suit was off. She was wearinglightly striped blue slacks and blue silk blouse and she had a paperflower in her hair. Something in Bob's stomach caved in as his eyeswidened on her.     The girl said glumly, I guess you men won't much care for me when youfind out who I am and what I've done. I'm Starre Lowenthal\u2014Andrew S.Burnside's granddaughter!   <doc-sep> Bob Parker had received that ethergram three weeks ago. And if TheInterplanetary Hauling & Moving Co., hadn't been about to go on therocks (chiefly due to the activities of Saylor & Saylor, a rival firm)neither Bob nor Queazy would have thought of sending an answeringethergram to Burnside stating that they would fill the order. Itwas, plainly, a hair-brained request. And yet, if by some chancethere was such a rigidly specified asteroid, their financial worrieswould be over. That they had actually discovered the asteroid, usingtheir mass-detectors in a weight-elimination process, seemed likean incredible stroke of luck. For there are literally millions ofasteroids in the asteroid belt, and they had been out in space onlythree weeks.     The asteroid in your back yard idea had been Bob Parker's originally.Now it was a fad that was sweeping Earth, and Burnside wasn't the firstrich man who had decided to hold a wedding on top of an asteroid.Unfortunately, other interplanetary moving companies had cashed in onthat brainstorm, chiefly the firm of the Saylor brothers\u2014which personsBob Parker intended to punch in the nose some day. And would havebefore this if he hadn't been lanky and tall while they were giants.Now that he and Queazy had found the asteroid, they were desperate toget it to its destination, for fear that the Saylor brothers might getwind of what was going on, and try to beat them out of their profits.Which was not so far-fetched, because the firm of Saylor & Saylor madeno pretense of being scrupulous.     Now they scuffed along the smooth-plane topside of the asteroid, themagnets in their shoes keeping them from stepping off into space. Theycame to the broad base of the asteroid-wedge, walked over the edge anddown the twelve-foot thickness. Here they squatted, and Bob Parkerhappily clamped the atomic-whirl spectroscope to the rough surface.By the naked eye, they could see iron ore, quartz crystals, cinnabar,but he had the spectroscope and there was no reason why he shouldn'tuse it. He satisfied himself as to the exterior of the asteroid, andthen sent the twin beams deep into its heart. The beams crossed, toreatoms from molecules, revolved them like an infinitely fine powder. Theradiations from the sundered molecules traveled back up the beams tothe atomic-whirl spectroscope. Bob watched a pointer which moved slowlyup and up\u2014past tungsten, past iridium, past gold\u2014     Bob Parker said, in astonishment, Hell! There's something screwy aboutthis business. Look at that point\u2014     Neither he nor Queazy had the opportunity to observe the pointer anyfurther. A cold, completely disagreeable feminine voice said,     May I ask what you interlopers are doing on my asteroid?     Bob started so badly that the spectroscope's settings were jarred andthe lights in its interior died. Bob twisted his head around as far ashe could inside the aquarium\u2014the glass helmet, and found himselflooking at a space-suited girl who was standing on the edge of theasteroid below.     Ma'am, said Bob, blinking, did you say something?     Queazy made a gulping sound and slowly straightened. He automaticallyreached up as if he would take off his hat and twist it in his hands.     I said, remarked the girl, that you should scram off of my asteroid.And quit poking around at it with that spectroscope. I've already takena reading. Cinnabar, iron ore, quartz crystals, tungsten. Goodbye.  "

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in IN THE GARDEN?",
        "Summary_1": "The story describes the crew of a probe spaceship as it investigates an extraterrestrial world. The crew is made up of Stark, Gilbert, Steiner, Langweilig, Craig, and Briton\u2014the captain, executive officer, crewmember, engineer, part-owner of the probe, and a Catholic priest respectively.\nFrom orbit, the crew scans the moon using various technological instruments. They discover abundant highly developed life forms including a small location of sentient life, possibly of extraordinary magnitude. \n\nThey descend to the moon\u2019s surface near the location of the sentient life. They discover a multitude of plants and animals that are found on Earth, also finding two individuals that appear to be human, Ha-Adamah and Hawwah.\n\nTheir investigation of the surroundings bears a startling resemblance to the biblical story of Genesis. The crew is bewildered to consider that this may indeed be a new Garden of Eden which never fell into sin and was preserved as a perfect paradise.\n\nAfter remaining for a few days, the crew returns to their probe. They remark how immoral it would be to meddle such an unspoiled paradise, but nevertheless begin the process of advertising the world to potential colonizers who would indeed exploit the moon for profit.\n\nSurprisingly, it is revealed that back on the planet that the individuals that were merely posing as Ha-Adamah and Hawwah working with their boss, Snake-oil Sam, to deceive potential colonists, ambushing them upon arrival and confiscating their valuable supplies and equipment.\n\nBack on the probe Father Briton chides the rest of the crew that they had been taken in by an obvious ruse and to inform any potential colonists to prepare for armed resistance. The incredulous crew demands to know the reasoning behind his conclusion.  He casually says that besides what he contended were glaring inaccuracies, the fact that Ha-Adamah refused to play him in checkers despite claiming to have a preternaturally perfect intellect was all the proof he needed.",
        "Summary_2": "Steiner uses several tools to determine if there is any life on a little moon that his craft hovers over. After getting some positive feedback, Steiner agrees to scan the rest of the world while his colleagues get some rest. The findings are good, so the crew decides to land.\n\nA man introduces himself as Ha-Adamah (Adam) and his female partner is named Hawwah (Eve). The man explains that he is able to speak whatever language his listener needs to hear in order to understand, and this includes animals like eagles and squirrels. \n\nStark then asks the mostly naked man if there are other humans on the moon. Adam says there cannot be more than one of anything. He then names each member of the crew something different and explains that they cannot be people because the man and woman themselves are people.\n\nThe crew members consume fruit from the garden and are incredibly surprised at their quality. The produce tastes better than anything they have ever eaten on earth. They begin to make the connections between this place and the Garden of Eden, and they wonder if they are dreaming. The man tells Langweilig he is not allowed to eat from the pomegranate tree, and the priest explains that in other languages, it is not the apple that is forbidden in the Garden of Eden, but the pomegranate. \n\nThe crew members continue to silently make comparisons to the Biblical story. Adam tells the men that he has heard about another world in which the people have fallen. He also explains that he has a preternatural intellect. In order to check his claims, the priest asks Adam to play checkers, but he refuses.\n\nThe crew members learn about the large serpent that lives in a nearby cave. Adam claims that if evil is to come to him, it will happen via the serpent. \n\nAfter leaving on their ship, all of the crew members are convinced that they have found an actual paradise, a place that has yet to be touched and has not yet fallen. They are eager to take advantage of the land\u2019s resources and exploit the perfect conditions by selling off the land to settlers. \n\nThe only person who disagrees that this Garden of Eden is real is the priest. He points out several inconsistencies and argues that Adam refused to play checkers because in reality he could not win. His skepticism convinces his colleagues that their shared experience was in fact fake. \n\nMeanwhile, Adam and Eve take off their costumes and the paint on their bodies that causes them to glow. Snake-Oil Sam comes out of his cave and the trio begins to prepare for the return of the settlers. They have done this many times before, and each time they fool a group of people, those settlers come back and Snake-Oil Sam takes everything they have and stockpiles it for himself. His motivation is to gain enough equipment and goods to start his own civilization there. ",
        "Summary_3": "A crew of humans in a spaceship encounter a small moon that has a promising amount of life that they wish to investigate. The crew of the Little Probe is made up of a typical captain, engineer, and executive officer, but also includes a tycoon and a priest, among others. Stark, the captain, orders his man Steiner to continue running scans overnight so that the crew can land on the moon the next day. When they approach the surface, they recognize various animals that look familiar from life on Earth, including sheep and lions, but there is a bright light they don\u2019t understand the source of. Briton, the priest, is also a linguist so he approaches the two people that they find, and is surprised when he is easily understood. The man, Ha Adamah, speaks English perfectly, and says it is due to a special character of his own language that anyone can understand him. The woman on the surface, Hawwah, does not speak while the crew is there. These two are the only humanoids that the crew notices, and they find that the bright light seems to be coming from the people themselves. The main features on the surface are a large garden and a fountain, and the crew is struck by the resemblance to the biblical story of Adam and Eve. They test the boundaries of the similarities by asking to eat apples, which they are told is fine, but then find that pomegranates are not allowed to be consumed. This does not discount the similarity, as some versions of the story say that pomegranates were the forbidden fruit, and the crew is even more baffled when they hear that there is a serpent there that is the source of evil: they do not meet him, as he is in a cave. After three days on the surface, with Father Briton asking questions all the while, the crew goes back to the Little Prob where they discuss what they had witnessed. Stark was astounded at the purity of the world, and thought it needed to be protected, as did Steiner. Craig, the tycoon who owns 51% of the probe, admitted it was beautiful and would be terrible to ruin, but immediately works on dictating a message to Gilbert, the executive officer, advertising the moon to those who might want to buy or lease land there. On the surface, Ha-Adamah and Hawwah are meeting with the Old Serpent\u2014it turns out that the entire situation was a ploy to draw the humans in, and they regularly kill incoming settlers to take their supplies. Father Briton is the only one who is suspicious, and convinces the rest of the crew that they have to doubt what they had just experienced\u2014besides flaws in logic, he was surprised that his offer of a checkers game had been denied, as it would have been a chance for Ha-Adamah to show off.",
        "Summary_4": "\tA crew of six find themselves in outer space, searching for their next mission. Steiner, one man on board, uses a machine to read the planet below, searching for life. The reader comes back positive, so they move on to the next test. The eppel reports an orange light, meaning the possibility of something extraordinary, but perhaps not.The eppel (the Extraordinary Perception Locator) was created with the intention to find the most extraordinary people, brains, or trains of thought.  \n\tStark, the captain, takes charge and demands they scan the rest of the planet for traces of infrastructure. He sends the rest of the crew to bed, and when they wake up the next morning, the report is back. Negative. They target the possibility of something extraordinary, as reported by the eppel, and make their way to the surface. \n\tAs they land, they take note of their surroundings. No shelters, buildings, or lean-tos. Just land with a lion and a lamb. They spot two people, neither naked nor clothed but bathed in light, and ask Father Briton, the Jesuit priest and resident linguist, to communicate with them. \n\tHe approaches them, talking in English, and the man, Ha-Adamah, replies. He introduces himself and the woman, named Hawwah. Father Briton asks him a few questions about their surroundings and names, and the Man responds with convoluted answers. He points the crew towards the fountain, so they may quench their thirst. Although hesitant at first, the men soon realize this water is the best they\u2019ve ever had: the freshest, bubbliest, and clearest. Their suspicions about this place and the Man and Woman only grow. \n\tThe Captain attempts to question Ha-Adamah, and his answers confirm their suspicions. This place might be Paradise or Eden, the place where humanity was born and disgraced. Ha-Adamah welcomes them and offers the fruit on the trees to eat, except for the pomegranates. Ha-Adamah reveals that he is happy here, but that he has been warned that he may lose this happiness and lead the rest of his life desperately trying to find it again. The Man also shies away from the cave where he says the great and evil serpent lives. The crew, now convinced, leave this land and call it in. Selling it as paradise perfect for ranching, farming, camping, or other industrial uses, they plot their return with settlers to take over the land. Only Father Briton believes paradise is not paradise at all, simply a trick. \n\tThe story flashes back to the surface, where Hawwah and Ha-Adamah are huddling with the Serpent, Snake-Oil Sam. It is revealed that they pretend to be Adam and Eve to draw in settlers, only to steal their equipment and kill them. The Serpent congratulates them on their work, but reminds them that more is to be done in order to farm this new world and get all the equipment they need. \n\tOn the spaceship, Father Briton asks for an armed escort to accompany them.

If Mr. Magnan were here, I'm surehe wouldn't dream of interfering in the work of other departments.I ... overheard your conversation with the gentleman from the CroanieLegation\u2014     The lists, Miss Furkle.     I'm not accustomed, Miss Furkle said, to intruding in mattersoutside our interest cluster.     That's worse than listening in on phone conversations, eh? But nevermind. I need the information, Miss Furkle.     Loyalty to my Chief\u2014     Loyalty to your pay-check should send you scuttling for the materialI've asked for, Retief said. I'm taking full responsibility. Nowscat.     The buzzer sounded. Retief flipped a key. MUDDLE, Retief speaking....     Arapoulous's brown face appeared on the desk screen.     How-do, Retief. Okay if I come up?     Sure, Hank. I want to talk to you.     In the office, Arapoulous took a chair. Sorry if I'm rushing you,Retief, he said. But have you got anything for me?     Retief waved at the wine bottles. What do you know about Croanie?     Croanie? Not much of a place. Mostly ocean. All right if you likefish, I guess. We import our seafood from there. Nice prawns in monsoontime. Over a foot long.     You on good terms with them?     Sure, I guess so. Course, they're pretty thick with Boge.     So?     Didn't I tell you? Boge was the bunch that tried to take us over herea dozen years back. They'd've made it too, if they hadn't had a lot ofbad luck. Their armor went in the drink, and without armor they're easygame.     Miss Furkle buzzed. I have your lists, she said shortly.     Bring them in, please.   <doc-sep> For a whole week that view did not change, and Rikud had come to acceptit as fact. There\u2014through the viewport and in it\u2014was a garden. Agarden larger than the entire world, a garden of plants which Rikud hadnever seen before, although he had always liked to stroll through theworld's garden and he had come to know every plant well. Nevertheless,it was a garden.     He told Chuls, but Chuls had responded, It is the viewport.     Crifer, on the other hand, wasn't so sure. It looks like the garden,he admitted to Rikud. But why should the garden be in the viewport?     Somehow, Rikud knew this question for a healthy sign. But he couldnot tell them of his most amazing thought of all.

        "Query": "How do the characters in the story \"In the Garden\" interact with each other?",
        "Summary_1": "There are two main groups of characters: the crew of the Little Probe and the inhabitants of the \u201cGarden\u201d world.\n\nThe crew of the Little Probe consist of Stark, the captain; Gilbert, the executive officer; Steiner, a generall crewmember \u201cflunky\u201d; Langweilig, the engineer; Craig, a businessman and part-owner of the ship; and Fr. Briton, priest, linguist, and checkers afficionado. Stark is the leader of the group, commanding the others to their various tasks. Craig is shown to be a shrewd entrepreneur who is most intent on reaping potential profit from the situation they find themselves in.\n\nOn the moon lives Ha-Adamah and Hawwah who present themselves as archetypes of the biblical Adam and Eve. In reality, they are settlers, attempting to gather supplies to farm this world by stealing supplies from other settlers that they entice to world and then ambush. They are commanded by Snake-Oil Sam, a cynical, former showbusiness professional who runs the con.\n\nThe two groups interact when the crew descends to the surface of the moon. Ha-Adamah describes his environment in casual but bewildering terms to his visitors. Briton, as a Catholic priest, is designated by the crew to be Ha-Adamah\u2019s main interlocutor. Hawwah, notedly does not speak at all\u2014a flourish to attempt to further depict the attractiveness of the world to their all-male visitors. The crew beside Briton are enamored by the environment of the moon and are totally taken in by the performance of their hosts. The story concludes with Briton chiding his crewmates for their gullibility. Although Briton perhaps had the most reason to believe the moon was divinely ordained, he saw through the charade without much difficulty.",
        "Summary_2": "There are two different groups of characters at play in the story. The crew members who land on the new world represent one group, and Adam, Eve, and Snake-Oil Sam represent the other. The second group is nearly able to convince the first group that the moon is an untouched world, almost identical to the Garden of Eden. The crew members spend several days with Adam and Eve, and their elaborate ruse convinces them that Adam and Eve know nothing of death or suffering or ageing. It is only the priest that recognizes that the entire interaction was a con. \n\nAs soon as the crew members leave, Snake-Oil Sam comes out of his cave to give Adam and Eve more directions. He is in charge of the entire sham, and he gives out orders. Sam recognizes that people simply can\u2019t resist ruining something that appears to be perfect. He has played this game before, and he knows that the crew members will be back with others to try and take over what they see as a paradise. Instead, he will murder them and take their goods to use for his own advantage. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The story\u2019s characters fall into two groups: the crew of the Little Probe, and those who live on the surface of the small moon that the Little Probe goes to investigate. The crew consists of six Americans: Stark is the ship\u2019s captain, so he calls all of shots onboard and asks a lot of questions on the surface. Steiner is his right-hand man, who tends to follow what Stark says and runs a lot of scans. Gilbert is the executive officer, who points out that they have to eat an apple to truly test if this reality is indeed the biblical paradise it appears to be, and Langweilig is the ship\u2019s engineer. Craig is the tycoon who owns most of the ship, and wants to rent out land on the moon, and Briton is the priest and linguist who initiates contact on the surface and remains a skeptic throughout the story, eventually convincing the rest of the crew that the whole thing is a trap. On the surface, there are three characters of interest: the Old Serpent, who the reader finds out at the end of the story is in charge of the deception, and the two people known as Ha-Adamah and Hawwah. Ha-Adamah, or Adam, is the one who interacts with the ship\u2019s crew when they visit the surface, and Hawwah, or Eve, does not talk to them while they are there\u2014she does talk, though, and works on the plan with the serpent at the end. It is the serpent who creates the paint that makes Adam and Eve glow as if they are sources of light themselves, and writes the script for the deception.",
        "Summary_4": "\tThe crew of the spaceship visiting \u201cParadise\u201d is made up of six men: Captain Stark, Steiner, Father Briton, Casper Craig, Wolfgang Langweilig, and Gregory Gilbert, the executive officer. Each man serves his own purpose on board their ship. Based on their friendliness and camaraderie, these men have worked together before. Finding paradise was not their first mission. Although Stark is the captain, he often asks favors from Father Briton, the advanced linguist. In commanding him and letting him work, Stark is showing his complete trust in his crew. \n\tHowever, the group of creatures on Paradise interact a little differently. As Father Briton mentions later in the story, it\u2019s clear that there was a powerful Thought (mind or being) on the planet, it just didn\u2019t reveal itself to them. The Serpent, or Snake-Oil Sam, hides out in a cave with the equipment, money, ships, and bone meal that they have stolen from previous settlers. He is the true brains behind the operation. He has Ha-Adamah and Hawwah under his command, and, though they complain about the itchy costume, they are on board with his plan. He is clearly in charge and more manipulative than Captain Stark. \n\tAs the Serpent and his crew act out paradise, Captain Stark and his crew fall for it. All except for Father Briton. But the others don\u2019t listen to him. They only laugh off his ideas and request for an armed escort. \n",

Today I hang in our newly developed not-pod just within the mirrorgateway, torn with the agony that we calculated must go with suchtremendous wavelength fluctuations. I have attuned myself to a fetuswithin the body of a not-woman in the not-world. Already I am staticand for hours have looked into this weird extension of the Universewith fear and trepidation.     As soon as my stasis was achieved, I tried to contact you, but gotno response. What could have diminished your powers of articulatewave interaction to make you incapable of receiving my messages andreturning them? My wave went out to yours and found it, barely pulsingand surrounded with an impregnable chimera.     Quickly, from the not-world vibrations about you, I learned thenot-knowledge of your location. So I must communicate with you by whatthe not-world calls mail till we meet. For this purpose I mustutilize the feeble vibrations of various not-people through whoseinadequate articulation I will attempt to make my moves known to you.Each time I will pick a city other than the one I am in at the time.     I, Glmpauszn, come equipped with powers evolved from your fragmentaryreports before you ceased to vibrate to us and with a vast treasuryof facts from indirect sources. Soon our tortured people will be freeof the fearsome not-folk and I will be their liberator. You failed inyour task, but I will try to get you off with light punishment when wereturn again.     The hand that writes this letter is that of a boy in the not-city ofBombay in the not-country of India. He does not know he writes it.Tomorrow it will be someone else. You must never know of my exactlocation, for the not-people might have access to the information.     I must leave off now because the not-child is about to be born. When itis alone in the room, it will be spirited away and I will spring fromthe pod on the gateway into its crib and will be its exact vibrationallikeness.     I have tremendous powers. But the not-people must never know I am amongthem. This is the only way I could arrive in the room where the gatewaylies without arousing suspicion. I will grow up as the not-child inorder that I might destroy the not-people completely.     All is well, only they shot this information file into my matrix toofast.

There are two people covered in very bright light, and meadows, forests, and a fountain, but no buildings.

He blinked.     The world had come to rest on the garden of the viewport.   <doc-sep> All around Rikud were darkness and hunger and thirst. The buzzer didnot sound because Rikud had silenced it forever. And no one went toeat or drink. Rikud himself had fumbled through the blackness and thewhimpering to the dining room, his tongue dry and swollen, but thesmooth belt that flowed with water and with savory dishes did not runany more. The machinery, Rikud realized, also was responsible for food.     Chuls said, over and over, I'm hungry.     We will eat and we will drink when the buzzer tells us, Wilm repliedconfidently.     It won't any more, Rikud said.     What won't?     The buzzer will never sound again. I broke it.     Crifer growled. I know. You shouldn't have done it. That was a badthing you did, Rikud.     It was not bad. The world has moved through the blackness and thestars and now we should go outside to live in the big garden therebeyond the viewport.     That's ridiculous, Chuls said.     Even Crifer now was angry at Rikud. He broke the buzzer and no one caneat. I hate Rikud, I think.     There was a lot of noise in the darkness, and someone else said, Ihate Rikud. Then everyone was saying it.     Rikud was sad. Soon he would die, because no one would go outside withhim and he could not go outside alone. In five more years he would havehad a woman, too. He wondered if it was dark and hungry in the women'squarters. Did women eat?     Perhaps they ate plants. Once, in the garden, Rikud had broken off afrond and tasted it. It had been bitter, but not unpleasant. Maybe theplants in the viewport would even be better.     We will not be hungry if we go outside, he said. We can eat there.     We can eat if the buzzer sounds, but it is broken, Chuls said dully.     Crifer shrilled, Maybe it is only variable and will buzz again.     No, Rikud assured him. It won't.     Then you broke it and I hate you, said Crifer. We should break you,too, to show you how it is to be broken.     We must go outside\u2014through the viewport. Rikud listened to the oddgurgling sound his stomach made.     A hand reached out in the darkness and grabbed at his head. He heardCrifer's voice. I have Rikud's head. The voice was nasty, hostile.     Crifer, more than anyone, had been his friend. But now that he hadbroken the machinery, Crifer was his enemy, because Crifer came nearerto understanding the situation than anyone except Rikud.     The hand reached out again, and it struck Rikud hard across the face.I hit him! I hit him!     Other hands reached out, and Rikud stumbled. He fell and then someonewas on top of him, and he struggled. He rolled and was up again, andhe did not like the sound of the angry voices. Someone said, Let usdo to Rikud what he said he did to the machinery. Rikud ran. In thedarkness, his feet prodded many bodies. There were those who were tooweak to rise. Rikud, too, felt a strange light-headedness and a gnawinghurt in his stomach. But it didn't matter. He heard the angry voicesand the feet pounding behind him, and he wanted only to get away.     It was dark and he was hungry and everyone who was strong enough to runwas chasing him, but every time he thought of the garden outside, andhow big it was, the darkness and the hunger and the people chasing himwere unimportant. It was so big that it would swallow him up completelyand positively.     He became sickly giddy thinking about it.     But if he didn't open the door and go into the garden outside, he woulddie because he had no food and no water and his stomach gurgled andgrumbled and hurt. And everyone was chasing him.     He stumbled through the darkness and felt his way back to the library,through the inner door and into the room with the voice\u2014but thevoice didn't speak this time\u2014through its door and into the place ofmachinery. Behind him, he could hear the voices at the first door, andhe thought for a moment that no one would come after him. But he heardCrifer yell something, and then feet pounding in the passage.     Rikud tripped over something and sprawled awkwardly across the floor.He felt a sharp hurt in his head, and when he reached up to touch itwith his hands there in the darkness, his fingers came away wet.     He got up slowly and opened the next door. The voices behind him werecloser now. Light streamed in through the viewport. After the darkness,it frightened Rikud and it made his eyes smart, and he could hear thosebehind him retreating to a safe distance. But their voices were notfar away, and he knew they would come after him because they wanted tobreak him.     Rikud looked out upon the garden and he trembled. Out there was life.The garden stretched off in unthinkable immensity to the cluster oflow mounds against the bright blue which roofed the many plants. Ifplants could live out there as they did within the world, then so couldpeople. Rikud and his people      should     . This was why the world had movedacross the darkness and the stars for all Rikud's lifetime and more.But he was afraid.     He reached up and grasped the handle of the door and he saw that hisfingers were red with the wetness which had come from his hurt head.Slowly he slipped to the cool floor\u2014how his head was burning!\u2014and fora long time he lay there, thinking he would never rise again. Inside heheard the voices again, and soon a foot and then another pounded onthe metal of the passage. He heard Crifer's voice louder than the rest:There is Rikud on the floor!     Tugging at the handle of the door, Rikud pulled himself upright.Something small and brown scurried across the other side of theviewport and Rikud imagined it turned to look at him with two hideousred eyes.     Rikud screamed and hurtled back through the corridor, and his facewas so terrible in the light streaming in through the viewport thateveryone fled before him. He stumbled again in the place of themachinery, and down on his hands and knees he fondled the bits of metalwhich he could see in the dim light through the open door.     Where's the buzzer? he sobbed. I must find the buzzer.     Crifer's voice, from the darkness inside, said, You broke it. Youbroke it. And now we will break you\u2014     Rikud got up and ran. He reached the door again and then he slippeddown against it, exhausted. Behind him, the voices and the footstepscame, and soon he saw Crifer's head peer in through the passageway.Then there were others, and then they were walking toward him.     His head whirled and the viewport seemed to swim in a haze. Could itbe variable, as Crifer had suggested? He wondered if the scurryingbrown thing waited somewhere, and nausea struck at the pit of hisstomach. But if the plants could live out there and the scurrying thingcould live and that was why the world had moved through the blackness,then so could he live out there, and Crifer and all the others....     So tightly did he grip the handle that his fingers began to hurt. Andhis heart pounded hard and he felt the pulses leaping on either side ofhis neck.     He stared out into the garden, and off into the distance, where theblue-white globe which might have been a star stood just above the rowof mounds.  "

        "Query": "How does religious belief play a role in the narrative of IN THE GARDEN?",
        "Summary_1": "Christianity is a central component of the story. The heart of the narrative revolves around the description of the world as a replica of the biblical Garden of Eden. The author goes into extensive detail regarding the aspects of the garden and its inhabitants and how they conform to aspects of the Genesis narrative and how it was understood by religious analysis. It is heavily suggested that here, the Serpent did not succeed in convincing man to sin and fall from grace as was the case in the biblical narrative. As a result, Ha-Adamah and Hawwah (the Hebrew names for Adam and Eve) remain clothed in light and still enjoy the preternatural gifts of creation including a highly advanced intellect, immortality and even an illuminated appearance.\n\nIt is revealed that this depiction is a deception on the part of the moon\u2019s inhabitants. Interestingly, the 4 non-believers on the crew are the most ready to believe that the state of affairs on the planet is indeed supernatural. It is only the clever priest who possesses faith, but employs the skepticism necessary to see through the fraud.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Snake-Oil Sam, the mastermind behind the ruse, realizes that the visitors who come to the new world will immediately make connections to the Garden of Eden if there are enough clues to point them in that direction. In that way, the story demonstrates that people are susceptible to believing in an already established story or trope, regardless of how impossible it seems. Since the settlers are familiar with the Bible and the famous story of Adam and Eve, they are preconditioned to believe that another Adam and Eve may exist in a separate world, a world that has yet to be tainted with sin. \n\nThe priest is the only character that sees through Adam and Eve\u2019s show. Although it\u2019s strange that the religious man in the group would be the most skeptical, it\u2019s clear that he has a keen eye for details. He purposefully asks Adam to play checkers with him to test his supernatural intellect, and when Adam refuses, he realizes that he cannot be who he says he is. Perhaps the priest has the most to lose in believing in this illusion, so his refusal to take the con artists at their word shows his true dedication to Christianity. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The people on the surface of the moon that the crew of the Little Probe is investigating are part of a very detailed ploy to replicate the biblical story of Adam and Eve. This religious story served as a recognizable type of paradise, which the serpent used to his advantage, knowing that humans would be drawn to something that they thought was perfect. All of the details of the facade were carefully designed around an attempt to make an authentic, tempting environment. This included changing some details from the English-translated version of the biblical story, including giving the people their Hebrew names of Ha Adamah and Hawwah. The other major point of religion in the story is the Jesuit priest who is onboard the Little Probe.

        "Summary_4": "\tThe story of Adam and Eve (or Genesis) is one of the most widely known myths. The idea that we, as humans, once inhabited Paradise, but lost it due to our greed and stolen innocence is intoxicating. It explains why life isn\u2019t perfect, why things don\u2019t always go our way, and why people die. \n\tIn In the Garden, this story is explored in a different manner. The Christian origin story acts as a backdrop for this uninhabited planet that a crew visits. After exploring, they are quick to believe that they have discovered another universe\u2019s Eden. And, therefore, quick to destroy it. \n\tTheir religious faith and belief in the story of Adam and Eve adds to the gravity of the situation. If this weren\u2019t a well-known story, then the crew would have been less amazed by the space before them. The perfection of the place, and the potential of Paradise, was what truly brought them in and, eventually, destroyed them.\n",

I just had to wait and you would destroyyourselves.     I don't understand, Bartholomew protested, searching the faces of thecousins closest to him. What does he mean, we have never existed?We're here, aren't we? What\u2014     Shut up! Raymond snapped. He turned on Martin. You don't seemsurprised.     The old man grinned. I'm not. I figured it all out years ago.     At first, he had wondered what he should do. Would it be better tothrow them into a futile panic by telling them or to do nothing? Hehad decided on the latter; that was the role they had assigned him\u2014towatch and wait and keep out of things\u2014and that was the role he wouldplay.     You knew all the time and you didn't tell us! Raymond spluttered.After we'd been so good to you, making a gentleman out of you insteadof a criminal.... That's right, he snarled, a criminal! An alcoholic,a thief, a derelict! How do you like that?     Sounds like a rich, full life, Martin said wistfully.     What an exciting existence they must have done him out of! But then, hecouldn't help thinking, he\u2014he and Conrad together, of course\u2014had donethem out of      any     kind of existence. It wasn't his responsibility,though; he had done nothing but let matters take whatever course wasdestined for them. If only he could be sure that it was the bettercourse, perhaps he wouldn't feel that nagging sense of guilt insidehim. Strange\u2014where, in his hermetic life, could he possibly havedeveloped such a queer thing as a conscience?     Then we've wasted all this time, Ninian sobbed, all this energy, allthis money, for nothing!     But you were nothing to begin with, Martin told them. And then,after a pause, he added, I only wish I could be sure there had beensome purpose to this.     He didn't know whether it was approaching death that dimmed his sight,or whether the frightened crowd that pressed around him was growingshadowy.     I wish I could feel that some good had been done in letting you bewiped out of existence, he went on voicing his thoughts. But I knowthat the same thing that happened to your worlds and my world willhappen all over again. To other people, in other times, but again. It'sbound to happen. There isn't any hope for humanity.     One man couldn't really change the course of human history, he toldhimself. Two men, that was\u2014one real, one a shadow.     Conrad came close to the old man's bed. He was almost transparent.     No, he said, there is hope. They didn't know the time transmitterworks two ways. I used it for going into the past only once\u2014just thisonce. But I've gone into the future with it many times. And\u2014 hepressed Martin's hand\u2014believe me, what I did\u2014what      we     did, you andI\u2014serves a purpose. It will change things for the better.

Nevertheless,it was a garden.     He told Chuls, but Chuls had responded, It is the viewport.     Crifer, on the other hand, wasn't so sure. It looks like the garden,he admitted to Rikud.

The gardens, moreover,did not jump and dance before his eyes the way the viewport gardensdid. Nor did they spin. Nor did the trees grow larger with every jolt.     Rikud sat down hard.

        "Query": "How does the theme of human imperfection manifest in IN THE GARDEN?",
        "Summary_1": "Human sinfulness and its collective fall from grace are referenced in several ways in the story. Ha-Adamah contrasts his world\u2019s perfection with the fallenness that is apparent in the visitors. He claims to be free from the stain of original sin. He presents himself as perfectly happy and not subject to corruption, aging, or death. This is contrasted with Earth's humanity which was fated to \u201close that happiness, and then to seek it vainly through all the ages.\u201d\n\nThe entire crew of the Little Probe agree on the unacceptability of spoiling a pristine world. Even so, they irresistibly and almost gleefully prepare to exploit the world\u2019s riches.\n\nSnake-Oil Sam expounds upon this inclination. He claims that on top of the very real greed of the visitors they\u2019ve deceived over the years, they are capitalizing on the human desire to despoil the unspoiled. This is a clear summation of concupiscence\u2014the inclination for fallen humanity to tend toward sin. It is clear that Sam and his associates are just as fallen as the other individuals in the story, preying on others to further their own goals.",
        "Summary_2": "Although the visiting crew members are impressed and in awe of the Garden of Eden, they have every intention of pillaging the place. They love the clean and delicious water it offers and the tasty fruit that is better than anything they\u2019ve had before. Yet, they cannot resist their urge to take over the land and commercialize it. They do not care that their actions will ruin the purity of the land and its two occupants. They are greedy and only want what will benefit them in the end. \n\nLikewise, Snake-Oil Sam recognizes the immense beauty of the untouched world, and instead of trying to preserve it, he entices groups of people to come and try to take it over so that he can murder them and take their goods and equipment. Snake-Oil Sam is cunning because he innately knows that if he can convince settlers that this world is pure and special, they will immediately desire to destroy it. According to Sam, people can\u2019t resist ruining something that appears to be unique and unadulterated. He uses human nature and the desire to control to his own advantage. By convincing strangers that Adam and Eve are simple and kind and unaware of ageing or suffering, he knows that those strangers will return to the land to make sure that Adam and Eve learn all about those topics. They can\u2019t help themselves precisely because humans have already fallen and are predisposed to sinning. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Human fallenness can be interpreted as the degraded state of mankind, or as inauthenticity in human interaction. These are both important themes to this story. In terms of inauthenticity, this is the root of the interactions on the surface of the moon. As the crew of the Little Probe is exploring the area where the two humanoids are living, everything they encounter is a carefully staged ploy. The two people on the surface do not let on any of the truth of their situation to the crew, and deliberately lie to them in order to entice them to come back to settle on the moon. This is ironic, as the serpent\u2019s plan for this ruse is heavily based on others\u2019 desires for authenticity in the story they are presented, thus the small changes in various iterations of this illusion of the biblical story of Adam and Eve. In terms of degradation, another central idea is that this moon is a pure and untouched place. However, the serpent knows that this will entice humans to investigate and try to settle there, because of an innate draw to spoil things that are in perfect condition. The crew of the Little Probe recognize this idea in a different way, in that they see this moon as what humankind could have been before it fell, when Adam and Eve fell to temptation. They see this as innocence that would be a crime to ruin, and know that humans of their own world would be inclined to disrupt what was there.",
        "Summary_4": "\tThe story of Adam and Eve ends with human failure. Eve, or Hawwah, eats the apple/pomegranate that God told them not to eat. And so she is cursed with painful birth, toiling the land, and eventual return to dust, or death. Both she and Adam are expelled from Eden and their expulsion leads to the creation of other humans. There is no longer one Man or Woman. \n\tHowever in this story, the destruction of paradise is brought about by two separate groups. The Serpent\u2019s crew of actors and props creates a false paradise to lure people in and pillage them. This in itself is an example of human fallenness, failure, or expulsion from Eden. By extorting the idea of paradise and using it to harm others, the Serpent and his crew are fallen humans. \n\tAnd so are the crew of the visiting spaceship. After discovering so-called paradise, their first thought is to destroy it. Their tools are farming, building, and burning, but not preserving. Human greed is what led to the falling, and is also what led to the falling of these two crews. \n",

The captain was a little puzzled by this, but he went on doggedly:Ha-Adamah, what do you think that we are? Are we not people?     You are not anything till I name you. But I will name you and thenyou can be. You are named Captain. He is named Priest. He is namedEngineer. He is named Flunky.     Thanks a lot, said Steiner.

Pick from the trees, said Ha-Adamah, and then it may be that youwill want to sleep on the grass. Being not of human nature (which doesnot need sleep or rest), it may be that you require respite. But youare free to enjoy the garden and its fruits.     We will, said Captain Stark.     They wandered about the place, but they were uneasy. There were theanimals.

        "Summary_1": "James Baron is planning a trek to Brightside Crossing on Mercury, a feat so far unaccomplished. Few had tried, and those that did died. All except for one. He is asked to wait at the Red Baron as someone wanted to see him at 8. He waits patiently and is rewarded with the company of Peter Claney, the man who made it back home. Claney instantly tells him to give up on the journey and stay on Earth. Baron asks for details about their trek and what went wrong, but Claney refuses to give him the details. Claney is an older man now with an epithelioma on his face. Although he came to warn him, he quickly learns that Baron may only listen if he hears the truth. So Claney recounts the story. \nMajor Tom Mikuta recruited Claney, Jack Stone, and Ted McIvers to join him. They were to adventure to the Brightside Crossing at perihelion, a more dangerous journey. Temperatures reached up to 770 degrees Fahrenheit at perihelion, but Mikuta was an all-or-nothing man. Stone arrived on Mercury first, soon followed by Mikuta and Claney. McIvers was the last to arrive and they left soon after with three Bugs and one tractor dragging the sledges. Stone was briefed by Sanderson, the head of the observatory, before they left, and the men pored over all images and maps of the Crossing before beginning. \nDespite their high-tech spacesuits and general gadgets, the giant sun still got to them. They were constantly thirsty and hot, and their skin itched and burned. They drove for eight hours, then slept for five. They needed to travel 70 miles a day. It would take 30 days to reach the Center, and then another 30 to reach the pick-up spot. The journey quickly took a toll on Stone, who was the most apprehensive of the bunch. He retreats into himself, while McIvers chatters nonstop to fill the silence. Tension grew among the crew, especially as McIvers put himself at risk by adventuring away from them. \nClaney lead the gang in his Bug, while McIvers and Mikuta flanked him. Stone was in the very back. If Claney saw something suspicious or unsafe, they would investigate on foot before continuing in their equipment. \nAs they travel, they got closer to the Sun, which appeared to be twice as big as it did on Earth. Several drives into their journey, McIvers discovered something truly terrible on one of his forrays. He screamed into the intercom, alerting the others who quickly rushed after him. He stood there, pointing below. There lay a broken, older Bug and two corpses. Wyatt and Carpenter, the original discoverers. \nThey continued on with disheartened spirits until Claney reached a cleft. There was no way to cross it, except for a very small and dangerous ledge. The cleft slowly began to crumble under their Bugs and they\u2019re left in a very precarious position. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story is about a man, Baron, who is planning to cross the bright side of the planet Mercury. Right before the trip is about to depart he runs into one of the famous adventurers that attempted it before him, Peter Claney, at a bar called the Red Lion. Peter goes into a long recollection of his experience to Baron, which is interspersed with them snapping back to reality at the bar. \n\nPeter\u2019s attempted Brightside crossing involved a party of four: the Major (a trusted team captain of sorts), himself (who would be in the lead Bug of the expedition), McIver (who would flank one side of Peter along with the Major), and Stone (who would drag the sledges). They began the expedition at a place called the Twilight lab, an observatory for studying the sun run by a person called Sanders located in a 5 mile wide transition between the bright and dark sides of Mercury which had hospitable temperatures for humans to survive.\n\nOver the course of their journey, tensions between them grew tense. McIver started to drive on little side trips during their daily driving in the Bug vehicles. On one of his side trips he discovered the skeletons of the last known explorers that came before them - Wyatt and Carpenter. Peter does not finish recounting his tale before the story closes, but the reader knows he never did successfully make the crossing, although he did survive (because he is presently sitting in the bar with Baron and recalling this tale from the past).\n\nIt is revealed that Peter\u2019s expedition party went beyond the farthest known point explored by humans (due to finding the bodies), and that he thinks a couple of mistakes were made in equipment choices and in not having a person driving several miles ahead to scout the terrain before the entire convoy had to drive through it.\n",

Claney says it can\u2019t be done, and that he\u2019ll tell Baron his story to prove it to him. The rest of the passage takes place within Claney\u2019s story. \n\nClaney tells of his desire since childhood to attempt the journey, and how he met Major Mikuta, who wants to attempt it. Claney joins Mikuta, along with a young acolyte of the Major\u2019s, Jack Stone, and an impetuous, thrill-seeking climber named Ted McIvers. The addition of McIvers to the team is an unwelcome surprise to Claney, and he proves to be headstrong and restless. \n\nThe team plans and strategizes at Twilight Lab at Mercury\u2019s north pole. They set out on their journey with Claney out front and in charge of finding safe passage routes, Mikuta and McIvers flanking him on either side, and Stone pulling the sledges in the rear. They were state-of-the-art protective equipment and travel in \u201cbug\u201d vehicles, but the terrain and atmosphere are treacherous. They grow more anxious as they go, with McIvers driving the rest of the crew nuts with his constant talking and wandering, and Stone growing more quiet and reserved.

Claney is the only person on earth who has attempted the ordeal and made it out alive, but Claney says that it simply cannot be done. It\u2019s impossible. \n\nClaney explains that a major named Tom Mikuta recruited him to go on the trip. Major wanted to cross the Brightside of Mercury at perihelion, except he wanted to cross the entire surface of the planet. Claney admits he was afraid because he knew the story of the last two explorers who never returned from their trip. He is also fully aware that the only place hotter than the Brightside of Mercury at perihelion is the actual surface of the sun. Claney believes that it can be done, and he agrees to join Major\u2019s team of men. \n\nMajor and Claney meet up at The Twilight Lab, which is near the north pole of Mercury. Jack Stone, another member of the team, arrives with supplies and equipment. Claney is upset to learn that McIvers will also be joining the team. He thinks he is too much of a risk-taker. The men discuss Mercury\u2019s atmosphere, and Claney realizes that there\u2019s no way to prepare for a voyage this mysterious. There will be active volcanoes, but they have no idea where they will find them. McIvers finally shows up, and although he\u2019s late, Major doesn\u2019t make an issue of it.\n\nThe team leaves the lab with a plan to reach the Center of Brightside in 30 days. They need to travel 70 miles per day. McIvers wants to know who will be out four or five miles ahead of the pack to evaluate the surface. Major sternly tells him that isn\u2019t part of the plan - all team members will stay in sight of one another.\n\nBack at Red Lion, Claney tells Baron that the heat was unbearable, even when their suits kept them cool at 70 degrees. The sight of the sun tricked their minds into believing they were melting. The team drives for eight hours and then stops and sleeps for five. Most of the time, the men are unable to get any rest. The only thing that propels them forward is the fact that no one had ever succeeded before.\nClaney crosses Mercury\u2019s difficult terrain, which includes mounds of dust and impassable cracks. At one point, McIvers drives down a long canyon. Claney sees that McIvers is waving to get his attention, so he follows his lead. McIvers finds wrecked vehicles; this is the spot where the two explorers died. Claney begins to experience difficulties with his Bug. He comes to a six foot drop that his vehicle cannot pass over. He sees a narrow ledge that resembles a ramp. \n",

I guess I was about ten whenWyatt and Carpenter made the last attempt\u2014that was in 2082,I think.

I know now that they were a pair of idiots, starting off withoutproper equipment, with practically no knowledge of surfaceconditions, without any charts\u2014they couldn\u2019t have madea hundred miles\u2014but I didn\u2019t know that then and it was aterrible tragedy.

I\u2019d always liked the Major\u2014he was big and quiet and cool,the sort of guy who always had things figured a little furtherahead than anyone else and always knew what to do in a tightplace.

He also had the kindof personality that could take a crew of wild men andmake them work like a well-oiled machine across a thousandmiles of Venus jungle. I liked him and I trusted him.     He contacted me in New York and he was very casual atfirst. We spent an evening here at the Red Lion, talking aboutold times; he told me about the Vulcan business, and how he\u2019dbeen out to see Sanderson and the Twilight Lab on Mercury,and how he preferred a hot trek to a cold one any day of theyear\u2014and then he wanted to know what I\u2019d been doing sinceVenus and what my plans were.     \u201cNo particular plans,\u201d I told him. \u201cWhy?\u201d     He looked me over. \u201cHow much do you weigh, Peter?\u201d     I told him one-thirty-five.     \u201cThat much!\u201d he said. \u201cWell, there can\u2019t be much fat onyou, at any rate.

Ifa man can do that, he\u2019s got Mercury. Until then,      nobody\u2019s     gotMercury. I want Mercury\u2014but I\u2019ll need help getting it.\u201d     I\u2019d thought of it a thousand times and never dared considerit. Nobody had, since Wyatt and Carpenter disappeared. Mercuryturns on its axis in the same time that it wheels aroundthe Sun, which means that the Brightside is always facing in.That makes the Brightside of Mercury at perihelion the hottestplace in the Solar System, with one single exception: thesurface of the Sun itself.     It would be a hellish trek. Only a few men had ever learnedjust      how     hellish and they never came back to tell about it. Itwas a real hell\u2019s Crossing, but someday, I thought, somebodywould cross it.     I wanted to be along.   <doc-sep>    Brightside     Crossing   by Alan E. Nourse    JAMES BARON was not pleased to hear that he had hada visitor when he reached the Red Lion that evening. Hehad no stomach for mysteries, vast or trifling, and therewere pressing things to think about at this time. Yet the doormanhad flagged him as he came in from the street: \u201cA thousandpardons, Mr. Baron. The gentleman\u2014he would leave noname. He said you\u2019d want to see him. He will be back byeight.\u201d     Now Baron drummed his fingers on the table top, staringabout the quiet lounge. Street trade was discouraged at theRed Lion, gently but persuasively; the patrons were few innumber. Across to the right was a group that Baron knewvaguely\u2014Andean climbers, or at least two of them were. Overnear the door he recognized old Balmer, who had mappedthe first passage to the core of Vulcan Crater on Venus. Baronreturned his smile with a nod. Then he settled back andwaited impatiently for the intruder who demanded his timewithout justifying it.     Presently a small, grizzled man crossed the room and satdown at Baron\u2019s table. He was short and wiry. His face heldno key to his age\u2014he might have been thirty or a thousand\u2014buthe looked weary and immensely ugly. His cheeks andforehead were twisted and brown, with scars that were stillhealing.     The stranger said, \u201cI\u2019m glad you waited. I\u2019ve heard you\u2019replanning to attempt the Brightside.\u201d     Baron stared at the man for a moment. \u201cI see you can readtelecasts,\u201d he said coldly. \u201cThe news was correct. We are goingto make a Brightside Crossing.\u201d     \u201cAt perihelion?\u201d     \u201cOf course. When else?\u201d     The grizzled man searched Baron\u2019s face for a momentwithout expression. Then he said slowly, \u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019renot going to make the Crossing.\u201d     \u201cSay, who are you, if you don\u2019t mind?\u201d Baron demanded.     \u201cThe name is Claney,\u201d said the stranger.     There was a silence. Then: \u201cClaney?      Peter     Claney?\u201d     \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d     Baron\u2019s eyes were wide with excitement, all trace of angergone. \u201cGreat balls of fire, man\u2014      where have you been hiding?     We\u2019ve been trying to contact you for months!\u201d     \u201cI know. I was hoping you\u2019d quit looking and chuck thewhole idea.\u201d     \u201cQuit looking!\u201d Baron bent forward over the table. \u201cMyfriend, we\u2019d given up hope, but we\u2019ve never quit looking.Here, have a drink. There\u2019s so much you can tell us.\u201d Hisfingers were trembling.     Peter Claney shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you anything youwant to hear.\u201d     \u201cBut you\u2019ve      got     to. You\u2019re the only man on Earth who\u2019sattempted a Brightside Crossing and lived through it! And thestory you cleared for the news\u2014it was nothing. We need      details     . Where did your equipment fall down? Where did youmiscalculate? What were the trouble spots?\u201d Baron jabbed afinger at Claney\u2019s face. \u201cThat, for instance\u2014epithelioma?Why? What was wrong with your glass? Your filters? We\u2019vegot to know those things. If you can tell us, we can makeit across where your attempt failed\u2014\u201d     \u201cYou want to know why we failed?\u201d asked Claney.     \u201cOf course we want to know. We      have     to know.\u201d     \u201cIt\u2019s simple. We failed because it can\u2019t be done. We couldn\u2019tdo it and neither can you. No human beings will ever crossthe Brightside alive, not if they try for centuries.\u201d     \u201cNonsense,\u201d Baron declared. \u201cWe will.\u201d     Claney shrugged. \u201cI was there. I know what I\u2019m saying. Youcan blame the equipment or the men\u2014there were flaws inboth quarters\u2014but we just didn\u2019t know what we were fighting.It was the      planet     that whipped us, that and the      Sun     . They\u2019llwhip you, too, if you try it.\u201d     \u201cNever,\u201d said Baron.     \u201cLet me tell you,\u201d Peter Claney said.   <doc-sep> The Twilight Lab, near the northern pole of Mercury, was theobvious jumping-off place. The setup there wasn\u2019t very extensive\u2014arocket landing, the labs and quarters for Sanderson\u2019screw sunk deep into the crust, and the tower that housedthe Solar \u2019scope that Sanderson had built up there ten yearsbefore.     Twilight Lab wasn\u2019t particularly interested in the Brightside,of course\u2014the Sun was Sanderson\u2019s baby and he\u2019d pickedMercury as the closest chunk of rock to the Sun that couldhold his observatory. He\u2019d chosen a good location, too. OnMercury, the Brightside temperature hits 770\u00b0 F. at perihelionand the Darkside runs pretty constant at -410\u00b0 F. No permanentinstallation with a human crew could survive at eitherextreme. But with Mercury\u2019s wobble, the twilight zone betweenBrightside and Darkside offers something closer to survivaltemperatures.     Sanderson built the Lab up near the pole, where the zoneis about five miles wide, so the temperature only varies 50 to60 degrees with the libration. The Solar \u2019scope could take thatmuch change and they\u2019d get good clear observation of the Sunfor about seventy out of the eighty-eight days it takes the planetto wheel around.     The Major was counting on Sanderson knowing somethingabout Mercury as well as the Sun when we camped at the Labto make final preparations.     Sanderson did. He thought we\u2019d lost our minds and he saidso, but he gave us all the help he could. He spent a weekbriefing Jack Stone, the third member of our party, who hadarrived with the supplies and equipment a few days earlier.Poor Jack met us at the rocket landing almost bawling, Sandersonhad given him such a gloomy picture of what Brightsidewas like.     Stone was a youngster\u2014hardly twenty-five, I\u2019d say\u2014buthe\u2019d been with the Major at Vulcan and had begged to jointhis trek. I had a funny feeling that Jack really didn\u2019t care forexploring too much, but he thought Mikuta was God, followedhim around like a puppy.     It didn\u2019t matter to me as long as he knew what he was gettingin for. You don\u2019t go asking people in this game why they do it\u2014they\u2019reliable to get awfully uneasy and none of them canever give you an answer that makes sense. Anyway, Stone hadborrowed three men from the Lab, and had the supplies andequipment all lined up when we got there, ready to checkand test.     We dug right in. With plenty of funds\u2014tri-V money andsome government cash the Major had talked his way around\u2014ourequipment was new and good. Mikuta had done the designingand testing himself, with a big assist from Sanderson.We had four Bugs, three of them the light pillow-tire models,with special lead-cooled cut-in engines when the heat set in,and one heavy-duty tractor model for pulling the sledges.     The Major went over them like a kid at the circus. Then hesaid, \u201cHave you heard anything from McIvers?\u201d     \u201cWho\u2019s he?\u201d Stone wanted to know.     \u201cHe\u2019ll be joining us. He\u2019s a good man\u2014got quite a namefor climbing, back home.\u201d The Major turned to me. \u201cYou\u2019veprobably heard of him.\u201d     I\u2019d heard plenty of stories about Ted McIvers and I wasn\u2019ttoo happy to hear that he was joining us. \u201cKind of a daredevil,isn\u2019t he?\u201d     \u201cMaybe. He\u2019s lucky and skillful. Where do you draw theline? We\u2019ll need plenty of both.\u201d     \u201cHave you ever worked with him?\u201d I asked.     \u201cNo. Are you worried?\u201d     \u201cNot exactly. But Brightside is no place to count on luck.\u201d     The Major laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to worry aboutMcIvers. We understood each other when I talked up thetrip to him and we\u2019re going to need each other too much todo any fooling around.\u201d He turned back to the supply list.\u201cMeanwhile, let\u2019s get this stuff listed and packed. We\u2019ll needto cut weight sharply and our time is short. Sanderson sayswe should leave in three days.\u201d     Two days later, McIvers hadn\u2019t arrived. The Major didn\u2019tsay much about it. Stone was getting edgy and so was I. Wespent the second day studying charts of the Brightside, such asthey were. The best available were pretty poor, taken from sofar out that the detail dissolved into blurs on blow-up. Theyshowed the biggest ranges of peaks and craters and faults, andthat was all. Still, we could use them to plan a broad outlineof our course.     \u201cThis range here,\u201d the Major said as we crowded aroundthe board, \u201cis largely inactive, according to Sanderson. Butthese to the south and west      could     be active. Seismographtracings suggest a lot of activity in that region, getting worsedown toward the equator\u2014not only volcanic, but sub-surfaceshifting.\u201d     Stone nodded. \u201cSanderson told me there was probably constantsurface activity.\u201d     The Major shrugged. \u201cWell, it\u2019s treacherous, there\u2019s nodoubt of it. But the only way to avoid it is to travel over thePole, which would lose us days and offer us no guarantee ofless activity to the west. Now we might avoid some if we couldfind a pass through this range and cut sharp east\u2014\u201d     It seemed that the more we considered the problem, thefurther we got from a solution. We knew there were activevolcanoes on the Brightside\u2014even on the Darkside, thoughsurface activity there was pretty much slowed down andlocalized.     But there were problems of atmosphere on Brightside, aswell. There was an atmosphere and a constant atmosphericflow from Brightside to Darkside. Not much\u2014the lighter gaseshad reached escape velocity and disappeared from Brightsidemillennia ago\u2014but there was CO  2  , and nitrogen, and traces ofother heavier gases. There was also an abundance of sulfurvapor, as well as carbon disulfide and sulfur dioxide.     The atmospheric tide moved toward the Darkside, where itcondensed, carrying enough volcanic ash with it for Sandersonto estimate the depth and nature of the surface upheavals onBrightside from his samplings. The trick was to find a passagethat avoided those upheavals as far as possible. But in the finalanalysis, we were barely scraping the surface. The only waywe would find out what was happening where was to be there.     Finally, on the third day, McIvers blew in on a freightrocket from Venus. He\u2019d missed the ship that the Major andI had taken by a few hours, and had conned his way to Venusin hopes of getting a hop from there. He didn\u2019t seem too upsetabout it, as though this were his usual way of doing things andhe couldn\u2019t see why everyone should get so excited.     He was a tall, rangy man with long, wavy hair prematurelygray, and the sort of eyes that looked like a climber\u2019s\u2014half-closed,sleepy, almost indolent, but capable of abrupt alertness.And he never stood still; he was always moving, always doingsomething with his hands, or talking, or pacing about.     Evidently the Major decided not to press the issue of hisarrival. There was still work to do, and an hour later we wererunning the final tests on the pressure suits. That evening,Stone and McIvers were thick as thieves, and everything wasset for an early departure after we got some rest.  "

        "Query": "What is the role of McIvers in the story of Brightside Crossing and how does his journey unfold?",
        "Summary_1": "From the get-go, Claney is clear in his obvious mistrust of McIvers and his preceding reputation. Late to Mercury, he arrives ready to explore. With long, gray hair and paradoxically drowsy yet alert eyes, McIvers\u2019 constant movement and chatter get on his colleague\u2019s nerves. McIvers is a famous climber known for pushing the boundaries and being a daredevil. \nAfter his arrival on Mercury, he and the crew soon set out for their treacherous journey to the Brightside Crossing. He switches spots with Stone, so he would have control of a Bug. He also asks to explore four or five miles ahead of the rest of the crew to see if it\u2019s dangerous footing ahead. Mikuta quickly shuts him down. McIvers talks nonstop through the intercoms or when they\u2019re supposed to be resting. As well, he disobeys Mikuta\u2019s orders and occasionally drifts off from the rest of the group, discovering things as he goes. He never drifts far enough to receive any real punishment, though he does get farther away every time. \nDuring one of his side-explorations, he discovers a wrecked Bug and two corpses belonging to Wyatt and Carpenter, the previous explorers of the Brightside Crossing. With this shocking find, he returns to the crew in silence. ",
        "Summary_2": "McIvers had a reputation in the climbing world for being both skilled and lucky, and the Major sought him out for the Brightside Crossing he was leading because he thought his skills would be useful. They had never met prior to this trip together, though they had spoken about the intent of the trip and that there would be no fooling around. The Major lets it slide that McIver shows up late, however, he does not approve of McIver\u2019s plan to go ahead of the rest of the party to scout the terrain. This turns out to potentially be one of the big mistakes that foils their attempted crossing.\n\nDuring their crossing, tensions between the crew and McIver become frazzled because they are tired of McIver\u2019s talking and bad jokes. McIver irritates the crew by taking little side trips away from the rest of them as they try to make forward progress through the Brightside. During one of those trips, McIver makes a significant discovery of two skeletons of the last known explorers. It is not known whether he lives or dies at the close of the crossing attempt that Peter is recollecting.\n",
        "Summary_3": "McIvers is a climbing enthusiast who is known as something of a daredevil, and is described by Mikuta as possessing skill and luck. Claney describes him as tall, with long, wavy, prematurely graying hair and \u201cclimber\u2019s\u201d eyes that can look drowsy or suddenly very alert. He never stands still and is always speaking, moving, or doing something. He has been invited on the Brightside Crossing mission, unbeknownst to Peter Claney, by Major Mikuta. He casually shows up three days late, having missed the ship that Claney and Mikuta took and conned his way into a different route via Venus. On the eve of the mission, as plans are being doled out, he asserts that he thinks he and Jack Stone should switch roles and he should be given more leeway for movement. He asks if he can go several miles ahead of the rest to scout out the terrain, but Mikuta insists that they will all stay together. McIvers shows his hot temper during this exchange but ultimately agrees. He grows restless during the journey and annoys everyone with his constant talking and wandering. Because of his meandering, he is the first to encounter a chilling sight: the bodies of Wyatt and Carpenter, the first two explorers to attempt the Brightside Crossing. \n",
        "Summary_4": "McIvers is an excellent climber with long gray hair and sleepy eyes. He is fidgety and difficult to take seriously. \n\nMajor Tom Mikuta invites Ted McIvers to join the team on their mission to cross the Brightside of Mercury, and Peter Claney is immediately disappointed. McIvers has a reputation for being a daredevil, and Claney worries that he\u2019s incapable of taking the danger of the mission seriously. Major argues that McIvers is both lucky and skillful, and the team will need plenty of luck and skill on this difficult trip. He also explains that McIvers knows that fooling around is unacceptable. When Claney tells James Baron the story of his trip, Baron agrees that taking McIvers was a huge mistake. Claney tells him that actually, the equipment and the route were more worrisome than McIvers. \n\nMcIvers arrives late to The Twilight Lab, but Major doesn\u2019t chide him. He actually shows up on a freight rocket from Venus because he missed his original chance to get on the ship that Major and Claney took. Major, the leader of the pack, tells McIvers that he will be dragging the sledges, but McIvers tells his boss that he and Jack Stone have already decided to switch roles. He clearly has no issue with challenging authority, and he gets his way. However, McIvers also wants to know who will be miles ahead of the group scouting the terrain, and Major tells him that no one will take that role. Everyone is to remain in sight of one another. Later, Claney reveals that McIvers was right about this suggestion. It would have been incredibly helpful to have a scout out ahead so the team wasn\u2019t driving blind. \n\nMcIvers\u2019 constant talking really annoys Claney and perhaps the other team members as well. He tells the same stupid jokes over and over and repeatedly wishes he had a cold beer. He also begins to go further and further away from the rest of the group members. On one of these tangents, McIvers spots the bodies of Wyatt and Carpenter, two explorers who failed at their mission to cross The Brightside. \n",
        "Article": "We jumped off from Twilight on a course due southeastwith thirty days to make it to the Center of Brightside. If wecould cross an average of seventy miles a day, we could hitCenter exactly at perihelion, the point of Mercury\u2019s closestapproach to the Sun\u2014which made Center the hottest part ofthe planet at the hottest it ever gets.     The Sun was already huge and yellow over the horizonwhen we started, twice the size it appears on Earth. Every daythat Sun would grow bigger and whiter, and every day thesurface would get hotter. But once we reached Center, the jobwas only half done\u2014we would still have to travel anothertwo thousand miles to the opposite twilight zone. Sandersonwas to meet us on the other side in the Laboratory\u2019s scout ship,approximately sixty days from the time we jumped off.     That was the plan, in outline. It was up to us to cross thoseseventy miles a day, no matter how hot it became, no matterwhat terrain we had to cross. Detours would be dangerous andtime-consuming. Delays could cost us our lives. We all knewthat.     The Major briefed us on details an hour before we left.\u201cPeter, you\u2019ll take the lead Bug, the small one we strippeddown for you. Stone and I will flank you on either side, givingyou a hundred-yard lead. McIvers, you\u2019ll have the job ofdragging the sledges, so we\u2019ll have to direct your course prettyclosely. Peter\u2019s job is to pick the passage at any given point.If there\u2019s any doubt of safe passage, we\u2019ll all explore aheadon foot before we risk the Bugs. Got that?\u201d     McIvers and Stone exchanged glances. McIvers said: \u201cJackand I were planning to change around. We figured he couldtake the sledges. That would give me a little more mobility.\u201d     The Major looked up sharply at Stone. \u201cDo you buy that,Jack?\u201d     Stone shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t mind. Mac wanted\u2014\u201d     McIvers made an impatient gesture with his hands. \u201cItdoesn\u2019t matter. I just feel better when I\u2019m on the move. Doesit make any difference?\u201d     \u201cI guess it doesn\u2019t,\u201d said the Major. \u201cThen you\u2019ll flankPeter along with me. Right?\u201d     \u201cSure, sure.\u201d McIvers pulled at his lower lip. \u201cWho\u2019s goingto do the advance scouting?\u201d     \u201cIt sounds like I am,\u201d I cut in. \u201cWe want to keep the leadBug light as possible.\u201d     Mikuta nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Peter\u2019s Bug is stripped downto the frame and wheels.\u201d     McIvers shook his head. \u201cNo, I mean the      advance     work.You need somebody out ahead\u2014four or five miles, at least\u2014topick up the big flaws and active surface changes, don\u2019t you?\u201dHe stared at the Major. \u201cI mean, how can we tell what sort ofa hole we may be moving into, unless we have a scout upahead?\u201d     \u201cThat\u2019s what we have the charts for,\u201d the Major saidsharply.     \u201cCharts! I\u2019m talking about      detail     work. We don\u2019t need toworry about the major topography. It\u2019s the little faults youcan\u2019t see on the pictures that can kill us.\u201d He tossed the chartsdown excitedly. \u201cLook, let me take a Bug out ahead and workreconnaissance, keep five, maybe ten miles ahead of the column.I can stay on good solid ground, of course, but scan thearea closely and radio back to Peter where to avoid the flaws.Then\u2014\u201d     \u201cNo dice,\u201d the Major broke in.     \u201cBut why not? We could save ourselves days!\u201d     \u201cI don\u2019t care what we could save. We stay together. Whenwe get to the Center, I want live men along with me. Thatmeans we stay within easy sight of each other at all times. Anyclimber knows that everybody is safer in a party than one manalone\u2014any time, any place.\u201d     McIvers stared at him, his cheeks an angry red. Finally hegave a sullen nod. \u201cOkay. If you say so.\u201d     \u201cWell, I say so and I mean it. I don\u2019t want any fancy stuff.We\u2019re going to hit Center together, and finish the Crossing together.Got that?\u201d     McIvers nodded. Mikuta then looked at Stone and me andwe nodded, too.     \u201cAll right,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve got it straight,let\u2019s go.\u201d     It was hot. If I forget everything else about that trek, I\u2019llnever forget that huge yellow Sun glaring down, without abreak, hotter and hotter with every mile. We knew that thefirst few days would be the easiest and we were rested andfresh when we started down the long ragged gorge southeast ofthe Twilight Lab.     I moved out first; back over my shoulder, I could see theMajor and McIvers crawling out behind me, their pillow tirestaking the rugged floor of the gorge smoothly. Behind them,Stone dragged the sledges.     Even at only 30 per cent Earth gravity they were a strain onthe big tractor, until the ski-blades bit into the fluffy volcanicash blanketing the valley. We even had a path to follow forthe first twenty miles.     I kept my eyes pasted to the big polaroid binocs, picking outthe track the early research teams had made out into the edgeof Brightside. But in a couple of hours we rumbled past Sanderson\u2019slittle outpost observatory and the tracks stopped. Wewere in virgin territory and already the Sun was beginning tobite.     We didn\u2019t      feel     the heat so much those first days out. We      saw     it. The refrig units kept our skins at a nice comfortable seventy-fivedegrees Fahrenheit inside our suits, but our eyes watchedthat glaring Sun and the baked yellow rocks going past, andsome nerve pathways got twisted up, somehow. We pouredsweat as if we were in a superheated furnace.     We drove eight hours and slept five. When a sleep periodcame due, we pulled the Bugs together into a square, threw upa light aluminum sun-shield and lay out in the dust and rocks.The sun-shield cut the temperature down sixty or seventydegrees, for whatever help that was. And then we ate from theforward sledge\u2014sucking through tubes\u2014protein, carbohydrates,bulk gelatin, vitamins.     The Major measured water out with an iron hand, becausewe\u2019d have drunk ourselves into nephritis in a week otherwise.We were constantly, unceasingly thirsty. Ask the physiologistsand psychiatrists why\u2014they can give you have a dozen interestingreasons\u2014but all we knew, or cared about, was that ithappened to be so.     We didn\u2019t sleep the first few stops, as a consequence. Oureyes burned in spite of the filters and we had roaring headaches,but we couldn\u2019t sleep them off. We sat around lookingat each other. Then McIvers would say how good a beer wouldtaste, and off we\u2019d go. We\u2019d have murdered our grandmothersfor one ice-cold bottle of beer.     After a few driving periods, I began to get my bearings atthe wheel. We were moving down into desolation that madeEarth\u2019s old Death Valley look like a Japanese rose garden.Huge sun-baked cracks opened up in the floor of the gorge,with black cliffs jutting up on either side; the air was filledwith a barely visible yellowish mist of sulfur and sulfurousgases.     It was a hot, barren hole, no place for any man to go, butthe challenge was so powerful you could almost feel it. No onehad ever crossed this land before and escaped. Those who hadtried it had been cruelly punished, but the land was still there,so it had to be crossed. Not the easy way. It had to be crossedthe hardest way possible: overland, through anything the landcould throw up to us, at the most difficult time possible.     Yet we knew that even the land might have been conqueredbefore, except for that Sun. We\u2019d fought absolute cold beforeand won. We\u2019d never fought heat like this and won. The onlyworse heat in the Solar System was the surface of the Sunitself.     Brightside was worth trying for. We would get it or it wouldget us. That was the bargain.     I learned a lot about Mercury those first few driving periods.The gorge petered out after a hundred miles and we movedonto the slope of a range of ragged craters that ran south andeast. This range had shown no activity since the first landingon Mercury forty years before, but beyond it there were activecones. Yellow fumes rose from the craters constantly; theirsides were shrouded with heavy ash.     We couldn\u2019t detect a wind, but we knew there was a hot,sulfurous breeze sweeping in great continental tides across theface of the planet. Not enough for erosion, though. The cratersrose up out of jagged gorges, huge towering spears of rock andrubble. Below were the vast yellow flatlands, smoking and hissingfrom the gases beneath the crust. Over everything was graydust\u2014silicates and salts, pumice and limestone and graniteash, filling crevices and declivities\u2014offering a soft, treacheroussurface for the Bug\u2019s pillow tires.     I learned to read the ground, to tell a covered fault by thesag of the dust; I learned to spot a passable crack, and tell itfrom an impassable cut. Time after time the Bugs ground toa halt while we explored a passage on foot, tied together withlight copper cable, digging, advancing, digging some moreuntil we were sure the surface would carry the machines. Itwas cruel work; we slept in exhaustion. But it went smoothly,at first.     Too smoothly, it seemed to me, and the others seemed tothink so, too.     McIvers\u2019 restlessness was beginning to grate on our nerves.He talked too much, while we were resting or while we weredriving; wisecracks, witticisms, unfunny jokes that wore thinwith repetition. He took to making side trips from the routenow and then, never far, but a little further each time.     Jack Stone reacted quite the opposite; he grew quieter witheach stop, more reserved and apprehensive. I didn\u2019t like it, butI figured that it would pass off after a while. I was apprehensiveenough myself; I just managed to hide it better.     And every mile the Sun got bigger and whiter and higher inthe sky and hotter. Without our ultra-violet screens and glarefilters we would have been blinded; as it was our eyes achedconstantly and the skin on our faces itched and tingled at theend of an eight-hour trek.     But it took one of those side trips of McIvers\u2019 to deliver thepenultimate blow to our already fraying nerves. He had drivendown a side-branch of a long canyon running off west of ourroute and was almost out of sight in a cloud of ash when weheard a sharp cry through our earphones.     I wheeled my Bug around with my heart in my throat andspotted him through the binocs, waving frantically from thetop of his machine. The Major and I took off, lumbering downthe gulch after him as fast as the Bugs could go, with a thousandhorrible pictures racing through our minds....     We found him standing stock-still, pointing down the gorgeand, for once, he didn\u2019t have anything to say. It was the wreckof a Bug; an old-fashioned half-track model of the sort thathadn\u2019t been in use for years. It was wedged tight in a cut inthe rock, an axle broken, its casing split wide open up themiddle, half-buried in a rock slide. A dozen feet away weretwo insulated suits with white bones gleaming through thefiberglass helmets.     This was as far as Wyatt and Carpenter had gotten on      their     Brightside Crossing.   <doc-sep> The Twilight Lab, near the northern pole of Mercury, was theobvious jumping-off place. The setup there wasn\u2019t very extensive\u2014arocket landing, the labs and quarters for Sanderson\u2019screw sunk deep into the crust, and the tower that housedthe Solar \u2019scope that Sanderson had built up there ten yearsbefore.     Twilight Lab wasn\u2019t particularly interested in the Brightside,of course\u2014the Sun was Sanderson\u2019s baby and he\u2019d pickedMercury as the closest chunk of rock to the Sun that couldhold his observatory. He\u2019d chosen a good location, too. OnMercury, the Brightside temperature hits 770\u00b0 F. at perihelionand the Darkside runs pretty constant at -410\u00b0 F. No permanentinstallation with a human crew could survive at eitherextreme. But with Mercury\u2019s wobble, the twilight zone betweenBrightside and Darkside offers something closer to survivaltemperatures.     Sanderson built the Lab up near the pole, where the zoneis about five miles wide, so the temperature only varies 50 to60 degrees with the libration. The Solar \u2019scope could take thatmuch change and they\u2019d get good clear observation of the Sunfor about seventy out of the eighty-eight days it takes the planetto wheel around.     The Major was counting on Sanderson knowing somethingabout Mercury as well as the Sun when we camped at the Labto make final preparations.     Sanderson did. He thought we\u2019d lost our minds and he saidso, but he gave us all the help he could. He spent a weekbriefing Jack Stone, the third member of our party, who hadarrived with the supplies and equipment a few days earlier.Poor Jack met us at the rocket landing almost bawling, Sandersonhad given him such a gloomy picture of what Brightsidewas like.     Stone was a youngster\u2014hardly twenty-five, I\u2019d say\u2014buthe\u2019d been with the Major at Vulcan and had begged to jointhis trek. I had a funny feeling that Jack really didn\u2019t care forexploring too much, but he thought Mikuta was God, followedhim around like a puppy.     It didn\u2019t matter to me as long as he knew what he was gettingin for. You don\u2019t go asking people in this game why they do it\u2014they\u2019reliable to get awfully uneasy and none of them canever give you an answer that makes sense. Anyway, Stone hadborrowed three men from the Lab, and had the supplies andequipment all lined up when we got there, ready to checkand test.     We dug right in. With plenty of funds\u2014tri-V money andsome government cash the Major had talked his way around\u2014ourequipment was new and good. Mikuta had done the designingand testing himself, with a big assist from Sanderson.We had four Bugs, three of them the light pillow-tire models,with special lead-cooled cut-in engines when the heat set in,and one heavy-duty tractor model for pulling the sledges.     The Major went over them like a kid at the circus. Then hesaid, \u201cHave you heard anything from McIvers?\u201d     \u201cWho\u2019s he?\u201d Stone wanted to know.     \u201cHe\u2019ll be joining us. He\u2019s a good man\u2014got quite a namefor climbing, back home.\u201d The Major turned to me. \u201cYou\u2019veprobably heard of him.\u201d     I\u2019d heard plenty of stories about Ted McIvers and I wasn\u2019ttoo happy to hear that he was joining us. \u201cKind of a daredevil,isn\u2019t he?\u201d     \u201cMaybe. He\u2019s lucky and skillful. Where do you draw theline? We\u2019ll need plenty of both.\u201d     \u201cHave you ever worked with him?\u201d I asked.     \u201cNo. Are you worried?\u201d     \u201cNot exactly. But Brightside is no place to count on luck.\u201d     The Major laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to worry aboutMcIvers. We understood each other when I talked up thetrip to him and we\u2019re going to need each other too much todo any fooling around.\u201d He turned back to the supply list.\u201cMeanwhile, let\u2019s get this stuff listed and packed. We\u2019ll needto cut weight sharply and our time is short. Sanderson sayswe should leave in three days.\u201d     Two days later, McIvers hadn\u2019t arrived. The Major didn\u2019tsay much about it. Stone was getting edgy and so was I. Wespent the second day studying charts of the Brightside, such asthey were. The best available were pretty poor, taken from sofar out that the detail dissolved into blurs on blow-up. Theyshowed the biggest ranges of peaks and craters and faults, andthat was all. Still, we could use them to plan a broad outlineof our course.     \u201cThis range here,\u201d the Major said as we crowded aroundthe board, \u201cis largely inactive, according to Sanderson. Butthese to the south and west      could     be active. Seismographtracings suggest a lot of activity in that region, getting worsedown toward the equator\u2014not only volcanic, but sub-surfaceshifting.\u201d     Stone nodded. \u201cSanderson told me there was probably constantsurface activity.\u201d     The Major shrugged. \u201cWell, it\u2019s treacherous, there\u2019s nodoubt of it. But the only way to avoid it is to travel over thePole, which would lose us days and offer us no guarantee ofless activity to the west. Now we might avoid some if we couldfind a pass through this range and cut sharp east\u2014\u201d     It seemed that the more we considered the problem, thefurther we got from a solution. We knew there were activevolcanoes on the Brightside\u2014even on the Darkside, thoughsurface activity there was pretty much slowed down andlocalized.     But there were problems of atmosphere on Brightside, aswell. There was an atmosphere and a constant atmosphericflow from Brightside to Darkside. Not much\u2014the lighter gaseshad reached escape velocity and disappeared from Brightsidemillennia ago\u2014but there was CO  2  , and nitrogen, and traces ofother heavier gases. There was also an abundance of sulfurvapor, as well as carbon disulfide and sulfur dioxide.     The atmospheric tide moved toward the Darkside, where itcondensed, carrying enough volcanic ash with it for Sandersonto estimate the depth and nature of the surface upheavals onBrightside from his samplings. The trick was to find a passagethat avoided those upheavals as far as possible. But in the finalanalysis, we were barely scraping the surface. The only waywe would find out what was happening where was to be there.     Finally, on the third day, McIvers blew in on a freightrocket from Venus. He\u2019d missed the ship that the Major andI had taken by a few hours, and had conned his way to Venusin hopes of getting a hop from there. He didn\u2019t seem too upsetabout it, as though this were his usual way of doing things andhe couldn\u2019t see why everyone should get so excited.     He was a tall, rangy man with long, wavy hair prematurelygray, and the sort of eyes that looked like a climber\u2019s\u2014half-closed,sleepy, almost indolent, but capable of abrupt alertness.And he never stood still; he was always moving, always doingsomething with his hands, or talking, or pacing about.     Evidently the Major decided not to press the issue of hisarrival. There was still work to do, and an hour later we wererunning the final tests on the pressure suits. That evening,Stone and McIvers were thick as thieves, and everything wasset for an early departure after we got some rest.   <doc-sep> I\u2019d been interested in the Brightside for almost as long asI can remember (Claney said). I guess I was about ten whenWyatt and Carpenter made the last attempt\u2014that was in 2082,I think. I followed the news stories like a tri-V serial and thenI was heartbroken when they just disappeared.     I know now that they were a pair of idiots, starting off withoutproper equipment, with practically no knowledge of surfaceconditions, without any charts\u2014they couldn\u2019t have madea hundred miles\u2014but I didn\u2019t know that then and it was aterrible tragedy. After that, I followed Sanderson\u2019s work in theTwilight Lab up there and began to get Brightside into myblood, sure as death.     But it was Mikuta\u2019s idea to attempt a Crossing. Did you everknow Tom Mikuta? I don\u2019t suppose you did. No, not Japanese\u2014Polish-American.He was a major in the Interplanetary Servicefor some years and hung onto the title after he gave uphis commission.     He was with Armstrong on Mars during his Service days,did a good deal of the original mapping and surveying forthe Colony there. I first met him on Venus; we spent fiveyears together up there doing some of the nastiest exploringsince the Matto Grasso. Then he made the attempt on VulcanCrater that paved the way for Balmer a few years later.     I\u2019d always liked the Major\u2014he was big and quiet and cool,the sort of guy who always had things figured a little furtherahead than anyone else and always knew what to do in a tightplace. Too many men in this game are all nerve and luck,with no judgment. The Major had both. He also had the kindof personality that could take a crew of wild men andmake them work like a well-oiled machine across a thousandmiles of Venus jungle. I liked him and I trusted him.     He contacted me in New York and he was very casual atfirst. We spent an evening here at the Red Lion, talking aboutold times; he told me about the Vulcan business, and how he\u2019dbeen out to see Sanderson and the Twilight Lab on Mercury,and how he preferred a hot trek to a cold one any day of theyear\u2014and then he wanted to know what I\u2019d been doing sinceVenus and what my plans were.     \u201cNo particular plans,\u201d I told him. \u201cWhy?\u201d     He looked me over. \u201cHow much do you weigh, Peter?\u201d     I told him one-thirty-five.     \u201cThat much!\u201d he said. \u201cWell, there can\u2019t be much fat onyou, at any rate. How do you take heat?\u201d     \u201cYou should know,\u201d I said. \u201cVenus was no icebox.\u201d     \u201cNo, I mean      real     heat.\u201d     Then I began to get it. \u201cYou\u2019re planning a trip.\u201d     \u201cThat\u2019s right. A hot trip.\u201d He grinned at me. \u201cMight bedangerous, too.\u201d     \u201cWhat trip?\u201d     \u201cBrightside of Mercury,\u201d the Major said.     I whistled cautiously. \u201cAt aphelion?\u201d     He threw his head back. \u201cWhy try a Crossing at aphelion?What have you done then? Four thousand miles of butcherousheat, just to have some joker come along, use your data anddrum you out of the glory by crossing at perihelion forty-fourdays later? No, thanks. I want the Brightside without any nonsenseabout it.\u201d He leaned across me eagerly. \u201cI want to makea Crossing at perihelion and I want to cross on the surface. Ifa man can do that, he\u2019s got Mercury. Until then,      nobody\u2019s     gotMercury. I want Mercury\u2014but I\u2019ll need help getting it.\u201d     I\u2019d thought of it a thousand times and never dared considerit. Nobody had, since Wyatt and Carpenter disappeared. Mercuryturns on its axis in the same time that it wheels aroundthe Sun, which means that the Brightside is always facing in.That makes the Brightside of Mercury at perihelion the hottestplace in the Solar System, with one single exception: thesurface of the Sun itself.     It would be a hellish trek. Only a few men had ever learnedjust      how     hellish and they never came back to tell about it. Itwas a real hell\u2019s Crossing, but someday, I thought, somebodywould cross it.     I wanted to be along.  "

        "Query": "What is the location where the events of Brightside Crossing take place?",
        "Summary_1": "Brightside Crossing by Alan E. Nourse mostly takes place on the surface of Mercury.  The main characters begin in an observatory equipped to support human life as well as do research on the planet itself. However, they quickly move on in their journey to cross the Brightside at perihelion. Full of craters, gorges, and cracked land, the planet\u2019s surface is incredibly dangerous to travel on. Sulfurous, hot winds blow across the planet. Beyond the towering, rocky spears and jagged gorges lay yellow valleys and flatlands. The gas beneath the surface of the planet can cause volcanic-like eruptions. This gas can also imply rise up from the core and poison the atmosphere around it. Gray dust caused by years of erosion rested atop every surface. \nMercury is an incredibly hot planet, being the nearest to the sun, and the surface reflects that. ",
        "Summary_2": "The only \u2018real\u2019 setting is a bar called Red Lion where Baron and Peter are sitting together. All other settings are imagined through Peter\u2019s recalling of past events.\n\nPeter\u2019s story includes settings from the Twilight Lab (an observatory on Mercury in the twilight zone between the bright and dark sides of the planet), in vehicles called Bugs on the surface of Mercury as his expedition party tries to cross the Brightside, and in various inhospitable locations on the surface of the bright side of the planet, including molten lead lakes and volcanoes.\n\nThe surface of the planet Mercury that faces the sun is referred to as the Brightside. Crossing it is extremely difficult due to the environmental conditions. It is described that the bright side of mercury is always facing towards the light as it rotates around the sun, never having darkness over it. It is an extremely hot place (770F), known to have active volcanoes, and an atmosphere that is mostly CO2, nitrogen and heavier gases. Humans must wear specialized suits to keep their body temperature at 75F while on the Brightside. A journey from the twilight zone (the transition between the bright and dark sides of the planet) to the Center of the Brightside would take about 30 days.\n",
        "Summary_3": "The initial setting is on Earth, in New York, outside of and then inside of a bar called the Red Lion. It is a quiet and sparsely populated lounge where some other adventurers (Andean climbers, the person who had mapped a previous voyage for Baron) are in attendance. Peter Claney\u2019s story touches briefly on settings during his childhood (presumably somewhere on Earth), Mikuta\u2019s time on Mars, his time with Mikuta on Venus, and New York again, but the primary setting is Mercury. The first area of Mercury they encounter is the Twilight Lab, located near Mercury\u2019s north pole. This is the jumping off point for the mission, and includes a rocket landing, labs and quarters located deep in Mercury\u2019s crust, and a tower with a solar scope. Mercury\u2019s temperature is around -410 degrees F on the darkside and can reach 770 degrees on the brightside. The lab is located in a twilight zone between the two, which is about five miles wide at the pole and allows the area to be habitable. The brightside has ranges of craters, peaks, and faults; some ranges are inactive while others have volcanic activity and shifting below surface level. The atmosphere is as treacherous as the terrain, with Co2, nitrogen, traces of heavier gases, sulfur vapor, carbon disulfide, and sulfur dioxide flowing in constant atmospheric tides from the brightside to the darkside. The first thirty miles of the trek take them through fluffy volcanic ash and into virgin territory full of desolate gorges and intense heat. They see tall, jagged rocks, as well as the yellow, smoky plains below them. They venture closer and closer to the sun, and have to be increasingly cautious of the tenuous surface of Mercury. Based on Claney saying he was ten in 2082, the events Claney describes as well as his meeting with Baron likely occur in the 2100s (or later). \n",
        "Summary_4": "The story begins at Red Lion, a place with few patrons. A doorman is in charge of the comings and goings. Several climbers are conversing, including Andean climbers and the first man to cross the Vulcan Crater on Venus. \nClaney then dives into his story about his trip to cross the Brightside of Mercury. The men meet up for their trip at the Twilight Lab near the north pole of the planet. The lab has a rocket landing and a lab, and much of it is deep in the crust of the planet where it is cooler. There is also a tower that houses the Solar \u2018scope. Sanderson, the lab\u2019s manager, is a sun researcher, so his lab is located at the closest reasonable spot to the sun. Its position between the Brightside and the Darkside means that the temperatures only fluctuate about 50-60 degrees. \nMercury is situated on an axis, and the part that turns in faces the sun. This area, the perihelion, is the hottest place in the solar system besides the actual surface of the sun. Here, the temperatures soar to 770 degrees fahrenheit. The surface of Mercury is particularly treacherous. There are many active volcanoes, and the ground shifts frequently, creating cracks and craters that are difficult to see and impossible to cross. The gases present are also dangerous, including CO 2, nitrogen, sulfur vapor, and sulfur dioxide. There is liquid lead and boiling pools of sulfur. \nOn Mercury, the sun appears to be twice as big as it does on Earth. The planet only has 30% of the gravity that Earth does, and it is blanketed with gray ash. Huge cracks in the surface appear out of nowhere, and cliffs rise out of the land, and rocks and rubble and molten lead make driving treacherous. Everything is difficult to see because of the sulfur mist and the volcanic ash. Without filters and screens, humans would be instantly blinded by the light from the sun. \nThere is a deep gorge where the bodies of Wyatt and Carpenter, two famous explorers who attempted to cross The Brightside, lie. Their outdated Bugs crashed there, presumably because they misjudged the surface and did not see the crack in the lan\n",

Nourse    JAMES BARON was not pleased to hear that he had hada visitor when he reached the Red Lion that evening. Hehad no stomach for mysteries, vast or trifling, and therewere pressing things to think about at this time. Yet the doormanhad flagged him as he came in from the street: \u201cA thousandpardons, Mr. Baron. The gentleman\u2014he would leave noname. He said you\u2019d want to see him. He will be back byeight.\u201d     Now Baron drummed his fingers on the table top, staringabout the quiet lounge. Street trade was discouraged at theRed Lion, gently but persuasively; the patrons were few innumber. Across to the right was a group that Baron knewvaguely\u2014Andean climbers, or at least two of them were. Overnear the door he recognized old Balmer, who had mappedthe first passage to the core of Vulcan Crater on Venus. Baronreturned his smile with a nod. Then he settled back andwaited impatiently for the intruder who demanded his timewithout justifying it.     Presently a small, grizzled man crossed the room and satdown at Baron\u2019s table. He was short and wiry. His face heldno key to his age\u2014he might have been thirty or a thousand\u2014buthe looked weary and immensely ugly. His cheeks andforehead were twisted and brown, with scars that were stillhealing.     The stranger said, \u201cI\u2019m glad you waited. I\u2019ve heard you\u2019replanning to attempt the Brightside.\u201d     Baron stared at the man for a moment. \u201cI see you can readtelecasts,\u201d he said coldly. \u201cThe news was correct. We are goingto make a Brightside Crossing.\u201d     \u201cAt perihelion?\u201d     \u201cOf course. When else?\u201d     The grizzled man searched Baron\u2019s face for a momentwithout expression. Then he said slowly, \u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019renot going to make the Crossing.\u201d     \u201cSay, who are you, if you don\u2019t mind?\u201d Baron demanded.     \u201cThe name is Claney,\u201d said the stranger.     There was a silence. Then: \u201cClaney?

We\u2019ve been trying to contact you for months!\u201d     \u201cI know. I was hoping you\u2019d quit looking and chuck thewhole idea.\u201d     \u201cQuit looking!\u201d Baron bent forward over the table. \u201cMyfriend, we\u2019d given up hope, but we\u2019ve never quit looking.Here, have a drink. There\u2019s so much you can tell us.\u201d Hisfingers were trembling.     Peter Claney shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you anything youwant to hear.\u201d     \u201cBut you\u2019ve      got     to. You\u2019re the only man on Earth who\u2019sattempted a Brightside Crossing and lived through it! And thestory you cleared for the news\u2014it was nothing. We need      details     .

If you can tell us, we can makeit across where your attempt failed\u2014\u201d     \u201cYou want to know why we failed?\u201d asked Claney.     \u201cOf course we want to know. We      have     to know.\u201d     \u201cIt\u2019s simple. We failed because it can\u2019t be done. We couldn\u2019tdo it and neither can you. No human beings will ever crossthe Brightside alive, not if they try for centuries.\u201d     \u201cNonsense,\u201d Baron declared. \u201cWe will.\u201d     Claney shrugged. \u201cI was there.

Youcan blame the equipment or the men\u2014there were flaws inboth quarters\u2014but we just didn\u2019t know what we were fighting.It was the      planet     that whipped us, that and the      Sun     . They\u2019llwhip you, too, if you try it.\u201d     \u201cNever,\u201d said Baron.     \u201cLet me tell you,\u201d Peter Claney said.   <doc-sep> The Twilight Lab, near the northern pole of Mercury, was theobvious jumping-off place. The setup there wasn\u2019t very extensive\u2014arocket landing, the labs and quarters for Sanderson\u2019screw sunk deep into the crust, and the tower that housedthe Solar \u2019scope that Sanderson had built up there ten yearsbefore.     Twilight Lab wasn\u2019t particularly interested in the Brightside,of course\u2014the Sun was Sanderson\u2019s baby and he\u2019d pickedMercury as the closest chunk of rock to the Sun that couldhold his observatory. He\u2019d chosen a good location, too. OnMercury, the Brightside temperature hits 770\u00b0 F. at perihelionand the Darkside runs pretty constant at -410\u00b0 F. No permanentinstallation with a human crew could survive at eitherextreme. But with Mercury\u2019s wobble, the twilight zone betweenBrightside and Darkside offers something closer to survivaltemperatures.     Sanderson built the Lab up near the pole, where the zoneis about five miles wide, so the temperature only varies 50 to60 degrees with the libration. The Solar \u2019scope could take thatmuch change and they\u2019d get good clear observation of the Sunfor about seventy out of the eighty-eight days it takes the planetto wheel around.     The Major was counting on Sanderson knowing somethingabout Mercury as well as the Sun when we camped at the Labto make final preparations.     Sanderson did. He thought we\u2019d lost our minds and he saidso, but he gave us all the help he could. He spent a weekbriefing Jack Stone, the third member of our party, who hadarrived with the supplies and equipment a few days earlier.Poor Jack met us at the rocket landing almost bawling, Sandersonhad given him such a gloomy picture of what Brightsidewas like.     Stone was a youngster\u2014hardly twenty-five, I\u2019d say\u2014buthe\u2019d been with the Major at Vulcan and had begged to jointhis trek. I had a funny feeling that Jack really didn\u2019t care forexploring too much, but he thought Mikuta was God, followedhim around like a puppy.     It didn\u2019t matter to me as long as he knew what he was gettingin for. You don\u2019t go asking people in this game why they do it\u2014they\u2019reliable to get awfully uneasy and none of them canever give you an answer that makes sense. Anyway, Stone hadborrowed three men from the Lab, and had the supplies andequipment all lined up when we got there, ready to checkand test.     We dug right in. With plenty of funds\u2014tri-V money andsome government cash the Major had talked his way around\u2014ourequipment was new and good. Mikuta had done the designingand testing himself, with a big assist from Sanderson.We had four Bugs, three of them the light pillow-tire models,with special lead-cooled cut-in engines when the heat set in,and one heavy-duty tractor model for pulling the sledges.     The Major went over them like a kid at the circus. Then hesaid, \u201cHave you heard anything from McIvers?\u201d     \u201cWho\u2019s he?\u201d Stone wanted to know.     \u201cHe\u2019ll be joining us. He\u2019s a good man\u2014got quite a namefor climbing, back home.\u201d The Major turned to me. \u201cYou\u2019veprobably heard of him.\u201d     I\u2019d heard plenty of stories about Ted McIvers and I wasn\u2019ttoo happy to hear that he was joining us. \u201cKind of a daredevil,isn\u2019t he?\u201d     \u201cMaybe. He\u2019s lucky and skillful. Where do you draw theline? We\u2019ll need plenty of both.\u201d     \u201cHave you ever worked with him?\u201d I asked.     \u201cNo. Are you worried?\u201d     \u201cNot exactly. But Brightside is no place to count on luck.\u201d     The Major laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to worry aboutMcIvers. We understood each other when I talked up thetrip to him and we\u2019re going to need each other too much todo any fooling around.\u201d He turned back to the supply list.\u201cMeanwhile, let\u2019s get this stuff listed and packed. We\u2019ll needto cut weight sharply and our time is short. Sanderson sayswe should leave in three days.\u201d     Two days later, McIvers hadn\u2019t arrived. The Major didn\u2019tsay much about it. Stone was getting edgy and so was I. Wespent the second day studying charts of the Brightside, such asthey were. The best available were pretty poor, taken from sofar out that the detail dissolved into blurs on blow-up. Theyshowed the biggest ranges of peaks and craters and faults, andthat was all. Still, we could use them to plan a broad outlineof our course.     \u201cThis range here,\u201d the Major said as we crowded aroundthe board, \u201cis largely inactive, according to Sanderson. Butthese to the south and west      could     be active. Seismographtracings suggest a lot of activity in that region, getting worsedown toward the equator\u2014not only volcanic, but sub-surfaceshifting.\u201d     Stone nodded. \u201cSanderson told me there was probably constantsurface activity.\u201d     The Major shrugged. \u201cWell, it\u2019s treacherous, there\u2019s nodoubt of it. But the only way to avoid it is to travel over thePole, which would lose us days and offer us no guarantee ofless activity to the west. Now we might avoid some if we couldfind a pass through this range and cut sharp east\u2014\u201d     It seemed that the more we considered the problem, thefurther we got from a solution. We knew there were activevolcanoes on the Brightside\u2014even on the Darkside, thoughsurface activity there was pretty much slowed down andlocalized.     But there were problems of atmosphere on Brightside, aswell. There was an atmosphere and a constant atmosphericflow from Brightside to Darkside. Not much\u2014the lighter gaseshad reached escape velocity and disappeared from Brightsidemillennia ago\u2014but there was CO  2  , and nitrogen, and traces ofother heavier gases. There was also an abundance of sulfurvapor, as well as carbon disulfide and sulfur dioxide.     The atmospheric tide moved toward the Darkside, where itcondensed, carrying enough volcanic ash with it for Sandersonto estimate the depth and nature of the surface upheavals onBrightside from his samplings. The trick was to find a passagethat avoided those upheavals as far as possible. But in the finalanalysis, we were barely scraping the surface. The only waywe would find out what was happening where was to be there.     Finally, on the third day, McIvers blew in on a freightrocket from Venus. He\u2019d missed the ship that the Major andI had taken by a few hours, and had conned his way to Venusin hopes of getting a hop from there. He didn\u2019t seem too upsetabout it, as though this were his usual way of doing things andhe couldn\u2019t see why everyone should get so excited.     He was a tall, rangy man with long, wavy hair prematurelygray, and the sort of eyes that looked like a climber\u2019s\u2014half-closed,sleepy, almost indolent, but capable of abrupt alertness.And he never stood still; he was always moving, always doingsomething with his hands, or talking, or pacing about.     Evidently the Major decided not to press the issue of hisarrival. There was still work to do, and an hour later we wererunning the final tests on the pressure suits. That evening,Stone and McIvers were thick as thieves, and everything wasset for an early departure after we got some rest.  "

        "Query": "What does the Brightside Crossing signify?",
        "Summary_1": "The Brightside Crossing is an undiscovered portion of Mercury. It is the closest planet to the sun, and the Brightside is the surface that is face-to-face with the surface of the sun most of the time, thanks to Mercury\u2019s quick orbit. It is an incredibly dangerous area of Mercury, with temperatures reaching up to 770 degrees Fahrenheit, possibly more. Because of the difficult atmosphere, the presence of dangerous gases, treacherous landscape, and the heat, the Brightside Crossing remained undiscovered and uninhabitable for hundreds of years. \nMajor Tom Mikuta decided to follow in the footsteps of Wyatt and Carpenter and take on the challenge. The promise of power and discovery draws the main characters forward, as well as the idea of being the first. Mikuta claims that if he were to make the crossing, Mercury would be his. The challenge of the Brightside Crossing is the origin of their desire.",
        "Summary_2": "It is significant to the explorers because it has never been done before, so being the first would presumably make them very famous. On a greater scale, a successful crossing means conquering Mercury for humanity to the Major. He thinks that if he can successfully cross the bright side of Mercury at perihelion (when the planet is closest to the sun) then man has \u201cgot Mercury\u201d. As in, if they have the technologies, knowledge, and skills to make the crossing at the hottest possible time there is nothing that isn\u2019t possible for humans to do on the planet.\n",
        "Summary_3": "The Brightside Crossing is significant because no one has done it successfully, though it has been attempted before. It is also significant because the entire story is about the Brightside Crossing. Baron\u2019s well-publicized upcoming mission to cross it is what brings Claney to speak with him (and try to talk him out of it), and the story Claney tells is about his own experience attempting to cross, as he is the only man on Earth to have survived an attempt (though he did sustain some physical damage). The Brightside gets its name from one of the most dangerous things about it: its proximity to the sun. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Many climbers and explorers wish to take on the Brightside Crossing, but it seems as though the trip is nearly impossible. Wyatt and Carpenter, two famous explorers, attempted to make the trip across the hottest planetary surface in the solar system in 2082, and they never returned from the trip. \n\nPeter Claney is the only living man who has attempted the trip and made it back alive. He was not successful in his mission to cross the perihelion, so it can be assumed that he turned back towards The Twilight Lab after his teammates perished. \n\nMaps of the terrain are shoddy at best since, and the surface is ever changing. Volcanoes erupt, cracks appear, cliffs crumble, and photography and technology is not yet good enough to create detailed pictures of the surface that would allow explorers to create a definitive and safe route. Since the men must travel at least 70 miles a day, there can be zero detours. It\u2019s a constant game of scanning the terrain and making last minute decisions about which way is safest. \n\nPeter Claney and his teammates are motivated almost entirely by their desire to be the first people to conquer The Brightside Crossing. They believe that The Brightside would get them or they would get The Brightside. There is no other way, and their fame and success makes the dangerous trip worth a try. \n",
        "Article": "I\u2019d been interested in the Brightside for almost as long asI can remember (Claney said). I guess I was about ten whenWyatt and Carpenter made the last attempt\u2014that was in 2082,I think. I followed the news stories like a tri-V serial and thenI was heartbroken when they just disappeared.     I know now that they were a pair of idiots, starting off withoutproper equipment, with practically no knowledge of surfaceconditions, without any charts\u2014they couldn\u2019t have madea hundred miles\u2014but I didn\u2019t know that then and it was aterrible tragedy. After that, I followed Sanderson\u2019s work in theTwilight Lab up there and began to get Brightside into myblood, sure as death.     But it was Mikuta\u2019s idea to attempt a Crossing. Did you everknow Tom Mikuta? I don\u2019t suppose you did. No, not Japanese\u2014Polish-American.He was a major in the Interplanetary Servicefor some years and hung onto the title after he gave uphis commission.     He was with Armstrong on Mars during his Service days,did a good deal of the original mapping and surveying forthe Colony there. I first met him on Venus; we spent fiveyears together up there doing some of the nastiest exploringsince the Matto Grasso. Then he made the attempt on VulcanCrater that paved the way for Balmer a few years later.     I\u2019d always liked the Major\u2014he was big and quiet and cool,the sort of guy who always had things figured a little furtherahead than anyone else and always knew what to do in a tightplace. Too many men in this game are all nerve and luck,with no judgment. The Major had both. He also had the kindof personality that could take a crew of wild men andmake them work like a well-oiled machine across a thousandmiles of Venus jungle. I liked him and I trusted him.     He contacted me in New York and he was very casual atfirst. We spent an evening here at the Red Lion, talking aboutold times; he told me about the Vulcan business, and how he\u2019dbeen out to see Sanderson and the Twilight Lab on Mercury,and how he preferred a hot trek to a cold one any day of theyear\u2014and then he wanted to know what I\u2019d been doing sinceVenus and what my plans were.     \u201cNo particular plans,\u201d I told him. \u201cWhy?\u201d     He looked me over. \u201cHow much do you weigh, Peter?\u201d     I told him one-thirty-five.     \u201cThat much!\u201d he said. \u201cWell, there can\u2019t be much fat onyou, at any rate. How do you take heat?\u201d     \u201cYou should know,\u201d I said. \u201cVenus was no icebox.\u201d     \u201cNo, I mean      real     heat.\u201d     Then I began to get it. \u201cYou\u2019re planning a trip.\u201d     \u201cThat\u2019s right. A hot trip.\u201d He grinned at me. \u201cMight bedangerous, too.\u201d     \u201cWhat trip?\u201d     \u201cBrightside of Mercury,\u201d the Major said.     I whistled cautiously. \u201cAt aphelion?\u201d     He threw his head back. \u201cWhy try a Crossing at aphelion?What have you done then? Four thousand miles of butcherousheat, just to have some joker come along, use your data anddrum you out of the glory by crossing at perihelion forty-fourdays later? No, thanks. I want the Brightside without any nonsenseabout it.\u201d He leaned across me eagerly. \u201cI want to makea Crossing at perihelion and I want to cross on the surface. Ifa man can do that, he\u2019s got Mercury. Until then,      nobody\u2019s     gotMercury. I want Mercury\u2014but I\u2019ll need help getting it.\u201d     I\u2019d thought of it a thousand times and never dared considerit. Nobody had, since Wyatt and Carpenter disappeared. Mercuryturns on its axis in the same time that it wheels aroundthe Sun, which means that the Brightside is always facing in.That makes the Brightside of Mercury at perihelion the hottestplace in the Solar System, with one single exception: thesurface of the Sun itself.     It would be a hellish trek. Only a few men had ever learnedjust      how     hellish and they never came back to tell about it. Itwas a real hell\u2019s Crossing, but someday, I thought, somebodywould cross it.     I wanted to be along.   <doc-sep>    Brightside     Crossing   by Alan E. Nourse    JAMES BARON was not pleased to hear that he had hada visitor when he reached the Red Lion that evening. Hehad no stomach for mysteries, vast or trifling, and therewere pressing things to think about at this time. Yet the doormanhad flagged him as he came in from the street: \u201cA thousandpardons, Mr. Baron. The gentleman\u2014he would leave noname. He said you\u2019d want to see him. He will be back byeight.\u201d     Now Baron drummed his fingers on the table top, staringabout the quiet lounge. Street trade was discouraged at theRed Lion, gently but persuasively; the patrons were few innumber. Across to the right was a group that Baron knewvaguely\u2014Andean climbers, or at least two of them were. Overnear the door he recognized old Balmer, who had mappedthe first passage to the core of Vulcan Crater on Venus. Baronreturned his smile with a nod. Then he settled back andwaited impatiently for the intruder who demanded his timewithout justifying it.     Presently a small, grizzled man crossed the room and satdown at Baron\u2019s table. He was short and wiry. His face heldno key to his age\u2014he might have been thirty or a thousand\u2014buthe looked weary and immensely ugly. His cheeks andforehead were twisted and brown, with scars that were stillhealing.     The stranger said, \u201cI\u2019m glad you waited. I\u2019ve heard you\u2019replanning to attempt the Brightside.\u201d     Baron stared at the man for a moment. \u201cI see you can readtelecasts,\u201d he said coldly. \u201cThe news was correct. We are goingto make a Brightside Crossing.\u201d     \u201cAt perihelion?\u201d     \u201cOf course. When else?\u201d     The grizzled man searched Baron\u2019s face for a momentwithout expression. Then he said slowly, \u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019renot going to make the Crossing.\u201d     \u201cSay, who are you, if you don\u2019t mind?\u201d Baron demanded.     \u201cThe name is Claney,\u201d said the stranger.     There was a silence. Then: \u201cClaney?      Peter     Claney?\u201d     \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d     Baron\u2019s eyes were wide with excitement, all trace of angergone. \u201cGreat balls of fire, man\u2014      where have you been hiding?

We\u2019ll needto cut weight sharply and our time is short. Sanderson sayswe should leave in three days.\u201d     Two days later, McIvers hadn\u2019t arrived. The Major didn\u2019tsay much about it. Stone was getting edgy and so was I. Wespent the second day studying charts of the Brightside, such asthey were. The best available were pretty poor, taken from sofar out that the detail dissolved into blurs on blow-up. Theyshowed the biggest ranges of peaks and craters and faults, andthat was all. Still, we could use them to plan a broad outlineof our course.     \u201cThis range here,\u201d the Major said as we crowded aroundthe board, \u201cis largely inactive, according to Sanderson. Butthese to the south and west      could     be active. Seismographtracings suggest a lot of activity in that region, getting worsedown toward the equator\u2014not only volcanic, but sub-surfaceshifting.\u201d     Stone nodded. \u201cSanderson told me there was probably constantsurface activity.\u201d     The Major shrugged. \u201cWell, it\u2019s treacherous, there\u2019s nodoubt of it. But the only way to avoid it is to travel over thePole, which would lose us days and offer us no guarantee ofless activity to the west. Now we might avoid some if we couldfind a pass through this range and cut sharp east\u2014\u201d     It seemed that the more we considered the problem, thefurther we got from a solution. We knew there were activevolcanoes on the Brightside\u2014even on the Darkside, thoughsurface activity there was pretty much slowed down andlocalized.     But there were problems of atmosphere on Brightside, aswell. There was an atmosphere and a constant atmosphericflow from Brightside to Darkside. Not much\u2014the lighter gaseshad reached escape velocity and disappeared from Brightsidemillennia ago\u2014but there was CO  2  , and nitrogen, and traces ofother heavier gases. There was also an abundance of sulfurvapor, as well as carbon disulfide and sulfur dioxide.     The atmospheric tide moved toward the Darkside, where itcondensed, carrying enough volcanic ash with it for Sandersonto estimate the depth and nature of the surface upheavals onBrightside from his samplings. The trick was to find a passagethat avoided those upheavals as far as possible. But in the finalanalysis, we were barely scraping the surface. The only waywe would find out what was happening where was to be there.     Finally, on the third day, McIvers blew in on a freightrocket from Venus. He\u2019d missed the ship that the Major andI had taken by a few hours, and had conned his way to Venusin hopes of getting a hop from there. He didn\u2019t seem too upsetabout it, as though this were his usual way of doing things andhe couldn\u2019t see why everyone should get so excited.     He was a tall, rangy man with long, wavy hair prematurelygray, and the sort of eyes that looked like a climber\u2019s\u2014half-closed,sleepy, almost indolent, but capable of abrupt alertness.And he never stood still; he was always moving, always doingsomething with his hands, or talking, or pacing about.     Evidently the Major decided not to press the issue of hisarrival. There was still work to do, and an hour later we wererunning the final tests on the pressure suits. That evening,Stone and McIvers were thick as thieves, and everything wasset for an early departure after we got some rest.  "

        "Query": "What is the story of Jack Stone in Brightside Crossing?",
        "Summary_1": "Jack Stone arrives on the surface of Mercury around a week ahead of his partners. It\u2019s revealed rather early on that Stone is not much of an explorer himself. His wits and genius make him an invaluable resource, but his heart wasn\u2019t necessarily in the right place. Claney claims that Stone only came to follow Major Mikuta around, a man he deeply respected and admired. \nAt barely 25 years old, Stone was the youngest member of the team. His experience with Mikuta at the Vulcan qualified him for the trek, or so he thought, and so he tagged along. \nHis apprehension and anxiety about the trip are evident from the beginning. After Sanderson, the leader of an observatory on Mercury, explained how treacherous their journey was going to be, Stone almost cried. \nOnce they begin their trek, Stone retreats further into himself. Jack\u2019s job was to drag the sledges behind the rest of the crew. Possibly fed up by McIvers\u2019 constant joking or tortured by the fear that he would be lost on this planet forever, Stone became a shell of himself. \nIn the end, after McIvers discovered the corpses of the two discoverers that came before them, Wyatt and Carpenter, we can only assume that Stone\u2019s fear and reservedness increased tremendously. ",
        "Summary_2": "Jack Stone is one of the explorers the Major recruits for his expedition. He is hardly twenty-five years old and crewed on the Major\u2019s vulcan explorations. Peter\u2019s assessment of Stone is that he follows the Major around like a puppy and begged to come on the Brightside Crossing. \n\nStone has the important role of bringing the supplies and equipment for their crossing. He receives some information about the inhospitable conditions of the Brightside from Sanders (owner of the Twilight Lab) that dejects him and makes him nervous about their trip. Stone has the important role of dragging the sleds of supplies during their crossing. He does not irritate the rest of the team, but instead grows more quiet and apprehensive with each day.\n\nThe reader doesn\u2019t know whether he survived the attempted crossing or what he did afterwards.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Jack Stone is a young man of about twenty-five who is part of the Brightside Crossing team. He had worked with Major Makuta at Vulcan and pleaded with him to be part of the Brightside mission. Claney theorizes that he doesn\u2019t care as much about exploring as he does Mikuta, who he sees as a kind of god and follows around. He arrives to Twilight Lab a few days before Claney and Mikuta to be briefed by Sanderson, and brings the supplies and equipment for the mission with him. By the time the other two arrive, Jack seems somewhat despondent based on what Sanderson has told him about the difficulties and improbability of the mission. Jack is assigned to flank Peter on the mission, along with Mikuta, but agrees to switch positions with McIvers and pull the sledges instead. This seems like something McIvers had pushed for in a previous conversation, but Jack says he doesn\u2019t mind and Mikuta agrees to the switch. As the mission goes on, Claney notices that, unlike McIvers, Jack gets quieter and more reserved as he grows more apprehensive. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Jack Stone is the youngest member of The Brightside Crossing team. He is about 25 years old, and he looks to Major Tom Mikuta as a mentor. They worked together on Venus, and that\u2019s where he discovered that Major would be making the trip across The Brightside. Stone begged Major to let him go along, even though it appears that he\u2019s very nervous about the trip. When Sanderson, The Twilight Lab manager, tells Stone about what The Brightside is really like, Stone nearly cries from fear. He gets the equipment all ready and helps to prepare the team for the treacherous trip. \nStone has never met McIvers before, but the two become fast friends. McIvers is able to easily manipulate Stone into switching roles with him. He wants to be more mobile, so he tells Stone that he should drag the sledges instead. Stone acquiesces without a fight. \nThroughout the trip, Stone becomes quiet and stoic. He is a young guy and isn\u2019t prepared to die on this trip. He responds to the difficult terrain and uncertainties with silence. \n",
        "Article": "The Twilight Lab, near the northern pole of Mercury, was theobvious jumping-off place. The setup there wasn\u2019t very extensive\u2014arocket landing, the labs and quarters for Sanderson\u2019screw sunk deep into the crust, and the tower that housedthe Solar \u2019scope that Sanderson had built up there ten yearsbefore.     Twilight Lab wasn\u2019t particularly interested in the Brightside,of course\u2014the Sun was Sanderson\u2019s baby and he\u2019d pickedMercury as the closest chunk of rock to the Sun that couldhold his observatory. He\u2019d chosen a good location, too. OnMercury, the Brightside temperature hits 770\u00b0 F. at perihelionand the Darkside runs pretty constant at -410\u00b0 F. No permanentinstallation with a human crew could survive at eitherextreme. But with Mercury\u2019s wobble, the twilight zone betweenBrightside and Darkside offers something closer to survivaltemperatures.     Sanderson built the Lab up near the pole, where the zoneis about five miles wide, so the temperature only varies 50 to60 degrees with the libration. The Solar \u2019scope could take thatmuch change and they\u2019d get good clear observation of the Sunfor about seventy out of the eighty-eight days it takes the planetto wheel around.     The Major was counting on Sanderson knowing somethingabout Mercury as well as the Sun when we camped at the Labto make final preparations.     Sanderson did. He thought we\u2019d lost our minds and he saidso, but he gave us all the help he could. He spent a weekbriefing Jack Stone, the third member of our party, who hadarrived with the supplies and equipment a few days earlier.Poor Jack met us at the rocket landing almost bawling, Sandersonhad given him such a gloomy picture of what Brightsidewas like.     Stone was a youngster\u2014hardly twenty-five, I\u2019d say\u2014buthe\u2019d been with the Major at Vulcan and had begged to jointhis trek. I had a funny feeling that Jack really didn\u2019t care forexploring too much, but he thought Mikuta was God, followedhim around like a puppy.     It didn\u2019t matter to me as long as he knew what he was gettingin for. You don\u2019t go asking people in this game why they do it\u2014they\u2019reliable to get awfully uneasy and none of them canever give you an answer that makes sense. Anyway, Stone hadborrowed three men from the Lab, and had the supplies andequipment all lined up when we got there, ready to checkand test.     We dug right in. With plenty of funds\u2014tri-V money andsome government cash the Major had talked his way around\u2014ourequipment was new and good. Mikuta had done the designingand testing himself, with a big assist from Sanderson.We had four Bugs, three of them the light pillow-tire models,with special lead-cooled cut-in engines when the heat set in,and one heavy-duty tractor model for pulling the sledges.     The Major went over them like a kid at the circus. Then hesaid, \u201cHave you heard anything from McIvers?\u201d     \u201cWho\u2019s he?\u201d Stone wanted to know.     \u201cHe\u2019ll be joining us. He\u2019s a good man\u2014got quite a namefor climbing, back home.\u201d The Major turned to me. \u201cYou\u2019veprobably heard of him.\u201d     I\u2019d heard plenty of stories about Ted McIvers and I wasn\u2019ttoo happy to hear that he was joining us. \u201cKind of a daredevil,isn\u2019t he?\u201d     \u201cMaybe. He\u2019s lucky and skillful. Where do you draw theline? We\u2019ll need plenty of both.\u201d     \u201cHave you ever worked with him?\u201d I asked.     \u201cNo. Are you worried?\u201d     \u201cNot exactly. But Brightside is no place to count on luck.\u201d     The Major laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to worry aboutMcIvers. We understood each other when I talked up thetrip to him and we\u2019re going to need each other too much todo any fooling around.\u201d He turned back to the supply list.\u201cMeanwhile, let\u2019s get this stuff listed and packed. We\u2019ll needto cut weight sharply and our time is short. Sanderson sayswe should leave in three days.\u201d     Two days later, McIvers hadn\u2019t arrived. The Major didn\u2019tsay much about it.

That evening,Stone and McIvers were thick as thieves, and everything wasset for an early departure after we got some rest.   <doc-sep> We jumped off from Twilight on a course due southeastwith thirty days to make it to the Center of Brightside. If wecould cross an average of seventy miles a day, we could hitCenter exactly at perihelion, the point of Mercury\u2019s closestapproach to the Sun\u2014which made Center the hottest part ofthe planet at the hottest it ever gets.     The Sun was already huge and yellow over the horizonwhen we started, twice the size it appears on Earth. Every daythat Sun would grow bigger and whiter, and every day thesurface would get hotter. But once we reached Center, the jobwas only half done\u2014we would still have to travel anothertwo thousand miles to the opposite twilight zone. Sandersonwas to meet us on the other side in the Laboratory\u2019s scout ship,approximately sixty days from the time we jumped off.     That was the plan, in outline. It was up to us to cross thoseseventy miles a day, no matter how hot it became, no matterwhat terrain we had to cross. Detours would be dangerous andtime-consuming. Delays could cost us our lives. We all knewthat.     The Major briefed us on details an hour before we left.\u201cPeter, you\u2019ll take the lead Bug, the small one we strippeddown for you. Stone and I will flank you on either side, givingyou a hundred-yard lead. McIvers, you\u2019ll have the job ofdragging the sledges, so we\u2019ll have to direct your course prettyclosely. Peter\u2019s job is to pick the passage at any given point.If there\u2019s any doubt of safe passage, we\u2019ll all explore aheadon foot before we risk the Bugs. Got that?\u201d     McIvers and Stone exchanged glances. McIvers said: \u201cJackand I were planning to change around. We figured he couldtake the sledges. That would give me a little more mobility.\u201d     The Major looked up sharply at Stone. \u201cDo you buy that,Jack?\u201d     Stone shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t mind. Mac wanted\u2014\u201d     McIvers made an impatient gesture with his hands. \u201cItdoesn\u2019t matter. I just feel better when I\u2019m on the move. Doesit make any difference?\u201d     \u201cI guess it doesn\u2019t,\u201d said the Major. \u201cThen you\u2019ll flankPeter along with me. Right?\u201d     \u201cSure, sure.\u201d McIvers pulled at his lower lip. \u201cWho\u2019s goingto do the advance scouting?\u201d     \u201cIt sounds like I am,\u201d I cut in. \u201cWe want to keep the leadBug light as possible.\u201d     Mikuta nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Peter\u2019s Bug is stripped downto the frame and wheels.\u201d     McIvers shook his head. \u201cNo, I mean the      advance     work.You need somebody out ahead\u2014four or five miles, at least\u2014topick up the big flaws and active surface changes, don\u2019t you?\u201dHe stared at the Major. \u201cI mean, how can we tell what sort ofa hole we may be moving into, unless we have a scout upahead?\u201d     \u201cThat\u2019s what we have the charts for,\u201d the Major saidsharply.     \u201cCharts! I\u2019m talking about      detail     work. We don\u2019t need toworry about the major topography. It\u2019s the little faults youcan\u2019t see on the pictures that can kill us.\u201d He tossed the chartsdown excitedly. \u201cLook, let me take a Bug out ahead and workreconnaissance, keep five, maybe ten miles ahead of the column.I can stay on good solid ground, of course, but scan thearea closely and radio back to Peter where to avoid the flaws.Then\u2014\u201d     \u201cNo dice,\u201d the Major broke in.     \u201cBut why not? We could save ourselves days!\u201d     \u201cI don\u2019t care what we could save. We stay together. Whenwe get to the Center, I want live men along with me. Thatmeans we stay within easy sight of each other at all times. Anyclimber knows that everybody is safer in a party than one manalone\u2014any time, any place.\u201d     McIvers stared at him, his cheeks an angry red. Finally hegave a sullen nod. \u201cOkay. If you say so.\u201d     \u201cWell, I say so and I mean it. I don\u2019t want any fancy stuff.We\u2019re going to hit Center together, and finish the Crossing together.Got that?\u201d     McIvers nodded. Mikuta then looked at Stone and me andwe nodded, too.     \u201cAll right,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve got it straight,let\u2019s go.\u201d     It was hot. If I forget everything else about that trek, I\u2019llnever forget that huge yellow Sun glaring down, without abreak, hotter and hotter with every mile. We knew that thefirst few days would be the easiest and we were rested andfresh when we started down the long ragged gorge southeast ofthe Twilight Lab.     I moved out first; back over my shoulder, I could see theMajor and McIvers crawling out behind me, their pillow tirestaking the rugged floor of the gorge smoothly. Behind them,Stone dragged the sledges.     Even at only 30 per cent Earth gravity they were a strain onthe big tractor, until the ski-blades bit into the fluffy volcanicash blanketing the valley. We even had a path to follow forthe first twenty miles.     I kept my eyes pasted to the big polaroid binocs, picking outthe track the early research teams had made out into the edgeof Brightside. But in a couple of hours we rumbled past Sanderson\u2019slittle outpost observatory and the tracks stopped. Wewere in virgin territory and already the Sun was beginning tobite.     We didn\u2019t      feel     the heat so much those first days out. We      saw     it. The refrig units kept our skins at a nice comfortable seventy-fivedegrees Fahrenheit inside our suits, but our eyes watchedthat glaring Sun and the baked yellow rocks going past, andsome nerve pathways got twisted up, somehow. We pouredsweat as if we were in a superheated furnace.     We drove eight hours and slept five. When a sleep periodcame due, we pulled the Bugs together into a square, threw upa light aluminum sun-shield and lay out in the dust and rocks.The sun-shield cut the temperature down sixty or seventydegrees, for whatever help that was. And then we ate from theforward sledge\u2014sucking through tubes\u2014protein, carbohydrates,bulk gelatin, vitamins.     The Major measured water out with an iron hand, becausewe\u2019d have drunk ourselves into nephritis in a week otherwise.We were constantly, unceasingly thirsty. Ask the physiologistsand psychiatrists why\u2014they can give you have a dozen interestingreasons\u2014but all we knew, or cared about, was that ithappened to be so.     We didn\u2019t sleep the first few stops, as a consequence. Oureyes burned in spite of the filters and we had roaring headaches,but we couldn\u2019t sleep them off. We sat around lookingat each other. Then McIvers would say how good a beer wouldtaste, and off we\u2019d go. We\u2019d have murdered our grandmothersfor one ice-cold bottle of beer.     After a few driving periods, I began to get my bearings atthe wheel. We were moving down into desolation that madeEarth\u2019s old Death Valley look like a Japanese rose garden.Huge sun-baked cracks opened up in the floor of the gorge,with black cliffs jutting up on either side; the air was filledwith a barely visible yellowish mist of sulfur and sulfurousgases.     It was a hot, barren hole, no place for any man to go, butthe challenge was so powerful you could almost feel it. No onehad ever crossed this land before and escaped. Those who hadtried it had been cruelly punished, but the land was still there,so it had to be crossed. Not the easy way. It had to be crossedthe hardest way possible: overland, through anything the landcould throw up to us, at the most difficult time possible.     Yet we knew that even the land might have been conqueredbefore, except for that Sun. We\u2019d fought absolute cold beforeand won. We\u2019d never fought heat like this and won. The onlyworse heat in the Solar System was the surface of the Sunitself.     Brightside was worth trying for. We would get it or it wouldget us. That was the bargain.     I learned a lot about Mercury those first few driving periods.The gorge petered out after a hundred miles and we movedonto the slope of a range of ragged craters that ran south andeast. This range had shown no activity since the first landingon Mercury forty years before, but beyond it there were activecones. Yellow fumes rose from the craters constantly; theirsides were shrouded with heavy ash.     We couldn\u2019t detect a wind, but we knew there was a hot,sulfurous breeze sweeping in great continental tides across theface of the planet. Not enough for erosion, though. The cratersrose up out of jagged gorges, huge towering spears of rock andrubble. Below were the vast yellow flatlands, smoking and hissingfrom the gases beneath the crust. Over everything was graydust\u2014silicates and salts, pumice and limestone and graniteash, filling crevices and declivities\u2014offering a soft, treacheroussurface for the Bug\u2019s pillow tires.     I learned to read the ground, to tell a covered fault by thesag of the dust; I learned to spot a passable crack, and tell itfrom an impassable cut. Time after time the Bugs ground toa halt while we explored a passage on foot, tied together withlight copper cable, digging, advancing, digging some moreuntil we were sure the surface would carry the machines. Itwas cruel work; we slept in exhaustion. But it went smoothly,at first.     Too smoothly, it seemed to me, and the others seemed tothink so, too.     McIvers\u2019 restlessness was beginning to grate on our nerves.He talked too much, while we were resting or while we weredriving; wisecracks, witticisms, unfunny jokes that wore thinwith repetition. He took to making side trips from the routenow and then, never far, but a little further each time.     Jack Stone reacted quite the opposite; he grew quieter witheach stop, more reserved and apprehensive. I didn\u2019t like it, butI figured that it would pass off after a while. I was apprehensiveenough myself; I just managed to hide it better.     And every mile the Sun got bigger and whiter and higher inthe sky and hotter. Without our ultra-violet screens and glarefilters we would have been blinded; as it was our eyes achedconstantly and the skin on our faces itched and tingled at theend of an eight-hour trek.     But it took one of those side trips of McIvers\u2019 to deliver thepenultimate blow to our already fraying nerves. He had drivendown a side-branch of a long canyon running off west of ourroute and was almost out of sight in a cloud of ash when weheard a sharp cry through our earphones.     I wheeled my Bug around with my heart in my throat andspotted him through the binocs, waving frantically from thetop of his machine. The Major and I took off, lumbering downthe gulch after him as fast as the Bugs could go, with a thousandhorrible pictures racing through our minds....     We found him standing stock-still, pointing down the gorgeand, for once, he didn\u2019t have anything to say. It was the wreckof a Bug; an old-fashioned half-track model of the sort thathadn\u2019t been in use for years. It was wedged tight in a cut inthe rock, an axle broken, its casing split wide open up themiddle, half-buried in a rock slide. A dozen feet away weretwo insulated suits with white bones gleaming through thefiberglass helmets.     This was as far as Wyatt and Carpenter had gotten on      their     Brightside Crossing.   <doc-sep> I\u2019d been interested in the Brightside for almost as long asI can remember (Claney said). I guess I was about ten whenWyatt and Carpenter made the last attempt\u2014that was in 2082,I think. I followed the news stories like a tri-V serial and thenI was heartbroken when they just disappeared.     I know now that they were a pair of idiots, starting off withoutproper equipment, with practically no knowledge of surfaceconditions, without any charts\u2014they couldn\u2019t have madea hundred miles\u2014but I didn\u2019t know that then and it was aterrible tragedy. After that, I followed Sanderson\u2019s work in theTwilight Lab up there and began to get Brightside into myblood, sure as death.     But it was Mikuta\u2019s idea to attempt a Crossing. Did you everknow Tom Mikuta? I don\u2019t suppose you did. No, not Japanese\u2014Polish-American.He was a major in the Interplanetary Servicefor some years and hung onto the title after he gave uphis commission.     He was with Armstrong on Mars during his Service days,did a good deal of the original mapping and surveying forthe Colony there. I first met him on Venus; we spent fiveyears together up there doing some of the nastiest exploringsince the Matto Grasso. Then he made the attempt on VulcanCrater that paved the way for Balmer a few years later.     I\u2019d always liked the Major\u2014he was big and quiet and cool,the sort of guy who always had things figured a little furtherahead than anyone else and always knew what to do in a tightplace. Too many men in this game are all nerve and luck,with no judgment. The Major had both. He also had the kindof personality that could take a crew of wild men andmake them work like a well-oiled machine across a thousandmiles of Venus jungle. I liked him and I trusted him.     He contacted me in New York and he was very casual atfirst. We spent an evening here at the Red Lion, talking aboutold times; he told me about the Vulcan business, and how he\u2019dbeen out to see Sanderson and the Twilight Lab on Mercury,and how he preferred a hot trek to a cold one any day of theyear\u2014and then he wanted to know what I\u2019d been doing sinceVenus and what my plans were.     \u201cNo particular plans,\u201d I told him. \u201cWhy?\u201d     He looked me over. \u201cHow much do you weigh, Peter?\u201d     I told him one-thirty-five.     \u201cThat much!\u201d he said. \u201cWell, there can\u2019t be much fat onyou, at any rate. How do you take heat?\u201d     \u201cYou should know,\u201d I said. \u201cVenus was no icebox.\u201d     \u201cNo, I mean      real     heat.\u201d     Then I began to get it. \u201cYou\u2019re planning a trip.\u201d     \u201cThat\u2019s right. A hot trip.\u201d He grinned at me. \u201cMight bedangerous, too.\u201d     \u201cWhat trip?\u201d     \u201cBrightside of Mercury,\u201d the Major said.     I whistled cautiously. \u201cAt aphelion?\u201d     He threw his head back. \u201cWhy try a Crossing at aphelion?What have you done then? Four thousand miles of butcherousheat, just to have some joker come along, use your data anddrum you out of the glory by crossing at perihelion forty-fourdays later? No, thanks. I want the Brightside without any nonsenseabout it.\u201d He leaned across me eagerly. \u201cI want to makea Crossing at perihelion and I want to cross on the surface. Ifa man can do that, he\u2019s got Mercury. Until then,      nobody\u2019s     gotMercury. I want Mercury\u2014but I\u2019ll need help getting it.\u201d     I\u2019d thought of it a thousand times and never dared considerit. Nobody had, since Wyatt and Carpenter disappeared. Mercuryturns on its axis in the same time that it wheels aroundthe Sun, which means that the Brightside is always facing in.That makes the Brightside of Mercury at perihelion the hottestplace in the Solar System, with one single exception: thesurface of the Sun itself.     It would be a hellish trek. Only a few men had ever learnedjust      how     hellish and they never came back to tell about it. Itwas a real hell\u2019s Crossing, but someday, I thought, somebodywould cross it.     I wanted to be along.  "

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in DOUBLE TROUBLE?",
        "Summary_1": "The mining for a precious ore called Acoustix has spurred colonization of Jupiter\u2019s eighth moon by two mining companies called Interstellar Voice and Larynx Incorporated. There is a barren desert landscape between the mining areas of the two companies that is called the Baldric. The only plant appears to be trees that have melon-shaped tops, and the only animal is a silver parrot-like bird that is capable of imitating human speech, and also of imitating human forms in a holographic-like manner.\n\nGrannie Annie (AKA Annabella C. Flowers) is a famous science fiction writer, who is travelling to the Baldric with her martian employee, Xartal, who takes detailed drawings that are the background research for her next novel. She is travelling in a party of four: herself, Xartal, Ezra Karn (old prospector), and the narrator (called Billy-boy by Grannie).\n\nStrange happenings are known to occur in the Baldric. They encounter a silver bird that repeats English words and creates what seems like a mirage of themselves projected in the distance which disappears as it comes closer. They do not know at the time, but the parrot has created this mirage based on viewing one of the lifelike drawings that Xartal is making of the group.\n\nThey happen to run into Jimmy Baker, the manager of the Larynx Incorporated mining company, who is interested in Grannie\u2019s help sorting out the root cause of his workers coming down with \u201cred spot fever\u201d which causes them to leave their work and walk into the Baldric, never to return. They travel to Larynx Incorporated\u2019s offices with Jimmy, where he learns all of the workers from Shaft Four have left their posts due to the fever. Coincidentally, that is also their most productive ore location. Jimmy, Grannie, and Xartal take off to Shaft Four via the Baldric to investigate what is going on. During their travel, they break for camp near a flock of the birds and discover their ability to imitate human forms.\n\nAntlers Karn, the manager of Interstellar Voice, turns out to be a bad guy who ambushes Grannie\u2019s camp. He is trying to sabotage Jimmy\u2019s company by causing the red spot fever to stop them from capitalizing on a huge deposit of Acoustix they discovered in Shaft Four. He steals Jimmy\u2019s car and kidnaps a mirage-version of Grannie. Billy and Ezra chase them down and discover Antlers has stranded their friends in a valley thirty miles away. \n\nGrannie has independently solved the mystery of the Red Spot Fever and sending her mirage with Antlers was part of her master plan. When Billy and Ezra return to her, Jimmy is projecting ultra-violet light onto a large group of the Shaft Four workers in a deep valley gorge. This counteracts the infra-red radiation that put them into a trance-like state that caused them to wander into the desert.\n\nGrannie, Jimmy, Xartal, Billy, and Ezra are triumphantly returning the workers to Shaft Four at the close of the story.\n",
        "Summary_2": "The story starts three days into an expedition on Jupiter's Eighth Moon, led by Annabella C. Flowers, a science fiction author, known by her friends as Grannie Annie. Also in the group were some of her friends: the narrator Billy, the prospector Ezra Karn, and the Martian illustrator named Xartal. The moon was known for Acoustix, an ore that allows aging Martians to improve their supersonic telecommunication abilities. They traveled through the desert to an area called the Baldric, which was filled with cat-tail-like trees and silver cockatoo-like creatures. Antlers Park, the manager of Interstellar Voice (an Acoustix mining company) had told them about the area. As they continued on, the group had a shock: they saw duplicates of themselves traveling toward them. It was not a simple mirage, as they could hear the others talking. Once they got close, however, the doubles disappeared. Shaking off the odd situation, the group continued, and eventually ran into Jimmy Baker, the manager of Larynx Incorporated, the competitors of Interstellar Voice. It seemed Jimmy needed Grannie's help: his workers at the mine had been falling sick with Red Spot Fever, which made them wander into the Baldric. The group headed to the Larynx Incorporated offices, where Jimmy admitted that calling off the mining expedition would mean the end of Jimmy's company, so he needed to combat the Fever. Grannie grabbed supplies from Jimmy's laboratory and they headed to the desert with Xartal. Ezra and Billy stayed to look around the offices, and briefly talked to Antlers Park on the visiphone. He had less issue with the Fever, but had an antitoxin that he was willing to share with Jimmy. Through a camera on Jimmy's car, Billy was able to watch the group in the desert as another set of mirages appeared. Grannie excitedly realized that the cockatoos on the moon were copying Xartal's drawings, mimicking the mental images and causing these \"mirages\". Ezra and Billy headed to Jimmy's office to investigate reports, realizing that everyone fell sick in the barracks, not while mining. They found a lens in the barracks that was pushing concentrated rays towards the workers, so they ran to the visiscreen room to find out where Grannie was. They were surprised to see Antlers Park was the only person in the car with Grannie, Jimmy and Xartal nowhere to be seen. Ezra and Billy drove out to meet them, where Billy realized this was a cockatoo and not the actual Grannie. Antlers Park eventually gave up the information about where he had left Grannie and the others, and when Billy and Ezra found them, Grannie showed them the blue ultraviolet light that had been set up to counteract the red rays that cause the fever. It seemed that the lens amplifying the rays to cause the fever was placed in Jimmy's company's barracks by Antlers' company, and the Red Spot Fever was a plan to keep Jimmy's company from becoming more successful than Antlers'.  ",
        "Summary_3": "Annabella C. Flowers, known as Grannie Annie, is a famed science fiction writer who summons the story's narrator, Billy, to join her on a mission to the 8th moon of Jupiter, where she ostensibly plans to observe the setting for her next novel. She also invites her constant companion, a prospector name Ezra Karn, and her illustrator, a Martian named Xartal. On the moon, the team unites at the offices of Interstellar Voice, a company managed by Antlers Park. Upon Billy's arrival, Antlers updates him on the history of the company; Interstellar Voice and their rival company Larynx Incorporated mine the moon for its resource of an ore called Acoustix, which is popular amongst Martians because of its ability to revitalize their supersonic vocalizations that dwindle around middle age. Between the properties of these two companies stretches a vast desert known as the Baldric, which is home to a bird-like species resembling cockatoos as well as flagpole trees. Grannie Annie plans to cross in order to further observe the moon's environment and make way to Larynx Incorporated. Antlers Park warns them vaguely of danger in the Baldric, but the team leaves anyway. During the course of their journey, they observe the cockatoos and discover their ability to mimic human voices. In addition, they discover an alarming visage--from their perch atop a high cliff, they see four travelers, seemingly themselves in exact 3D duplicate, walking along the same path they'd just traversed. After this odd discovery, they meet Jimmy Baker, who arrives in his car guided through the air attached to a kite, and Grannie Annie reveals the true purpose of their trip is to help Jimmy resolve the labor issues at his company, Larynx Incorporated. His workers have been stricken with Red-Spot Fever, which causes them to abandon their job and walk into the desert; Jimmy worries this will destroy his business. After Grannie Annie, Xartal, and Jimmy Baker leave to tour his company's laboratory and Shaft Four, Billy and Ezra stay behind and tour the offices of Larynx Incorporated. An employee shows them an updated visiphone from which they can view Grannie Annie's journey, and they witness them stopping by a cockatoo nest, where a cockatoo observes Xartal's drawings and uses its ability to mentally mimic images to recreate his drawings of the team in 3D just as they saw previously in the desert. When Billy and Ezra discover a device in the workers' bunker that has been used to spread Red-Spot Fever and see Grannie Annie is returning with Antlers Park, they rush to meet them. Billy realizes this isn\u2019t the real Grannie Annie, but rather her 3D image, and they hurry to stop Antlers Park. After a chase, Antlers admits he set up the Red-Spot device in order to sabotage his business rival. When they reunite with Annie, she and Jimmy and Xartal are using ultra-violet rays to combat the infra-red rays that ignited the Red-Spot Fever in order to draw them back to Larynx Incorporated.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Grannie Annie, Ezra Karn, and Billy-Boy are on Jupiter\u2019s Eighth Moon. Xartal, a Martian, is also there to draw illustrations for Grannie Annie\u2019s book. The group meets with Antlers Park, the manager of Interstellar Voice, and he tells them about the Baldric, a stretch of land that connects his company, Interstellar Voice, with Larynx Incorporated. The two companies are competing to harvest Acoustix. Acoustix is an ore that amplifies Martians\u2019 thoughts so that they can continue to speak to Earthmen even in their old age when their ability to produce vibrations diminishes. Park warns that the Baldric is dangerous, but Annie is undeterred. \n\nAnnie, Ezra, Billy, and Xartal arrive at the Baldric and spot a cockatoo. Xartal draws the creature and the group members in his notebook. Moments later, Annie spots four figures that look just like herself and her crew members walking on the other side of the hill. The apparent mirage disappears quickly.\n\nBilly sees a kite car, and minutes later Jimmy Baker, the manager of Larynx Incorporated, approaches the group. His company is in trouble because a lot of its workers have come down with Red Spot Fever. The workers become talkative and then they walk out into the Baldric. Annie, Jimmy, and Xartal head out to investigate. Billy and Ezra stay behind, and they check out an invention of Jimmy\u2019s - a three-dimensional screen that makes them feel like they\u2019re right there with their group members. They speak to Park on the contraption, and he says that he will give Jimmy the antidote to Red Spot Fever. Billy spots his own likeness on the screen, and he\u2019s shocked. Annie tells the others that the cockatoos are looking at Xartal\u2019s drawings and projecting their mental images of his pictures. \n\nBilly realizes that all of the workers become sick when they\u2019re in their barracks, not when they\u2019re in the mines. At the barracks, Ezra finds a piece of metal with a lens on the wall. The infra-red rays from Jupiter are causing the plague; the lens was put there to amplify those rays, and they sicken the sleeping workers. \n\nBilly and Ezra return to the screen and see Park driving a kite car with Annie by his side.  While the men follow Park\u2019s car, he tries to shoot at them. He fails, and Ezra uses a tool to grab Park by the throat. Billy and Ezra find Annie and hundreds of Jimmy\u2019s workers. The group has set up a large ultraviolet light that works to fight the infra-red rays that cause the fever. It was Park all along who was forcing the men to become sick because he did not want Jimmy\u2019s company to be competitive. Park had tried to get Grannie Annie sick as well, but he ended up taking her duplicate image in the kite car instead of the real one. \n",

        "Summary_1": "In the buildings of Interstellar Voice and Larynx Incorporated, two Acoustix ore mining companies on Jupiter\u2019s eighth moon.\n\nThe Baldric - the largely deserted space between the mining grounds of Interstellar Voice and Larynx Incorporated. It is a desert-like place with trees that are trunks with melon-shaped tops, and silver birds that can repeat English phrases as well as mimic human forms that appear like mirages. There is also a deep valley gorge within the desert and many eyries which seem similar to oases.\n\nThere are several scenes aboard kite-propelled cars in the Baldric, as well as visiphone-like video feed of Jimmy\u2019s car that is viewed from the offices of Larynx Incorporated.\n\nShaft Four is one of the locations that Larynx Incorporated mines in on the border of the Baldric, which is talked about often, but is never actually visited by the main characters during the story.\n",
        "Summary_2": "The surface of Jupiter's Eighth Moon is covered in desert with huge trees that look like giant cat-tails, long thin poles with a melon-shaped part on top. It is very windy, which pushes all of the desert sand around a lot. The \"flagpole trees\" mark the edge of the Baldric, an area defined by the trees and a cockatoo-like creature. When Antlers Park said that the area would be trouble, Grannie knew she had to investigate. The Baldric itself acts as a line between the areas controlled by the two mining companies, and the mines themselves are where the work happens. Most of the surface, then, is covered either in sand or rock. The other major location in the story is the headquarters of Larynx Incorporated, which is also on Jupiter's Eighth Moon. In the headquarters, there are barracks for the miners, which have huge windows made of denvo-quartz. There is a commissary where people can eat, and a number of administrative areas such as Jimmy's office, and a large visiscreen room where the characters at the headquarters are able to track the movements of the part of the group that left to investigate Red Spot Fever. ",
        "Summary_3": "The primary action of the story takes place on Jupiter's Eighth Moon, where Grannie Annie assembles a team to help Jimmy Baker resolve the labor issues at his company, Larynx Incorporated. Although the team assembles at the headquarters of Jimmy's rival company, Interstellar Voice, they never go inside, and immediately make their way across a vast, desert-like area known as the Baldric. The manager of Interstellar Voice, Antlers Park, warns them of threats in the Baldric, but they never run into any such danger. Instead, they observe two of the Baldric's most unique characteristics: The flagpole trees that look like vertical cat tails topped with a melon-like protuberance and the bird-like creatures resembling cockatoos that build large, transparent, web-like nests between them. The cockatoos are silver and look like parrots with a crest and have the unique ability to mimic not only the sounds of a person's voice but also the 3D image of their visage in exact duplicate. As the team makes their way across the desert, they are pelted by wind and powdery sand and climb a high ridge from which they are picked up by Jimmy Baker flying his kite-guided car. These vehicles appear to be the main mode of transportation for representatives of both companies on the moon. The final unique setting of the story is Larynx Incorporated, which is comprised of offices and crew bunkers in a large central building, several mining shafts spread throughout the Baldric, a laboratory, a commissary, and an experimental shop. From one of the many offices in the building, an operator shows Billy and Ezra an update to the visiphone that allows viewers to witness 3D events remotely. Later, Billy and Ezra examine the barracks, housed in a low, rectangular building with a dome roof.",
        "Summary_4": "\u201cDouble Trouble\u201d takes place on the Eighth Moon of Jupiter. Two companies, Interstellar Voice, and Larynx Incorporated are at war with each other to harvest the most Acoustix ore. The companies are located about 10 miles away from each other, and in between them is a space called the Baldric. The Baldric is covered with Flagpole trees. They stand straight up and have a bulbous fruit or vegetable that grows out of the very top. The entire surface is covered in sand, and wind is an ever-present feature of the atmosphere. There are also hundreds of birds that look a lot like cockatoos. The birds look at Xartal\u2019s drawings and then project those images out of their minds. This makes it appear like there are two Grannie Annies or two Billys, when there is really just one. The cockatoos\u2019 ability to project images is similar to their ability to repeat words and phrases that humans say. \n \nThe characters also venture inside of Larynx Incorporated, the company owned by Jimmy Baker. There are offices, glass doors, counting machines, and report tapes there. The offices are where they package the Acoustix ore to ship it to their customers. The most interesting part of Larynx Incorporated is Jimmy\u2019s invention, an improvement on the visiphone called a visiscreen. Viewers can be taken to a location and the three D image that\u2019s created makes it feel like they are there, experiencing everything along with the group. \n",

If anythinghappened to Annabella C. Flowers, I would never forgive myself andneither would her millions of readers.     Ezra Karn and I went back into the office. The old prospector chuckled.     Dang human dynamo. Got more energy than a runaway comet.     A connecting door on the far side of the office opened onto a longcorridor which ended at a staircase.     Let's look around, I said.     We passed down the corridor and climbed the staircase to the secondfloor. Here were the general offices of      Larynx Incorporated     , andthrough glass doors I could see clerks busy with counting machines andreport tapes. In another chamber the extremely light Acoustix ore wasbeing packed into big cases and marked for shipment. At the far end adoor to a small room stood open. Inside a young man was tilted back ina swivel chair before a complicated instrument panel.     C'mon in, he said, seeing us. If you want a look at your friends,here they are.     He flicked a stud, and the entire wall above the panel underwent aslow change of colors. Those colors whirled kaleidescopically, thencoalesced into a three-dimensional scene.     It was a scene of a rapidly unfolding desert country as seen from therear of a kite car. Directly behind the windscreen, backs turned to me,were Jimmy Baker, Grannie, and Xartal. It was as if I were standingdirectly behind them.     It's Mr. Baker's own invention, the operator said. An improvement onthe visiphone.     Do you mean to say you can follow the movements of that car and itspassengers wherever it goes? Can you hear them talk too?     Sure. The operator turned another dial, and Grannie's falsetto voiceentered the room. It stopped abruptly. The machine uses a lot ofpower, the operator said, and as yet we haven't got much.     The cloud of anxiety which had wrapped itself about me disappearedsomewhat as I viewed this device. At least I could now keep myselfposted of Grannie's movements.

        "Query": "How would you describe the dynamic between Jimmy and Grannie in DOUBLE TROUBLE?",
        "Summary_1": "Jimmy Baker is the manager of the Acoustix ore mining company called Larynx Incorporated on Jupiter\u2019s eighth moon. Grannie Annie (AKA Annabella C. Flowers) is a famous science fiction writer, well known for her authentic background research for her novels. She is exploring the eighth moon of Jupiter for her newest novel.\n\nJimmy has knowledge of Grannie\u2019s work and is hoping she can help him solve the mystery of the Red Spot Fever with her excellent problem solving skills. Grannie does not appear to know Jimmy before their meeting in the Baldric. They have a cordial and collaborative relationship through the story that results in solving the mystery.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Jimmy Baker is the director of Larynx Incorporated, one of the companies on Jupiter's Eighth Moon that aims to collect Acoustix ore. Visiting Jimmy was Grannie's primary reason for traveling to the Baldric, and Jimmy seems to need her help. In fact, he thinks she is the only one who might be able to solve his problem. Grannie is excited to help, and is intrigued by the puzzle he has for her. The two of them seem to work well together; Jimmy trusts Grannie to go with him to investigate the issues, and Grannie has some good ideas for him. In the end, they are able to uncover the issue and find a way to help Jimmy's workers. ",
        "Summary_3": "Jimmy Baker is the congenial manager of Larynx Incorporated, and Billy immediately likes him. When Jimmy picks up Grannie Annie and her team in the Baldric, he mentions how relieved he feels to have her there to help him with his labor problems. Jimmy is a realist, and Grannie Annie is a science fiction writer, so his pragmatic thinking and her creativity work well together to put a stop to Antlers Park's plot to sabotage Jimmy's business. Because of her stubborn insistence of carefully observing each setting for her potential novels, Grannie Annie has developed a quick and keen understanding of unusual phenomena she discovers in her travels. This helps her determine the cause of the 3D duplicates of themselves the cockatoos create and also helps her to quickly deduce Antlers' scheme. When Antlers attempts to force the Red-Spot Fever upon Annie, Jimmy, and Xartal, Annie's creativity leads her to pretend to contract the plague, so that Antlers will leave them to enact the rest of his plot. With Antlers gone, Jimmy and Annie work together to develop the plan to remove the windscreen from his kite car and replace it with an ultra-violet radiator that could be used to guide his lost workers back to Larynx Incorporated.",
        "Summary_4": "Jimmy is thankful that Grannie Annie and her friends have come to help him solve the mystery of the Red Spot Fever. His business, Larynx Incorporated, will no longer exist if they can\u2019t find the route cause of the illness. Jimmy needs his workers to stay on task and mine the ore, Acoustix, so that he can sell his product. Without the miners, Interstellar Voice will undoubtedly win the race and Larynx Incorporated will become obsolete. Jimmy explains that he pays his workers well and sends them on a nice vacation every year, so he can\u2019t figure out why they are all walking off the job. \n\nAlthough Antlers Park tries to scare Grannie Annie away from going to the Baldric to help her friend, Grannie Annie isn\u2019t buying what he\u2019s selling. She\u2019s there to research her new novel and help out Jimmy, and nothing is going to stop her from completing her task. It is Grannie Annie\u2019s idea to set up the ultraviolet screen that will counteract the infrared-rays that cause Red Spot Fever, and she does it all to get Jimmy\u2019s workers back to the mines. \n",
        "Article": "Not until they had vanished in the desert haze did I sense theloneliness of this outpost. With that loneliness came a sudden sense offoreboding. Had I been a fool to let Grannie go? I thought of her, anold woman who should be in a rocking chair, knitting socks. If anythinghappened to Annabella C. Flowers, I would never forgive myself andneither would her millions of readers.     Ezra Karn and I went back into the office. The old prospector chuckled.     Dang human dynamo. Got more energy than a runaway comet.     A connecting door on the far side of the office opened onto a longcorridor which ended at a staircase.     Let's look around, I said.     We passed down the corridor and climbed the staircase to the secondfloor. Here were the general offices of      Larynx Incorporated     , andthrough glass doors I could see clerks busy with counting machines andreport tapes. In another chamber the extremely light Acoustix ore wasbeing packed into big cases and marked for shipment. At the far end adoor to a small room stood open. Inside a young man was tilted back ina swivel chair before a complicated instrument panel.     C'mon in, he said, seeing us. If you want a look at your friends,here they are.     He flicked a stud, and the entire wall above the panel underwent aslow change of colors. Those colors whirled kaleidescopically, thencoalesced into a three-dimensional scene.     It was a scene of a rapidly unfolding desert country as seen from therear of a kite car. Directly behind the windscreen, backs turned to me,were Jimmy Baker, Grannie, and Xartal. It was as if I were standingdirectly behind them.     It's Mr. Baker's own invention, the operator said. An improvement onthe visiphone.     Do you mean to say you can follow the movements of that car and itspassengers wherever it goes? Can you hear them talk too?     Sure. The operator turned another dial, and Grannie's falsetto voiceentered the room. It stopped abruptly. The machine uses a lot ofpower, the operator said, and as yet we haven't got much.     The cloud of anxiety which had wrapped itself about me disappearedsomewhat as I viewed this device. At least I could now keep myselfposted of Grannie's movements.     Karn and I went down to the commissary where we ate our supper. Whenwe returned to Jimmy Baker's office, the visiphone bell was ringing.I went over to it and turned it on, and to my surprise the face ofAntlers Park flashed on the screen.     Hello, he said in his friendly way. I see you arrived all right. IsMiss Flowers there?     Miss Flowers left with Mr. Baker for Shaft Four, I said. There'strouble up there. Red spot fever.     Fever, eh? repeated Park. That's a shame. Is there anything I cando?     Tell me, I said, has your company had any trouble with this plague?     A little. But up until yesterday the fever's been confined to theother side of the Baldric. We had one partial case, but my chemistsgave the chap an antitoxin that seems to have worked. Come to think ofit, I might drive over to Shaft Four and give Jimmy Baker the formula.I haven't been out in the Baldric for years, but if you didn't have anytrouble, I shouldn't either.     We exchanged a few more pleasantries, and then he rang off. In exactlyan hour I went upstairs to the visiscreen room.     Then once more I was directly behind my friends, listening in on theirconversation. The view through the windscreen showed an irregular arrayof flagpole trees, with the sky dotted by high-flying cockatoos.     There's an eyrie over there, Jimmy Baker was saying. We might aswell camp beside it.   <doc-sep> I leaped into the driver's seat and gave the kite its head. And now thecountry began to undergo a subtle change. The trees seemed to groupthemselves in a long flanking corridor in a northwesterly direction, asif to hide some secret that lay beyond. Twice I attempted to penetratethat wall, only to find my way blocked by those curious growths.     Then a corridor opened before me; a mile forward and the desert beganagain. But it was a new desert this time: the sand packed hard asgranite, the way ahead utterly devoid of vegetation. In the distanceblack bulging hills extended to right and left, with a narrow chasm ordoorway between.     I headed for that entrance, and when I reached it, I shut off powerwith an exclamation of astonishment.     There was a huge chair-shaped rock there, and seated upon it wasGrannie Annie. She had a tablet in her hands, and she was writing.     Grannie! I yelled. What're you doing here? Where's Mr. Baker?     She rose to her feet and clambered down the rock.     Getting back Jimmy's mine laborers, she said, a twinkle in her eyes.I see you've got Antlers Park. I'm glad of that. It saves me a lot oftrouble. She took off her spectacles and wiped them on her sleeve.Don't look so fuddled, Billy-boy. Come along, and I'll show you.     She led the way through the narrow passage into the valley. A deepgorge, it was, with the black sheer cliffs on either side pressingclose. Ten feet forward, I stopped short, staring in amazement.     Advancing toward me like a column of infantry came a long line ofLarynx miners. They walked slowly, looking straight ahead, moving downthe center of the gorge toward the entrance.     But there was more! A kite car was drawn up to the side. The windscreenhad been removed, and mounted on the hood was a large bullet-likecontrivance that looked not unlike a search lamp. A blinding shaft ofbluish radiance spewed from its open end. Playing it back and forthupon the marching men were Jimmy Baker and Xartal, the Martian.     Ultra violet, Grannie Annie explained. The opposite end of thevibratory scale and the only thing that will combat the infra-red raysthat cause red spot fever. Those men won't stop walking until they'vereached Shaft Four.     Grannie Annie told her story during the long ride back to Shaft Four.We drove slowly, keeping the line of marching Larynx miners alwaysahead of us.     Jimmy Baker had struck a new big lode of Acoustix, a lode which ifworked successfully would see      Larynx Incorporated     become a far morepowerful exporting concern than      Interstellar Voice     . Antlers Parkdidn't want that.     It was he or his agents who placed those lens buttons in the Larynxbarracks.      For he knew that just as Jupiter's great spot wasresponsible for a climate and atmosphere suitable for an Earthman onthis Eighth Moon, so also was that spot a deadly power in itself,capable when its rays were concentrated of causing a fatal sickness.       Then suddenly becoming fearful of Grannie's prying, Antlers Park stroveto head her off before she reached Shaft Four.     He did head her off and managed to lure her and Baker and Xartal intothe Shaft barracks where they would be exposed to the rays from thelens button. But Grannie only pretended to contract the plague.     Park then attempted to outwit Ezra Karn and me by returning in JimmyBaker's kite car with a cockatoo image of Grannie.   <doc-sep> Jimmy Baker nodded. He told his story over the roar of the wind as weheaded back across the desert. Occasionally he touched a stud on anelectric windlass to which the kite wire was attached. Apparently theseadjustments moved planes or fins on the kite and accounted for thecar's ability to move in any direction.     If I weren't a realist, I'd say that      Larynx Incorporated     has beenbewitched, he began slowly. We pay our men high wages and give themexcellent living conditions with a vacation on Callisto every year.Up until a short time ago most of them were in excellent health andspirits. Then the Red Spot Fever got them.     Red Spot Fever? Grannie looked at him curiously.     Jimmy Baker nodded. The first symptoms are a tendency to garrulousnesson the part of the patient. Then they disappear.     He paused to make an adjustment of the windlass.     They walk out into the Baldric, he continued, and nothing can stopthem. We tried following them, of course, but it was no go. As soon asthey realize they're being followed, they stop. But the moment our eyesare turned, they give us the slip.     But surely you must have some idea of where they go, Grannie said.     Baker lit a cigarette. There's all kinds of rumors, he replied, butnone of them will hold water. By the way, there's a cockatoo eyrieahead of us.     I followed his gaze and saw a curious structure suspended betweena rude circle of flagpole trees. A strange web-like formation oftranslucent gauzy material, it was. Fully two hundred cockatoos wereperched upon it. They watched us with their mild eyes as we passed, butthey didn't move.     After that we were rolling up the driveway that led to the offices of      Larynx Incorporated     . As Jimmy Baker led the way up the inclined ramp,a door in the central building opened, and a man emerged. His face wasdrawn.     Mr. Baker, he said breathlessly, seventy-five workers at Shaft Fourhave headed out into the Baldric.     Baker dropped his cigarette and ground his heel on it savagely.     Shaft Four, eh? he repeated. That's our principal mine. If the feverspreads there, I'm licked.     He motioned us into his office and strode across to a desk. SilentXartal, the Martian illustrator, took a chair in a corner and got hisnotebook out, sketching the room's interior. Grannie Annie remainedstanding.     Presently the old lady walked across to the desk and helped herself tothe bottle of Martian whiskey there.     There must be ways of stopping this, she said. Have you called inany physicians? Why don't you call an enforced vacation and send themen away until the plague has died down?     Baker shook his head. Three doctors from Callisto were here lastmonth. They were as much at loss as I am. As for sending the men away,I may have to do that, but when I do, it means quits. Our company ischartered with Spacolonial, and you know what that means. Failureto produce during a period of thirty days or more, and you lose allrights.     A visiphone bell sounded, and Baker walked across to the instrument. Aman's face formed in the vision plate. Baker listened, said Okay andthrew off the switch.     The entire crew of Shaft Four have gone out into the Baldric, he saidslowly. There was a large map hanging on the wall back of Baker's desk.Grannie Annie walked across to it and began to study its markings.     Shaft Four is at the outer edge of the Baldric at a point where thatcorridor is at its widest, she said.     Baker looked up. That's right. We only began operations there acomparatively short time ago. Struck a rich vein of Acoustix thatruns deep in. If that vein holds out, we'll double the output of      Interstellar Voice     , our rival, in a year.     Grannie nodded. I think you and I and Xartal had better take a run upthere, she said. But first I want to see your laboratory.     There was no refusing her. Jimmy Baker led the way down to a lowerlevel where a huge laboratory and experimental shop ran the lengthof the building. Grannie seized a light weight carry-case and begandropping articles into it. A pontocated glass lens, three or fourWellington radite bulbs, each with a spectroscopic filament, a smalldynamo that would operate on a kite windlass, and a quantity of wireand other items.     The kite car was brought out again, and the old woman, Baker and theMartian took their places in it. Then Jimmy waved, and the car began toroll down the ramp.  "

        "Query": "What role does Acoustix play in the story of DOUBLE TROUBLE?",
        "Summary_1": "It is a precious, lightweight ore found on at least one of Jupiter\u2019s moons (eighth moon) that is highly valuable on Mars, but of no value on Earth. Martians are able to speak out loud as Earthlings do by supersonically amplifying their thoughts. As Martians grow beyond middle age, they are no longer able to do this amplification without the assistance of the Acoustix ore. Thus, it is highly valuable to them.\n\nThe ore is the only reason for colonization of Jupiter\u2019s moons, and there are two main companies that mine it - Interstellar Voice, Larynx Incorporated. It becomes a source of greed, which causes the manager of Interstellar Voice (Antlers Karn) to attempt sabotage against the other company, serving as the main climax of the story.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Acoustix is an ore found on Jupiter's eighth moon that helps older martians continue to amplify their thoughts with their supersonic communication methods that usually deteriorate once the Martian hits middle age. Although there is no use for it on Earth, it is the entire reason there is colonial presence on the moon, and the reason for the presence of the companies Interstellar Voice and Larynx Incorporated. The ore is therefore the primary point of competition between the two companies, and when Larynx Incorporated finds a new, rich source of the ore, Antlers Park decides he has to take action to keep Jimmy Baker's company from getting ahead. This is why Antlers made a small device to make the rays more concentrated, to shine them on the workers in the barracks, to give them Red Spot Fever. This would allow him to take over the area that is rich in ore.  \n",
        "Summary_3": "Acoustix is an ore unique to Jupiter's Eighth Moon and is the reason for the presence of the mining operations of Intersteller Voice and Larynx Incorporated. As Antlers Park informs Billy, although the ore is useless to Earthmen, the Martians highly value it. Because Martians speak using a supersonic method, they are able to amplify their thoughts via high-frequency wavelengths. As they get older, this ability decreases, and the Acoustix has the ability to restore that ability to its previous strength. Jimmy Baker's company, Larynx Incorporated, has discovered a massive reserve of Acoustix that would essentially put them far ahead of their competition, and therefore Antlers Park works to sabotage them by spreading Red-Spot fever amongst his workers, knowing their discovery would hurt his own business, Interstellar Voice. Jimmy worries that the labor shortage will impair his company's ability to mine Shaft Four, which produces their largest share of Acoustix, and will lead to the termination of his charter through Spacolonial.",
        "Summary_4": "Acoustix is the ore that Larynx Incorporated and Interstellar Voice are both harvesting and selling. As far as anyone knows, Acoustix can only be found on this moon of Jupiter's. The ore is useless on Earth, but Martians use it to continue to communicate with Earthmen after they have reached old age. Martians create wave lengths with their thoughts using vibrations. After they become older, they are unable to create the same frequency of vibrations, and therefore lose the ability to speak with others. The Acoustix ore revitalizes the organ they use to create the vibrations, and it gives them the gift of communication once more. \n\nAntlers Park does not want Jimmy Baker and his company to outdo his business, Interstellar Voice. The men share access to the Baldric, which is where the miners are harvesting Acoustix. If Park can get Baker out of the way, he will have the whole stretch of land to harvest for himself, and he will be the sole person profiting off of the moon. He hatches a plan to make Baker's employees sick with Red Spot Fever so that they walk off the job and leave the Acoustix to his miners to gather and sell. \n\n",
        "Article": "When Annabella C. Flowers, that renowned writer of science fiction,visiphoned me at Crater City, Mars, to meet her here, I had thought shewas crazy. But Miss Flowers, known to her friends as Grannie Annie,had always been mildly crazy. If you haven't read her books, you'vemissed something. She's the author of      Lady of the Green Flames     ,      Lady of the Runaway Planet     ,      Lady of the Crimson Space-Beast     , andother works of science fiction. Blood-and-thunder as these books are,however, they have one redeeming feature\u2014authenticity of background.Grannie Annie was the original research digger-upper, and when shelaid the setting of a yarn on a star of the sixth magnitude, only atransportation-velocity of less than light could prevent her fromvisiting her stage in person.     Therefore when she asked me to meet her at the landing field of      Interstellar Voice     on Jupiter's Eighth Moon, I knew she had anothernovel in the state of embryo.     What I didn't expect was Ezra Karn. He was an old prospector Granniehad met, and he had become so attached to the authoress he now followedher wherever she went. As for Xartal, he was a Martian and was slatedto do the illustrations for Grannie's new book.     Five minutes after my ship had blasted down, the four of us met in theoffices of      Interstellar Voice     . And then I was shaking hands withAntlers Park, the manager of I. V. himself.     Glad to meet you, he said cordially. I've just been trying topersuade Miss Flowers not to attempt a trip into the Baldric.     What's the Baldric? I had asked.     Antlers Park flicked the ash from his cheroot and shrugged.     Will you believe me, sir, he said, when I tell you I've been outhere on this forsaken moon five years and don't rightly know myself?     I scowled at that; it didn't make sense.     However, as you perhaps know, the only reason for colonial activitieshere at all is because of the presence of an ore known as Acoustix.It's no use to the people of Earth but of untold value on Mars. I'mnot up on the scientific reasons, but it seems that life on the redplanet has developed with a supersonic method of vocal communication.The Martian speaks as the Earthman does, but he amplifies his thoughts'transmission by way of wave lengths as high as three million vibrationsper second. The trouble is that by the time the average Martian reachesmiddle age, his ability to produce those vibrations steadily decreases.Then it was found that this ore, Acoustix, revitalized their soundingapparatus, and the rush was on.     What do you mean?     Park leaned back. The rush to find more of the ore, he explained.But up until now this moon is the only place where it can be found.     There are two companies here, he continued,       Interstellar Voice     and      Larynx Incorporated     . Chap by the name of Jimmy Baker runs that.However, the point is, between the properties of these two companiesstretches a band or belt which has become known as the Baldric.     There are two principal forms of life in the Baldric; flagpole treesand a species of ornithoid resembling cockatoos. So far no one hascrossed the Baldric without trouble.     What sort of trouble? Grannie Annie had demanded. And when AntlersPark stuttered evasively, the old lady snorted, Fiddlesticks, I neversaw trouble yet that couldn't be explained.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      It is rather unusual, Magnan said, to assign an officer of your rankto courier duty, but this is an unusual mission.     Retief sat relaxed and said nothing. Just before the silence grewawkward, Magnan went on.     There are four planets in the group, he said. Two double planets,all rather close to an unimportant star listed as DRI-G 33987. They'recalled Jorgensen's Worlds, and in themselves are of no importancewhatever. However, they lie deep in the sector into which the Soettihave been penetrating.     Now\u2014 Magnan leaned forward and lowered his voice\u2014we have learnedthat the Soetti plan a bold step forward. Since they've met noopposition so far in their infiltration of Terrestrial space, theyintend to seize Jorgensen's Worlds by force.     Magnan leaned back, waiting for Retief's reaction. Retief drewcarefully on his cigar and looked at Magnan. Magnan frowned.     This is open aggression, Retief, he said, in case I haven't mademyself clear. Aggression on Terrestrial-occupied territory by an alienspecies. Obviously, we can't allow it.     Magnan drew a large folder from his desk.     A show of resistance at this point is necessary. Unfortunately,Jorgensen's Worlds are technologically undeveloped areas. They'refarmers or traders. Their industry is limited to a minor role intheir economy\u2014enough to support the merchant fleet, no more. The warpotential, by conventional standards, is nil.     Magnan tapped the folder before him.     I have here, he said solemnly, information which will change thatpicture completely. He leaned back and blinked at Retief.   <doc-sep> Most of the cousins gasped as the truth began to percolate through.     I knew from the very beginning, Conrad finished, that I didn'thave to do anything at all. I just had to wait and you would destroyyourselves.     I don't understand, Bartholomew protested, searching the faces of thecousins closest to him. What does he mean, we have never existed?We're here, aren't we? What\u2014     Shut up! Raymond snapped. He turned on Martin. You don't seemsurprised.     The old man grinned. I'm not. I figured it all out years ago.     At first, he had wondered what he should do. Would it be better tothrow them into a futile panic by telling them or to do nothing? Hehad decided on the latter; that was the role they had assigned him\u2014towatch and wait and keep out of things\u2014and that was the role he wouldplay.     You knew all the time and you didn't tell us! Raymond spluttered.After we'd been so good to you, making a gentleman out of you insteadof a criminal.... That's right, he snarled, a criminal! An alcoholic,a thief, a derelict! How do you like that?     Sounds like a rich, full life, Martin said wistfully.     What an exciting existence they must have done him out of! But then, hecouldn't help thinking, he\u2014he and Conrad together, of course\u2014had donethem out of      any     kind of existence. It wasn't his responsibility,though; he had done nothing but let matters take whatever course wasdestined for them. If only he could be sure that it was the bettercourse, perhaps he wouldn't feel that nagging sense of guilt insidehim. Strange\u2014where, in his hermetic life, could he possibly havedeveloped such a queer thing as a conscience?     Then we've wasted all this time, Ninian sobbed, all this energy, allthis money, for nothing!     But you were nothing to begin with, Martin told them. And then,after a pause, he added, I only wish I could be sure there had beensome purpose to this.     He didn't know whether it was approaching death that dimmed his sight,or whether the frightened crowd that pressed around him was growingshadowy.     I wish I could feel that some good had been done in letting you bewiped out of existence, he went on voicing his thoughts. But I knowthat the same thing that happened to your worlds and my world willhappen all over again. To other people, in other times, but again. It'sbound to happen. There isn't any hope for humanity.     One man couldn't really change the course of human history, he toldhimself. Two men, that was\u2014one real, one a shadow.     Conrad came close to the old man's bed. He was almost transparent.     No, he said, there is hope. They didn't know the time transmitterworks two ways. I used it for going into the past only once\u2014just thisonce. But I've gone into the future with it many times. And\u2014 hepressed Martin's hand\u2014believe me, what I did\u2014what      we     did, you andI\u2014serves a purpose. It will change things for the better. Everythingis going to be all right.  "

        "Query": "What does Red Spot Fever refer to in the story DOUBLE TROUBLE?",
        "Summary_1": "The symptoms of the fever are described as \u201cgarrulousness\u201d followed by the victims leaving their post and walking into the Baldric desert.\n\nThe fever is brought on by infra-red rays from Jupiter\u2019s great spot. Normally, people on this moon aren\u2019t coming down with the fever from their regular activities. However, a lens-like device mounted in the window of the worker barracks at Larynx Incorporated projects the infra-red rays from the great spot around the room onto the sleeping workers which puts them into this trance-like state.\n\nAntlers Karn is responsible for causing the Red Spot Fever by having the devices installed in his competitors' barracks. He also claims to have developed an antitoxin that would reverse the fever, however, it is implied that this was only a lie to cover up his actions.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Red Spot Fever makes the people who catch it start to talk a lot, and after rambling for a while the people wander into the Baldric as long as they can do so unnoticed. When someone is watching them to try to see where they are going, they stop until they can slip away. This is a big issue for the mining companies that rely on their workers for survival. The Fever comes about by the infra-red rays from Jupiter's great spot, and exposure to these rays over time causes the Fever in humans. The good news is that the infra-red rays can be combated with ultra violet light, which we see Jimmy Baker and Xartal use at the end of the story, shining the light on the miners to counteract the exposure.  ",
        "Summary_3": "Jimmy Baker believes he is losing his workers to onset Red Spot Fever, the symptoms of which include extreme talkativeness followed by a tendency to wander away and disappear. Following the discovery of the massive store of Acoustix around Shaft Four, his workers began wandering into the vastness of the Baldric. Billy and Ezra confirm Jimmy's suspicions when they discover a device hidden in the barracks at Larynx Incorporated that concentrates and amplifies the power of the infra-red rays from nearby Jupiter's great spot. The device operates on a timer so that it beams onto the workers as they sleep. Antlers Park admits to having installed the device because he feared the resultant competition from Jimmy Baker's discovery of the deep Acoustix vein. In order to combat the Red Spot Fever, Annie and Jimmy concoct a plan to utilize Jimmy's kite car as a makeshift beam from which to cast ultraviolet rays upon the wandering workers. Since the rays are at the opposite end of the vibratory scale, they can be used to subvert the symptoms of Red Spot Fever and draw the workers back to Larynx Incorporated.",
        "Summary_4": "Red Spot Fever is an illness that Jimmy Baker's workers come down with after Antlers Park hatches a plan to make them sick. He or one of his minions sneaks into the workers' barracks and places a piece of metal with a lens on the wall. The lens works to amplify Jupiter's infrared-rays, and the rays hit the men while they are sleeping. The workers are affected by this contraption because it makes them extremely talkative and forces them to walk out of their mines. Importantly, Billy looks through Jimmy Baker's folder of victims and makes a connection that the men are becoming sick while they are sleeping, and not while they are working. This gives Ezra and Billy the idea to go to the barracks and look around, and that's when they find the lens that amplifies the harmful rays. \n\nGrannie Annie is able to solve the problem by hitting the infected men with ultraviolet light which counteracts against the infrared-rays. When the men are no longer poisoned by the infrared, they walk right back to their work stations. ",
        "Article": "Don't you see, the lady continued. Everything that Xartal put onpaper has been seen by one or more of these cockatoos. The cockatoosare like Earth parrots all right, but not only have they the powerof copying speech, they also have the ability to recreate a mentalimage of what they have seen. In other words their brains form apowerful photographic impression of the object. That impression isthen transmitted simultaneously in telepathic wavelengths to commonfoci. That eyrie might be likened to a cinema screen, receiving brainvibrations from a hundred different sources that blend into the lightfield to form what are apparently three-dimensional images.     The Larynx manager nodded slowly. I see, he said. But why don't thebirds reconstruct images from the actual person. Why use drawings?     Probably because the drawings are exaggerated in certain details andmade a greater impression on their brains, Grannie replied.     Up on the eyrie a strange performance was taking place. The duplicateof Grannie Annie was bowing to the duplicate of Jimmy Baker, and theimage of Ezra Karn was playing leap frog with the image of Antlers Park.     Then abruptly the screen before me blurred and went blank.     Sorry, the operator said. I've used too much power already. Have togive the generators a chance to build it up again.     Nodding, I turned and motioned to Karn. We went back downstairs.     That explains something at any rate, the old prospector said. Buthow about that Red spot fever?     On Jimmy Baker's desk was a large file marked: FEVER VICTIMS. I openedit and found it contained the case histories of those men who had beenattacked by the strange malady.     Reading them over, I was struck by one detail. Each patient hadreceived the first symptoms, not while working in the mines, but whilesleeping or lounging in the barracks.     Five minutes later Karn and I were striding down a white ramp thatled to the nearest barracks. The building came into sight, a lowrectangular structure, dome-roofed to withstand the violent winds.     Inside double tiers of bunks stretched along either wall. In thosebunks some thirty men lay sleeping.     The far wall was taken up by a huge window of denvo-quartz. As I stoodthere, something suddenly caught Ezra Karn's eye. He began to walktoward that window.     Look here, he said.     Six feet up on that window a small almost imperceptible button of dullmetal had been wedged into an aperture cut in the quartz. The centralpart of the button appeared to be a powerful lens of some kind, and asI seized it and pulled it loose, I felt the hum of tiny clock work.     All at once I had it! Red spot fever. Heat fever from the infra-redrays of Jupiter's great spot. Someone had constructed this lens toconcentrate and amplify the power of those rays. The internal clockworkserved a double purpose. It opened a shutter, and it rotated the lensslowly so that it played for a time on each of the sleeping men.     I slid the metal button in my pocket and left the barracks at a run.Back in the visiscreen room, I snapped to the operator:     Turn it on!     The kite car swam into view in the screen above the instrument panel.I stared with open eyes. Jimmy Baker no longer was in the car, norwas Xartal, the Martian. Grannie Annie was there, but seated at thecontrols was Antlers Park, the manager of Interstellar Voice.   <doc-sep>    DOUBLE TROUBLE     by CARL JACOBI     Grannie Annie, that waspish science-fiction     writer, was in a jam again. What with red-spot     fever, talking cockatoos and flagpole trees,     I was running in circles\u2014especially since     Grannie became twins every now and then.     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Planet Stories Spring 1945.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      We had left the offices of      Interstellar Voice     three days ago, Earthtime, and now as the immense disc of Jupiter flamed across the sky,entered the outer limits of the Baldric. Grannie Annie strode in thelead, her absurd long-skirted black dress looking as out of place inthis desert as the trees.     Flagpole trees. They rose straight up like enormous cat-tails, withonly a melon-shaped protuberance at the top to show they were a form ofvegetation. Everything else was blanketed by the sand and the powerfulwind that blew from all quarters.     As we reached the first of those trees, Grannie came to a halt.     This is the Baldric all right. If my calculations are right, we've hitit at its narrowest spot.     Ezra Karn took a greasy pipe from his lips and spat. It looks like therest of this God-forsaken moon, he said, 'ceptin for them sticks.     Xartal, the Martian illustrator, said nothing. He was like that,taciturn, speaking only when spoken to.     He could be excused this time, however, for this was only our third dayon Jupiter's Eighth Moon, and the country was still strange to us.   <doc-sep> Jimmy Baker nodded. He told his story over the roar of the wind as weheaded back across the desert. Occasionally he touched a stud on anelectric windlass to which the kite wire was attached. Apparently theseadjustments moved planes or fins on the kite and accounted for thecar's ability to move in any direction.     If I weren't a realist, I'd say that      Larynx Incorporated     has beenbewitched, he began slowly. We pay our men high wages and give themexcellent living conditions with a vacation on Callisto every year.Up until a short time ago most of them were in excellent health andspirits. Then the Red Spot Fever got them.     Red Spot Fever? Grannie looked at him curiously.     Jimmy Baker nodded. The first symptoms are a tendency to garrulousnesson the part of the patient. Then they disappear.     He paused to make an adjustment of the windlass.     They walk out into the Baldric, he continued, and nothing can stopthem. We tried following them, of course, but it was no go. As soon asthey realize they're being followed, they stop. But the moment our eyesare turned, they give us the slip.     But surely you must have some idea of where they go, Grannie said.     Baker lit a cigarette. There's all kinds of rumors, he replied, butnone of them will hold water. By the way, there's a cockatoo eyrieahead of us.     I followed his gaze and saw a curious structure suspended betweena rude circle of flagpole trees. A strange web-like formation oftranslucent gauzy material, it was. Fully two hundred cockatoos wereperched upon it. They watched us with their mild eyes as we passed, butthey didn't move.     After that we were rolling up the driveway that led to the offices of      Larynx Incorporated     . As Jimmy Baker led the way up the inclined ramp,a door in the central building opened, and a man emerged. His face wasdrawn.     Mr. Baker, he said breathlessly, seventy-five workers at Shaft Fourhave headed out into the Baldric.     Baker dropped his cigarette and ground his heel on it savagely.     Shaft Four, eh? he repeated. That's our principal mine. If the feverspreads there, I'm licked.     He motioned us into his office and strode across to a desk. SilentXartal, the Martian illustrator, took a chair in a corner and got hisnotebook out, sketching the room's interior. Grannie Annie remainedstanding.     Presently the old lady walked across to the desk and helped herself tothe bottle of Martian whiskey there.     There must be ways of stopping this, she said. Have you called inany physicians? Why don't you call an enforced vacation and send themen away until the plague has died down?     Baker shook his head. Three doctors from Callisto were here lastmonth. They were as much at loss as I am. As for sending the men away,I may have to do that, but when I do, it means quits. Our company ischartered with Spacolonial, and you know what that means. Failureto produce during a period of thirty days or more, and you lose allrights.     A visiphone bell sounded, and Baker walked across to the instrument. Aman's face formed in the vision plate. Baker listened, said Okay andthrew off the switch.     The entire crew of Shaft Four have gone out into the Baldric, he saidslowly. There was a large map hanging on the wall back of Baker's desk.Grannie Annie walked across to it and began to study its markings.     Shaft Four is at the outer edge of the Baldric at a point where thatcorridor is at its widest, she said.     Baker looked up. That's right. We only began operations there acomparatively short time ago. Struck a rich vein of Acoustix thatruns deep in. If that vein holds out, we'll double the output of      Interstellar Voice     , our rival, in a year.     Grannie nodded. I think you and I and Xartal had better take a run upthere, she said. But first I want to see your laboratory.     There was no refusing her. Jimmy Baker led the way down to a lowerlevel where a huge laboratory and experimental shop ran the lengthof the building. Grannie seized a light weight carry-case and begandropping articles into it. A pontocated glass lens, three or fourWellington radite bulbs, each with a spectroscopic filament, a smalldynamo that would operate on a kite windlass, and a quantity of wireand other items.     The kite car was brought out again, and the old woman, Baker and theMartian took their places in it. Then Jimmy waved, and the car began toroll down the ramp.  "

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the story's storyline?",
        "Summary_1": "Purnie, an animal, is going to see the ocean on his fifth birthday. He has heard stories about this place, and experiencing it firsthand is surreal for him. Purnie is careful not to disturb the animals he sees along the way because he has frozen time, and everything must resume normally when he unfreezes it. He knows that time-stopping is forbidden for animals his age, but he chooses to believe that his family will be proud of his bravery. \n\nFinally, he sees the ocean in front of him, and he resumes time. He does a head-stand and feels weak and dizzy. These feelings are a result of the time-stop, and he knows it. Purnie approaches some humans on the beach. A man named Forbes is in the middle of explaining to his captain, Benson, that he has found 17 planets to claim as his own. Forbes is hellbent on raising his FORBES flag as soon as possible. He is eager to stake his claim to the land and says that his mission is much bigger than real estate alone. Benson retorts that yes, his mission is bigger than just real estate because his paperwork says that Forbes will own all of the inhabitants of the planets he claims as well as the land. \n\nThe crew members use a special machine and  find radiation emanating from Purnie. Forbes demands that they put the animal in a box. Benson protests and reminds Forbes that it\u2019s against Universal Law, but Forbes insists. Purnie experiences his first-ever impulse to run away with fear when a noose comes towards him. He goes back to pick up his fruit, and Forbes shoots him in the leg. When the man throws the noose again, Purnie involuntarily stops time. He drags himself up the knoll where he originally came from. \n\nThe humans are astonished when time resumes and Purnie is not where he was a split second ago. They spot him up on top of a pile of petrified logs, and suddenly the logs fall down the hill and pin the men down. Purnie is shocked and regretful. The whole thing was an accident. He deliberately stops time and uses all of his remaining strength to lift the logs off of the humans. Purnie begins to lose consciousness, and he knows that he must resume time or he will die. After pouring all of his strength into this action, time does begin again. The humans resume life and feel as though they have gone mad. They know that they were just facing death by drowning, and now they are free. The logs were so heavy that it would have taken superhuman strength to move them. Forbes, in particular, has really gone mad, and he laughs to himself uncontrollably. Benson believes that Purnie was responsible for moving the logs, but of course that seems physically impossible. \n \nPurnie stares off at the beautiful ocean views and watches the men leave in their vehicle as he dies. \n",
        "Summary_2": "On his fifth birthday, Purnie--a small, kangaroo-like creature with large eyes--runs through the forest as he goes to see the beach for the first time. Bemoaning the fact that days are so short, he triggers his ability to stop time. He marvels at the bees frozen in mid-air and reminds himself to not abuse his time-stopping power or it could drain all of his energy and kill him. Before arriving at the beach, he gathers some fruit for lunch and then pauses atop a small, rocky hill from where he takes in his first view of the ocean. Purnie is overwhelmed and thrilled at the idea of making friends with the new animals he sees: three-legged tripons, a flock of spora, and, further down, a group of ten humans making their way onto the beach. When he unfreezes time, Purnie climbs down the rockpile and runs around the beach, showing his new animal friends his headstand technique. Next, he visits two humans, who barely notice his presence. Captain Benson is the hired leader of the expedition; Forbes is a wealthy real estate investor who owns seventeen planets and considers himself a \"pioneer\". Forbes explains to Benson that coming to the planet is a mere formality as he has already staked his claim to make this planet his eighteenth; planting a flag emblazoned with his name is a symbolic gesture. Benson's men wish to explore the new planet and its native species, but Forbes is impatient to build his flagpole and leave. He has no interest in learning about the creatures there, only in owning their land and tripling his investment over time. Purnie wants to play with the humans, and Forbes expresses his annoyance and tries to get a crewmember to take him away. One of the crew members, Miles, checks the planet's surface for radiation while Benson and Forbes investigate the rockpile where Purnie had perched earlier to see if the rocks may be used to support Forbes' flagpole. After they determine the rocks are extremely heavy petrified logs and cannot be moved, Miles alerts them that Purnie is emitting a large amount of radiation. Forbes orders the crew to capture Purnie so he can take him home, reproduce him, and profit off of his radiation resource. As Purnie evades capture, thinking he is playing with the men, Forbes grows impatient and shoots him, causing Purnie to instinctively stop time. Injured, Purnie takes shelter atop the petrified logs, which fall under him and crush the humans below. Panicked, Purnie rushes to remove the logs, using up his own energy. When he unfreezes time again, the men are astonished. In one moment, they were crushed by logs, and in the next, the logs had disappeared. This drives Forbes insane, and he laughs as they take him away to the ship. Having exhausted all of his energy saving the men, Purnie watches them leave, succumbs to his wounds, and dies.",
        "Summary_3": "Purnie, a five-year-old creature, is off from school for his birthday and takes a secret trip to see the ocean. When he is near enough to smell the ocean, Purnie freezes time even though he has been warned about the amount of energy this takes, and there is a maxim that small children who stop time without an adult may not live to regret it. When he reaches the shore, he recognizes the petrified logs, spora, and tripons from his brothers\u2019 descriptions and is delighted to find two-legged animals there as well. Purnie approaches the two-legged animals who are actually humans and speaks to them but is ignored. The humans discuss the men who are curiously looking at the animals around them, and Forbes, the leader, orders Captain Benson to have the men work right away. Purnie follows the men closely, and Forbes gets annoyed and kicks at him. They talk about this being Forbes's eighteenth planet, and Forbes wants his flag planted and a cornerstone and plaque installed. One of the men gets a strong reading on his scintillometer, a device that detects radiation. Tracing the reading, they find it is coming from Purnie. Forbes orders Purnie put into a lead box, thinking radioactive animals can reproduce and provide an endless supply of radioactive materials. Benson is reluctant because putting Purnie in the box will kill him, and it goes against Universal Law. Forbes reminds him of their contract, and Benson has his men try to rope Purnie, who thinks it is a game and playfully comes near the box before running away. When Forbes loses patience, he shoots at Purnie to wound him. Stunned, he stops and sees the noose coming toward him. Purnie freezes time again, limps away, and climbs to the top of the bluff. When he restarts time, the men are shocked he is no longer there on the beach with them. Spying Purnie on the bluff, they approach him; Purnie shifts, causing the logs to slide down and hit the men. Purnie is shocked and saddened at their suffering and feels awful he caused it. He realizes some of the men will drown because they can\u2019t move and the tide is coming in, so he freezes time again, pulls the logs off the men, and drags them onto the beach. At the top of the hill, he restarts time, and the men are puzzled to be back on the beach with the logs off them. They question their sanity, and Forbes really has gone insane. The men help those who are seriously wounded, disarm Forbes and tie his hands together, and return him to the ship. Benson wonders why Purnie would come back to the humans who tormented him and goes back to the beach looking for him. He calls out for Purnie, tells him they made a mistake, and he would like to help Purnie if he is hurt. When he doesn\u2019t see him, Benson leaves.",
        "Summary_4": "On an alien planet, a small non-human creature named Purnie is turning five years old. Purnie is precocious and adventurous, with the amazing ability to stop and start time with its mind. However, the super power comes with consequences. It tires Purnie to use time-stopping, and if done too much it can kill the user.\n\nPurnie leaves brothers and parents in a village in the forest and stops time while venturing beside a stream towards the ocean. Upon reaching a cliff overlooking the orange colored ocean, Purnie restarts time and discovers a group of human space explorers that are attempting to claim the planet and have only been onshore for 20 minutes musing at the strange creatures they are finding.\n\nForbes is from San Diego and has a history of claiming planets, this current one being the 17th if successfully staked with his flag, cornerstone, and plaque. He orders around Captain Benson and the rest of the crew, in a hurry to claim the planet upon their arrival.\n\nPurnie thinks the humans are friends to play with and tries to interact with them on multiple occasions. When the crew discovers that Purnie is radioactive, Forbes orders them to capture it and place it in a lead box to bring to Earth, which Forbes thinks will make him very rich. Purnie\u2019s confusion about their hostility leads to an involuntary stopping of time which is used to return to the top of the cliff. Accidentally, Purnie sets off a rock slide after restarting time from the location on the top of the cliff and sets off a rock slide while peering over the edge that traps most of the humans under rocks and petrified logs along the beach and in the ocean. Deep horror causes Pernie to once again stop time, go down to the beach, and move all the debris off the humans - saving their lives.\n\nWhen time restarts once again, the humans are completely baffled as to how they were rescued, and Forbes loses his grip on reality entirely - having to be tied up by the crew for their return trip. Captain Benson wonders why a creature they tried to capture and kill would have come back to their rescue from their almost certain deaths and goes looking for Pernie as the crew prepares to leave. Not finding Purnie, the spaceship takes off, and the final sight of Purnie\u2019s life before dying of exhaustion from using the superpower is a floating wet flag of Forbes' in the ocean.\n",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]       Every lonely man tries to make friends.     Manet just didn't know when to stop!      William Manet was alone.     In the beginning, he had seen many advantages to being alone. It wouldgive him an unprecedented opportunity to once and for all correlateloneliness to the point of madness, to see how long it would take himto start slavering and clawing the pin-ups from the magazines, to beginteaching himself classes in philosophy consisting of interminablelectures to a bored and captive audience of one.     He would be able to measure the qualities of peace and decide whetherit was really better than war, he would be able to get as fat and asdirty as he liked, he would be able to live more like an animal andthink more like a god than any man for generations.     But after a shorter time than he expected, it all got to be a tearingbore. Even the waiting to go crazy part of it.     Not that he was going to have any great long wait of it. He was alreadytalking to himself, making verbal notes for his lectures, and he hadcut out a picture of Annie Oakley from an old book. He tacked it up andwinked at it whenever he passed that way.     Lately she was winking back at him.     Loneliness was a physical weight on his skull. It peeled the flesh fromhis arms and legs and sandpapered his self-pity to a fine sensitivity.     No one on Earth was as lonely as William Manet, and even William Manetcould only be this lonely on Mars.     Manet was Atmosphere Seeder Station 131-47's own human.     All Manet had to do was sit in the beating aluminum heart in the middleof the chalk desert and stare out, chin cupped in hands, at the flat,flat pavement of dirty talcum, at the stars gleaming as hard in theblack sky as a starlet's capped teeth ... stars two of which were moonsand one of which was Earth. He had to do nothing else. The wholegimcrack was cybernetically controlled, entirely automatic. No one wasneeded here\u2014no human being, at least.     The Workers' Union was a pretty small pressure group, but it didn'ttake much to pressure the Assembly. Featherbedding had been carefullyspecified, including an Overseer for each of the Seeders to honeycombMars, to prepare its atmosphere for colonization.     They didn't give tests to find well-balanced, well-integrated peoplefor the job. Well-balanced, well-integrated men weren't going toisolate themselves in a useless job. They got, instead, William Manetand his fellows.     The Overseers were to stay as long as the job required. Passenger fareto Mars was about one billion dollars. They weren't providing commuterservice for night shifts. They weren't providing accommodationsfor couples when the law specified only one occupant. They weren'tproviding fuel (at fifty million dollars a gallon) for visits betweenthe various Overseers. They weren't very providential.     But it was two hundred thousand a year in salary, and it offeredwonderful opportunities.     It gave William Manet an opportunity to think he saw a spaceship makinga tailfirst landing on the table of the desert, its tail burning asbright as envy.  "

When Forbes demands that Benson\u2019s crew stop dawdling and hurry up and put his FORBES flag up, Benson tells Forbes that they are only humans. Of course they are interested in the new environment and want to take a moment to look around. He is not afraid to tell Forbes that capturing Purnie or injuring him is against Universal Laws. Benson does not want to take part in illegal activities, and he scoffs at Forbes\u2019 remarks that he is a pioneer and not a real estate developer. He openly tells Forbes that he knows he will triple his money after claiming these planets, so it\u2019s not like he\u2019s doing it for the greater good of humanity. Benson also asks Forbes if he\u2019s going to take his 17 new planets back home with him to San Diego. It\u2019s clear that Benson has little respect for Forbes and the way he conducts his business, but at the same time, he needs a job and Forbes is providing him with an incredible opportunity to survey all sorts of different planets.\n\nBenson has to face Forbes\u2019 wrath when Purnie goes missing after Forbes shoots him and they attempt to put a noose around his neck. After Purnie unfreezes time, the men are confused as to what they just saw. Forbes turns to Benson and tells him that he is holding him responsible for this mishap even though there is zero evidence that Benson did anything wrong.\n\nAfter the logs fall on the men and Purnie uses all of his remaining strength to save their lives, Forbes is completely out of his mind. Benson finds it a bit humorous, especially since he has an inkling that Purnie, the bug-eyed creature, was behind the whole thing. He does not respect Forbes and thinks his disconnect to reality and repetitive laughter is what he deserves for the way he treated Purnie, himself, and the crew. \n",
        "Summary_2": "As a wealthy real estate investor who hires Captain Benson to lead the expedition to the new planet, Forbes treats Benson with a great amount of flippancy and disrespect. He disregards Benson's request to let the crew explore the planet before rushing to build his flagpole to symbolically stake his claim there. He completely ignores Benson when he shows concern for Purnie's well-being when Forbes wants to capture Purnie and take him home to profit off of the radiation in his body. While Benson cares for the safety of his crew and the lives of the new species they discover on this new planet, Forbes only sees ways in which he can personally profit and build his real estate empire. Forbes infuriates Benson when he shoots Purnie, and he goes so far as to call him a fool in spite of Forbes' warnings against talking to him with disrespect. While Benson attempts to understand how Purnie was able to evade capture, Forbes simply wants to maim Purnie and blame Benson for his own mistakes. When the crew gets pinned by the logs dislodged accidentally by Purnie, Benson's instincts are to find and help as many people as he can, including Forbes. ",
        "Summary_3": "For the most part, the two men seem to tolerate each other. Forbes has employed Benson to hire men to explore the eighteenth planet that Forbes intends to claim as his own. As the employer, Forbes uses his position to order Benson to carry out his demands, although sometimes Benson questions Forbes's orders and resists carrying them out. Benson also questions Forbes's right to claim all the planets he is claiming and pokes a little fun at him at times. When Forbes wants Benson to order his men right to work after they arrive, Benson counters by asking if Forbes is human since they\u2019ve only been there twenty minutes, and the men are curious about the new planet. Benson also needles Forbes when the men discover radiation, pointing out that he will make enough money to buy his next planet. Forbes is unimpressed with the discovery of radiation since they\u2019ve found some on each of his other planets so far, but not in significant quantities. Forbes is most concerned about staking his claim by installing his flag, a cornerstone, and a plaque. When Benson questions the importance of the flag, Forbes tells him it signifies an empire, development, and progress. When Benson says Forbes will practically own the people who buy real estate on Forbes's planets, Forbes angrily replies that it is he and other people like him who risk their own money to give Benson and others space ships and places to go so they can get away from their thirteen-story tenement houses. Once it becomes clear that Purnie is the source of the large amount of radiation their equipment is detecting, Forbes orders Benson to have the animal put in one of their lead boxes meant to hold radioactive minerals. When Benson starts to remind him that this is forbidden by Universal Law, Forbes asserts his authority, reminding Benson the planet is his, and he is the law. After Purnie avoids capture and Forbes wounds him, Benson calls Forbes a fool and tells him to put his gun away, but Forbes claims he just nicked the animal. When Purnie escapes their attempts to rope him, Forbes blames Benson for ruining everything and is determined to capture Purnie himself. Benson tries to stop him, but Purnie shifts on the pile of petrified logs, sending them onto the men. When Forbes goes mad at the end of the story, Benson orders his men to take his gun from him and tie his hands together as they take him to the ship. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Benson is the captain of Forbes\u2019 expedition spaceship that has landed on the ocean shore of an alien planet. Forbes is very much in charge and makes repeated orders to Benson throughout the story that he obeys. Benson attempts to keep the peace by following and acquiescing to Forbes\u2019 sometimes unethical orders (like placing the creature, Purnie, in a sealed lead box that would kill him). Benson has a sensitive reasoning that Forbes does not possess, like when he thinks it possible Purnie may just come along without being sealed in the box, and when he wonders why Purnie would return to rescue the men that had tried to capture him.\n",

We're eithercrazy or those damn logs are alive!     It's not the logs. How about us? How'd we get out of the water? Miles,we're both cracking.     I'm telling you, man, it's the logs, or rocks or whatever they are.I was looking right at them. First they're on top of me, then they'repiled up over there!     Damnit, the logs didn't pick us up out of the ocean, did they? CaptainBenson!     Are you men all right?     Yes sir, but\u2014     Who saw exactly what happened?     I'm afraid we're not seeing right, Captain. Those logs\u2014     I know, I know. Now get hold of yourselves. We've got to round up theothers and get out of here while time is on our side.     But what happened, Captain?     Hell, Rhodes, don't you think I'd like to know? Those logs are so oldthey're petrified. The whole bunch of us couldn't lift one. It wouldtake super-human energy to move one of those things.     I haven't seen anything super-human. Those ostriches down there are sobusy eating seaweed\u2014     All right, let's bear a hand here with the others. Some of them can'twalk. Where's Forbes?     He's sitting down there in the water, Captain, crying like a baby. Orlaughing. I can't tell which.     We'll have to get him. Miles, Schick, come along. Forbes! You allright?     Ho-ho-ho! Seventeen! Seventeen! Seventeen planets, Benson, and they'lldo anything I say! This one's got a mind of its own. Did you see thatlittle trick with the rocks? Ho-ho!     See if you can find his gun, Schick; he'll either kill himself or oneof us. Tie his hands and take him back to the ship. We'll be alongshortly.     Hah-hah-hah! Seventeen! Benson, I'm holding you personally responsiblefor this. Hee-hee!   <doc-sep> The animals stopped so suddenly that Purnie nearly tangled himself intheir heels.     All right, Forbes, just hold it a minute. Listen to me. Sure, it'syour money that put us here; it's your expedition all the way. But youhired me to get you here with the best crew on earth, and that's justwhat I've done. My job isn't over yet. I'm responsible for the safetyof the men while we're here, and for the safe trip home.     Precisely. And since you're responsible, get 'em working. Tell 'em tobring along the flag. Look at the damn fools back there, playing in theocean with a three-legged ostrich!     Good God, man, aren't you human? We've only been on this planet twentyminutes! Naturally they want to look around. They half expected to findwild animals or worse, and here we are surrounded by quaint littlecreatures that run up to us like we're long-lost brothers. Let the menlook around a minute or two before we stake out your claim.     Bah! Bunch of damn children.     As Purnie followed along, a leg shot out at him and missed. Benson,will you get this bug-eyed kangaroo away from me! Purnie shrieked withjoy at this new frolic and promptly stood on his head. In this positionhe got an upside down view of them walking away.     He gave up trying to stay with them. Why did they move so fast, anyway?What was the hurry? As he sat down and began eating his lunch, threemore of the creatures came along making excited noises, apparentlytrying to catch up to the first two. As they passed him, he held outhis lunch. Want some? No response.     Playing held more promise than eating. He left his lunch half eaten andwent down to where they had stopped further along the beach.     Captain Benson, sir! Miles has detected strong radiation in thevicinity. He's trying to locate it now.     There you are, Forbes. Your new piece of real estate is going to makeyou so rich that you can buy your next planet. That'll make eighteen, Ibelieve.     Radiation, bah! We've found low-grade ore on every planet I'vediscovered so far, and this one'll be no different. Now how about thatflag? Let's get it up, Benson. And the cornerstone, and the plaque.     All right, lads. The sooner we get Mr. Forbes's pennant raised and hisclaim staked out, the sooner we can take time to look around. Livelynow!   <doc-sep> When Purnie started time again, the animal with the noose stood inopen-mouthed disbelief as the rope fell harmlessly to the sand\u2014on thespot where Purnie had been standing.     My God, he's\u2014he's gone.     Then another of the animals, the one with the smoking thing in hishand, ran a few steps toward the noose, stopped and gaped at the rope.All right, you people, what's going on here? Get him in that box. Whatdid you do with him?     The resumption of time meant nothing at all to those on the beach, forto them time had never stopped. The only thing they could be sure ofwas that at one moment there had been a fuzzy creature hopping aroundin front of them, and the next moment he was gone.     Is he invisible, Captain? Where is he?     Up there, Captain! On those rocks. Isn't that him?     Well, I'll be damned!     Benson, I'm holding you personally responsible for this! Now thatyou've botched it up, I'll bring him down my own way.     Just a minute, Forbes, let me think. There's something about thatfuzzy little devil that we should.... Forbes! I warned you about thatgun!     Purnie moved across the top of the rockpile for a last look at hisfriends. His weight on the end of the first log started the slide.Slowly at first, the giant pencils began cascading down the shortdistance to the sand. Purnie fell back onto solid ground, horrified atthe spectacle before him. The agonizing screams of the animals belowfilled him with hysteria.     The boulders caught most of them as they stood ankle-deep in the surf.Others were pinned down on the sand.     I didn't mean it! Purnie screamed. I'm sorry! Can't you hear? Hehopped back and forth near the edge of the rise, torn with panic andshame. Get up! Please get up! He was horrified by the moans reachinghis ears from the beach. You're getting all wet! Did you hear me?Please get up. He was choked with rage and sorrow. How could he havedone this? He wanted his friends to get up and shake themselves off,tell him it was all right. But it was beyond his power to bring itabout.     The lapping tide threatened to cover those in the orange surf.  "

        "Summary_1": "The unnamed planet where the story takes place is breathtaking, colorful, and lively with all sorts of fauna and flora unknown to Earth. There is blue moss on the forest floors, bubbling streams, and orange pools of water. There are also bees, purple clouds, petrified logs by the ocean, and three-legged animals who eat seaweed. The orange ocean waves crash against the sand, and two moons hover in the sky. Humans have never touched this land, so Purnie is surprised that he has never heard his brothers or parents talk about the two-legged animals who make strange sounds. He does not understand that they have just landed their ship here and are experiencing the land for the first time. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story takes place on an unnamed planet home to a great amount of biodiversity. Purnie is a small, kangaroo-like creature with large, bugged-out eyes; there seem to be several of his kind on this planet as well. There are forests with plentiful foliage, tall trees, and blue moss. The sky above has two moons and makes the trees seem endlessly tall with its low, dense, purple clouds. Throughout the forest flow milky-orange streams and whirlpools; bees buzz about pollinating paka plants. Purnie runs through this environment filled with the joy of life and makes his way to the ocean, driven towards it by its acid-sweet smell, and gathers fruit along the way. When Purnie arrives at the ocean, he stands atop a large rock pile, which turns out to be comprised of heavy petrified logs. He has stopped time, so everything he sees is frozen mid-action: The orange-and-white waves of the ocean tower mid-break, and he sees a flock of spora flying overhead, three-legged tripons chewing on seaweed, and a group of humans. According to the human crew member, Miles, there appears to be a great amount of radiation present on the surface of the planet as well as its creatures. ",
        "Summary_3": "The setting is on a planet similar to Earth, with a varied landscape featuring forests, oceans, and valleys. Purnie lives in a village where there is a school that he and his brothers attend. There is a nearby ocean on the other side of the forest that separates it from the village. The forest is colorful with patches of blue moss and a stream with milky-orange water with little whirlpools, bees and other creatures, and low-hanging purple clouds. The forest extends for quite a distance because Purnie has never been to the ocean before. It is lush with foliage, including paka plants, plants that produce pollen and fruit, and tall trees that seem to reach as high as the clouds. From his brothers\u2019 descriptions, Purnie knows what to expect at the beach, but he is still amazed when he sees everything for himself. The forest ends at a rocky knoll formed by petrified logs that overlooks the sea with its orange waves higher than a house and breakers coming onto the shore. There is a flock of birds called spora who land on the beach in a deep glide and humorous three-legged tripons that stand in the water and eat seaweed. As day ends, two moons appear in the sky, and their light is bright enough that Purnie can see the men leaving to return to their ship. \n",

Most of the story takes place in this beach location where the ocean is orange colored, there is a tall cliff with petrified logs piled up along its edge, and many hiding places. \n\nThe creatures on the planet are all very different to what humans are used to seeing, which creates a distracting setting for the crew through the story.\n",

Maybe he's\u2014 His sounds were cut off by awavelet gently rolling over his head.     Purnie could wait no longer. The tides were all but covering one of theanimals, and soon the others would be in the same plight. Disregardingthe consequences, he ordered time to stop.     Wading down into the surf, he worked a log off one victim, then hetugged the animal up to the sand. Through blinding tears, Purnie workedslowly and carefully. He knew there was no hurry\u2014at least, not as faras his friends' safety was concerned. No matter what their conditionof life or death was at this moment, it would stay the same way untilhe started time again. He made his way deeper into the orange liquid,where a raised hand signalled the location of a submerged body. Thehand was clutching a large white banner that was tangled among thelogs. Purnie worked the animal free and pulled it ashore.     It was the one who had been carrying the shiny object that spit smoke.     Scarcely noticing his own injured leg, he ferried one victim afteranother until there were no more in the surf. Up on the beach, hestarted unraveling the logs that pinned down the animals caught there.He removed a log from the lap of one, who then remained in a sittingposition, his face contorted into a frozen mask of agony and shock.Another, with the weight removed, rolled over like an iron statue intoa new position. Purnie whimpered in black misery as he surveyed thechaotic scene before him.     At last he could do no more; he felt consciousness slipping away fromhim.     He instinctively knew that if he lost his senses during a period oftime-stopping, events would pick up where they had left off ... withouthim. For Purnie, this would be death. If he had to lose consciousness,he knew he must first resume time.     Step by step he plodded up the little hill, pausing every now and thento consider if this were the moment to start time before it was toolate. With his energy fast draining away, he reached the top of theknoll, and he turned to look down once more on the group below.     Then he knew how much his mind and body had suffered: when he orderedtime to resume, nothing happened.     His heart sank. He wasn't afraid of death, and he knew that if he diedthe oceans would roll again and his friends would move about. But hewanted to see them safe.     He tried to clear his mind for supreme effort. There was no      urging     time to start. He knew he couldn't persuade it by bits and pieces,first slowly then full ahead. Time either progressed or it didn't.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]         It was a fine day at the beach       for Purnie's game\u2014but his new       friends played very rough!        Purnie ran laughing and shouting through the forest until he could runno more. He fell headlong into a patch of blue moss and whooped withdelight in having this day free for exploring. He was free to see theocean at last.     When he had caught his breath, he looked back through the forest. Nosign of the village; he had left it far behind. Safe from the scrutinyof brothers and parents, there was nothing now to stop him from goingto the ocean. This was the moment to stop time.     On your mark! he shouted to the rippling stream and its orangewhirlpools. He glanced furtively from side to side, pretending thatsome object might try to get a head start. Get set! he challengedthe thin-winged bees that hovered over the abundant foliage. Stop!He shrieked this command upward toward the dense, low-hanging purpleclouds that perennially raced across the treetops, making one wonderhow tall the trees really were.     His eyes took quick inventory. It was exactly as he knew it would be:the milky-orange stream had become motionless and its minute whirlpoolshad stopped whirling; a nearby bee hung suspended over a paka plant,its transparent wings frozen in position for a downward stroke; and theheavy purple fluid overhead held fast in its manufacture of whorls andnimbi.     With everything around him in a state of perfect tableau, Purniehurried toward the ocean.     If only the days weren't so short! he thought. There was so much tosee and so little time. It seemed that everyone except him had seenthe wonders of the beach country. The stories he had heard from hisbrothers and their friends had taunted him for as long as he couldremember. So many times had he heard these thrilling tales that now,as he ran along, he could clearly picture the wonderland as though hewere already there. There would be a rockslide of petrified logs toplay on, the ocean itself with waves higher than a house, the comicalthree-legged tripons who never stopped munching on seaweed, and manykinds of other wonderful creatures found only at the ocean.     He bounced through the forest as though the world was reserved thisday just for him. And who could say it wasn't? he thought. Wasn't thishis fifth birthday? He ran along feeling sorry for four-year-olds, andeven for those who were only four and a half, for they were babies andwouldn't dare try slipping away to the ocean alone. But five!     I'll set you free, Mr. Bee\u2014just wait and see! As he passed one ofthe many motionless pollen-gathering insects he met on the way, he tookcare not to brush against it or disturb its interrupted task. WhenPurnie had stopped time, the bees\u2014like all the other creatures hemet\u2014had been arrested in their native activities, and he knew that assoon as he resumed time, everything would pick up where it had left off.   <doc-sep> Purnie took in these sounds with perplexed concern. He sensed theimploring quality of the creature with the rope, but he didn't knowwhat he was supposed to do. He cocked his head to one side as hewiggled in anticipation.     He saw the noose spinning down toward his head, and, before he knewit, he had scooted out of the circle and up the sandy beach. He wassurprised at himself for running away. Why had he done it? He wondered.Never before had he felt this fleeting twinge that made him want toprotect himself.     He watched the animals huddle around the box on the beach, theirattention apparently diverted to something else. He wished now that hehad not run away; he felt he had lost his chance to join in their fun.     Wait! He ran over to his half-eaten lunch, picked it up, and ran backinto the little crowd. I've got my lunch, want some?     The party came to life once more. His friends ran this way and that,and at last Purnie knew that the idea was to get him into the box.He picked up the spirit of the tease, and deliberately ran within afew feet of the lead box, then, just as the nearest pursuer was aboutto push him in, he sidestepped onto safer ground. Then he heard adeafening roar and felt a warm, wet sting in one of his legs.     Forbes, you fool! Put away that gun!     There you are, boys. It's all in knowing how. Just winged him, that'sall. Now pick him up.     The pang in his leg was nothing: Purnie's misery lay in his confusion.What had he done wrong? When he saw the noose spinning toward himagain, he involuntarily stopped time. He knew better than to use thispower carelessly, but his action now was reflex. In that split secondfollowing the sharp sting in his leg, his mind had grasped in alldirections to find an acceptable course of action. Finding none, it hadordered the stoppage of time.     The scene around him became a tableau once more. The noose hungmotionless over his head while the rest of the rope snaked its way intransverse waves back to one of the two-legged animals. Purnie draggedhimself through the congregation, whimpering from his inability tounderstand.     As he worked his way past one creature after another, he tried at firstto not look them in the eye, for he felt sure he had done somethingwrong. Then he thought that by sneaking a glance at them as he passed,he might see a sign pointing to their purpose. He limped by one who hadin his hand a small shiny object that had been emitting smoke from oneend; the smoke now billowed in lifeless curls about the animal's head.He hobbled by another who held a small box that had previously made ahissing sound whenever Purnie was near. These things told him nothing.Before starting his climb up the knoll, he passed a tripon which, trueto its reputation, was comical even in fright. Startled by the loudexplosion, it had jumped four feet into the air before Purnie hadstopped time. Now it hung there, its beak stuffed with seaweed and itsthree legs drawn up into a squatting position.     Leaving the assorted statues behind, he limped his way up the knoll,torn between leaving and staying. What an odd place, this oceancountry! He wondered why he had not heard more detail about the beachanimals.     Reaching the top of the bluff, he looked down upon his silent friendswith a feeling of deep sorrow. How he wished he were down there playingwith them. But he knew at last that theirs was a game he didn't fitinto. Now there was nothing left but to resume time and start thelong walk home. Even though the short day was nearly over, he knew hedidn't dare use time-stopping to get himself home in nothing flat. Hisfatigued body and clouded mind were strong signals that he had alreadyabused this faculty.  "

        "Query": "What part does Purnie play in the BEACH SCENE story?",
        "Summary_1": "Although Purnie is an animal and not a human, he plays a very important role in the story. Through his understanding of the world, we learn that he has never felt real fear before. This makes sense because although he has been warned about stopping time, and he has explicitly been told that it could lead to his death, he decides to go ahead with his birthday plan anyway and stop time and see the ocean. When the humans throw a noose at him in an attempt to capture him, he is shocked to find that his body instinctively runs from it. He doesn\u2019t really experience the fear because he wants to play with them and has no interest in leaving the fun, but his natural impulses as an animal save his life at this moment. Humans have never before visited his planet, so this means that no other animal Purnie has come in contact with has made his body react this way. \nPurnie also demonstrates how evil Forbes is for trying to capture and kill such an innocent and caring animal. When Benson reminds Forbes that it\u2019s illegal to shoot or capture Purnie, Forbes does not care at all. He wants the animal that is emitting radiation because he believes he can make a profit off of him. The value of Purnie\u2019s life means nothing to him. However, as soon as Purnie feels as though his \u201cfriends\u201d are in danger, he is willing to risk his own life by stopping time to help them. Purnie feels guilt, regret, and sorrow when he accidentally causes the petrified logs to fall on the men, yet Forbes has none of those feelings when he shoots Purnie in the leg and causes him pain. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Purnie celebrates his fifth birthday by taking his first-ever trip to the beach to take in the sights and meet new friends with the animals his brothers have told him about. Purnie is a small, kangaroo-like creature with the ability to stop time and an extremely upbeat and friendly attitude. Not only does he want to be friends with every animal he encounters, but he also wants to share his lunch with them and show them his ability to do a headstand. Purnie lives in harmony with the forest and its creatures and contrasts with the human explorers who come to lay claim to his planet. Purnie uses his time-stopping ability to extend his birthday because he feels there is not enough time in the day to enjoy all the wonders life has to offer. When he encounters the humans, he is curious because he has never seen their kind before. He listens to the funny sounds they make and follows them persistently, trying to share his lunch with them and demonstrate his headstand. When Forbes orders the men to capture him, Purnie believes they are simply playing a game, and he obliges by evading them. Even after Forbes shoots him, Purnie maintains his positive view of the humans and is more confused by what he did wrong than he is hurt by his actions. This further demonstrates Purnie's naivete and purity of heart. Although his family had warned him about the fatal danger of using his time-stopping powers for too long, Purnie cares more about the survival of the humans he perceives to be his friends and therefore sacrifices his own life to save them when they are crushed by the petrified logs.",
        "Summary_3": "Purnie is a mischievous creature with the ability to stop and restart time who innocently causes a tragedy that he then tries to set right. Purnie is out for a day of exploration for his birthday when he comes across the humans on the beach. The humans have no interest in him until they discover Purnie is radioactive; then Forbes, the man financing the expedition and claiming the planet as his, orders them to put Purnie in one of their lead boxes. He is excited that animals are radioactive because they can reproduce and provide him with an endless supply of radioactive material to make him extremely wealthy. Purnie doesn\u2019t know this, of course, and tries to engage the men in play with him. When he realizes they want him near the box, he teasingly runs close to it then away again. When Forbes shoots Purnie, Purnie sees the noose coming toward his head and instinctively stops times. This allows him to evade capture, make his way atop the bluff, and watch from a safe distance once he restarts time. The men are puzzled at Purnie\u2019s sudden disappearance but plan to catch him when they see him on the bluff. As they approach, Purnie accidentally triggers a rockslide of the petrified logs that spill onto the men, trapping them where they are. Purnie is horrified at what he has caused as he hears the men\u2019s cries of pain. He also notices that the tide is coming in, and the men will drown, so he stops time again, removes the logs from the men, and drags them onto the beach where they will be safe. After everyone is safe, Purnie restarts time, and men are incredulous to find themselves suddenly freed from the logs and on the beach. Forbes goes insane. Before they leave, Benson goes back to look for Purnie and offers to help him if he is wounded.\n",

Purnie\u2019s role is of childlike wonder in trying to interact with what it thinks are new friends along the shoreline - while those very friends attempt to capture and kill it. \n\nBecause Purnie is unable to communicate with humans, it also acts as a mime-like guide to the story, providing many physical actions that convey its emotions rather than language. Purnie\u2019s ability to start and stop time creates pause for the reader to exist in the moments of great emotion that Purnie experiences - joy adventuring to the beach, confusion in trying to be captured, horror in thinking it has killed the humans. Ultimately, this superpower drains Purnie to the point of death.\n",
        "Article": "   BEACH SCENE     By MARSHALL KING     Illustrated by WOOD     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Galaxy Magazine October 1960.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]         It was a fine day at the beach       for Purnie's game\u2014but his new       friends played very rough!        Purnie ran laughing and shouting through the forest until he could runno more. He fell headlong into a patch of blue moss and whooped withdelight in having this day free for exploring. He was free to see theocean at last.     When he had caught his breath, he looked back through the forest. Nosign of the village; he had left it far behind. Safe from the scrutinyof brothers and parents, there was nothing now to stop him from goingto the ocean. This was the moment to stop time.     On your mark! he shouted to the rippling stream and its orangewhirlpools. He glanced furtively from side to side, pretending thatsome object might try to get a head start. Get set! he challengedthe thin-winged bees that hovered over the abundant foliage. Stop!He shrieked this command upward toward the dense, low-hanging purpleclouds that perennially raced across the treetops, making one wonderhow tall the trees really were.     His eyes took quick inventory. It was exactly as he knew it would be:the milky-orange stream had become motionless and its minute whirlpoolshad stopped whirling; a nearby bee hung suspended over a paka plant,its transparent wings frozen in position for a downward stroke; and theheavy purple fluid overhead held fast in its manufacture of whorls andnimbi.     With everything around him in a state of perfect tableau, Purniehurried toward the ocean.     If only the days weren't so short! he thought. There was so much tosee and so little time. It seemed that everyone except him had seenthe wonders of the beach country. The stories he had heard from hisbrothers and their friends had taunted him for as long as he couldremember. So many times had he heard these thrilling tales that now,as he ran along, he could clearly picture the wonderland as though hewere already there. There would be a rockslide of petrified logs toplay on, the ocean itself with waves higher than a house, the comicalthree-legged tripons who never stopped munching on seaweed, and manykinds of other wonderful creatures found only at the ocean.     He bounced through the forest as though the world was reserved thisday just for him. And who could say it wasn't? he thought. Wasn't thishis fifth birthday? He ran along feeling sorry for four-year-olds, andeven for those who were only four and a half, for they were babies andwouldn't dare try slipping away to the ocean alone. But five!     I'll set you free, Mr. Bee\u2014just wait and see! As he passed one ofthe many motionless pollen-gathering insects he met on the way, he tookcare not to brush against it or disturb its interrupted task. WhenPurnie had stopped time, the bees\u2014like all the other creatures hemet\u2014had been arrested in their native activities, and he knew that assoon as he resumed time, everything would pick up where it had left off.   <doc-sep> Purnie took in these sounds with perplexed concern. He sensed theimploring quality of the creature with the rope, but he didn't knowwhat he was supposed to do. He cocked his head to one side as hewiggled in anticipation.     He saw the noose spinning down toward his head, and, before he knewit, he had scooted out of the circle and up the sandy beach. He wassurprised at himself for running away. Why had he done it? He wondered.Never before had he felt this fleeting twinge that made him want toprotect himself.     He watched the animals huddle around the box on the beach, theirattention apparently diverted to something else. He wished now that hehad not run away; he felt he had lost his chance to join in their fun.     Wait! He ran over to his half-eaten lunch, picked it up, and ran backinto the little crowd. I've got my lunch, want some?     The party came to life once more. His friends ran this way and that,and at last Purnie knew that the idea was to get him into the box.He picked up the spirit of the tease, and deliberately ran within afew feet of the lead box, then, just as the nearest pursuer was aboutto push him in, he sidestepped onto safer ground. Then he heard adeafening roar and felt a warm, wet sting in one of his legs.     Forbes, you fool! Put away that gun!     There you are, boys. It's all in knowing how. Just winged him, that'sall. Now pick him up.     The pang in his leg was nothing: Purnie's misery lay in his confusion.What had he done wrong? When he saw the noose spinning toward himagain, he involuntarily stopped time. He knew better than to use thispower carelessly, but his action now was reflex. In that split secondfollowing the sharp sting in his leg, his mind had grasped in alldirections to find an acceptable course of action. Finding none, it hadordered the stoppage of time.     The scene around him became a tableau once more. The noose hungmotionless over his head while the rest of the rope snaked its way intransverse waves back to one of the two-legged animals. Purnie draggedhimself through the congregation, whimpering from his inability tounderstand.     As he worked his way past one creature after another, he tried at firstto not look them in the eye, for he felt sure he had done somethingwrong. Then he thought that by sneaking a glance at them as he passed,he might see a sign pointing to their purpose. He limped by one who hadin his hand a small shiny object that had been emitting smoke from oneend; the smoke now billowed in lifeless curls about the animal's head.He hobbled by another who held a small box that had previously made ahissing sound whenever Purnie was near. These things told him nothing.Before starting his climb up the knoll, he passed a tripon which, trueto its reputation, was comical even in fright. Startled by the loudexplosion, it had jumped four feet into the air before Purnie hadstopped time. Now it hung there, its beak stuffed with seaweed and itsthree legs drawn up into a squatting position.     Leaving the assorted statues behind, he limped his way up the knoll,torn between leaving and staying. What an odd place, this oceancountry! He wondered why he had not heard more detail about the beachanimals.     Reaching the top of the bluff, he looked down upon his silent friendswith a feeling of deep sorrow. How he wished he were down there playingwith them. But he knew at last that theirs was a game he didn't fitinto. Now there was nothing left but to resume time and start thelong walk home. Even though the short day was nearly over, he knew hedidn't dare use time-stopping to get himself home in nothing flat. Hisfatigued body and clouded mind were strong signals that he had alreadyabused this faculty.   <doc-sep> Purnie worked his way down the hill, imploring them to save themselves.The sounds they made carried a new tone, a desperate foreboding ofdeath.     Rhodes! Cabot! Can you hear me?     I\u2014I can't move, Captain. My leg, it's.... My God, we're going todrown!     Look around you, Cabot. Can you see anyone moving?     The men on the beach are nearly buried, Captain. And the rest of ushere in the water\u2014     Forbes. Can you see Forbes? Maybe he's\u2014 His sounds were cut off by awavelet gently rolling over his head.     Purnie could wait no longer. The tides were all but covering one of theanimals, and soon the others would be in the same plight. Disregardingthe consequences, he ordered time to stop.     Wading down into the surf, he worked a log off one victim, then hetugged the animal up to the sand. Through blinding tears, Purnie workedslowly and carefully. He knew there was no hurry\u2014at least, not as faras his friends' safety was concerned. No matter what their conditionof life or death was at this moment, it would stay the same way untilhe started time again. He made his way deeper into the orange liquid,where a raised hand signalled the location of a submerged body. Thehand was clutching a large white banner that was tangled among thelogs. Purnie worked the animal free and pulled it ashore.     It was the one who had been carrying the shiny object that spit smoke.     Scarcely noticing his own injured leg, he ferried one victim afteranother until there were no more in the surf. Up on the beach, hestarted unraveling the logs that pinned down the animals caught there.He removed a log from the lap of one, who then remained in a sittingposition, his face contorted into a frozen mask of agony and shock.Another, with the weight removed, rolled over like an iron statue intoa new position. Purnie whimpered in black misery as he surveyed thechaotic scene before him.     At last he could do no more; he felt consciousness slipping away fromhim.     He instinctively knew that if he lost his senses during a period oftime-stopping, events would pick up where they had left off ... withouthim. For Purnie, this would be death.

        "Query": "What triggers Forbes' madness in the BEACH SCENE?",
        "Summary_1": "Forbes believes he can control anyone and anything he comes in contact with. His first order of business upon landing on the gorgeous planet is to put up his flag emblazoned with his name. When Benson reminds him that the crew members are interested in taking a moment to look around, Forbes reprimands him for suggesting that they have the right to waste his money. He believes that putting up his flag is a symbol of defeat, and he is incredibly eager to take over a planet he literally just landed on and knows almost nothing about. He incessantly talks about the 17 other planets he has already conquered, and he calls himself a pioneer. Although Forbes definitely makes a lot of money by claiming these planets, he is more interested in the control and fame it brings him than the money he will inevitably make. \nThe first time that Purnie freezes time to escape the noose after Forbes shoots him in the leg, Forbes is incredibly confused but willing to blame the glitch on Benson. He shot Purnie after explicitly being told not to, so he assumes that Benson secretly managed to aid Purnie in getting away. He is furious at this act because capturing the animal emitting radiation is very important to him. He doesn't care if it\u2019s illegal or immoral. He wants control of the planet, the animal, and the crew. \nThe second time that Purnie freezes time, Forbes cannot simply ignore it. He knows that he saw the petrified logs falling down the hill, he knows that he saw several crew members pinned under the logs, about to drown, and he knows that he himself was in a near-death situation one second and saved in the next. There is simply no explanation in his mind for what occurred, and his brain can\u2019t compute the mysterious event. He laughs hysterically because he can\u2019t process the information that his brain receives. He was about to die, and now he is perfectly fine, and he has no explanation for the chain of events. \n",
        "Summary_2": "When Forbes shoots Purnie in an effort to try to capture him and bring him back to Earth to exploit his radiation for profit, Purnie instinctively triggers his ability to stop time. He uses this opportunity to retreat back to his perch atop the pile of petrified logs. When he unfreezes time again, Forbes and the rest of the crew are astonished as it appears he has disappeared right before their eyes and reappeared atop the logs. As Purnie moves across the log pile, the logs begin to slip and roll down toward the beach, crushing the men and pinning them to the beach. As the surf begins to cover them, Purnie fears they will drown, pauses time, and begins to save them one-by-one as he slowly bleeds out and expends his energy. Once he has removed the logs from all of the crew members, including Forbes, he once more retreats to the top of the hill and collapses, exhausted. His mind un-freezes time, and the men are once more flabbergasted as it appears the logs have disappeared from their bodies in the blink of an eye. Purnie has saved them, but the experience is too baffling and too overwhelming for Forbes to process. He goes mad, and the men carry him away back to the ship.",
        "Summary_3": "Forbes goes mad after Purnie stops time, removes the petrified logs from the men, and moves them up to the beach out of reach of the water so they won't drown. All of the men knew that the logs were so heavy they could not have moved them. And because the men don't know that time can be stopped, they have no idea how they moved from where they were or how the logs were pulled off them. After time resumes, Forbes is seen sitting in the water, talking about his seventeen planets that will do anything that he says. However, he says this planet has a mind of its own. Forbes is astonished that the rocks seemingly moved on their own. Forbes laughs continually and comments that he will hold Benson personally responsible. The men speculate that Forbes will never be the same after this experience. In fact, they take his gun so he can\u2019t shoot any of them, and they tie his hands before they take him back to the ship. \n",
        "Summary_4": "When Purnie stops time on two occasions - escaping from being put in the lead box, and saving the crew from death under fallen rocks - it creates a disappearing act that Forbes cannot wrap his head around. Forbes thinks he is rooted in reality, and then all of a sudden Purnie no longer exists, or the entire crew has been saved by what must have been superhuman strength to move petrified logs off their bodies.\n\nWhen Forbes can\u2019t make sense of mysteriously being rescued from near-death in the ocean, he doesn\u2019t know what is real any more. He goes mad into a giddiness of having done what he considers capturing this strange and wonderful planet for himself.\n",

My God, he's\u2014he's gone.     Then another of the animals, the one with the smoking thing in hishand, ran a few steps toward the noose, stopped and gaped at the rope.All right, you people, what's going on here? Get him in that box. Whatdid you do with him?     The resumption of time meant nothing at all to those on the beach, forto them time had never stopped. The only thing they could be sure ofwas that at one moment there had been a fuzzy creature hopping aroundin front of them, and the next moment he was gone.     Is he invisible, Captain? Where is he?     Up there, Captain! On those rocks. Isn't that him?     Well, I'll be damned!     Benson, I'm holding you personally responsible for this! Now thatyou've botched it up, I'll bring him down my own way.     Just a minute, Forbes, let me think. There's something about thatfuzzy little devil that we should.... Forbes! I warned you about thatgun!     Purnie moved across the top of the rockpile for a last look at hisfriends. His weight on the end of the first log started the slide.Slowly at first, the giant pencils began cascading down the shortdistance to the sand. Purnie fell back onto solid ground, horrified atthe spectacle before him. The agonizing screams of the animals belowfilled him with hysteria.     The boulders caught most of them as they stood ankle-deep in the surf.Others were pinned down on the sand.     I didn't mean it! Purnie screamed. I'm sorry! Can't you hear? Hehopped back and forth near the edge of the rise, torn with panic andshame. Get up! Please get up! He was horrified by the moans reachinghis ears from the beach. You're getting all wet! Did you hear me?Please get up. He was choked with rage and sorrow. How could he havedone this? He wanted his friends to get up and shake themselves off,tell him it was all right. But it was beyond his power to bring itabout.     The lapping tide threatened to cover those in the orange surf.   <doc-sep> Purnie took in these sounds with perplexed concern.

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in HUNT the HUNTER?",
        "Summary_1": "\nExtrone is a very important person of influence who is on a hunting trip looking for farn beasts on an outer planet. He has hired guides, Ri and Mia, who are businessmen who have successfully shot a farn beast on a prior private trip. They attempted to conceal their killing of a farn beast on that trip, however, the word got out and now Extrone has forced them (seemingly against their will) to be the guides for his own trip. Ri and Mia do not turn out to be very good guides. Mia is unsupportive of Extrone and suspicious of his activities and potential plans to violently attack the aliens, and Ri is fearful of that talk and of Extrone himself causing him to be unhelpful as a guide.\n\nExtrone refers to being loved by his \u201csubjects\u201d suggesting he has a position of royalty or power. The military is at his disposal and seem eager to please him. He is highly focused on finding and killing a farn beast any way possible - and attempts sacrificing his guide Ri as bait for the animal to do it. He kills Mia by shooting him in the back after Ri accuses him of intent to kill Extrone, suggesting Extrone is a violent ruler.\n\nExtrone\u2019s focus is on killing a farn beast and this blinds him to the existence of an alien trap on the planet. It is heavily implied that the aliens have intentions to do harm to Extrone, and it is revealed that his fixation on the farn beast led him directly into a trap set by the aliens to capture him.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Extrone, a prominent leader of the humans, has taken his hunting party to track down a farn beast, a newly-discovered creature. His guides are two businessman, Ri and Mia, who were the first to come across and kill a farn beast. They are there begrdugingly, but their fear of Extrone is clear. They arrive on the wrong side of the ridge and are searching for a way to cross it to reach the farn beasts. Ri hears the cough of a farn beast on their side, and Extrone is pleased they won\u2019t have to waste time crossing the ridge. They set up camp there, and Extrone asks Mia and Ri to scout ahead and find farn beast tracks. No one is armed, except for Extrone, so Mia and Ri are extremely cautious not to get too far into the beasts\u2019 territory. They\u2019re sweating as they come across land marred by a rocket\u2019s blast off probably from a year ago. They theorize that it\u2019s the people who discovered the beasts, though they don\u2019t know who. \nRi reveals that they shot their guide after finding the farn beast, but not their pilot. They bicker a little, scared of Extrone and the possibility of him killing them afterward. They agree to hide the blast area from him, but inform him they found tracks instead. A rocket flies over the camp, looking for Extrone. They land near and tell Extrone that an alien ship was spotted on this planet. They were unable to destroy it at the time. Extrone gives out orders to destroy it and then sends them away. Extrone asserts his dominance over Ri after they return. Ri and Mia rest in their sleeping bags, discussing what they need to do about Extrone. \nThe next morning, Extrone\u2019s personal bearer, Lin, presents alien information about the farn beasts. They begin their trek into the forest, people cutting the way for Extrone who managed to kill one small animal with his weapon. Extrone\u2019s men were able to shoot down the alien ship. Lin finds a spoor and leads Extrone to it, revealing on the way that the farn beasts are great hunters. Extrone decides to use Ri as bait to draw the beasts to him. \nWhen he informs Ri of his decision, Ri betrays Mia in a way to guarantee his safety. So, Extrone kills Mia and then uses Ri as bait anyway. After stringing him up and torturing him, his screams eventually draw the farn beast near. A farn beast and its mate appear and charge Ri. The story ends with Extrone holding fire as the farn beast nears, and the alien trap being sprung. \n",
        "Summary_3": "General Extrone is on a hunting trip to kill a farn. To help him track the farn, he has hired two businessmen, Ri and Mia, who actually killed the first farn, which Extrone resents; he wanted to kill the first one. While Ri and Mia are out tracking the farn beast, they talk about how much they hate working for Extrone since he is a self-centered, egotist who cares nothing about anyone except himself. After Ri and Mia killed their farn, they killed their guide to keep word from getting out about it. Now they wonder if their pilot was the one who told others about it. Mia points out to Ri that Extrone might just shoot them after the hunt is over, but Ri says Extrone wouldn\u2019t do that because they aren\u2019t a couple of nobodies. Meanwhile, a low-flying rocket passes overhead and lands; it is part of Extrone\u2019s Ninth Fleet with news that an alien ship has been sighted near the planet where the general is hunting. Extrone refuses to leave with them for someplace safer, instead making it clear he expects them to take care of the problem. Ri and Mia return to camp, and Extrone has Ri give him an update. Extrone makes it clear that the two businessmen had better not have killed the last farn beast and then make Ri say he knows and loves Extrone. Later than night, Mia tells Ri he is afraid Extrone will kill them before he lets them return to civilization. Mia points out lies that Extrone has told, such as that the army tried to plot against him; Mia figured out that the army was helping him. He also thinks Extrone cut off trade with the aliens because he is getting ready to invade them. The next day, Extrone talks with his personal bearer, Lin, who has read an alien manual about the farn beast. When Extrone complains about Ri and Mia, Lin keeps telling him facts about the farn beast. Extrone allows Lin to disagree with him, but Lin always follows his statement with \u201cSir.\u201d Hunting later that day, Lin spies a spoor and shows it to Extrone. When they hear the farn cough, Lin says it\u2019s a good thing they are downwind; otherwise the farn beast would track them down. This gives Extrone the idea of using a human for bait and chooses Ri. When Ri realizes what is planned, he tells Extrone that Mia has been talking about killing Extrone. Extrone shoots Mia and still uses Ri for bait, which does lure two farn beasts. Instead of killing them, Extrone waits to see what they will do. The the aliens spring their trap.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Ri and Mia are two businessmen hired as guides by Extrone, a violent, though popular leader, on his mission to hunt farn beasts. They were hired because of their success killing a farn beast during one of their Hunting Club missions. Soon after their arrival on the planet where the hunt takes place, Ri hears a farn beast cough while plotting their course with Extrone, and Extrone sends him and Mia into the forest to track it. Ri and Mia bemoan the fact that they have been hired for this purpose in spite of the fact that neither of them is a professional guide; they merely have hunted a farn beast in the past. As they track the beast, they discover a blast area and cannot identify the source of it, although they do know it wasn't created by one of the Hunting Club's rockets. When they make their way back to camp, they worry about if Extrone will kill them after the hunt in order to keep the discovery of the farn beasts a secret despite the fact that rumors of their existence had already spread. Extrone has killed others in the past. Back at camp, a group of high-ranking officers from the Ninth Fleet visit Extrone to warn him about the presence of a nearby alien spacecraft, fearing it is seeking him out to exterminate him. Extrone orders them to destroy it and scoffs at the idea that he might not be safe on this planet. After the officers leave, Extrone calls Ri into his tent and admits he needs him because he has never seen a farn beast and would have hunted them on alien planets (where he has heard they hunt them frequently) had it been safe for him to do so. It is clear from his conversation with Ri that Extrone is loved by his constituents and hated by his alien enemies. When Ri joins Mia later, they again discuss their fear of being killed after the hunt, and Mia suggests the army purposefully installed Extrone as puppet leader during the anti-military rebellion in order to gain popular support for their eventual attack on the alien system. Ri refuses to believe Mia's theories whether out of fear or denial; either way, Ri and Mia guides Extrone's hunt the next morning, joined by Extrone's personal bearer Lin and several other attendants. Lin warns a dismissive Extrone of the dangers of the farn beasts, and Extrone decides to use Ri as bait to lure them to their spot. In a panic, Ri tells Extrone to use Mia instead, since he had plotted to kill Extrone. Without missing a beat, Extrone kills Mia and continues to use Ri as bait. Lin and Extrone hideaway as Ri screams and draws the farn beasts to their location. Suddenly, the aliens the Ninth Fleet officers had warned Extrone about spring their trap. They had been using Extrone as bait to catch the farn beasts themselves.",
        "Article": "It was Mia's turn to shrug. Whoever they were, they couldn't have beenhunters. They'd have kept the secret better.     We didn't do so damned well.     We didn't have a chance, Mia objected. Everybody and his brother hadheard the rumor that farn beasts were somewhere around here. It wasn'tour fault Extrone found out.     I wish we hadn't shot our guide, then. I wish he was here instead ofus.     Mia shook perspiration out of his eyes. We should have shot our pilot,too. That was our mistake. The pilot must have been the one who toldExtrone we'd hunted this area.     I didn't think a Club pilot would do that.     After Extrone said he'd hunt farn beasts, even if it meant going tothe alien system? Listen, you don't know.... Wait a minute.     There was perspiration on Ri's upper lip.           I     didn't tell Extrone, if that's what you're thinking, Mia said.     Ri's mouth twisted. I didn't say you did.     Listen, Mia said in a hoarse whisper. I just thought. Listen. Tohell with how he found out. Here's the point. Maybe he'll shoot us,too, when the hunt's over.     Ri licked his lips. No. He wouldn't do that. We're not\u2014not justanybody. He couldn't kill us like that. Not even      him     . And besides,why would he want to do that? It wouldn't do any good to shoot us. Toomany people already know about the farn beasts. You said that yourself.     Mia said, I hope you're right. They stood side by side, studying theblast area in silence. Finally, Mia said, We better be getting back.     What'll we tell him?     That we saw tracks. What else can we tell him?     They turned back along their trail, stumbling over vines.     It gets hotter at sunset, Ri said nervously.     The breeze dies down.     It's screwy. I didn't think farn beasts had this wide a range. Theremust be a lot of them, to be on both sides of the ridge like this.     There may be a pass, Mia said, pushing a vine away.     Ri wrinkled his brow, panting. I guess that's it. If there were a lotof them, we'd have heard something before we did. But even so, it'sdamned funny, when you think about it.

Ri looked away from his face.     Perhaps I'm envious of your reputation as a hunter. You see, I havenever killed a farn beast. In fact, I haven't      seen     a farn beast.     Ri glanced nervously around the tent, his sharp eyes avoiding Extrone'sglittering ones. Few people have seen them, sir.     Oh? Extrone questioned mildly. I wouldn't say that. I understandthat the aliens hunt them quite extensively ... on some of theirplanets.     I meant in our system, sir.     Of course you did, Extrone said, lazily tracing the crease of hissleeve with his forefinger. I imagine these are the only farn beastsin our system.     Ri waited uneasily, not answering.     Yes, Extrone said, I imagine they are. It would have been a shame ifyou had killed the last one. Don't you think so?     Ri's hands worried the sides of his outer garment. Yes, sir. It wouldhave been.     Extrone pursed his lips. It wouldn't have been very considerate of youto\u2014But, still, you gained valuable experience. I'm glad you agreed tocome along as my guide.     It was an honor, sir.     Extrone's lip twisted in wry amusement. If I had waited until it wassafe for me to hunt on an alien planet, I would not have been able tofind such an illustrious guide.     ... I'm flattered, sir.     Of course, Extrone said. But you should have spoken to me about it,when you discovered the farn beast in our own system.     I realize that, sir. That is, I had intended at the first opportunity,sir....     Of course, Extrone said dryly. Like all of my subjects, he wavedhis hand in a broad gesture, the highest as well as the lowest slave,know me and love me. I know your intentions were the best.     Ri squirmed, his face pale. We do indeed love you, sir.     Extrone bent forward.       Know     me and love me.     Yes, sir.      Know     you and love you, sir, Ri said.     Get out! Extrone said.   <doc-sep> What is it you wish? he barked. I understood in my discussions withthe other ... ah ... civilian there'd be no further need for theseirritating conferences.     I've just learned you're placing more students abroad, Mr. Gulver. Howmany this time?     Two thousand.     And where will they be going?     Croanie. It's all in the application form I've handed in. Your job isto provide transportation.     Will there be any other students embarking this season?     Why ... perhaps. That's Boge's business. Gulver looked at Retief withpursed lips. As a matter of fact, we had in mind dispatching anothertwo thousand to Featherweight.     Another under-populated world\u2014and in the same cluster, I believe,Retief said. Your people must be unusually interested in that regionof space.     If that's all you wanted to know, I'll be on my way. I have matters ofimportance to see to.     After Gulver left, Retief called Miss Furkle in. I'd like to have abreak-out of all the student movements that have been planned under thepresent program, he said. And see if you can get a summary of whatMEDDLE has been shipping lately.     Miss Furkle compressed her lips. If Mr. Magnan were here, I'm surehe wouldn't dream of interfering in the work of other departments.I ... overheard your conversation with the gentleman from the CroanieLegation\u2014     The lists, Miss Furkle.     I'm not accustomed, Miss Furkle said, to intruding in mattersoutside our interest cluster.     That's worse than listening in on phone conversations, eh? But nevermind. I need the information, Miss Furkle.     Loyalty to my Chief\u2014     Loyalty to your pay-check should send you scuttling for the materialI've asked for, Retief said. I'm taking full responsibility. Nowscat.     The buzzer sounded. Retief flipped a key. MUDDLE, Retief speaking....     Arapoulous's brown face appeared on the desk screen.     How-do, Retief. Okay if I come up?     Sure, Hank. I want to talk to you.     In the office, Arapoulous took a chair. Sorry if I'm rushing you,Retief, he said. But have you got anything for me?     Retief waved at the wine bottles. What do you know about Croanie?     Croanie? Not much of a place. Mostly ocean. All right if you likefish, I guess. We import our seafood from there. Nice prawns in monsoontime. Over a foot long.     You on good terms with them?     Sure, I guess so. Course, they're pretty thick with Boge.     So?     Didn't I tell you? Boge was the bunch that tried to take us over herea dozen years back. They'd've made it too, if they hadn't had a lot ofbad luck. Their armor went in the drink, and without armor they're easygame.     Miss Furkle buzzed. I have your lists, she said shortly.     Bring them in, please.  "

        "Query": "\"What does the farn beast represent and why is it important in HUNT the HUNTER?\"",
        "Summary_1": "The farn beast is capable of killing humans and aliens. It resides on alien planets, but is rare within the human-occupied system. It is thought by Extrone that Ri may have been one of the only humans to ever see and shoot one.\n\nThey are described as having long fangs and being carnivorous. Their main sound is a coughing noise, which can be used to locate how far away they are. They do indeed seem attracted to humans, as they are drawn to Ri screaming when he is placed as bait at the watering hole.\n\nThe farn beast is significant, because as Extrone and his party are focused on hunting them, it is revealed that the beast itself is being used as bait by aliens to lure Extrone to the planet. \n",
        "Summary_2": "The farn beast is a newly-discovered creature. Although they are newly discovered by humans, aliens have known about them for some time. They are a dangerous and terrifying animal with long fangs and red beady eyes. After two businessman discovered and killed the beast on their hunting trip, it soon became the new adventure each man must attempt. The farn beasts in this story are being hunted by a party led by Extrone, an extremely powerful man. The hunt for the farn beast reveals Extrone\u2019s true colors as he kills Mia, one of his guides, and uses the other guide, Ri, as bait to kill a farn beast. The farn beasts also act as a great plot progressor and keep the characters moving forward. ",
        "Summary_3": "The farn beast is the whole reason for the expedition in the story, and it is Extrone\u2019s obsession, so much so that he pays no attention to his army intelligence about aliens in the area near the planet where he is hunting. The farn beast is a rare creature that has only been seen by a few humans and only recently been killed by humans. They wanted to keep it a secret, so they killed their guide before returning home. Now General Extrone wants to kill a farn beast, and he is forcing the two men who killed the last one to be his guides to find one. He is angry that the two men didn\u2019t tell him about finding and killing one. The farn beast is distinguishable by its coughing roar and is known to be dangerous to humans. They are carnivorous, have long, sharp fangs, and when angered, can tear a man apart. They charge when they detect the scent, sight, or sound of prey and will track and hunt down a man even if it takes all day. After Extrone uses one of his guides as bait, two farn beasts are drawn to it. They have tiny eyes that are red and full of hatred; they swing their heads wildly and flare their nostrils in anger. Their tails thrash against the flora of the forest. When Ri screams, the farn cross the watering hole directly toward him. The story says this is when the aliens spring their trap.",
        "Summary_4": "The farn beasts are dangerous, carnivorous creatures with small, red eyes, long, sharp fangs, and tails. Although their behavior is largely unpredictable, they are able to dismember men and aliens alike when they are angry. They also have excellent tracking skills and will pursue the scene, sight, or sound of their prey for as long as a day. Lin calls them the \"particular enemy of men\" although they are also frequently hunted by aliens. As members of the Hunting Club, Ri and Mia hunt a farn beast, and this successful kill draws the attention of Extrone, who hires them as his guides to hunt farn beasts himself. Farn beasts emit loud coughs, which is how Ri determines one of them is nearby in the first place. Later, Lin and Extrone realize there are multiple farn beasts nearby on their hunt when they hear multiple coughs. Extrone's alien enemies not only hunt the farn beasts, but they have also developed a manual for identifying and understanding them; they clearly understand the beasts much better than Extrone. This works to their advantage later as they use Extrone and Lin as bait to spring a trap to catch the farn beasts they were hunting.\n",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      Of course using live bait is the best     way to lure dangerous alien animals ...     unless it turns out that you are the bait!      We're somewhat to the south, I think, Ri said, bending over the crudefield map. That ridge, he pointed, on our left, is right here. Hedrew a finger down the map. It was over here, he moved the finger,over the ridge, north of here, that we sighted them.     Extrone asked, Is there a pass?     Ri looked up, studying the terrain. He moved his shoulders. I don'tknow, but maybe they range this far. Maybe they're on this side of theridge, too.     Delicately, Extrone raised a hand to his beard. I'd hate to lose a daycrossing the ridge, he said.     Yes, sir, Ri said. Suddenly he threw back his head. Listen!     Eh? Extrone said.     Hear it? That cough? I think that's one, from over there. Right upahead of us.     Extrone raised his eyebrows.     This time, the coughing roar was more distant, but distinct.     It is! Ri said. It's a farn beast, all right!     Extrone smiled, almost pointed teeth showing through the beard. I'mglad we won't have to cross the ridge.     Ri wiped his forehead on the back of his sleeve. Yes, sir.     We'll pitch camp right here, then, Extrone said. We'll go after ittomorrow. He looked at the sky. Have the bearers hurry.     Yes, sir.     Ri moved away, his pulse gradually slowing. You, there! he called.Pitch camp, here!     He crossed to Mia, who, along with him, had been pressed into Extrone'sparty as guides. Once more, Ri addressed the bearers, Be quick, now!And to Mia, God almighty, he was getting mad. He ran a hand under hiscollar. It's a good thing that farn beast sounded off when it did. I'dhate to think of making him climb that ridge.     Mia glanced nervously over his shoulder. It's that damned pilot'sfault for setting us down on this side. I told him it was the otherside. I told him so.     Ri shrugged hopelessly.     Mia said, I don't think he even saw a blast area over here. I think hewanted to get us in trouble.     There shouldn't be one. There shouldn't be a blast area on this sideof the ridge, too.     That's what I mean. The pilot don't like businessmen. He had it in forus.     Ri cleared his throat nervously. Maybe you're right.     It's the Hunting Club he don't like.     I wish to God I'd never heard of a farn beast, Ri said. At least,then, I wouldn't be one of his guides. Why didn't he hire somebodyelse?  "

        "Query": "How would you describe the dynamic between Lin and Extrone in HUNT the HUNTER?",
        "Summary_1": "Lin is Extrone\u2019s personal bearer who does anything that is asked of him by Extrone. Extrone is pleased when people are fearful of him, but it appears that Lin may not have a fear or may be suppressing it. \n\nLin appears very loyal to Extrone, which is proven when he rejects an attempt of bribery by Ri who wants to know if he is in danger by Extrone\u2019s plan. Lin does Extrone\u2019s bidding by tying up Ri and staking him out for bait to lure the farn beast.\nHowever, when Lin and Extrone hide in a nearby tree to shoot the farn beast when they come after Ri, Lin\u2019s actions become more sinister and it is revealed that he may have different beliefs from Extrone. Lin says hunting animals should be done for reasons like survival, not just for killing - which is the opposite of what Extrone believes - that the waiting and then the killing is the appeal. It is never clear if Lin is part of the alien trapping of Extrone that results, or whether he was as blind to it as Extrone.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Extrone is the head hunter and hotshot of this particular expedition. It seems as though he holds a monopoly over humanity through his control of the Army. Lin is his right-hand man and personal bearer. Lin is one of the few in the camp who will challenge Extrone, but not in an obvious way. He presents information to him in a way that is subtle and not demeaning, usually aided by his addition of the word \u201cSir,\u201d at the end of a sentence. Extrone respects what Lin has to say, possibly through him proving himself over and over, and even chooses not to kill him when he says something contradictory. Lin presents the manual on farn beasts to Extrone, who hates that it\u2019s developed by aliens. Lin explains how dangerous and fast these beasts are and remains calm and impassive when Extrone tries to challenge him. \nLater on, Lin discovers a spoor close to where the farn beasts are living. He races back to tell Extrone, and the two of them journey together alone. On this trip, Lin reveals that the farn beasts are excellent trackers and hunters, which inspires Extrone to set up bait for the beasts. \nIn the end, however, there seems to be a change in Lin\u2019s composure. While discussing Extrone\u2019s love for hunting, Lin claims that no one should hunt for fun, only out of necessity. He argues a little with Extrone, until the farn beasts arrive. Perhaps this signals that Lin is not as loyal to Extrone as we are led to believe. \n",
        "Summary_3": "While the two men don\u2019t completely accept each other, they seem to be more accepting of each other than the other characters. In a position of authority, a leader cannot afford to be too friendly with those under him; however, Extrone takes this concept to the extreme and is downright hateful and hard to tolerate. The only person he is somewhat civil to is Lin, and even then, his civility is limited. Extrone treats other people in a very arrogant manner, barking orders at them (\u201cYou! Hey! Bring me a drink!\u201d), making veiled threats (\u201cIt would be a shame if you had killed the last one. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d), and treating them as if they are utterly useless. With Lin, however, Extrone allows him to respectfully disagree with him or contradict him. Extrone acknowledges that very few people will stand up to him like Lin does, and yet it may be Lin\u2019s manner of doing so that enables him to get away with this. Lin does not act afraid of Extrone, and when Extrone drones on about the way people disrespect him, Lin focuses on the topic at hand, the farn beast. When Extrone confronts him about contradicting him, Lin affects an impassive response rather than kowtowing to him. And when Lin says people should only hunt when they have to for food, Extrone says people should hunt for the love of hunting. Lin names it \u201ckilling,\u201d but Extrone corrects him with \u201chunting.\u201d Lin drops the topic as if he knows better than to debate Extrone.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Lin has been Extrone's personal bearer for a while, having accompanied him on several expeditions such as the one on Meizque, and he does Extrone's bidding. However, he is also intelligent and clever and understands how to say the right thing to Extrone to get the reaction he wants; he appears emotionally unaffected by Extrone's bombastic behavior and is matter-of-fact in most of his actions. Lin does his best to educate Extrone about the characteristics and known behavior of the farn beasts and their potential danger to humans. Lin is practical and encourages proper precautions when they get closer to the farn beasts; he guides Extrone to the farn beasts more effectively than Ri and Mia. Lin wrangles Ri when Extrone orders him to be used as bait to catch the farn beasts. For his part, Extrone treats Lin with the same dismissiveness and condescension that he treats any of his associates. However, he does have some amount of deference for Lin and, although he does not absorb much of the information Lin tries to give him, he does listen to much of his practical advice when pursuing the farn beasts.",
        "Article": "A farn beast coughed, far in the matted forest.     Extrone laughed nervously. He must have heard.     We're lucky to rouse one so fast, Lin said.     Extrone dug his boot cleats into the tree, braced himself. I likethis. There's more excitement in waiting like this than in anything Iknow.     Lin nodded.     The waiting, itself, is a lot. The suspense. It's not only the killingthat matters.     It's not      only     the killing, Lin echoed.     You understand? Extrone said. How it is to wait, knowing in just aminute something is going to come out of the forest, and you're goingto kill it?     I know, Lin said.     But it's not only the killing. It's the waiting, too.     The farn beast coughed again; nearer.     It's a different one, Lin said.     How do you know?     Hear the lower pitch, the more of a roar?     Hey! Extrone shouted. You, down there. There are two coming. Nowlet's hear you really scream!     Ri, below, whimpered childishly and began to retreat toward the tethertree, his eyes wide.     There's a lot of satisfaction in fooling them, too, Extrone said.Making them come to your bait, where you can get at them. Heopened his right hand. Choose your ground, set your trap. Bait it.He snapped his hand into a fist, held the fist up before his eyes,imprisoning the idea. Spring the trap when the quarry is inside.Clever. That makes the waiting more interesting. Waiting to see if theyreally will come to your bait.     Lin shifted, staring toward the forest.     I've always liked to hunt, Extrone said. More than anything else, Ithink.     Lin spat toward the ground. People should hunt because they have to.For food. For safety.     No, Extrone argued. People should hunt for the love of hunting.     Killing?     Hunting, Extrone repeated harshly.   <doc-sep> With morning came birds' songs, came dew, came breakfast smells.The air was sweet with cooking and it was nostalgic, childhoodlike,uncontaminated.     And Extrone stepped out of the tent, fully dressed, surly, letting theflap slap loudly behind him. He stretched hungrily and stared aroundthe camp, his eyes still vacant-mean with sleep.     Breakfast! he shouted, and two bearers came running with a foldingtable and chair. Behind them, a third bearer, carrying a tray ofvarious foods; and yet behind him, a fourth, with a steaming pitcherand a drinking mug.     Extrone ate hugely, with none of the delicacy sometimes affected in hisconversational gestures. When he had finished, he washed his mouth withwater and spat on the ground.     Lin! he said.     His personal bearer came loping toward him.     Have you read that manual I gave you?     Lin nodded. Yes.     Extrone pushed the table away. He smacked his lips wetly. Veryludicrous, Lin. Have you noticed that I have two businessmen forguides? It occurred to me when I got up. They would have spat on me,twenty years ago, damn them.     Lin waited.     Now I can spit on them, which pleases me.     The farn beasts are dangerous, sir, Lin said.     Eh? Oh, yes. Those. What did the manual say about them?     I believe they're carnivorous, sir.     An alien manual. That's ludicrous, too. That we have the onlyinformation on our newly discovered fauna from an alien manual\u2014and, ofcourse, two businessmen.     They have very long, sharp fangs, and, when enraged, are capable oftearing a man\u2014     An alien? Extrone corrected.     There's not enough difference between us to matter, sir. Of tearing analien to pieces, sir.     Extrone laughed harshly. It's 'sir' whenever you contradict me?     Lin's face remained impassive. I guess it seems that way. Sir.     Damned few people would dare go as far as you do, Extrone said. Butyou're afraid of me, too, in your own way, aren't you?     Lin shrugged. Maybe.     I can see you are. Even my wives are. I wonder if anyone can know howwonderful it feels to have people      all     afraid of you.     The farn beasts, according to the manual....     You are very insistent on one subject.     ... It's the only thing I know anything about. The farn beast, as Iwas saying, sir, is the particular enemy of men. Or if you like, ofaliens. Sir.     All right, Extrone said, annoyed. I'll be careful.     In the distance, a farn beast coughed.     Instantly alert, Extrone said, Get the bearers! Have some of them cuta path through that damn thicket! And tell those two businessmen to getthe hell over here!     Lin smiled, his eyes suddenly afire with the excitement of the hunt.   <doc-sep> Extrone wants to see you, Lin said.     Ri twisted at the grass shoot, broke it off, worried and unhappy.What's he want to see      me     for?     I don't know, Lin said curtly.     Ri got to his feet. One of his hands reached out, plucked nervouslyat Lin's bare forearm. Look, he whispered. You know him. I have\u2014alittle money. If you were able to ... if he wants, Ri gulped, to      do     anything to me\u2014I'd pay you, if you could....     You better come along, Lin said, turning.     Ri rubbed his hands along his thighs; he sighed, a tiny sound,ineffectual. He followed Lin beyond an outcropping of shale to whereExtrone was seated, petting his rifle.     Extrone nodded genially. The farn beast hunter, eh?     Yes, sir.     Extrone drummed his fingers on the stock of the blast rifle. Tell mewhat they look like, he said suddenly.     Well, sir, they're ... uh....     Pretty frightening?     No, sir.... Well, in a way, sir.     But      you     weren't afraid of them, were you?     No, sir. No, because....     Extrone was smiling innocently. Good. I want you to do something forme.     I ... I.... Ri glanced nervously at Lin out of the tail of his eye.Lin's face was impassive.     Of      course     you will, Extrone said genially. Get me a rope, Lin. Agood, long, strong rope.     What are you going to do? Ri asked, terrified.     Why, I'm going to tie the rope around your waist and stake you out asbait.     No!     Oh, come now. When the farn beast hears you scream\u2014you      can     scream,by the way?     Ri swallowed.     We could find a way to make you.     There was perspiration trickling down Ri's forehead, a single drop,creeping toward his nose.     You'll be safe, Extrone said, studying his face with amusement. I'llshoot the animal before it reaches you.     Ri gulped for air. But ... if there should be more than one?     Extrone shrugged.     I\u2014Look, sir. Listen to me. Ri's lips were bloodless and his handswere trembling. It's not me you want to do this to. It's Mia, sir.      He     killed a farn beast before      I     did, sir. And last night\u2014lastnight, he\u2014     He what? Extrone demanded, leaning forward intently.     Ri breathed with a gurgling sound. He said he ought to kill you, sir.That's what he said. I heard him, sir. He said he ought to kill you.He's the one you ought to use for bait. Then if there was an accident,sir, it wouldn't matter, because he said he ought to kill you. Iwouldn't....     Extrone said, Which one is he?     That one. Right over there.     The one with his back to me?     Yes, sir. That's him. That's him, sir.     Extrone aimed carefully and fired, full charge, then lowered the rifleand said, Here comes Lin with the rope, I see.     Ri was greenish. You ... you....     Extrone turned to Lin. Tie one end around his waist.     Wait, Ri begged, fighting off the rope with his hands. You don'twant to use me, sir. Not after I told you.... Please, sir. If anythingshould happen to me.... Please, sir. Don't do it.     Tie it, Extrone ordered.     No, sir. Please. Oh,      please     don't, sir.     Tie it, Extrone said inexorably.     Lin bent with the rope; his face was colorless.  "

        "Query": "In what locations does the story of HUNT the HUNTER occur?",
        "Summary_1": "On the surface of a planet which is wooded in scrub forest and one of the few places known to have farn beasts. The hunting party is next to a ridge that would be a significant effort to cross, and there are \u201cblast sites\u201d around the woods. The hunting party also uses a nearby water hole location to lure farn beasts while hiding up in a tree.\n\nExtrone\u2019s camp set up by \u201cbearers\u201d and his tent, which is extravagantly decorated, are also scenes used throughout the story.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Hunt the Hunter by Kris Neville takes place on a mostly unexplored planet inhibited by the farn beast and other creatures. The coughing roar of the farn beast can often be heard in the distance. Great sprawling vines, trees, and bushes cover the land, and the heat is oppressive in its thickness. It only gets hotter, too. Once the sun goes down, the breeze dies off too, leaving just stale heat in its wake. There is a ridge separating the humans and the farn beasts, and the humans spend their time searching for the pass. \nRocket blast-off marks cover the ground in some places. Other spots are watering holes, lakes, and rivers, perfect for the creatures living on this land.  \nRi and Mia sleep in sleeping bags on the ground when they pitch camp. However, Extrone has a luxurious tent equipped with electric lights, tiled floors, and a feather bed. A crystal chain hangs from the front opening too. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The story takes place on an unnamed outer planet where the characters are involved in hunting for the farn beast. At the same time, alien space ships are seen nearby, and the military wants Extrone to return to an inner planet where he will be safer. The unnamed planet has many features that support wildlife and include land features such as ridges. We know that, in addition to farn beasts, there are birds and arboreal creatures in the forest. The forests are thick with many trees, and it is sweltering, especially in the forest where the foliage stops outside air from entering. There are dense thickets that the men have to hack in order for Extrone to pass through the area. There are gently swaying grasses in some areas, and in the mornings, they can hear the birds singing. While Extrone sleeps in a luxurious tent, the other men sleep under the sky where a smooth-surfaced moon hangs, bisected into twin hemispheres by a central mountain range. The drinking hole is where they see the farns\u2019 prints and where Extrone has Ri tied to a tree to serve as bait.\n\tAnother setting within this setting is Extrone\u2019s tent. Inside it is absolutely luxurious. The bedding is composed of feathers and is surrounded by silk curtains. The flooring is made of tile blocks that have been transported to the planet and laid neatly and smoothly in the ground to create an even floor. There is a chain of crystals hanging from the top of the tent, and the electric lights are powered by a portable dynamo. Extrone seems to have every luxury available to him.\n",
        "Summary_4": "The primary action of the story takes place on an unnamed planet, where Extrone and his entourage travel to hunt farn beasts. They make camp in a field of grass next to a scrub forest somewhere in the southern region and there is a ridge to their north over which they previously sighted farn beasts. The forest is hot and dense and filled with trees and vines. Military officers from the Ninth Fleet visit Extrone to provide a warning about the sighting of an alien spacecraft; the officers come from the military outpost on a nearby moon. When Extrone invites Ri inside of his tent, the luxuriousness of his lifestyle highlights not only Extrone's wealth but also the glee with which he shows it off: His bed is expensive, full of heavy feathers, and flanked by silken sleep curtains. Solid tile blocks form the base of his floor, and a chain of crystals hangs in the middle of the tent to the left of a thin, hand-carved pole. Electric light brightens the space. Juxtaposed with Extrone's extravagancies, Mia and Ri sleep in sleeping bags under a gnarled tree. During the hunt for the farn beast, Extrone and Lin discover farn beast tracks in a muddy waterhole, and this is where they tie Ri to the base of a scaling tree.",
        "Article": "It was Mia's turn to shrug. Whoever they were, they couldn't have beenhunters. They'd have kept the secret better.     We didn't do so damned well.     We didn't have a chance, Mia objected. Everybody and his brother hadheard the rumor that farn beasts were somewhere around here. It wasn'tour fault Extrone found out.     I wish we hadn't shot our guide, then. I wish he was here instead ofus.     Mia shook perspiration out of his eyes. We should have shot our pilot,too. That was our mistake. The pilot must have been the one who toldExtrone we'd hunted this area.     I didn't think a Club pilot would do that.     After Extrone said he'd hunt farn beasts, even if it meant going tothe alien system? Listen, you don't know.... Wait a minute.     There was perspiration on Ri's upper lip.           I     didn't tell Extrone, if that's what you're thinking, Mia said.     Ri's mouth twisted. I didn't say you did.     Listen, Mia said in a hoarse whisper. I just thought. Listen. Tohell with how he found out. Here's the point. Maybe he'll shoot us,too, when the hunt's over.     Ri licked his lips. No. He wouldn't do that. We're not\u2014not justanybody. He couldn't kill us like that. Not even      him     . And besides,why would he want to do that? It wouldn't do any good to shoot us. Toomany people already know about the farn beasts. You said that yourself.     Mia said, I hope you're right. They stood side by side, studying theblast area in silence. Finally, Mia said, We better be getting back.     What'll we tell him?     That we saw tracks. What else can we tell him?     They turned back along their trail, stumbling over vines.     It gets hotter at sunset, Ri said nervously.     The breeze dies down.     It's screwy. I didn't think farn beasts had this wide a range. Theremust be a lot of them, to be on both sides of the ridge like this.     There may be a pass, Mia said, pushing a vine away.     Ri wrinkled his brow, panting. I guess that's it. If there were a lotof them, we'd have heard something before we did. But even so, it'sdamned funny, when you think about it.     Mia looked up at the darkening sky. We better hurry, he said.   <doc-sep> Extrone narrowed his eyes. I see by your eyes that you areenvious\u2014that is the word, isn't it?\u2014of my tent.     Ri looked away from his face.     Perhaps I'm envious of your reputation as a hunter. You see, I havenever killed a farn beast. In fact, I haven't      seen     a farn beast.     Ri glanced nervously around the tent, his sharp eyes avoiding Extrone'sglittering ones. Few people have seen them, sir.     Oh? Extrone questioned mildly. I wouldn't say that. I understandthat the aliens hunt them quite extensively ... on some of theirplanets.     I meant in our system, sir.     Of course you did, Extrone said, lazily tracing the crease of hissleeve with his forefinger. I imagine these are the only farn beastsin our system.     Ri waited uneasily, not answering.     Yes, Extrone said, I imagine they are. It would have been a shame ifyou had killed the last one. Don't you think so?     Ri's hands worried the sides of his outer garment. Yes, sir. It wouldhave been.     Extrone pursed his lips. It wouldn't have been very considerate of youto\u2014But, still, you gained valuable experience. I'm glad you agreed tocome along as my guide.     It was an honor, sir.     Extrone's lip twisted in wry amusement. If I had waited until it wassafe for me to hunt on an alien planet, I would not have been able tofind such an illustrious guide.     ... I'm flattered, sir.     Of course, Extrone said. But you should have spoken to me about it,when you discovered the farn beast in our own system.     I realize that, sir. That is, I had intended at the first opportunity,sir....     Of course, Extrone said dryly. Like all of my subjects, he wavedhis hand in a broad gesture, the highest as well as the lowest slave,know me and love me. I know your intentions were the best.     Ri squirmed, his face pale. We do indeed love you, sir.     Extrone bent forward.       Know     me and love me.     Yes, sir.      Know     you and love you, sir, Ri said.     Get out!

We're somewhat to the south, I think, Ri said, bending over the crudefield map. That ridge, he pointed, on our left, is right here. Hedrew a finger down the map. It was over here, he moved the finger,over the ridge, north of here, that we sighted them.     Extrone asked, Is there a pass?     Ri looked up, studying the terrain. He moved his shoulders. I don'tknow, but maybe they range this far. Maybe they're on this side of theridge, too.     Delicately, Extrone raised a hand to his beard. I'd hate to lose a daycrossing the ridge, he said.     Yes, sir, Ri said. Suddenly he threw back his head. Listen!     Eh? Extrone said.     Hear it? That cough? I think that's one, from over there. Right upahead of us.     Extrone raised his eyebrows.     This time, the coughing roar was more distant, but distinct.     It is! Ri said. It's a farn beast, all right!     Extrone smiled, almost pointed teeth showing through the beard. I'mglad we won't have to cross the ridge.     Ri wiped his forehead on the back of his sleeve. Yes, sir.     We'll pitch camp right here, then, Extrone said. We'll go after ittomorrow. He looked at the sky. Have the bearers hurry.     Yes, sir.     Ri moved away, his pulse gradually slowing. You, there! he called.Pitch camp, here!     He crossed to Mia, who, along with him, had been pressed into Extrone'sparty as guides. Once more, Ri addressed the bearers, Be quick, now!And to Mia, God almighty, he was getting mad. He ran a hand under hiscollar. It's a good thing that farn beast sounded off when it did. I'dhate to think of making him climb that ridge.     Mia glanced nervously over his shoulder. It's that damned pilot'sfault for setting us down on this side. I told him it was the otherside. I told him so.     Ri shrugged hopelessly.     Mia said, I don't think he even saw a blast area over here. I think hewanted to get us in trouble.     There shouldn't be one. There shouldn't be a blast area on this sideof the ridge, too.     That's what I mean. The pilot don't like businessmen. He had it in forus.     Ri cleared his throat nervously. Maybe you're right.     It's the Hunting Club he don't like.     I wish to God I'd never heard of a farn beast, Ri said. At least,then, I wouldn't be one of his guides. Why didn't he hire somebodyelse?  "

        "Query": "How would you describe the connection between Ri and Mia in HUNT the HUNTER?",
        "Summary_1": "They are businessmen that have been recruited (seemingly against their will) as guides for Extrone on a hunting trip seeking to kill farn beasts. They had come to the same location once before on a hunting trip together in good relations, and killed their guide to keep their finding of the farn beasts a secret. Initially, they seem to be bonded in their misery about being forced into this situation by Extrone. However, this relationship changes and deteriorates over the story.\n\nMia is highly suspicious of Extrone, his possible appointment by the Army, and what he thinks is an impending invasion of the alien system to be led by Extrone. \n\nRi has had several personal meetings with Extrone and is completely terrified of him and what he is capable of. Ri rejects the notions suggested by Mia and is scared to be caught speaking of them. When Extrone threatens to put Ri out for bait to lure the farn beasts, he rats Mia out as having intention to kill Extrone in order to avoid his own death. The plan fails when Extrone kills Mia on the spot by shooting him in the back, thus ending their relationship.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Ri and Mia are two businessmen who were on a hunting trip before this current expedition. There, with their guide and pilot, they discovered the farn beast and killed at least one. Extrone hired them to be his guides on his own expedition, seeing as they found the beast in the first place. \nAfter their discovery, Ri and Mia shot their guide but left the pilot alive. This meant that the word about farn beasts spread and soon became a hot topic. Now, Ri and Mia are trapped on this planet with Extrone, a scary and powerful man, and their relationship begins to crack under the weight of all this pressure. \nMia firmly believes that Extrone will kill both of them once this expedition is over. Ri disagrees, choosing to remain optimistic. On one of their guide trips, they discover blast tracks, a sign that others have been here. They choose to not tell Extrone out of fear. \nAfter Mia divulges his plans to expose Extreone for what he really is when they return to civilization. Ri feels nervous about the prospect and tries to shut the conversation down. Later on, when Extrone calls Ri into his tent to use him as bait, Ri betrays Mia and reveals his treacherous plans. Extrone kills Mia quickly and efficiently but uses Ri as bait anyway. Despite their history as hunters and friends, Ri still betrays Mia in order to save his own skin. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Ri and Mia have a friendly camaraderie until the end of the story when Ri lies and tries to convince Extrone to use Mia as live bait for the farn beast rather than himself. Ri and Mia killed the first farn beast in their world, and when Extrone heard this, he hired them for a pittance to be his guides on a hunting expedition for the farn beast. Neither man wants to be there, but they have no choice. When Ri and Mia killed a farn beast, they killed their guide to prevent news of it from leaking, but other people still found out. Mia worries that Extrone will kill them, too, when the hunt is over, but Ri insists that they are too important for that to happen. Ri insists their friends and influence will prevent Extrone from doing that, but Mia counters that Extrone can always claim it was an accident. The two men are suspicious about how Extrone came to power, and Mia suspects that he is planning to invade the aliens and, for that reason, cut off trade with them. Ri disagrees and says the trade discontinuation was to keep an economic balance. While the two men disagree about Extrone\u2019s methods, they both agree that he is a scary guy. At the end of the story, however, when Extrone\u2019s plan to use Ri as live bait for the farn beast becomes clear to him, Ri lies and says Extrone should use Mia as bait because Mia has been talking about killing Extrone. Extrone has Ri point out Mia to him and then shoots him and still uses Ri for bait. So Ri gains nothing and causes his friend\u2019s death. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Ri and Mia are two businessmen who are hired by Extrone to serve as guides on his hunting trip because of their association with the Hunting Club and their success in killing one during a recent mission. Although they successfully hunted a farn beast in the past, they are not professional guides by any means. Despite this and the low pay that they receive for their efforts, they feel compelled to meet Extrone's demands out of fear of reprisal. Mia is more assertive and confident than Ri, and he strongly believes that Extrone is a puppet leader installed by the military to ensure the people will support future military action against the aliens. Ri, fearful and timid, does not want to believe Mia's conspiracies and espouses faith in Extrone. Mia further fears that Extrone will kill them once the hunt is over because he does not want them to reveal the location of the farn beasts. Ri's fear of Extrone takes over when Extrone wants to use him as bait to catch the farn beasts, and he throws Mia under the bus by claiming Mia has suggested assassinating Extrone. Extrone immediately kills Mia and uses Ri as bait anyway.",

Because I think the Army is getting ready to invade thealien system!     The people won't support them, Ri answered woodenly.           Think.     If he tells them to, they will. They trust him.     Ri looked around at the shadows.     That explains a lot of things, Mia said. I think the Army's beenpreparing for this for a long time. From the first, maybe. That's whyExtrone cut off our trade with the aliens. Partly to keep them fromlearning that he was getting ready to invade them, but more to keepthem from exposing      him     to the people. The aliens wouldn't be fooledlike we were, so easy.     No! Ri snapped. It was to keep the natural economic balance.     You know that's not right.     Ri lay down on his bed roll.

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in Bodyguard?",
        "Summary_1": "\nGabriel (Gabe) Lockard, an attractive man, is sitting in a bar with humans and extraterrestrials. He knocks over a man's drink while he talks to a girl. He offers to pay for a new suit, showing off his wealth. The other man reaches to throw his drink at Lockard but is stopped by a third man wearing a gray suit, who seems to know Lockard. This man warns Lockard to be careful, and when he leaves, Lockard tells the woman he's with that he's never seen him before, even though they talked as if they were acquaintances. The stranger visits a locker at a nearby airstation, puts most of his belongings inside, including all forms of identification, and sets the lock to the word \"bodyguard\". He climbs into a helicab, where he pressures the driver into taking him to a zarquil game. This man has been floating around without an identity, but operates as a flying dutchman, floating between zarquil games. Another day, Lockard crashes a helicar on a rainy fall night in a dark corner of a degrading city, and a fat stranger pulls him and his wife out of the helicar before it exploded. The man who saved them has the ID of Dominic Bianchi, a milgot dealer who seems to have disappeared in the past few weeks. Mrs. Lockard warns her husband to be more careful lest something happen to him. It seems the stranger's job is to rotate identities and protect Lockard. On yet another day, a thin stranger chases off a thief with his gun, and checks in on Mr. and Mrs. Lockard. Mrs. Lockard realizes that he is the same man who pulled them out of their aircar crash, and was the man wearing the gray suit at the bar. He has been changing bodies this whole time. She wants to know why, but the stranger suggests she ask Gabriel. She suspects they've been running from this stranger, and has started to be able to identify him, which the stranger is disappointed by as he explains it is not Gabriel he is helping. Because Gabriel is going to run-down cities, the bodies the stranger is getting are not well-vetted, and can't last too long. It turns out the stranger was the original Gabriel Lockard, the implication being that he's trying to protect his original body. As the stranger tries to swap bodies again, he finds that nobody wants the one he's in. He's offered a body that is healthy but likely a criminal, for three times the usual fee, and the stranger accepts the expensive deal. After the bodyswap, he recognizes the man as someone police are ordered to burn on sights. Mrs. Lockard interrogates her husband about his stolen body, which starts an argument. She recognizes he can't get his old body back, but lies and says she'd stay with him if he switched back, and the two talk about how ugly he was. ",
        "Summary_2": "Gabriel Lockard, a good looking man, stands at the bar with his wife. He accidentally hits another man\u2019s drink, and the ugly little man winds up to hit Gabe. However, a stranger in a gray suit interjects. Gabe\u2019s wife asks who the stranger was, and he tells her that he\u2019s never seen him before. \n\nThe stranger hails a cab  and requests to be taken to the zarquil game. The cab driver tells him that he might as well commit suicide, but the stranger insists. \n\nOn a dark and rainy night, Gabe refuses to allow his wife to drive the helicar. When they crash, the stranger, with a brand new look, is right behind them. He pulls them out of the car before it blows up. Mrs. Lockard has a feeling that she has met the stranger before, but she dismisses her thought as ludicrous. When she asks for an introduction, Gabe asks the stranger for his name. He pulls out an ID card with the name Dominic Bianchi on it and explains that Bianchi lost all of his money a few weeks ago, and now he\u2019s nothing. Mrs. Lockard tries to compensate the stranger for saving their lives, but he tells her that he has plenty of money. Gabe promises to be more careful in the future.\n\nThe stranger then makes his way to the zarquil game, which is an illegal activity. The game is run by the Vinzz, and it is very expensive to play. While there, he gains a new body, and this time he has small, angular features. \n\nLater, the stranger approaches Gabe, laying on the ground in an alleyway, and his distressed wife. Mrs. Lockard recognizes the skinny stranger as the same man that has been following them and saving their lives. He admits that he is all of them, and she realizes that the stranger is playing in the zarquil games. The stranger calls a cab so that Gabe won\u2019t freeze to death outside, once again saving his life. \n\nThe stranger then goes to a zarquil game to change his appearance again. The Vinzz tries to turn him away because his body is in poor condition, but he asserts that he has lots of money to fork over. The alien offers him the body of a criminal. The stranger agrees to take the body, and he finds it to be very handsome. He recognizes the new face he wears as one that belongs to a man who will be burned immediately by any police officer he encounters. \n\nMrs. Lockard tells Gabe that she knows that the stranger who has been chasing them is the real Gabe Lockard, and he wants his body back. When the man in Lockard\u2019s body becomes defensive, she assures him that she would stay with him regardless of what his actual body looks like. He has zero interest in returning to his old body, and his wife says it\u2019s sad that he can\u2019t buy a new personality as well. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The story takes place in a reality where humans can trade bodies through a game called zarquil, thus taking on the physical appearance of a new person while someone else gets their old body. The premise is that the body of Gabriel Lockard is actually inhabited by an unknown person. His wife, Helen, is the one to unravel the story as she begins to discover that \u201cstrangers\u201d (the real Gabe inhabiting the bodies of strangers, changing form repeatedly through the story) keep coming to their rescue. \nThe \u201cstrangers\u201d that Helen starts to realize are a single person (Gabe\u2019s consciousness) changing bodies over time appear when the arrogant and incredibly handsome body of Gabriel Lockard: gets a drink thrown in his face at a bar, crashes his vehicle into a tower with Helen as a passenger, and when he is face down unconscious in an alley. \nHelen first realizes what is happening when the \u201cstrangers\u201d seem deeply concerned that Gabe remain alive. Through their interactions, she comes to realize that Gabe is not actually in his own body, and that the real Gabe is following his body around like a bodyguard, resentful of the person in there and not wanting any harm to come to what he considers his perfect physique. \nThe stranger continues to change forms throughout the story to evade detection by Gabe, though Helen foils that plan. He also does this for the reason of wanting to inhabit a body as perfect as he believes his original body was, hoping to \u201ctrade up\u201d to a body he finds suitable through the process. The last body switch he makes is a dark deal into the body of a wanted criminal that is very handsome and fit. He is happy with the outcome as he thinks he may be able to get away with the crimes this body committed with his cunning wit.\nThe story closes with Helen confronting the body of Gabe with an unknown person inside, in which he confirms that what she knows is true. The person inside Gabe is unkind to her and does not treat her well, and the story ends with her in this predicament, having to make a choice whether to stay or go.\n",
        "Summary_4": " In a bar with his wife, Gabriel Lockard draws attention to himself with his good looks and arrogance. Lockard gestures expansively, bumping another man and spilling his drink on his suit, knocking his glass to the floor. Condescendingly, Lockard offers to buy him another drink and pay his cleaning bill. When the man starts to throw his fresh drink on Lockard, he is stopped by a stranger in a gray suit. Lockard and the man in the gray suit talk as if they know each other; Lockard acknowledges the stranger is useful to have around, and the stranger, noticing signs of Lockard\u2019s aging, comments Lockard soon might not be worth saving. \nAfter following Lockard to his hotel, the stranger takes a cab to the zarquil games to change his body, something he does after every encounter with Lockard. In the meantime, Gabe and Mrs. Lockart go out in a helicar. When Mrs. Lockart suggests she drive because Gabe is drunk, he insists on driving. He crashes the helicar, and the stranger, now a fat man, rescues him and his wife from the helicar just before it catches on fire. Gabe introduces his wife, and the stranger mysteriously states, \u201cI hope you\u2019ll be worthy of the name.\u201d He takes the Lockards back to their hotel and then goes to the zarquil games again.\nAs a slim, sickly man, the stranger rescues Lockard and his wife from a would-be thief. Lockard is unconscious while Mrs. Lockard and the stranger discuss the situation. She realizes he is the same person who keeps protecting Gabe but exchanging bodies over and over and wants to know why he does it; the stranger says she should ask her husband. He acknowledges Mrs. Lockard is in a difficult situation with her marriage, stating, \u201cToo bad he got married anyway for your sake.\u201d When Mrs. Lockard wants to know why the stranger protects Gabriel, he encourages her to ask her husband. \nWhen the stranger tries to change bodies again, he is first told his diseased body makes him ineligible but then is offered a game where all he knows is the other body is a healthy male. He suspects this means the other person is a criminal but accepts the offer anyway, knowing he will assume responsibility for the crimes the other identity had committed. The stranger ends up with a \u201cfine\u201d new body that is handsome in a dark way, but the stranger recognizes the face as someone wanted by the police.\nMrs. Lockard confronts her husband about knowing the stranger better than he claimed. She asks if he would consider taking his original body back, and Gabe states she would then be the real Gabriel Lockart\u2019s wife. She claims she would stay with her husband\u2019s soul but knows this is a lie. He claims anything would be better than the hulk of his original body; Mrs. Lockard comments it\u2019s a shame he could only change his body or his character, not both. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t",

        "Query": "What role does Mrs. Lockard play in the story Bodyguard?",
        "Summary_1": "The young woman who Lockard is sitting with at the bar at the beginning of the story is the woman who would eventually become his wife. Her name is Helen, but she is mostly referred to as Mrs. Lockard. By the time the helicar crash happens, they have been married, and by the time they are almost robbed, they have been married six months. Her role is most clear when she is talking to the stranger after the robbery. She is the one who explicitly pieces together that the stranger she has seen, although varying in form at each event, has been the same person. The gray suit, the fat man, and the scrawny man have all been the same person. It is her perspective that changes Lockard's life and his possible path for the future, and the two of them have been on the run from the stranger the whole time they've been married. She gets enough information from the stranger to be able to confront her husband about what's happening, allowing her to uncover the whole story.",
        "Summary_2": "\nMrs. Lockard is Gabe\u2019s wife of six months. She is a very good-looking woman with a penchant for furs. She does not realize that the Gabe Lockard she knows is not the true Gabe Lockard until she uncovers the mystery of why a shape-changing stranger is always saving their lives. Mrs. Lockard is not part of the seedy underclass, so she has little awareness of the zarquil games and would not know to be on the lookout for an intruder in her husband\u2019s body. \n\nEven before she realizes that the man she is married to is a liar, she is deeply unhappy in the marriage. At one point, the stranger who is chasing them, the real Gabe Lockard, notices that her face is bruised beneath her makeup. She is being abused by her husband, and she feels as though she has no way out of the relationship. Mrs. Lockard also complains that she has been forced to run from these strangers ever since she married Gabe. He won't tell her anything, so she is forced to figure everything out on her own, and she now recognizes that she is constantly on the run. When the real Gabe Lockard says that it\u2019s a pity that she\u2019s married, she agrees with him. \n\nThroughout her many interactions with the stranger that saves Gabe\u2019s life, Mrs. Lockard asks a lot of tough questions. She is very intelligent and continues to seek the truth even when she\u2019s being ignored. Her persistence pays off because the real Gabe Lockard admits to her that he is the same person in all of the strangers\u2019 bodies. She is then able to approach her husband with the information she has uncovered. When she tells him that she knows what\u2019s really going on, she suggests that he go back to his old body and promises to stay with him. She discovers how vain and immoral he is when he tells her that would never happen; he had the worst body before and he has zero intention of living in it again. Mrs. Lockard tells him that it\u2019s too bad he can\u2019t get a new personality. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Helen Lockard is the wife of Gabe. She is significant because she guides the story and unravels the mysterious plot line of her husband trading bodies. She also has a significant role in attempting to enact justice upon the person that came to inhabit Gabe\u2019s body, though the reader does not see this situation fully resolved.\n\nAs the story\u2019s guide, she discovers that the strangers following her and her husband continue to rescue them from the harmful situations that Gabe places them in. She realizes the strangers are actually a single person (Gabe\u2019s consciousness) that has been taking different bodily forms by playing zarquil and following his real body around.\n\nShe often assumes Gabe is lying to her, and even considers escaping her marriage by entering a game of zarquil to become someone else. When she discovers that the body of Gabe actually has the consciousness of another person in it, she confronts them. Although she is demeaned and taunted, her motivations are set on seeking justice for Gabe.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Mrs. Lockard is first described as \u201cthe girl\u201d with Gabriel Lockard in the bar. Gabriel is extremely good-looking and draws a lot of attention because of his looks. Compared to him, Mrs. Lockard almost looks plain. She has been married to Gabe for six months. Her husband is rude, coarse, and self-centered, and she regrets marrying him. He isn\u2019t above striking her cheek violently when they argue. For instance, Mrs. Lockard tries to get along with Gabe, gently offering to drive the helicar when Gabe has had too much to drink. After she sees the stranger at the bar, and he rescues her from the wrecked helicar, she begins to think the stranger is familiar, although he looks different each time she sees him. After the stranger saves her and Gabe from the thief, she opens up to the stranger and confesses she feels like Gabe is looking for trouble. This is also when she realizes the stranger is definitely the same person from the bar, the wreck, and now the attempted theft. She opens up to the stranger and admits that Gabe is running from something. She wonders what it would be like to change bodies with another person in a zarquil game and escape from Gabriel, but she realizes her body is a good one and would hate to give it up. She begins to realize how closely connected the stranger is to her and Gabe. She accepts the stranger, although his significance is a secret her husband keeps from her, and her acceptance spurs the stranger to admit that his current body, thin and sickly, will only last another four or five months. She later asks her husband why he doesn\u2019t give up the body, and he skeptically accuses her of wanting to be the real Gabe\u2019s wife because then her husband would be sound in mind and body. She denies thinking of herself with the real Gabe and says she would stay with her husband in his \u201creal\u201d body. When her husband admits he doesn\u2019t know where his real body is and thinks whoever has it might have killed himself after looking in the mirror, Mrs. Lockard comments that his real body must have matched his character and that it is a shame he could only change one of them, not both. Her husband realizes that she is dissatisfied with him, and her interaction with the stranger helps her see her husband as he really is. Compared to her husband, the stranger is much kinder, more honest, and stable. \n",

So he went to the nearest airstation. There he inserted acoin in a locker, into which he put most of his personal possessions,reserving only a sum of money. After setting the locker to respond tothe letter combination      bodyguard     , he went out into the street.     If he had met with a fatal accident at that point, there would havebeen nothing on his body to identify him. As a matter of fact, no realidentification was possible, for he was no one and had been no one foryears.     The nondescript man hailed a cruising helicab. Where to, fellow-man?the driver asked.     I'm new in the parish, the other man replied and let it hang there.     Oh...? Females...? Narcophagi...? Thrill-mills?     But to each of these questions the nondescript man shook his head.     Games? the driver finally asked, although he could guess what waswanted by then. Dice...? Roulette...? Farjeen?     Is there a good zarquil game in town?     The driver moved so he could see the face of the man behind him in theteleview. A very ordinary face. Look, colleague, why don't you commitsuicide? It's cleaner and quicker.     I can't contact your attitude, the passenger said with a thinsmile. Bet you've never tried the game yourself. Each time ithappens, there's a ... well, there's no experience to match it at athrill-mill. He gave a sigh that was almost an audible shudder, andwhich the driver misinterpreted as an expression of ecstasy.     Each time, eh? You're a dutchman then? The driver spat out of thewindow. If it wasn't for the nibble, I'd throw you right out of thecab. Without even bothering to take it down even. I hate dutchmen ...anybody with any legitimate feelings hates 'em.     But it would be silly to let personal prejudice stand in the way of acommission, wouldn't it? the other man asked coolly.     Of course. You'll need plenty of foliage, though.     I have sufficient funds. I also have a gun.     You're the dictator, the driver agreed sullenly.      II     It was a dark and rainy night in early fall. Gabe Lockard was in nocondition to drive the helicar. However, he was stubborn.     Let me take the controls, honey, the light-haired girl urged, but heshook his handsome head.     Show you I can do something 'sides look pretty, he said thickly,referring to an earlier and not amicable conversation they had held,and of which she still bore the reminder on one thickly made-up cheek.     Fortunately the car was flying low, contrary to regulations, so thatwhen they smashed into the beacon tower on the outskirts of the littletown, they didn't have far to fall. And hardly had their car crashedon the ground when the car that had been following them landed, and ashort fat man was puffing toward them through the mist.     To the girl's indignation, the stranger not only hauled Gabe out ontothe dripping grass first, but stopped and deliberately examined theyoung man by the light of his minilume, almost as if she weren't thereat all. Only when she started to struggle out by herself did he seem toremember her existence. He pulled her away from the wreck just a momentbefore the fuel tank exploded and the 'copter went up in flames.     Gabe opened his eyes and saw the fat man gazing down at himspeculatively. My guardian angel, he mumbled\u2014shock had sobered hima little, but not enough. He sat up. Guess I'm not hurt or you'd havethrown me back in.     And that's no joke, the fat man agreed.     The girl shivered and at that moment Gabriel suddenly seemed to recallthat he had not been alone. How about Helen? She on course?     Seems to be, the fat man said. You all right, miss? he asked,glancing toward the girl without, she thought, much apparent concern.           Mrs.     , Gabriel corrected. Allow me to introduce you to Mrs. GabrielLockard, he said, bowing from his seated position toward the girl.Pretty bauble, isn't she?     I'm delighted to meet you, Mrs. Gabriel Lockard, the fat man said,looking at her intently. His small eyes seemed to strip the make-upfrom her cheek and examine the livid bruise underneath. I hopeyou'll be worthy of the name. The light given off by the flamingcar flickered on his face and Gabriel's and, she supposed, hers too.Otherwise, darkness surrounded the three of them.     There were no public illuminators this far out\u2014even in town thelights were dimming and not being replaced fast enough nor by thenewer models. The town, the civilization, the planet all were old andbeginning to slide downhill....     Gabe gave a short laugh, for no reason that she could see.   <doc-sep> It was beginning to snow. Light, feathery flakes drifted down on herhusband's immobile body. She pulled her thick coat\u2014of fur taken fromsome animal who had lived and died light-years away\u2014more closely aboutherself. The thin young man began to cough again.     Overhead a tiny star seemed to detach itself from the pale flat diskof the Moon and hurl itself upward\u2014one of the interstellar shipsembarking on its long voyage to distant suns. She wished that somehowshe could be on it, but she was here, on this solitary old world in abarren solar system, with her unconscious husband and a strange man whofollowed them, and it looked as if here she would stay ... all three ofthem would stay....     If you're after Gabriel, planning to hurt him, she asked, why thendo you keep helping him?     I am not helping      him     . And he knows that.     You'll change again tonight, won't you? she babbled. You alwayschange after you ... meet us? I think I'm beginning to be able toidentify you now, even when you're ... wearing a new body; there'ssomething about you that doesn't change.     Too bad he got married, the young man said. I could have followedhim for an eternity and he would never have been able to pick me outfrom the crowd. Too bad he got married anyway, he added, his voiceless impersonal, for your sake.     She had come to the same conclusion in her six months of marriage, butshe would not admit that to an outsider. Though this man was hardly anoutsider; he was part of their small family group\u2014as long as she hadknown Gabriel, so long he must have known her. And she began to suspectthat he was even more closely involved than that.     Why must you change again? she persisted, obliquely approaching thesubject she feared. You have a pretty good body there. Why run therisk of getting a bad one?     This isn't a good body, he said. It's diseased. Sure, nobody'ssupposed to play the game who hasn't passed a thorough medicalexamination. But in the places to which your husband has been leadingme, they're often not too particular, as long as the player has plentyof foliage.     How\u2014long will it last you?     Four or five months, if I'm careful. He smiled. But don't worry, ifthat's what you're doing; I'll get it passed on before then. It'll beexpensive\u2014that's all. Bad landing for the guy who gets it, but thenit was tough on me too, wasn't it?     But how did you get into this ... pursuit? she asked again. And whyare you doing it? People didn't have any traffic with Gabriel Lockardfor fun, not after they got to know him. And this man certainly shouldknow him better than most.     Ask your husband.     The original Gabriel Lockard looked down at the prostrate,snow-powdered figure of the man who had stolen his body and his name,and stirred it with his toe. I'd better call a cab\u2014he might freeze todeath.     He signaled and a cab came.     Tell him, when he comes to, he said to the girl as he and the driverlifted the heavy form of her husband into the helicar, that I'mgetting pretty tired of this. He stopped for a long spell of coughing.Tell him that sometimes I wonder whether cutting off my nose wouldn't,in the long run, be most beneficial for my face.  "

        "Query": "What is the importance of the man in the gray suit who is a stranger in the story Bodyguard?",
        "Summary_1": "The stranger in the gray suit at the bar in the beginning of the story happens to be the original Gabriel Lockard, and it is hinted that the original Lockard only switched bodies because the current one had convinced him to when they'd had too much to drink. The stranger is keeping an eye on the current Gabriel Lockard to protect the body from harm. He does this by participating in zarquil games, run by the alien race the Vinzz, which allows him to swap bodies with other people. If he is in a reputable area, there are careful checks to make sure that these bodies are healthy, but he ends up with a sick body partway through the story, which forces him to take the body of a criminal as his only option because nobody will buy the sick body from him. The stranger's desire to protect his original body pushes him to become obsessed with this task, and it is his only real goal. He follows Lockard throughout the story, switching bodies every time he is seen, which forces Lockard and his wife to flee from him, staying constantly on the run. Lockard is used to this stranger being around, and tries to avoid making him angry, but there is a sense that he is sick of being saved and wants to live his own life. Lockard even offers to buy the stranger a drink at the beginning to try to work something out, seemingly exhausted from being followed. His single-mindedness is shown by the fact that the stranger's password on his locker is \"bodyguard\", in reference to his original body.",
        "Summary_2": "The stranger in the gray suit is the real Gabriel Lockard. He managed to lose his body through the illegal game known as zarquil, and he desperately wants it back. The stranger thinks of himself as Gabe Lockard\u2019s bodyguard, and he uses the term as the passcode for the locker where he keeps his valuables. His life\u2019s mission is to guard Gabe\u2019s body and get it back so that he can be himself once more. In order to do this, he follows the fake Gabe Lockard and his wife around town to make sure that he is treating his body nicely. Fake Gabe Lockard frequently gets into fights, accidents, and other situations that could lead to his death or irreparably damage his body, and the stranger spends nearly all of his waking hours keeping tabs on him and rescuing him from destruction. \n\nThe stranger seems sinister at first, especially since he goes to seedy areas of town where the Vinzz run illegal zarquil games. He uses his immense wealth to purchase other peoples\u2019 bodies. However, his motivation for continuously changing bodies is to keep his secret from the fake Gabe Lockard. He does not want the man who stole his body to be able to recognize him and kill him. Although he has not found the perfect solution to his problem, he is merely doing what he can to survive, protect his true body, and try to get it back. The stranger treats Gabe\u2019s new wife well, and he even tells her the truth about his predicament. If he did not have the incredible amounts of cash he has, he would not be able to keep up with this plan. But he is able to use his money to keep buying new bodies and chasing around Gabe. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The stranger in the gray suit is just one of the embodiments of the \u201cstranger\u201d throughout the story that keeps watch over Gabe. It is revealed that this stranger is actually Gabe himself who is continuously changing physical appearance by playing zarquil. He tries to take on bodies of greater and greater physical beauty until he can find one that is as good as the body he left, which he considers to be a perfect physical form. \n\nThe stranger is significant because he ultimately provides the key information that could liberate Helen from a marriage where she is treated poorly and gets into dangerous situations that could ultimately get her killed if she stays with him. \n\nThe stranger also represents the great lengths humans are willing to go to for pursuing or maintaining physical beauty or health. The game required to change form is dangerous and illegal, but the stranger continues to return to it for the allure of a better form.\n",
        "Summary_4": "The stranger in the gray suit at the bar is the real Gabriel Lockart. He lost his body to the man who currently inhabits it in a zarquil game after having too many drinks with him, and now he follows Gabe Lockart wherever he goes and protects him whenever he is in danger. Actually, the stranger is not protecting the person in Gabe Lockart\u2019s body, but the body of Gabe Lockart. The stranger shows up in the bar and protects Gabe when another man wants to throw a drink on Gabe; he also shows up and pulls Gabe and his wife from the wreckage of their helicar. He saves them from a would-be thief and calls for a cab to take them to where they are staying to prevent Gabe from freezing to death. The stranger follows Gabe wherever he goes, protecting his body. The stranger seems to want his body and identity back, but the current Gabe will not willingly give up the body and identity because he enjoys them too much.\n",
        "Article": "   Bodyguard     By CHRISTOPHER GRIMM     Illustrated by CAVAT     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Galaxy Science Fiction February 1956.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]        When overwhelming danger is constantly present,of course       a man is entitled to have a bodyguard. The annoyance was that       he had to do it himself ... and his body would not cooperate!        The man at the bar was exceptionally handsome, and he knew it. So didthe light-haired girl at his side, and so did the nondescript man inthe gray suit who was watching them from a booth in the corner.     Everyone in the room was aware of the big young man, and most of thehumans present were resentful, for he handled himself consciously andarrogantly, as if his appearance alone were enough to make him superiorto anyone. Even the girl with him was growing restless, for she wasaccustomed to adulation herself, and next to Gabriel Lockard she wasalmost ordinary-looking.     As for the extraterrestrials\u2014it was a free bar\u2014they were merelyamused, since to them all men were pathetically and irredeemablyhideous.     Gabe threw his arm wide in one of his expansive gestures. There was ashort man standing next to the pair\u2014young, as most men and women werein that time, thanks to the science which could stave off decay, thoughnot death\u2014but with no other apparent physical virtue, for plasticsurgery had not fulfilled its bright promise of the twentieth century.     The drink he had been raising to his lips splashed all over hisclothing; the glass shattered at his feet. Now he was not only a ratherugly little man, but also a rather ridiculous one\u2014or at least he felthe was, which was what mattered.     Sorry, colleague, Gabe said lazily. All my fault. You must let mebuy you a replacement. He gestured to the bartender. Another of thesame for my fellow-man here.     The ugly man dabbed futilely at his dripping trousers with a clothhastily supplied by the management.     You must allow me to pay your cleaning bill, Gabe said, taking outhis wallet and extracting several credit notes without seeming to lookat them. Here, have yourself a new suit on me.      You could use one     was implied.     And that, coming on top of Gabriel Lockard's spectacular appearance,was too much. The ugly man picked up the drink the bartender had justset before him and started to hurl it, glass and all, into Lockard'shandsome face.   <doc-sep> Once the illuminators were extinguished in Gabriel Lockard's hotelsuite, it seemed reasonably certain to the man in the gray suit, ashe watched from the street, that his quarry would not go out againthat night. So he went to the nearest airstation. There he inserted acoin in a locker, into which he put most of his personal possessions,reserving only a sum of money. After setting the locker to respond tothe letter combination      bodyguard     , he went out into the street.     If he had met with a fatal accident at that point, there would havebeen nothing on his body to identify him. As a matter of fact, no realidentification was possible, for he was no one and had been no one foryears.     The nondescript man hailed a cruising helicab. Where to, fellow-man?the driver asked.     I'm new in the parish, the other man replied and let it hang there.     Oh...? Females...? Narcophagi...? Thrill-mills?     But to each of these questions the nondescript man shook his head.     Games? the driver finally asked, although he could guess what waswanted by then. Dice...? Roulette...? Farjeen?     Is there a good zarquil game in town?     The driver moved so he could see the face of the man behind him in theteleview. A very ordinary face. Look, colleague, why don't you commitsuicide? It's cleaner and quicker.     I can't contact your attitude, the passenger said with a thinsmile. Bet you've never tried the game yourself. Each time ithappens, there's a ... well, there's no experience to match it at athrill-mill. He gave a sigh that was almost an audible shudder, andwhich the driver misinterpreted as an expression of ecstasy.     Each time, eh? You're a dutchman then? The driver spat out of thewindow. If it wasn't for the nibble, I'd throw you right out of thecab. Without even bothering to take it down even. I hate dutchmen ...anybody with any legitimate feelings hates 'em.     But it would be silly to let personal prejudice stand in the way of acommission, wouldn't it? the other man asked coolly.     Of course. You'll need plenty of foliage, though.     I have sufficient funds. I also have a gun.     You're the dictator, the driver agreed sullenly.      II     It was a dark and rainy night in early fall. Gabe Lockard was in nocondition to drive the helicar. However, he was stubborn.     Let me take the controls, honey, the light-haired girl urged, but heshook his handsome head.     Show you I can do something 'sides look pretty, he said thickly,referring to an earlier and not amicable conversation they had held,and of which she still bore the reminder on one thickly made-up cheek.     Fortunately the car was flying low, contrary to regulations, so thatwhen they smashed into the beacon tower on the outskirts of the littletown, they didn't have far to fall. And hardly had their car crashedon the ground when the car that had been following them landed, and ashort fat man was puffing toward them through the mist.     To the girl's indignation, the stranger not only hauled Gabe out ontothe dripping grass first, but stopped and deliberately examined theyoung man by the light of his minilume, almost as if she weren't thereat all. Only when she started to struggle out by herself did he seem toremember her existence. He pulled her away from the wreck just a momentbefore the fuel tank exploded and the 'copter went up in flames.     Gabe opened his eyes and saw the fat man gazing down at himspeculatively. My guardian angel, he mumbled\u2014shock had sobered hima little, but not enough. He sat up. Guess I'm not hurt or you'd havethrown me back in.     And that's no joke, the fat man agreed.     The girl shivered and at that moment Gabriel suddenly seemed to recallthat he had not been alone. How about Helen? She on course?     Seems to be, the fat man said. You all right, miss? he asked,glancing toward the girl without, she thought, much apparent concern.           Mrs.     , Gabriel corrected. Allow me to introduce you to Mrs. GabrielLockard, he said, bowing from his seated position toward the girl.Pretty bauble, isn't she?     I'm delighted to meet you, Mrs. Gabriel Lockard, the fat man said,looking at her intently. His small eyes seemed to strip the make-upfrom her cheek and examine the livid bruise underneath. I hopeyou'll be worthy of the name. The light given off by the flamingcar flickered on his face and Gabriel's and, she supposed, hers too.Otherwise, darkness surrounded the three of them.     There were no public illuminators this far out\u2014even in town thelights were dimming and not being replaced fast enough nor by thenewer models. The town, the civilization, the planet all were old andbeginning to slide downhill....     Gabe gave a short laugh, for no reason that she could see.   <doc-sep> Playing the game was fabulously expensive; it had to be to make itprofitable for the Vinzz to run it. Those odd creatures from Altair'sseventh planet cared nothing for the welfare of the completely alienhuman beings; all they wanted was to feather their own pockets withinterstellar credits, so that they could return to Vinau and buy manyslaves. For, on Vinau, bodies were of little account, and so to themzarquil was the equivalent of the terrestrial game musical chairs.Which was why they came to Terra to make profits\u2014there has never beenbig money in musical chairs as such.     When the zarquil operators were apprehended, which was not frequent\u2014asthey had strange powers, which, not being definable, were beyond thelaw\u2014they suffered their sentences with equanimity. No Earth courtcould give an effective prison sentence to a creature whose lifespanned approximately two thousand terrestrial years. And capitalpunishment had become obsolete on Terra, which very possibly saved theterrestrials embarrassment, for it was not certain that their weaponscould kill the Vinzz ... or whether, in fact, the Vinzz merely expiredafter a period of years out of sheer boredom. Fortunately, becausetrade was more profitable than war, there had always been peace betweenVinau and Terra, and, for that reason, Terra could not bar the entranceof apparently respectable citizens of a friendly planet.     The taxi driver took the fat man to one of the rather seedy locales inwhich the zarquil games were usually found, for the Vinzz attempted toconduct their operations with as much unobtrusiveness as was possible.But the front door swung open on an interior that lacked the opulenceof the usual Vinoz set-up; it was down-right shabby, the dim olivelight hinting of squalor rather than forbidden pleasures. That wasthe trouble in these smaller towns\u2014you ran greater risks of gettinginvolved in games where the players had not been carefully screened.     The Vinoz games were usually clean, because that paid off better, but,when profits were lacking, the Vinzz were capable of sliding off intodarkside practices. Naturally the small-town houses were more likely tohave trouble in making ends meet, because everybody in the parish kneweverybody else far too well.     The fat man wondered whether that had been his quarry's motive incoming to such desolate, off-trail places\u2014hoping that eventuallydisaster would hit the one who pursued him. Somehow, such a plan seemedtoo logical for the man he was haunting.     However, beggars could not be choosers. The fat man paid off theheli-driver and entered the zarquil house. One? the small greencreature in the slightly frayed robe asked.     One, the fat man answered.      III     The would-be thief fled down the dark alley, with the hot bright raysfrom the stranger's gun lancing out after him in flamboyant but futilepatterns. The stranger, a thin young man with delicate, angularfeatures, made no attempt to follow. Instead, he bent over to examineGabriel Lockard's form, appropriately outstretched in the gutter. Onlyweighted out, he muttered, he'll be all right. Whatever possessed youtwo to come out to a place like this?     I really think Gabriel      must     be possessed.... the girl said, mostlyto herself. I had no idea of the kind of place it was going to beuntil he brought me here. The others were bad, but this is even worse.It almost seems as if he went around looking for trouble, doesn't it?     It does indeed, the stranger agreed, coughing a little. It wasgrowing colder and, on this world, the cities had no domes to protectthem from the climate, because it was Earth and the air was breathableand it wasn't worth the trouble of fixing up.     The girl looked closely at him. You look different, but you      are     thesame man who pulled us out of that aircar crash, aren't you? And beforethat the man in the gray suit? And before that...?     The young man's cheekbones protruded as he smiled. Yes, I'm all ofthem.     Then what they say about the zarquil games is true? There are peoplewho go around changing their bodies like\u2014like hats? Automatically shereached to adjust the expensive bit of blue synthetic on her moon-palehair, for she was always conscious of her appearance; if she had notbeen so before marriage, Gabriel would have taught her that.

        "Query": "What is the importance of the zarquil games mentioned in Bodyguard?",
        "Summary_1": "An alien race called the Vinzz, from Altair's seventh planet, run the zarquil games as a way to make money so that they can buy slaves. Through these games, humans are able to swap bodies so they can experience what it is like to live as someone else. People who participate frequently are known as flying dutchmen, and the stranger in the story is called this a few times. These games are illegal and dangerous, and you must have a lot of money to participate. In larger cities with more resources and oversight, all of the potential bodies go through a detailed vetting process to make sure that the body in question does not have any illnesses or a criminal past. When the stranger ends up with a sick body near the end of the story, his only option is to accept a body with a criminal past because nobody will accept an ill body at a reputable game. Public perception shows that society looks down on these games. The cab driver that the stranger meets explicitly says that he looks down on dutchmen, saying he hates them, and very reluctantly takes the stranger to a zarquil game because he is promised the money and he knows the stranger has a gun. It is this game that caused the original Gabriel Lockard to lose his body and identity, and it is through this game that he rotates through nameless people in order to follow the new Lockard to keep an eye on the body. \n",
        "Summary_2": "The zarquil games are illegally run by the Vinzz, an alien race. The illegal operation has such a terrible reputation that one of the cab drivers the stranger encounters suggests that he kill himself rather than playing. The cab driver almost refuses to bring him to the games, but he sees the amount of cash the stranger is holding and agrees to do his bidding. Many people in the society know nothing about zarquil because it\u2019s an underground game that people with good reputations do not take part in. The stranger is known as a \u201cdutchman,\u201d which is a term for someone who plays zarquil all the time for the rush of it. \n\nZarquil is an interesting phenomenon because both the victim and the perpetrator are both considered guilty. The game is very expensive to play, and that\u2019s why the Vinzz spend their time running the activity for humans. The Vinzz use the money they make to return to their home planet of Vinau and purchase slaves. The aliens rarely get in trouble for hosting the games because the Vinzz live about 2,000 years, and therefore no punishment would be worthwhile. The Vinzz are not subjected to capital punishment because the humans don\u2019t know if their weapons are good enough to kill them. \n\nMales are given male bodies, and females are given female bodies. The Vinzz do not play \u201cmixed games\u201d and switch up genders, even though there is surely a market for that. Humans are also not allowed to trade bodies with aliens. The Vinzz feel that if they successfully traded a human body for an alien one, the humans would become outraged and start a war over the matter. Some seedy zarquil games include private purchases of criminal bodies. Criminals do not pass the standard testing and must be bought in secret. \n\nThe zarquil games are an important part of the story because Gabe Lockard loses his body to the stranger in one of these illegal games. The stranger, or the real Gabe Lockard, then uses zarquil to continuously change bodies to go undetected by the fake Gabe Lockard. He wants to get his real body back, and in order to do that he must not let the fake Gabe Lockard know his true identity. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Zarquil is an extremely illegal \u201ccrime against nature\u201d sport which is akin to a game of musical chairs. Instead of trading chairs, the game is a high consequence one where humans trade bodies. Supposedly the entrants to the game have a physical health check to ensure the participants get into bodies free of disease, but this proves to not be well regulated as the stranger receives several bodies which he thinks are \u201cdiseased\u201d.\n\nThe sport is run by aliens, Vinzz, from Altair\u2019s seventh planet that have no regard for the welfare of the humans playing, only the profits. The game persists on Terra (where humans live in the story) because there is no capital punishment that can be brought upon the Vinzz, as they live over 2000 years, making prison sentences useless to discourage them from running the game.\n\nThe games are significant because they allow humans to escape their lives by changing into completely different identities. This can enable criminals to escape the law, or for a single person to follow others undetected by continuously changing appearances.\n",
        "Summary_4": "The zarquil games are an illegal activity played by people referred to as dutchmen who go from one game to another seeking the thrills they get from it. Part of the thrill of the game was the unknown; players don\u2019t know for sure what kind of body they will end up with. The games are very expensive and are run by the Vinzz, who are strange beings from Altair\u2019s seventh planet Vinau. The Vinzz have no concerns for the humans playing their games; they are running the games strictly for the money they can make from them so that they can return to Vinau and buy many slaves. The Vinzz live for around two thousand earth years and bodies mean little to them; they care nothing about a human\u2019s body. The Vinzz are not barred from coming to Earth to run their games because the trade between the two planets is so valuable that they maintain peace. In the games, people exchange bodies. The Vinzz are supposed to vet everyone who plays to make sure their bodies are healthy, but they have been known to cut corners when profits are lagging. This explains why the stranger ends up as the sickly, thin man who only has four or five months left to live. \nThe zarquil games are significant in the story because that is how the stranger lost his body and name to the current Gabe Lockard. Apparently, the stranger drank too much too many times and played the zarquil game, losing his body and identity. He continues playing the game, changing his identity after every interaction with the current Gabe. The stranger isn\u2019t sure whether he keeps changing after interacting with the current Gabe because of his interaction or because none of the subsequent bodies feel right to him. Perhaps he just wants to one day obtain a body that is as close to perfection as his original body was. \n",

She had an excellent memory for faces andhis was not included in her gallery. The girl pulled her thin jacketcloser about her chilly body. Aren't you going to introduce your\u2014yourfriend to me, Gabe?     I don't know who he is, Gabe said almost merrily, except that he'sno friend of mine. Do you have a name, stranger?     Of course I have a name. The fat man extracted an identificationcard from his wallet and read it. Says here I'm Dominic Bianchi, andDominic Bianchi is a retail milgot dealer.... Only he isn't a retailmilgot dealer any more; the poor fellow went bankrupt a couple of weeksago, and now he isn't ... anything.     You saved our lives, the girl said. I'd like to give you some tokenof my\u2014of our appreciation. Her hand reached toward her credit-carrierwith deliberate insult. He might have saved her life, but onlycasually, as a by-product of some larger scheme, and her appreciationheld little gratitude.     The fat man shook his head without rancor. I have plenty of money,thank you, Mrs. Gabriel Lockard.... Come, he addressed her husband,if you get up, I'll drive you home. I warn you, be more careful in thefuture! Sometimes, he added musingly, I almost wish you would letsomething happen. Then my problem would not be any problem, would it?     Gabriel shivered. I'll be careful, he vowed. I promise\u2014I'll becareful.       When he was sure that his charge was safely tucked in for the night,the fat man checked his personal possessions. He then requested a taxidriver to take him to the nearest zarquil game. The driver accepted thecommission phlegmatically. Perhaps he was more hardened than the othershad been; perhaps he was unaware that the fat man was not a desperateor despairing individual seeking one last chance, but what was knowncolloquially as a flying dutchman, a man, or woman, who went fromone zarquil game to another, loving the thrill of the sport, if youcould call it that, for its own sake, and not for the futile hope itextended and which was its sole shred of claim to moral justification.Perhaps\u2014and this was the most likely hypothesis\u2014he just didn't care.     Zarquil was extremely illegal, of course\u2014so much so that there weremany legitimate citizens who weren't quite sure just what the wordimplied, knowing merely that it was one of those nameless horrors sodeliciously hinted at by the fax sheets under the generic term ofcrimes against nature. Actually the phrase was more appropriate tozarquil than to most of the other activities to which it was commonlyapplied. And this was one crime\u2014for it was crime in law as well asnature\u2014in which victim had to be considered as guilty as perpetrator;otherwise the whole legal structure of society would collapse.   <doc-sep> Once the illuminators were extinguished in Gabriel Lockard's hotelsuite, it seemed reasonably certain to the man in the gray suit, ashe watched from the street, that his quarry would not go out againthat night. So he went to the nearest airstation. There he inserted acoin in a locker, into which he put most of his personal possessions,reserving only a sum of money. After setting the locker to respond tothe letter combination      bodyguard     , he went out into the street.     If he had met with a fatal accident at that point, there would havebeen nothing on his body to identify him. As a matter of fact, no realidentification was possible, for he was no one and had been no one foryears.     The nondescript man hailed a cruising helicab. Where to, fellow-man?the driver asked.     I'm new in the parish, the other man replied and let it hang there.     Oh...? Females...? Narcophagi...? Thrill-mills?     But to each of these questions the nondescript man shook his head.     Games? the driver finally asked, although he could guess what waswanted by then. Dice...? Roulette...? Farjeen?     Is there a good zarquil game in town?     The driver moved so he could see the face of the man behind him in theteleview. A very ordinary face. Look, colleague, why don't you commitsuicide? It's cleaner and quicker.     I can't contact your attitude, the passenger said with a thinsmile. Bet you've never tried the game yourself. Each time ithappens, there's a ... well, there's no experience to match it at athrill-mill. He gave a sigh that was almost an audible shudder, andwhich the driver misinterpreted as an expression of ecstasy.     Each time, eh? You're a dutchman then? The driver spat out of thewindow. If it wasn't for the nibble, I'd throw you right out of thecab. Without even bothering to take it down even. I hate dutchmen ...anybody with any legitimate feelings hates 'em.     But it would be silly to let personal prejudice stand in the way of acommission, wouldn't it? the other man asked coolly.     Of course. You'll need plenty of foliage, though.     I have sufficient funds. I also have a gun.     You're the dictator, the driver agreed sullenly.      II     It was a dark and rainy night in early fall. Gabe Lockard was in nocondition to drive the helicar. However, he was stubborn.     Let me take the controls, honey, the light-haired girl urged, but heshook his handsome head.     Show you I can do something 'sides look pretty, he said thickly,referring to an earlier and not amicable conversation they had held,and of which she still bore the reminder on one thickly made-up cheek.     Fortunately the car was flying low, contrary to regulations, so thatwhen they smashed into the beacon tower on the outskirts of the littletown, they didn't have far to fall. And hardly had their car crashedon the ground when the car that had been following them landed, and ashort fat man was puffing toward them through the mist.     To the girl's indignation, the stranger not only hauled Gabe out ontothe dripping grass first, but stopped and deliberately examined theyoung man by the light of his minilume, almost as if she weren't thereat all. Only when she started to struggle out by herself did he seem toremember her existence. He pulled her away from the wreck just a momentbefore the fuel tank exploded and the 'copter went up in flames.     Gabe opened his eyes and saw the fat man gazing down at himspeculatively. My guardian angel, he mumbled\u2014shock had sobered hima little, but not enough. He sat up. Guess I'm not hurt or you'd havethrown me back in.     And that's no joke, the fat man agreed.     The girl shivered and at that moment Gabriel suddenly seemed to recallthat he had not been alone. How about Helen? She on course?     Seems to be, the fat man said. You all right, miss? he asked,glancing toward the girl without, she thought, much apparent concern.           Mrs.     , Gabriel corrected. Allow me to introduce you to Mrs. GabrielLockard, he said, bowing from his seated position toward the girl.Pretty bauble, isn't she?     I'm delighted to meet you, Mrs. Gabriel Lockard, the fat man said,looking at her intently. His small eyes seemed to strip the make-upfrom her cheek and examine the livid bruise underneath. I hopeyou'll be worthy of the name. The light given off by the flamingcar flickered on his face and Gabriel's and, she supposed, hers too.Otherwise, darkness surrounded the three of them.     There were no public illuminators this far out\u2014even in town thelights were dimming and not being replaced fast enough nor by thenewer models. The town, the civilization, the planet all were old andbeginning to slide downhill....     Gabe gave a short laugh, for no reason that she could see.  "

        "Query": "What is the connection between the stranger and Gabe Lockard in the story \"Bodyguard\"?",
        "Summary_1": "The stranger is actually the original Gabriel Lockard, and the man we know as Lockard now is the man who took this body a while ago. The new Lockard has some sense of who the stranger is, though he knows he will never recognize him because the stranger switches bodies frequently. The stranger is keeping an eye out on his original body, trying to protect it, with a bit of hope that he may one day get it back. They have a tenuous and superficial relationship, with the new Lockard being somewhat hesitant about the stranger's involvement in his life. The stranger makes it clear that it is not Lockard he is protecting, but just the body he is in. Through this story, the stranger keeps a man from throwing a glass in Lockard's face at a bar, pulls Lockard and his wife out of a helicar crash, and stops a robbery from happening. There is bitterness and exhaustion on both sides of this relationship, and at the beginning of the story the new Lockard tries to offer the stranger a drink so they can sort things out, but the stranger refuses and it seems he would only be appeased if he had his original body back. ",
        "Summary_2": "The stranger follows Gabe Lockard and his wife around everywhere they go in order to protect them. The stranger used to be the real owner of Gabe Lockard's body, but he lost it in a game of zarquil. Since then, he has made it his life's mission to protect his former body from harm. When an angry man at a bar almost assaults Gabe, the stranger stops the man from hitting Gabe in the face. When Gabe crashes his helicar into a beacon tower, the stranger is right behind the vehicle, and he pulls Gabe and his wife out of the crashed car before it blows up. When Gabe lies unconscious in the snow on a freezing night in an alleyway, the stranger shows up and calls him a cab to get his body back home in the warmth. \n\nGabe knows exactly why the stranger is following him and saving his life, but he refuses to tell his wife, Mrs. Lockard, the reason behind the strange behavior. However, Mrs. Lockard continues asking the stranger questions and eventually uncovers the truth. She realizes that she's married to the fake Gabe Lockard, and that he is a liar and a manipulator. ",
        "Summary_3": "The stranger is Gabe\u2019s consciousness inhabiting the bodies of other people. Gabe left his own body in unknown circumstances, and now his body is inhabited by someone else. The relationship between them is not a shared mutual experience. The person in Gabe\u2019s body is largely indifferent to the help from the stranger and does not recognize it is the same person sharing care towards him over time. The stranger (the real Gabe) feels a mix of protectiveness for his body and a deep resentment of the new person that is inside of it.\n\nThe stranger monitors \u201cGabe\u201d closely like a bodyguard and cares deeply about his body continuing to exist, even calling a cab so it doesn\u2019t freeze to death at one point. Potentially he does this with the hope that he can one day get back into it. The stranger continues to follow and save the body of \u201cGabe\u201d while simultaneously changing physical forms through playing zarquil. This serves both to try to avoid being detected by Gabe and Helen (ultimately foiled when Helen figures it out), and to attempt to enter a physical form that is as perfect as he felt his original body was.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Gabe Lockard in the story is actually a man inhabiting the body and adopting the identity of the real Gabriel Lockard. The real Gabe Lockard is the stranger in the gray suit in the bar, the fat man who pulls Gabe and Mrs. Lockard from their wrecked helicar, the thin, sickly man who saves Gabe and Mrs. Lockard from the would-be thief, and the handsome, dark, coarse-featured hulking man at the end of the story. The stranger follows Gabe and Mrs. Lockard from town to town, acting like a kind of bodyguard for Gabe to protect him from the harm he can do to himself and from other dangers. Apparently, at some time in the past, the real Gabe Lockard crossed paths with the man who now inhabits his body, and they had drinks together. The real Gabe comments that he drank with the current Gabe \u201conce too often\u201d and says that things worked out well for the current Gabe. Gabe Lockard\u2019s body is incredibly handsome and attracts attention wherever he goes. The current Gabe, though, is coarse, rude, and self-centered; he has been moving from town to town to get away from the real Gabe who is following him, protecting Gabe\u2019s body. It seems that the real Gabe hopes to get his real body back at some point in the future.\n",
        "Article": "   Bodyguard     By CHRISTOPHER GRIMM     Illustrated by CAVAT     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Galaxy Science Fiction February 1956.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]        When overwhelming danger is constantly present,of course       a man is entitled to have a bodyguard. The annoyance was that       he had to do it himself ... and his body would not cooperate!        The man at the bar was exceptionally handsome, and he knew it. So didthe light-haired girl at his side, and so did the nondescript man inthe gray suit who was watching them from a booth in the corner.     Everyone in the room was aware of the big young man, and most of thehumans present were resentful, for he handled himself consciously andarrogantly, as if his appearance alone were enough to make him superiorto anyone. Even the girl with him was growing restless, for she wasaccustomed to adulation herself, and next to Gabriel Lockard she wasalmost ordinary-looking.     As for the extraterrestrials\u2014it was a free bar\u2014they were merelyamused, since to them all men were pathetically and irredeemablyhideous.     Gabe threw his arm wide in one of his expansive gestures. There was ashort man standing next to the pair\u2014young, as most men and women werein that time, thanks to the science which could stave off decay, thoughnot death\u2014but with no other apparent physical virtue, for plasticsurgery had not fulfilled its bright promise of the twentieth century.     The drink he had been raising to his lips splashed all over hisclothing; the glass shattered at his feet. Now he was not only a ratherugly little man, but also a rather ridiculous one\u2014or at least he felthe was, which was what mattered.     Sorry, colleague, Gabe said lazily. All my fault. You must let mebuy you a replacement. He gestured to the bartender. Another of thesame for my fellow-man here.     The ugly man dabbed futilely at his dripping trousers with a clothhastily supplied by the management.     You must allow me to pay your cleaning bill, Gabe said, taking outhis wallet and extracting several credit notes without seeming to lookat them. Here, have yourself a new suit on me.      You could use one     was implied.     And that, coming on top of Gabriel Lockard's spectacular appearance,was too much. The ugly man picked up the drink the bartender had justset before him and started to hurl it, glass and all, into Lockard'shandsome face.   <doc-sep> Once the illuminators were extinguished in Gabriel Lockard's hotelsuite, it seemed reasonably certain to the man in the gray suit, ashe watched from the street, that his quarry would not go out againthat night. So he went to the nearest airstation. There he inserted acoin in a locker, into which he put most of his personal possessions,reserving only a sum of money.

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in The Winning of the Moon?",
        "Summary_1": "On the surface of the moon, the American base (Freedom 19) is headed by Major Winship, with his three men, Captain Wilkins, Captain Lawler, and Lieutenant Chandler. The Soviets of Base Garagin are conducting a seismic test to learn more about the depths of the moon. The Americans protested it, as their base is not as strongly built, but the Russians went ahead anyway. With a language barrier and poor communication, the Americans don\u2019t know when they are going to perform the test, so they stand outside in their suits waiting. After a few hours, a moonquake occurs, rippling through the surface. The quake caused a leak in their base, which Winship tries and fails to fix with a marker and a plastic sheet. He complains that the Russians did this on purpose, to try and force them off the moon, but they have three weeks of emergency air. They can try and fix it. \nThey are unable to use the transmission since there is no air in the base. Winship orders his men to find the caulking solution, but it has hardened and dried out. He orders Lawler and Chandler to make the 60-minute-round-trip journey to Base Garagin to ask for help. Though Soviet General Finogenov denies it, Winship still wonders if this was intentional. Wilkins and Winship share a meal of gross nutrition tablets. \nWilkins, the resident tech, hooks Winship up to the radio within his suit, so he can speak into the radio. With all the complicated wiring, Winship\u2019s air supply is cut off, and he motions to Wilkins to fix it. Earth is on the line, but he tries to not make his problem known. After Wilkins fixes it, Winship informs them of their difficulties and is told that a replacement could arrive in 10 days and that the Russians formally apologized. \nChandler and Lawler arrive with a 55-gallon barrel of caulking agent, along with another compound that must be mixed in. Displeased by the Russian\u2019s excessiveness, the team figures out a way to successfully mix it. Wilkins creates an electric mixer, while the rest move the barrel inside the dome with great difficulty. They mix the barrel and quickly realize that it is a chemical epoxy, one that reacts to temperature. The heat of the mixer and the dome causes the epoxy to heat up drastically. The men escape to the airlock and watch as the barrel explodes, the fire it causes using up all their remaining oxygen. \n",
        "Summary_2": "An American man named Major Winship learns that there will be an underground blast the following day. He calls Base Gagrin, the Soviet Union\u2019s dome, to request that they relay the exact timing of the explosion. The person who answers cannot speak English, so Winship hangs up. Winship and his three crew members, Lawler, Wilkins, and Chandler, have no way of knowing when the explosion will be over because they are on the moon. Winship\u2019s suit stops working, and his body starts to overheat. Although he knows it\u2019s a risk, he decides to leave the safety of the dome so that he can cool down. He can\u2019t stand the excessive heat and thinks that the explosion has already occurred.\n\nWhen Winship immerses himself in the moon\u2019s environment, he successfully cools down. Within seconds, however, he feels the explosion. The men hear several minutes of static on their communication devices. They realize that their capsule has a dome and is losing pressure. Winship tries to cover the hole with a plastic sheet, but it doesn\u2019t work. He reenters the dome and speaks to the Soviets on the phone. Their leader lets him know that they suffered zero damage and suggests that it\u2019s because their dome is stronger and superior to the Americans\u2019. Winship accuses them of purposefully failing to communicate, and the Soviet denies it. The men attempt to use some calk to fix the hole, but it is useless because it has already been exposed to air. \n\nAlthough the Americans hate to rely on the Soviets for any type of help, the crew has no choice at this point. Lawler and Chandler take the land car to the Soviet base to get supplies to patch the hole. Winship cannot travel because of his busted suit, and Wilkins stays behind with him. They share a meal and complain about how the Soviets have a much nicer dome than they do, and their leader has a real wooden desk, among other nicer amenities. Some time later, Winship calls Earth. He tells the Americans on the ground about the leak in their dome. The man on the other end tells Winship that the Soviets have apologized for the incident, but Winship still isn\u2019t convinced of their sincerity. \n\nLawler and Chandler return with a 55-gallon drum of the calking agent, and this shocks Wilkins and Winship. They need only a very small amount, and this massive drum is difficult to carry and maneuver. Again, Winship wonders if the Soviets are playing tricks with the Americans. The team uses an electric mixer to prepare the calk, but the mixture gets incredibly hot and starts turning bright red. Wilkins realizes that the compound is an epoxy, and the men need to exit the dome immediately. He yells at everyone to evacuate. The Americans are very worried that the drum of calk is going to blow up like a bomb. Moments later, it does. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The story starts with four Americans in spacesuits on the moon waiting outside of their dome as the Russians conduct a seismic test involving some explosions. Pinov is the Russian on the emergency line, but he does not speak English, so the Americans don't know when it will be safe to enter the dome again. It was hot outside the dome, and the suits' cooling systems could only do so much. Major Winship got tired of waiting and wanted to cool off, so he entered the dome, but as soon as he did so he was thrown off his feet from an explosion. Soon after, some static blocked communications for a minute or two, but then the men had a new problem: the dome was losing pressure, so they were losing air. After their best attempt at patching the hole, they got in touch with the Russians who had not sustained any damage. Major Winship had no patience for General Finogenov, even though the Russian was seemingly embarrassed that there had been a quake caused by his test, as he had promised therew ould not be. Lt. Chandler found the squeeze tubes that they could use to patch the rupture, but they were no longer any good, so Capt. Lawler and Lt. Chandler headed to Base Gagarin in their land car to ask to borrow calking compound from the Russians.  Major Winship and Capt. Wilkins figured they may as well report back to Earth, but once their communications connect, Major Winship realized he is on emergency air and tries to get help from Capt. Wilkins, but those on Earth heard Winship lose air and gasp. Wilkins caught on just in time, and updated those on Earth as they swaped out their oxygen supplies in their suits. Earth requested a report in three hours, confirming that the dome's leak hadn't been repaired, and Winship was relieved the Soviet didn't have to step in to help with his air issue. When the others returned with the fifty-five gallon drum of calking compound, they marveled at how much the Soviets had on hand, and then moved to make an electric mixer to prepare the compound. They tried to move the drum inside to mix it, but there wasn't room, and they tried to move it back out, so all of the men were sweating again. As they discussed how best to proceed in patching the dome, it occured to Wilkins that it could be a room-temperature-curing epoxy resin, and just then they realized that the epoxy had become rock-solid and hot. Wilkins threw out orders to try to protect the men from the impending explosion, but he watched the drum of compound melt, and eventually the air tank started to heat up too. A quick burst of flame flashed inside the dome, leaving the men stranded without air at the end of the story. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Major Winship and his crew stationed at the American moonbase Freedom 19 await a subterranean atomic explosion resulting from a test conducted by their Russian counterparts at Base Gagarin. According to the Russians, the test will help them determine the composition of the moon by analyzing the resultant seismic activity. However, Major Winship suspects the Russians, led by General Finogenov, are conducting the tests in order to purposefully sabotage American efforts to fortify their moon presence. They struggle to communicate with the Russian base as they await word on the status of their test, and when Major Winship goes back inside the dome to call them again, he is suddenly knocked over by movements of the moon's surface, signifying completion of the test. After the quakes settle, the crew discovers a leak in the protective dome, which causes air to slowly seep out. Luckily, they have an emergency air supply to last three weeks, but they lose a significant amount of calking that could be used to repair the leak. When a plastic sheet fails to patch the damage, Lt. Les Chandler searches for squeeze tubes that can ostensibly repair it. However, he discovers that the paste inside requires air in order to harden and some of the tubes have hardened already. Captain Skip Lawler accompanies Lt. Chandler to Base Gagarin in order to ask for calking that might help repair the patch. In their absence, Major Winship bemoans to Captain Larry Wilkins the luxury in which the Russians live on Base Gagarin compared to their discomfort in the cramped quarters of Freedom 19. He continues to muse about his theory that General Finogenov intentionally caused the explosion to harm their base and cause them to vacate the moon. As they await Lawler and Chandler's return, Capt. Wilkins calls Earth on the radio transmitter so that Winship can report the test explosion and the resulting damage. While he talks, he suddenly runs out of his emergency supply of air, and Wilkins refills it for him. Earth promises to restore their air supply in ten days. When Lawler and Chandler return with the calking compound, the crew spends a good amount of time engineering a large, mechanical mixer since the compound comes in a massive, heavy barrel and must be mixed together in order to use it properly. As Captain Wilkins begins mixing the compound, he suddenly realizes that it is a room-temperature-curing epoxy resin. The resin hardens, and the crew rushes out of the dome just before it melts, tips over the barrel, and ignites the air tank next to it, causing a massive explosion. Now the crew is left without any supply of air, and their only hope is an emergency supply still ten days from arriving.",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]       Every lonely man tries to make friends.     Manet just didn't know when to stop!      William Manet was alone.     In the beginning, he had seen many advantages to being alone. It wouldgive him an unprecedented opportunity to once and for all correlateloneliness to the point of madness, to see how long it would take himto start slavering and clawing the pin-ups from the magazines, to beginteaching himself classes in philosophy consisting of interminablelectures to a bored and captive audience of one.     He would be able to measure the qualities of peace and decide whetherit was really better than war, he would be able to get as fat and asdirty as he liked, he would be able to live more like an animal andthink more like a god than any man for generations.     But after a shorter time than he expected, it all got to be a tearingbore. Even the waiting to go crazy part of it.     Not that he was going to have any great long wait of it. He was alreadytalking to himself, making verbal notes for his lectures, and he hadcut out a picture of Annie Oakley from an old book. He tacked it up andwinked at it whenever he passed that way.     Lately she was winking back at him.     Loneliness was a physical weight on his skull. It peeled the flesh fromhis arms and legs and sandpapered his self-pity to a fine sensitivity.     No one on Earth was as lonely as William Manet, and even William Manetcould only be this lonely on Mars.     Manet was Atmosphere Seeder Station 131-47's own human.     All Manet had to do was sit in the beating aluminum heart in the middleof the chalk desert and stare out, chin cupped in hands, at the flat,flat pavement of dirty talcum, at the stars gleaming as hard in theblack sky as a starlet's capped teeth ... stars two of which were moonsand one of which was Earth. He had to do nothing else. The wholegimcrack was cybernetically controlled, entirely automatic. No one wasneeded here\u2014no human being, at least.     The Workers' Union was a pretty small pressure group, but it didn'ttake much to pressure the Assembly. Featherbedding had been carefullyspecified, including an Overseer for each of the Seeders to honeycombMars, to prepare its atmosphere for colonization.     They didn't give tests to find well-balanced, well-integrated peoplefor the job. Well-balanced, well-integrated men weren't going toisolate themselves in a useless job. They got, instead, William Manetand his fellows.     The Overseers were to stay as long as the job required. Passenger fareto Mars was about one billion dollars. They weren't providing commuterservice for night shifts. They weren't providing accommodationsfor couples when the law specified only one occupant. They weren'tproviding fuel (at fifty million dollars a gallon) for visits betweenthe various Overseers. They weren't very providential.     But it was two hundred thousand a year in salary, and it offeredwonderful opportunities.     It gave William Manet an opportunity to think he saw a spaceship makinga tailfirst landing on the table of the desert, its tail burning asbright as envy.  "

        "Query": "What was the nature of the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union during the space race, as depicted in The Winning of the Moon?",
        "Summary_1": "As can be seen from the beginning, Base Gagarin and the small group of Americans have a slightly contentious relationship. Even the title of the story, The Winning of the Moon, emphasizes the undercurrent of war and competition that informs the way they interact with each other. \nThe story begins with potentially purposeful miscommunication between the Russians and the Americans. The Soviet base is running an underground seismic wave test, the likes of which could release after-shocks and tremors. Such a quake could damage the American dome, meager in comparison with Base Gagarin. The Soviets put Pinov on the line, who only speaks Russian. Without the ability to communicate, the Americans were stuck outside on the moon for hours, waiting to see if the seismic eruption could be seen or felt. Feeling like idiots, one goes inside, just as an aftershock causes a leak in their dome. They instantly blame the Russians, especially since the Americans protested such a test. \nThis series of unfortunate events continues as the Americans quickly realize that their supplies are not able to fix the leak. They must ask the Russians for help, even after complaining to their home base about their actions. \nBase Gagarin is huge compared to the American dome. General Finogenov even has a wooden desk in his office, along with other earthly amenities that the Americans have been deprived of. The Russians have been on the moon for six years longer than the Americans, which could explain their extensive supplies. \nThey give the Americans a 55-gallon mixture to fix the leak, however, the language barrier prevents them from realizing what kind of epoxy it is. This miscommunication leads to the barrel exploding and further destroying the American dome. It\u2019s fair to say that it\u2019s not smooth sailing on the moon. \n",
        "Summary_2": "When Winship calls the Soviets to discuss the exact timing for the underground explosion, Pinov, the person who answers the call, cannot speak English. This makes Winship frustrated. When Captain Wilkins suggests to Captain Winship that he say the word \u201chelp\u201d into the phone so that the Soviets will know it\u2019s serious, Winship says he would rather die. This suggests that there\u2019s a power dynamic between the two nations, and Winship, as an American, does not want to appear weak in front of the Soviets. Winship wants to keep his American crew safe, but his pride is equally important at this point. As a result of Winship\u2019s refusal to say the word \u201chelp,\u201d he ends up stepping outside of the dome before the explosion occurs. \n\nLater, Winship called General Finogenov, the Soviet leader, to report some damage to their dome. The General responds by explaining that the Soviets have a stronger dome, and Winship accuses Finogenov of deliberately cutting the ties of communication to keep the Americans guessing and jeopardize their safety. Finogenov profusely denies Winship\u2019s claim and offers to help in any way possible. \n\nWinship is highly suspicious of the Soviets, and especially suspicious of Finogenov\u2019s incredible working space in the dome. He has a wooden desk, a chair, and one hundred square feet to move around in. It appears to Winshp that Finogenov cares only about his own comfort and not about the safety of his American counterparts. When Winship has to call the Americans on Earth to let them know about the air leak, he is concerned that the Soviets are listening in on his call. He and his men do not want to wait 10 days for the other Americans to send them supplies to fix the leak, so their only real choice is to rely on the kindness of the Soviets. This makes Winship sick to his stomach, as he loathes asking them for help and potentially looking weak. \n\nIt appears that Winship\u2019s suspicions are merited when the Soviets send over a 55-gallon drum of calk to fix a very small leak in the Americans\u2019 dome, and they do not give the Americans proper instructions for how to prepare and use the chemicals. The crew uses an electric mixer to prepare the calk, and the epoxy mixture turns bright red and blows up. \n",
        "Summary_3": "There are seven Soviets and four Americans on the moon in this story, and there is definitely an issue of a balance of power. The Soviets have been there for six years longer than the Americans have, and have way more space set up for their equipment and living. The Americans operate out of one 500 square foot dome, and the Soviets have a 3000 square foot dome and two smaller ones (that are each still larger than the American one). The Americans think they have better space suits, that are at least less bulky, but don't have the amenities like the nice furniture or the fresh plants. Things are very tense over the radio: Major Winship seems constantly angry while communicating with the Soviets, and the Russians act polite and apologetic when things go terribly wrong, even if it's unclear how much happened on purpose. On the day of the seismic test, the one Soviet who does not speak English is the one who is in charge of emergency communication, which Winship thinks was on purpose. The Soviets have a lot more electric power, and say that their experiments are all for purely scientific purposes, even if the Americans think the Soviets are trying to drive them out. The Americans have to rely on the Soviets for emergency supplies; they hope not to have to ask for air, but do retrieve a drum of calking compound to aid in the dome repairs which eventually causes an even larger problem as their air supply is burnt out. ",
        "Summary_4": "Although the two groups both operate bases on the moon, they live very different lives and struggle to effectively communicate with each other. While one large dome and three smaller ones comprise the Soviet Base Gagarin, the American Freedom 19 base is one cramped dome where the four-person crew lives and works.  The seven-person crew at Base Gagarin live in luxury compared to the American crew and have hot tea, better supplies, and more space to live and work. Major Winship expresses consistent frustration with the inability to communicate with Pinov during the atomic test, and he is deeply suspicious about General Finogenov's motives regarding the test in the first place. Winship does not trust when Finogenov insists the tests are being conducted for purely scientific purposes, and the results of the study will be made available in the technical press. For his part, Finogenov is deeply apologetic when the test causes a leak in Freedom 19 and therefore a drop in air pressure, but Winship still doesn't trust him. He believes it is all part of a Soviet plan to sabotage their mission and expel them from the moon. Winship's misgivings appear to have some truth (or else the whole incident reveals the incompetence of the American crew) when the Soviet base supplies the Americans a large batch of what they believe to be a calking compound in order to repair the air leak. The compound turns out to be a highly explosive material that combusts when it makes contact with the American air tank, thus completely depleting its air supply.",
        "Article": "The officer picked up the dollar bill and fingered it with evidentinterest. He turned it over and studied the printing. United States ofAmerica, he read aloud. What are those?     It's the name of the country I come from, Jeff said carefully.I\u2014uh\u2014got on the wrong train, apparently, and must have come furtherthan I thought. What's the name of this place?     This is Costa, West Goodland, in the Continental Federation. Say, youmust come from an umpty remote part of the world if you don't knowabout this country. His eyes narrowed. Where'd you learn to speakFederal, if you come from so far?     Jeff said helplessly, I can't explain, if you don't know about theUnited States. Listen, can you take me to a bank, or some place wherethey know about foreign exchange?     The policeman scowled. How'd you get into this country, anyway? Yougot immigrate clearance?     An angry muttering started among the bystanders.     The policeman made up his mind. You come with me.     At the police station, Jeff put his elbows dejectedly on the highcounter while the policeman talked to an officer in charge. Some menwhom Jeff took for reporters got up from a table and eased over tolisten.     I don't know whether to charge them with fakemake, bumsy, peekage orlunate, the policeman said as he finished.     His superior gave Jeff a long puzzled stare.     Jeff sighed. I know it sounds impossible, but a man brought me insomething he claimed was a time traveler. You speak the same language Ido\u2014more or less\u2014but everything else is kind of unfamiliar. I belongin the United States, a country in North America. I can't believe I'mso far in the future that the United States has been forgotten.     There ensued a long, confused, inconclusive interrogation.     The man behind the desk asked questions which seemed stupid to Jeff andgot answers which probably seemed stupid to him.     The reporters quizzed Jeff gleefully. Come out, what are youadvertising? they kept asking. Who got you up to this?     The police puzzled over his driver's license and the other cards in hiswallet. They asked repeatedly about the lack of a Work License, whichJeff took to be some sort of union card. Evidently there was gravedoubt that he had any legal right to be in the country.     In the end, Jeff and Ann were locked in separate cells for the night.Jeff groaned and pounded the bars as he thought of his wife, imprisonedand alone in a smelly jail. After hours of pacing the cell, he lay downin the cot and reached automatically for his silver pillbox. Then hehesitated.     In past weeks, his insomnia had grown worse and worse, so that latelyhe had begun taking stronger pills. After a longing glance at thebig red and yellow capsules, he put the box away. Whatever tomorrowbrought, it wouldn't find him slow and drowsy.      IV     He passed a wakeful night. In the early morning, he looked up to see alittle man with a briefcase at his cell door.     Wish joy, Mr. Elliott, the man said coolly. I am one of Mr. Bullen'sbarmen. You know, represent at law? He sent me to arrange your release,if you are ready to be reasonable.     Jeff lay there and put his hands behind his head. I doubt if I'mready. I'm comfortable here. By the way, how did you know where I was?     No problem. When we read in this morning's newspapers about a manclaiming to be a time traveler, we knew.     All right. Now start explaining. Until I understand where I am, Bullenisn't getting me out of here.     The lawyer smiled and sat down. Mr. Kersey told you yesterday\u2014you'vegone back six years. But you'll need some mental gymnastics tounderstand. Time is a dimension, not a stream of events like a moviefilm. A film never changes. Space does\u2014and time does. For example, ifa movie showed a burning house at Sixth and Main, would you expect tofind a house burning whenever you returned to that corner?     You mean to say that if I went back to 1865, I wouldn't find the CivilWar was over and Lincoln had been assassinated?     If you go back to the time you call 1865\u2014which is most easilydone\u2014you will find that the people there know nothing of a Lincoln orthat war.     Jeff looked blank. What are they doing then?     The little man spread his hands. What are the people doing now atSixth and Main? Certainly not the same things they were doing the dayof the fire. We're talking about a dimension, not an event. Don't yougrasp the difference between the two?     Nope. To me, 1865 means the end of the Civil War. How else can youspeak of a point in time except by the events that happened then?     Well, if you go to a place in three-dimensional space\u2014say, a lakein the mountains\u2014how do you identify that place? By looking forlandmarks. It doesn't matter that an eagle is soaring over a mountainpeak. That's only an event. The peak is the landmark. You follow me?     So far. Keep talking.   <doc-sep> The taxi let them off at a square meadow which was filled withtransparent plastic domes housing clocks of all varieties, most ofthe antique type based on the old twenty-four hour day instead of thestandard thirty hours. There were few extraterrestrial clocks becausemost non-humans had time sense, Michael knew, and needed no mechanicaldevices.     This, said Carpenter, is Times Square. Once it wasn't really square,but it is contrary to Nekkarian custom to do, say, imply, or permitthe existence of anything that isn't true, so when Nekkar entered theUnion, we had to square off the place. And, of course, install theclocks. Finest clock museum in the Union, I understand.     The pictures in my history books\u2014 Michael began.     Did I hear you correctly, sir? The capes of a bright blue cloaktrembled with the indignation of a scarlet, many-tentacled being. Didyou use the word      history     ? He pronounced it in terms of loathing. Ihave been grossly insulted and I shall be forced to report you to thepolice, sir.     Please don't! Carpenter begged.

He indicated the stalwart constable who, splendid in gold helmet andgold-spangled pink tights, surveyed the terrain haughtily from hisfloating platform in the air.

Never mention the word 'history' in front of a Meropian.They rose from barbarism in one generation, and so they haven't anyhistory at all. Naturally, they're sensitive in the extreme about it.     Naturally, Michael said. Tell me, Mr. Carpenter, is there somespecial reason for everything being decorated in red and green? Inoticed it along the way and it's all over here, too.     Why, Christmas is coming, my boy, Carpenter answered, surprised.It's July already\u2014about time they got started fixing things up.

        "Query": "What is the backdrop of The Winning of the Moon?",
        "Summary_1": "The Winning of the Moon by Kris Neville takes place on the moon, although exactly what moon is never specified. The moon itself has a fairly uneven surface, especially after the moonquake rips through its bases. \nMost of the story takes place inside of the American base, a mere 500 square feet. It is cramped inside, filled to the brim with equipment, tools, and supplies necessary for the moon. The American men slept on bunks that rose up from the floor. Cables hung from the ceiling and snaked across the walls, bringing energy into the dome using solar power. The base itself is in the shape of a dome with an airlock leading to the outside. \nThe Russian base, Base Gagarin, is incredibly different. They\u2019ve got three buildings that make up the base, the biggest of which is 3,000 square feet. With luxuries like wooden furniture, fresh lemons from Earth, and nutmeg, the Soviet base has everything the Americans lacked. \n",
        "Summary_2": "\u201cThe Winning of the Moon\u201d takes place on Earth\u2019s moon, where both the Americans and the Soviets have built domes that house crews for years at a time. There is no oxygen on the moon\u2019s surface, so it\u2019s very important that the crew members have strong suits with plenty of emergency air canisters. In this story, the Soviets\u2019 explosion creates a leak in the Americans\u2019 dome, which poses a major problem. The Americans housed in the dome will die if they cannot fix the leak in a few weeks\u2019 time.\n\nThe Americans\u2019 dome is small and cramped. There is a ton of necessary equipment, and not a lot of room to move around for the four crew members. The men sleep in bunk beds. The Soviets\u2019 dome, however, is much nicer and roomier. Their home is called Base Gagarin, and it\u2019s located about 10 miles away from the Americans. It is much sturdier, and as a result, it does not spring a leak after the purposeful detonation is over with. The Soviet General has a real wooden desk in his office and a real wooden chair, and the norm is to use aluminum furniture. The Soviets have lots of space to move around, and they look down upon the Americans for their less luxurious space. \n\n",
        "Summary_3": "This story takes place on the moon, where the American mission Freedom 19 has established a base. Their neighbors, so to speak, are the Soviet Union. These bases are ten miles apart, which is a thirty-minute trip by land car. The dome that the Americans live and work in is very small, only 500 square feet, but the Soviets have one large dome and two smaller ones which gives them much more space. It is hot on the surface of the moon in the space suits, so the Americans have to be inside the dome to be able to cool off. ",
        "Summary_4": "The story takes place at Freedom 19, an American moonbase. An airlock leads into a five hundred square foot dome on the surface of the moon filled with various kinds of equipment, a table, an air tank, and radio transmitter. The dome is powered by solar cells affixed to the roof. The compact living space includes bunks attached to the walls six feet above the floor. Ten miles from Freedom 19 rests Base Gagarin, the Russian moonbase situated at the bottom of a fold in the moon's surface. The Americans travel to and from Base Gagarin in a small land car for supply runs and meetings. Compared to the cozy quarters of the American base, the Russian base is large and comfortable with three domes instead of one. The main dome has more than three thousand square feet and the smaller two are twelve hundred square feet each. Finogenev's office is one-hundred square feet with a wooden desk and chair. Major Winship envies the comfort in which the Russians live on their base and mentions the presence of a samovar, which they use to boil and dispense hot tea. Winship also believes the Russians chose their heavy, wooden furniture to taunt the Americans since they have access to vast amounts of aluminum and choose wood construction instead. ",

        "Query": "What does the seismic test conducted by the Russians signify in The Winning of the Moon?",
        "Summary_1": "After the Russians conduct their seismic test, a moonquake erupts and tears a leak in the American dome. This leak is significant because it is the first of a series of slightly cataclysmic events. As well, it highlights the strained and tense relationship between the Russians and the Americans. \nMajor Winship accused the Russians of deliberately injuring their base, further showing how contentious their relationship is. General Finogenov ardently denies this, however, and says that their base had no damage at all. \nAfter trying and failing to fix the leak with their own supplies, two of the Americans are forced to travel to Base Gagarin and borrow their resin. This ends up backfiring, however, as the epoxy quickly heats up and explodes as they mix the two components together. The explosion further damages the dome and takes away the American\u2019s entire air supply. \nAs well, the seismic testing was greatly discouraged and protested by the Americans. \n",
        "Summary_2": "The four man American crew on the moon is warned about the Soviets\u2019 underground atomic device and its planned detonation before the test is completed. The Soviets have planned the explosion in order to learn more about the composition of the moon. The shock waves from the explosion should give them information about the various layers of the moon. The Americans protested the underground explosion because they feared that the device\u2019s detonation would disturb their satellite. Although the Americans call their Soviet counterparts to get information about the exact timing of the explosion, the person who answers the phone cannot speak English, so they are unable to learn the Soviets\u2019 specific plans. Major Winship is outside of the American dome when the device is detonated, which is strictly against protocol. The Americans prove that they were right to fight the Soviets about their plan because the dome they live in gets a leak from the shifting surface of the moon. The Soviet General apologizes for the lack of communication and the damage to the Americans\u2019 dome, but their behavior still reads as suspicious. ",
        "Summary_3": "The Soviet Union had conducted a seismic test on the moon by detonating an underground atomic device, but the Americans had warned the Soviets that they shouldn't go through with the tests because of potential dangers. Even though the Americans asked the Soviets not to run the test, they did anyway, and the resulting tremors ruptured the American dome. Not only was the dome leaking air because of this test, but the Americans had to rely on the Soviets for supplies to try to fix it. This only made matters worse, because the materials the Americans borrowed from the Soviets to repair the dome ended up burning out their entire oxygen supply, leaving them stranded without air at the end of the story. In this way, the seismic test shows both the power the Soviets think they hold over the Americans as well as a chance for the Americans to lose emergency supplies as their situation rapidly falls downhill.  ",
        "Summary_4": "The Russians claim to conduct the seismic test in order to analyze the resultant shock waves to help them better understand the composition of the moon where they and the American have established bases. Although they insist their purpose is purely scientific, Major Winship suspects they intended the test to harm Freedom 19. The test triggers a few moonquakes, which ultimately causes a leak to appear in the dome. The resulting loss in air pressure leads the crew of the Freedom 19 to attempt a variety of methods to patch the leak. However, they have subpar materials and tools to work with compared with the plentiful resource at Base Gagarin. Lawler and Chandler make their way to the Russian base in order to procure calking that may seal the leak. They return with the calking compound which turns out to be a highly combustible material, which explodes and eliminates the rest of their air supply.",

Suppose I crack the Foo next week?You're dead broke, a widow, and with a funeral to pay for. The onlysmart thing to do is wait a while.     Nan's eyes clouded, and her lips trembled. That's what I've been tryingto say.      Why     do you have to win the Vandenberg Cup next week? Why can'tyou sell the Foo and go into some kind of business? You're a trainedpilot.     He had been standing in front of her with his body unconsciously tensefrom the strain of trying to make her understand. Now herelaxed\u2014more\u2014he slumped\u2014and something began to die in his face, andthe first faint lines crept in to show that after it had died, it wouldnot return to life, but would fossilize, leaving his features in thealmost unreadable mask that the newspapers would come to know.     I'm a good bit more than a trained pilot, he said quietly. The Foo Isa means to an end. After I win the Vandenberg Cup, I can walk into anyplant in the States\u2014Douglas, North American, Boeing\u2014      any     of them\u2014andpick up the Chief Test Pilot's job for the asking. A few of them have asgood as said so. After that\u2014 His voice had regained some of its formeranimation from this new source. Now he broke off, and shrugged. I'vetold you all this before.     The girl reached up, as if the physical touch could bring him back toher, and put her fingers around his wrist. Darling! she said. If it'sthat      rocket     pilot business again....     Somehow, his wrist was out of her encircling fingers. It's always 'that      rocket     pilot business,' he said, mimicking her voice. Damn it, I'mthe only trained rocket pilot in the world! I weigh a hundred andfifteen pounds, I'm five feet tall, and I know more navigation and maththan anybody the Air Force or Navy have! I can use words likebrennschluss and mass-ratio without running over to a copy of      Colliers     , and I\u2014 He stopped himself, half-smiled, and shruggedagain.     I guess I was kidding myself. After the Cup, there'll be the test job,and after that, there'll be the rockets. You would have had to wait along time.     All she could think of to say was, But, Darling, there      aren't     anyman-carrying rockets.     That's not my fault, he said, and walked away from her.       A week later, he took his stripped-down F-110 across the last line witha scream like that of a hawk that brings its prey safely to its nest.     <doc-sep> The machine didn't answer.

The alien electronic brain was silent.     By this time, I couldn't see and Kane's voice was a hollow, farawaything that rang in my ears. I tugged at my bindings, but they onlytightened as I struggled.     If you take us back to the Moon, your masters will never know youfailed in your mission. They won't know you failed because you won'tbring them proof of your failure.     My fading consciousness tried to envision the alien mechanical brain asit struggled with the problem.     Look at it this way, Kane persisted. If you carry our corpses toyour masters, all your efforts will have been useless. If you return usto the Moon alive, you'll still have a chance to carry out your missionlater.     A long silence followed. Verana and Marie screamed at Kane to let go.A soft darkness seemed to fill the room, blurring everything, drowningeven their shrieks in strangling blackness.     You win, the machine conceded. I'll return the ship to the Moon.     Kane released his grip on my throat.     See? he asked. Didn't I tell you every problem has a solution?     I didn't answer.

        "Query": "What is the role of Major Winship in The Winning of the Moon and how does his story unfold?",
        "Summary_1": "Major Winship is one of the few Americans who is currently living on base on the surface of the moon. He is in charge as the Commanding Officer of Freedom 19, as he outranks both the Captains and the first Lieutenant. After watching the moonquake shake the surface from inside the base, Major Winship quickly realizes that the quake ripped a hole in the dome itself. He attempts to fix it with a marker, then with a plastic sheet, but both fail. Their caulking compound has hardened and is completely unusable. Winship accuses the Russians of causing the quake and leak on purpose, but the General vehemently denies his claims. They try to call into Earth but realize that without air, there\u2019d be no sound. So, they have to find another way.  \nStuck in his suit until they can restore air to the base, Winship sends Lt. Chandler and Capt. Lawler to ask the Soviets for help. Winship shares a meal with Wilkins, and then the Captain connected to Winship with a series of wires to the radio. This way he\u2019d be able to communicate while in his suit. \nHe suffers a major mistake with the wiring, however, when his air supply is cut off. He motions to Wilkins who saves him, reconnecting the lost cable, and Winship lets those on Earth know what happened. They let him know that they\u2019ve received a formal apology and that they will send a replacement in ten days\u2019 time. \nOnce Chandler and Lawler return, Winship is faced with a new problem: how to mix and activate the 55-gallon fix for the leak. Wilkins creates an electric mixer, and they bring the barrel inside to mix. The barrel becomes red-hot and looks to be on the verge of combustion. The men scramble and get to the airlock. The barrel explodes and the flames use up all the oxygen. Winship is faced with an even greater problem now: how to survive. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Major Winship is the main character in \u201cThe Winning of the Moon\u201d, and he faces external and internal conflicts throughout the story. At the beginning of the story, Winship\u2019s spacesuit malfunctions, and the technology that keeps him cool stops working. He begins sweating profusely, and it deeply annoys him. He wants information about the Soviets\u2019 planned explosion, but he cannot learn the timing of the explosion because the person he speaks to at the Soviet base does not speak English. This further frustrates Winship, and he begins to believe that the Soviets are making the Americans\u2019 lives difficult on purpose. He decides to take a risk and exit the dome even though he can\u2019t be totally sure that the device was already detonated. He goes outside to cool himself off, and within moments he feels the ground quaking. When he discovers a leak in the dome, he tries unsuccessfully to patch it up with plastic sheeting. The last thing he wants to do is ask the Soviets for help, so he becomes even more irritated when he learns that the calk the Americans have on hand is busted and will not work to fix the leak.Two of his team members head to the Soviet base to get supplies to fix the leak, but Winship stays behind with his malfunctioning suit. He decides to call Earth to discuss the Soviets\u2019 actions, and while he is on the phone, he realizes that he is using his emergency air supply. He has to motion silently to his colleague, Wilkins, to help him out so that he can breathe. Winship is very frustrated when Lawler and Chandler return to the American base with a 55-gallon drum of calk to fix the small leak, and he once again questions the Soviets\u2019 actions. He has to quickly exit the dome along with the other crew members before the drum explodes after they attempt to ready the concoction for use with an electric mixer. ",
        "Summary_3": "Major Winship is the commanding officer of the mission Freedom 19, the American base on the moon. He runs communications with the Russians who are also on the moon, and is trying to requet information from Pinov, who does not speak English, at the beginning of the story. He is upset with the Russians and does not like them very much, and he thinks they are deliberately making communication difficult. His reefer isn't working and he's boiling in his suit so he insists on going back into the dome to cool off, when he is knocked over by the quake from a seismic test the Russians are doing. He has a spat on the radio with the Russians and complains about the situation as the Americans try to patch the dome. While Capt. Lawler and Lt. Chandler head to the base for supplies, he stays behind in the dome, reflecting on how the American space suits are better than those of the Russians, as he yearns to be able to smoke. After the men return with a drum of calking compound, Winship continues discussing his suspicions that the Soviets ran the test to cause damage to the American base on purpose. After they try to mix the drum indoors, he realizes they have to move it back outside, but soon everything goes wrong. The drum heats up, heating up the air tank in turn, and a flame shoots through the dome, burning through the entire American oxygen supply.",
        "Summary_4": "Major Winship is the commander of the four-person crew of the Freedom 19. Suspicious and cynical, Winship envies the luxury in which the crew at Base Gagarin lives. His bitterness manifests in his interactions with everyone from the Russian crew; he grows frustrated and impatient when Pinov cannot speak English. He suspects General Finogenov is lying about the purpose of the atomic test and believes he wants to eliminate the American base from the moon entirely. Winship orders his crew through a series of failed repairs using their inferior resources after the atomic test results in an air leak in the Freedom 19 dome. During his call to Earth to report the explosion damage, he thinks he is dying when his emergency air supply runs out, but Wilkins quickly replaces it. Winship's growing frustration reaches its crescendo when Lawler and Chandler return from their supply run, and the five-person crew struggles to maneuver the large container into the small dome and then further struggle to build a makeshift mixer which with to stir the calking compound.

That's going to take awhile.     It's something to do while we wait.     I guess we ought to. Major Winship came down from the bunk andsat with his back toward the transmitter. Capt. Wilkins slewed theequipment around until the emergency jacks were accessible. Heunearthed the appropriate cable and began unscrewing the exteriorplate to the small transmitter-receiver set on Major Winship's back.Eventually, trailing wires, Major Winship was coupled into the network.Okay?     Okay, Major Winship gestured.     They roused Earth.     This is Major Charles Winship, Commanding Officer, Freedom 19, theAmerican moonbase.     At this point, Major Winship observed for the first time that he wasnow on emergency air. He started to ask Capt. Wilkins to change hisair bottle, but then he realized his communications were cut off. Hereached over and rapped Capt. Wilkins' helmet.     This is the Cape. Come in, Major Winship.     Just a moment.     Is everything all right?     Major Winship was squirming nervously, obviously perturbed.     A-Okay, he said. Just a moment.     What's wrong? came the worried question. In the background, he heardsomeone say, I think there's something wrong.     Capt. Wilkins peered intently. Major Winship contorted his face in asavage grimace.     Capt. Wilkins raised his eyebrows in alarm. They were face to facethrough their helmets, close together. Each face appeared monstrouslylarge to the other.     Major Winship made a strangling motion and reached for his throat. Onearm tangled a cable and jerked the speaker jack loose. Major Winshipcould no longer hear the alarmed expressions from the Cape. The effortwas not entirely subvocal, since he emitted a little gasping cry ininvoluntary realism.     This, in the course of some 90 seconds, was transmitted to Earth.     Capt. Wilkins's lips were desperately forming the word Leak?     Air, Major Winship said silently.     Leak?     Bottle! Bottle! Bottle! It was a frog-like, unvocal expletive.   <doc-sep> He crossed with the floating moon-motion to the airlock and entered,closing the door behind him. The darkness slowly filled with air, andthe temperature inside the suit declined steadily. At the proper momentof pressure, the inner lock slid open and Major Winship stepped intothe illuminated central area. His foot was lifted for the second stepwhen the floor beneath him rose and fell gently, pitching him forward,off balance. He stumbled against the table and ended up seated besidethe radio equipment. The ground moved again.     Charlie! Charlie!     I'm okay, Major Winship answered. Okay! Okay!     It's\u2014     There was additional surface movement. The movement ceased.     Hey, Les, how's it look? Capt. Wilkins asked.     Okay from this side. Charlie, you still okay?     Okay, Major Winship said. We told them this might happen, he addedbitterly.     There was a wait during which everyone seemed to be holding theirbreath.     I guess it's over, said Major Winship, getting to his feet. Wait abit more, there may be an after-shock. He switched once again to theemergency channel.     Is Pinov, came the supremely relaxed voice. Help?     Major Winship whinnied in disgust.       Nyet!      he snarled. To the otherAmericans: Our comrades seem unconcerned.     Tough.     They began to get the static for the first time. It crackled andsnapped in their speakers. They made sounds of disapproval at eachother. For a minute or two, static blanked out the communicationscompletely. It then abated to something in excess of normal.     Well, Lt. Chandler commented, even though we didn't build this thingto withstand a moonquake, it seems to have stood up all right.     I guess I was just\u2014 Major Winship began. Oh, hell! We're losingpressure. Where's the markers?     By the lug cabinet.     Got 'em, Major Winship said a moment later.     He peeled back a marker and let it fall. Air currents whisked it awayand plastered it against a riveted seam of the dome. It pulsed asthough it were breathing and then it ruptured.     Major Winship moved quickly to cut out the emergency air supply whichhad cut in automatically with the pressure drop. You guys wait. It'son your right side, midway up. I'll try to sheet it.     He moved for the plastic sheeting.     We've lost about three feet of calk out here, Capt. Lawler said. Ican see more ripping loose. You're losing pressure fast at this rate.     Major Winship pressed the sheeting over the leak. How's that?     Not yet.     I don't think I've got enough pressure left to hold it, now. It'ssprung a little, and I can't get it to conform over the rivet heads.     There was a splatter of static.     Damn! Major Winship said, they should have made these things moreflexible.     Still coming out.     Best I can do. Major Winship stepped back. The sheet began slowlyto slide downward, then it fell away completely and lay limply on thefloor.     Come on in, he said dryly.  "

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in DOWN TO THE WORLDS OF MEN?",
        "Summary_1": "The story begins on a scoutship with 29 fourteen-year-olds. The narrator of the story is Mia Havero, she is short and skinny. Her father is the Chairman of the Council. The fourteen-year-olds are being dropped on a planet called Tintera for their Trial. \n\n\nMia details her dislike of the planet. She rides on her horse Ninc for three days before she comes across other people. The men and Mia get into a disagreement because she does not want to join them. Mia proceeds to point her weapon and them. She tells them to drop their rifles on the ground and only lets them return to retrieve them once Mia and the men are a 20-minute ride away from the weapons. \n\nMia continues on riding her horse and passes a town where she meets more people. Eventually, Mia ends up at a campsite where she intends to rest and eat. However, the men who she encountered before and flashed her weapon at, find her at the campsite. She is grabbed from behind. The men have their grip on her, preventing her from escaping from them. The men destroy her pickup signal and she is punched in the face by one of the men. \n",
        "Summary_2": "First we see the main character, Mia, in a scoutship, where she and another fifteen girls and thirteen boys are being sent to the planet Tintera for their Trial. All of the inhabitants at the age of fourteen will be send to the Trial where they have to survive thirty days on a colonized planet. Those make to the end and are brought back by the ship are considered as useful to the society while those that cannot make it are not. \n\nMia spends the first night by her own after declining Jimmy Dentremont\u2019s invitation, a boy who is also on the Trial, to become partners, and avoiding Venie Morlock, a girl on Trial and has a crush on Jimmy Dentremont. Finally on the third day, Mia goes on the road, travelling east with her horse, Ninc. She meets Horst and his group of men. After they threaten her to go along with them, she pulls out her gun before they do. So she tells them to drop their weapons and walk along with her. Later she lets them go back to retrieve their guns. Afterwards, she gets to a village where she is shocked again. Here she sees the Free Birthers who destroyed Earth. But apparently, they seem to have forgotten what horrifying things they have done to Earth, to mankind. Then later, Mia sees the scoutship again, but the driver is not one of theirs, which is weird.\n\nAs she gets to a campsite, she pulls herself in. There she sees a family with three kids. They have a campfire and tell bedtime stories. Not long after, Horst and his group get here as well. Mia tries to escape, but she can\u2019t and is caught by Horst. She tries to use her gun again when they take her pickup signal, but this time she gets caught and is knocked unconscious. ",
        "Summary_3": "Mia Havero is a fourteen year old girl who lives on a spaceship home to a human civilization. She, along with twenty eight other young adults are about to be dropped off on a colonized planet Tintera, where they will undergo their Trial. Members of the Ship\u2019s population, upon turning fourteen, are dropped off on a planet with a horse, food and clothes, a pistol, and a pickup signal so that they may be picked up a month later, forced to survive on their wits and skills. \n\tJimmy Dentremont, one of the children about to be dropped off whom Mia considers to be of similar intelligence as herself, approaches her and asks if she wants to partner up during the trial. She teasingly refuses, and Jimmy disembarks the ship to begin his trial. Mia is dropped off at another location with her horse Ninc, and we learn of her dislike for planets: she is unaccustomed to the gravity, the fauna, and the smell.  \n\tOn her third day of riding, Mia discovers a road and five men herding grotesque green creatures. As she catches up with them, she notices that they are armed. Their leader, who she judges to have a mean face, invites her to ride with them to Forton. When she refuses, he gestures towards his rifle; however, she quickly draws her sonic pistol and forces the men to disarm. Twenty minutes of riding later, she leaves the men, allowing them to return for their weapons. \n\tMia enters a town whereupon she encounters a family with four children and realizes that the population of the planet engage in unregulated reproduction. She is disgusted by this behaviour, remembering that it was such behaviour that led to the overpopulation of Earth and the need to evacuate onto the Great Ships. Overhead, she notices a scout ship, similar to the one that dropped her off on Tintera, and wonders what it is doing there. \n\tNow at a campsite, Mia rests and observes the interaction between an old man and a family with three children. He tells the children the tale of Baba Yaga, an evil witch who lived in a house that stood on chicken legs. Baba Yaga\u2019s stepdaughter is sent to live with her, and foils her stepmother\u2019s attempt to get rid of her. \n\tSuddenly, Mia notices commotion at the edge of the camp, and realizes that the five men whom she held at gunpoint earlier had arrived. As she makes to leave, one of the men pins her and calls over the others. He tells Mia that it is obvious she is from a Ship, and that one of her friends was imprisoned in Forton. Mia quickly levels her gun at him, asking for the name of her friend. As he stalls, she is struck by another one of the men, and her pickup signal is destroyed shortly before she is knocked out.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Mia is a fourteen year old girl aboard Earth's ship after the planet's evacuation. When all children on the ship turn fourteen, they go through the Trial, where they are dropped on a random colonized planet and told to survive on their own for a month. Mia is waiting to be dropped on Tintera, a planet that has had little to no contact with the ship for over a century. She is accompanied by other children that she has known, some friends, most of them she is indifferent about. Once Mia is dropped onto Tintera along with her horse Ninc, she gets through the first night feeling frightened and lonely. For the next few days, she roams the planet in search of people to stick with. As she explores, she notes that Tintera is home to odd animals. Mia eventually finds a road and travels down it, meeting a group of men on horseback. The men question Mia, calling her a boy, and insist that she join them. Mia declines, to which the men draw their weapons at her. However, she raises her sonic pistol at them and is able to get away. Mia continues until she reaches a town, where she discovers that the people there are Free Birthers: people who were blamed for Earth's downfall and have multiple children. Mia is shocked by this, determined to find out more about the planet. Later that night, she comes across a campsite where she decides to turn in. She is surrounded by families and an old man who tells a story by the campfire about Baba Yaga, a wicked stepmother who sends her stepdaughter on a dangerous quest into the woods. As bedtime approaches, the men on horseback from earlier return, where they find Mia and attack her, robbing her of her gear and horse. Mia insults the men and is then knocked out.",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]       Every lonely man tries to make friends.     Manet just didn't know when to stop!      William Manet was alone.     In the beginning, he had seen many advantages to being alone. It wouldgive him an unprecedented opportunity to once and for all correlateloneliness to the point of madness, to see how long it would take himto start slavering and clawing the pin-ups from the magazines, to beginteaching himself classes in philosophy consisting of interminablelectures to a bored and captive audience of one.     He would be able to measure the qualities of peace and decide whetherit was really better than war, he would be able to get as fat and asdirty as he liked, he would be able to live more like an animal andthink more like a god than any man for generations.     But after a shorter time than he expected, it all got to be a tearingbore. Even the waiting to go crazy part of it.     Not that he was going to have any great long wait of it. He was alreadytalking to himself, making verbal notes for his lectures, and he hadcut out a picture of Annie Oakley from an old book. He tacked it up andwinked at it whenever he passed that way.     Lately she was winking back at him.     Loneliness was a physical weight on his skull. It peeled the flesh fromhis arms and legs and sandpapered his self-pity to a fine sensitivity.     No one on Earth was as lonely as William Manet, and even William Manetcould only be this lonely on Mars.     Manet was Atmosphere Seeder Station 131-47's own human.     All Manet had to do was sit in the beating aluminum heart in the middleof the chalk desert and stare out, chin cupped in hands, at the flat,flat pavement of dirty talcum, at the stars gleaming as hard in theblack sky as a starlet's capped teeth ... stars two of which were moonsand one of which was Earth. He had to do nothing else. The wholegimcrack was cybernetically controlled, entirely automatic. No one wasneeded here\u2014no human being, at least.     The Workers' Union was a pretty small pressure group, but it didn'ttake much to pressure the Assembly. Featherbedding had been carefullyspecified, including an Overseer for each of the Seeders to honeycombMars, to prepare its atmosphere for colonization.     They didn't give tests to find well-balanced, well-integrated peoplefor the job. Well-balanced, well-integrated men weren't going toisolate themselves in a useless job. They got, instead, William Manetand his fellows.     The Overseers were to stay as long as the job required. Passenger fareto Mars was about one billion dollars. They weren't providing commuterservice for night shifts. They weren't providing accommodationsfor couples when the law specified only one occupant. They weren'tproviding fuel (at fifty million dollars a gallon) for visits betweenthe various Overseers. They weren't very providential.     But it was two hundred thousand a year in salary, and it offeredwonderful opportunities.     It gave William Manet an opportunity to think he saw a spaceship makinga tailfirst landing on the table of the desert, its tail burning asbright as envy.  "

        "Query": "What did Mia learn about the destruction of Earth in DOWN TO THE WORLDS OF MEN?",
        "Summary_1": "Mia is taught that those who destroyed Earth were not smart and that they deserve punishment for their actions. According to her, Earth was evacuated because of overpopulation. People had too many children that required more resources than Earth was capable of providing. Consequently, there was a fight over the remaining resources that caused a war. \n\nMia has great-great-grandparents that were among those who anticipated the destruction of Earth and prepared to leave. \n\nIn addition, Mia talks about how humans left Earth. She says there were Great Ships built around 2025. The Great Ships and other things went into the Solar System in 2041. The humans that escaped established 112 colonies in the first 16 years. During this retelling of what she was taught, she emphasizes that horses were important to the success of the new colonies. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Mia knows that there was a evac plan on Earth long ago, the evac plan needed to be implemented and colonies had to be established in a very short amount of time. In 2025, first of the eight Great Ships was finished. Then before 2041, 112 colonies were created. Mia believes that bringing horses to the colonies was an important factor that lead to the success of those colonies. Even those few planets could have had substitutes for horses, they had to be domesticated and trained. \n\nLater we acknowledge that Mia has learned about the Free Birthers in school. They destroyed Earth. Those Free Birthers basically just bred and spread, and the population on earth reached 8 billion. With so many people, resources became limited, which in the end lead to the war that destroyed Earth, and 8 billion people died along with the blow up of the Solar System. Thus, without those Free Birthers, there would never be 8 billion people on Earth, then the evac plan would never take place, and those 8 billion people would not have to die. If his great-great-grandparents did not have the foresight he did, Mia might not even be alive. ",
        "Summary_3": "Mia is taught that, ultimately, Earth\u2019s destruction is attributable to Free Birthers, those who have an unregulated number of children. Because of the resulting overpopulation, the resources of Earth were consumed and contested, resulting in the death of eight billion people and the final war which tore apart the solar system in 2041. The first of the Great Ships, like the one on which Mia lives, was built sixteen years prior, and, in the intervening years, 112 colonies had been established. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Mia was taught, along with all young students, that Earth was destroyed due to an overpopulation problem. \"Free Birthers\" are to blame for the destruction of Earth; these are people that had multiple children, and according to what Mia was taught, used up all the limited resources that Earth had. By a certain point, Earth had become too overcrowded, with over eight billion people as a population. This ultimately led to a final war, and an evacuation.",

[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Worlds of If Science Fiction, July 1963.

There were sixteen of us girls and thirteen boys. We took our placesin the seats in the center of the scout. Riggy Allen made a joke thatnobody bothered to laugh at, and then we were all silent. I was feelinglost and just beginning to enjoy it when Jimmy Dentremont came over tome. He's red-headed and has a face that makes him look about ten. Anintelligent runt like me.     He said what I expected. Mia, do you want to go partners if we can gettogether when we get down?     I guess he thought that because we were always matched on study I likedhim. Well, I did when I wasn't mad at him, but now I had that crackhe'd made about being a snob in mind, so I said, Not likely. I want tocome back alive. It wasn't fair, but it was a good crack and he wentback to his place without saying anything.     My name is Mia Havero. I'm fourteen, of course, or I wouldn't betelling this. I'm short, dark and scrawny, though I don't expect thatscrawniness to last much longer. Mother is very good looking. In themeantime, I've got brains as a consolation.     After we were all settled, George Fuhonin, the pilot, raised the ramps.We sat there for five minutes while they bled air out of our tube andthen we just ... dropped. My stomach turned flips. We didn't have toleave that way, but George thinks it's fun to be a hot pilot.     Thinking it over, I was almost sorry I'd been stinking to Jimmy D. He'sthe only competition I have my own age. The trouble is, you don't gopartners with the competition, do you? Besides, there was still thatcrack about being a snob.     The planet chosen for our Trial was called Tintera. The last contactthe Ship had had with it\u2014and we were the ones who dropped them\u2014wasalmost 150 years ago. No contact since. That had made the Councildebate a little before they dropped us there, but they decided it wasall right in the end. It didn't make any practical difference to uskids because they never tell you anything about the place they're goingto drop you. All I knew was the name. I wouldn't have known that muchif Daddy weren't Chairman of the Council.     I felt like crawling in a corner of the ship and crying, but nobodyelse was breaking down, so I didn't. I did feel miserable. I cried whenI said good-by to Mother and Daddy\u2014a real emotional scene\u2014but thatwasn't in public.   <doc-sep> Ri swallowed. We couldn't make the people believe that.     No? Mia challenged. Couldn't we? Not today, but what about tomorrow?You'll see. Because I think the Army is getting ready to invade thealien system!     The people won't support them, Ri answered woodenly.           Think.     If he tells them to, they will. They trust him.     Ri looked around at the shadows.     That explains a lot of things, Mia said. I think the Army's beenpreparing for this for a long time. From the first, maybe. That's whyExtrone cut off our trade with the aliens. Partly to keep them fromlearning that he was getting ready to invade them, but more to keepthem from exposing      him     to the people. The aliens wouldn't be fooledlike we were, so easy.     No! Ri snapped. It was to keep the natural economic balance.     You know that's not right.     Ri lay down on his bed roll. Don't talk about it. It's not good totalk like this. I don't even want to listen.     When the invasion starts, he'll have to command      all     their loyalties.To keep them from revolt again. They'd be ready to believe us, then.He'll have a hard enough time without people running around trying totell the truth.     You're wrong. He's not like that. I know you're wrong.     Mia smiled twistedly. How many has he already killed? How can we evenguess?     Ri swallowed sickly.     Remember our guide? To keep our hunting territory a secret?     Ri shuddered. That's different. Don't you see? This is not at all likethat.   <doc-sep> It was Mia's turn to shrug. Whoever they were, they couldn't have beenhunters. They'd have kept the secret better.     We didn't do so damned well.     We didn't have a chance, Mia objected. Everybody and his brother hadheard the rumor that farn beasts were somewhere around here. It wasn'tour fault Extrone found out.     I wish we hadn't shot our guide, then. I wish he was here instead ofus.     Mia shook perspiration out of his eyes. We should have shot our pilot,too. That was our mistake. The pilot must have been the one who toldExtrone we'd hunted this area.     I didn't think a Club pilot would do that.     After Extrone said he'd hunt farn beasts, even if it meant going tothe alien system? Listen, you don't know.... Wait a minute.     There was perspiration on Ri's upper lip.           I     didn't tell Extrone, if that's what you're thinking, Mia said.     Ri's mouth twisted. I didn't say you did.     Listen, Mia said in a hoarse whisper. I just thought. Listen. Tohell with how he found out. Here's the point. Maybe he'll shoot us,too, when the hunt's over.     Ri licked his lips. No. He wouldn't do that. We're not\u2014not justanybody. He couldn't kill us like that. Not even      him     . And besides,why would he want to do that? It wouldn't do any good to shoot us. Toomany people already know about the farn beasts. You said that yourself.     Mia said, I hope you're right. They stood side by side, studying theblast area in silence. Finally, Mia said, We better be getting back.     What'll we tell him?     That we saw tracks. What else can we tell him?     They turned back along their trail, stumbling over vines.     It gets hotter at sunset, Ri said nervously.     The breeze dies down.     It's screwy. I didn't think farn beasts had this wide a range. Theremust be a lot of them, to be on both sides of the ridge like this.     There may be a pass, Mia said, pushing a vine away.     Ri wrinkled his brow, panting. I guess that's it. If there were a lotof them, we'd have heard something before we did. But even so, it'sdamned funny, when you think about it.     Mia looked up at the darkening sky. We better hurry, he said.  "

        "Query": "How does Tintera differ from Mia's familiar planet, according to her observations in DOWN TO THE WORLDS OF MEN?",
        "Summary_1": "Mia discusses how she does not like different planets for many reasons, gravity included. In addition, she does not like the idea of animals that can crawl on her or vegetation existing unintentionally. She also does not like the smells of different planets. When Mia sees individuals with more than one child, she becomes nauseous at the sight. To Mia, that seems reckless to have so many children as she is taught that it was the cause of Earth\u2019s destruction. Another occurrence that Mia finds interesting is when she sees an old man during her travels. She is fascinated by his white hair, which she notes that she had never seen in person before. ",
        "Summary_2": "Firstly, the planet Tintera has not been in contact with the Ship for almost 150 years. For the first two days in her Trial she sees nothing except some odd looking animals. To her surprise, they actually taste good, while some other good looking things do not taste so good. She also notices the ugly animals that Horst and his men are herding. Secondly, the town shocks her. Everything there are out of date. The truck she saw is the most advanced machine they have. The newspaper at the rear of the town has \u201cinvasion\u201d printed on them. There are literally no women older than 10 years old, only men, boys and kids. She feels weird. But after she sees the swarming kids, she realizes that those people are Free Birthers. She feels sick by what she sees in this sight since they are the ones that basically destroyed Earth. Moreover, to her surprises, they don\u2019t even seem to remember about the things that they\u2019ve done to Earth at all. ",
        "Summary_3": "Mia harbors a dislike for planets, particularly because she is unaccustomed to certain aspects. Specifically, she feels the attractive force gravity is different from on the ship where she lives. She is unfamiliar with the ubiquitous vegetation and the fauna. Furthermore, Mia mentions that she is not used to having the lights go out, suggesting that the lights on the ship stay on at all times. Most of all, however, she dislikes the smell of planets. Though there is a relatively small space on her ship on the third level which bear semblance to planets, it is different from Tintera in that Mia is able to leave when she feels uncomfortable. \n\tAdditionally, Tintera\u2019s human culture is different from on the ship. Whereas the inhabitants of the ship are bound by a culture which prohibits unregulated reproduction, the people of Tintera are Free Birthers unconcerned with such matters.

        "Summary_4": "Tintera has many differences from the life on the ship that Mia is used to. Firstly, and as is similar for all planets, it has an unpleasant smell in its atmosphere. The seasons are also different; despite it being December on the ship, it is spring on Tintera. The planet also has animals that Mia is not used to seeing; for example, the strange creatures that she sees being herded by the men on horseback. The biggest difference that Mia notes about Tintera is that here, people have multiple children who roam about freely. This goes against the rules of the Council and frightens Mia. ",

There were sixteen of us girls and thirteen boys. We took our placesin the seats in the center of the scout. Riggy Allen made a joke thatnobody bothered to laugh at, and then we were all silent. I was feelinglost and just beginning to enjoy it when Jimmy Dentremont came over tome. He's red-headed and has a face that makes him look about ten. Anintelligent runt like me.     He said what I expected. Mia, do you want to go partners if we can gettogether when we get down?     I guess he thought that because we were always matched on study I likedhim. Well, I did when I wasn't mad at him, but now I had that crackhe'd made about being a snob in mind, so I said, Not likely. I want tocome back alive. It wasn't fair, but it was a good crack and he wentback to his place without saying anything.     My name is Mia Havero. I'm fourteen, of course, or I wouldn't betelling this. I'm short, dark and scrawny, though I don't expect thatscrawniness to last much longer. Mother is very good looking. In themeantime, I've got brains as a consolation.     After we were all settled, George Fuhonin, the pilot, raised the ramps.We sat there for five minutes while they bled air out of our tube andthen we just ... dropped. My stomach turned flips. We didn't have toleave that way, but George thinks it's fun to be a hot pilot.     Thinking it over, I was almost sorry I'd been stinking to Jimmy D. He'sthe only competition I have my own age. The trouble is, you don't gopartners with the competition, do you? Besides, there was still thatcrack about being a snob.     The planet chosen for our Trial was called Tintera. The last contactthe Ship had had with it\u2014and we were the ones who dropped them\u2014wasalmost 150 years ago. No contact since. That had made the Councildebate a little before they dropped us there, but they decided it wasall right in the end. It didn't make any practical difference to uskids because they never tell you anything about the place they're goingto drop you. All I knew was the name. I wouldn't have known that muchif Daddy weren't Chairman of the Council.     I felt like crawling in a corner of the ship and crying, but nobodyelse was breaking down, so I didn't. I did feel miserable. I cried whenI said good-by to Mother and Daddy\u2014a real emotional scene\u2014but thatwasn't in public.   <doc-sep> Mia looked at his companion. He spat. What hurts most, he pays us forit. I could buy half this planet, and he makes me his guide\u2014at lessthan I pay my secretary.     Well, anyway, we won't have to cross that ridge.     Hey, you! Extrone called.     The two of them turned immediately.     You two scout ahead, Extrone said. See if you can pick up sometracks.     Yes, sir, Ri said, and instantly the two of them readjusted theirshoulder straps and started off.     Shortly they were inside of the scrub forest, safe from sight. Let'swait here, Mia said.     No, we better go on. He may have sent a spy in.     They pushed on, being careful to blaze the trees, because they were notprofessional guides.     We don't want to get too near, Ri said after toiling through theforest for many minutes. Without guns, we don't want to get nearenough for the farn beast to charge us.     They stopped. The forest was dense, the vines clinging.     He'll want the bearers to hack a path for him, Mia said. But we goit alone. Damn him.     Ri twisted his mouth into a sour frown. He wiped at his forehead. Hot.By God, it's hot. I didn't think it was this hot, the first time wewere here.     Mia said, The first time,      we     weren't guides. We didn't notice it somuch then.     They fought a few yards more into the forest.     Then it ended. Or, rather, there was a wide gap. Before them lay ablast area, unmistakable. The grass was beginning to grow again, butthe tree stumps were roasted from the rocket breath.     This isn't ours! Ri said. This looks like it was made nearly a yearago!     Mia's eyes narrowed. The military from Xnile?     No, Ri said. They don't have any rockets this small. And I don'tthink there's another cargo rocket on this planet outside of the one weleased from the Club. Except the one      he     brought.     The ones who discovered the farn beasts in the first place? Miaasked. You think it's their blast?     So? Ri said. But who are they?   <doc-sep> Ri swallowed. We couldn't make the people believe that.     No? Mia challenged. Couldn't we? Not today, but what about tomorrow?You'll see. Because I think the Army is getting ready to invade thealien system!     The people won't support them, Ri answered woodenly.           Think.     If he tells them to, they will. They trust him.     Ri looked around at the shadows.     That explains a lot of things, Mia said. I think the Army's beenpreparing for this for a long time. From the first, maybe. That's whyExtrone cut off our trade with the aliens. Partly to keep them fromlearning that he was getting ready to invade them, but more to keepthem from exposing      him     to the people. The aliens wouldn't be fooledlike we were, so easy.     No! Ri snapped. It was to keep the natural economic balance.     You know that's not right.     Ri lay down on his bed roll. Don't talk about it. It's not good totalk like this. I don't even want to listen.     When the invasion starts, he'll have to command      all     their loyalties.To keep them from revolt again. They'd be ready to believe us, then.He'll have a hard enough time without people running around trying totell the truth.     You're wrong. He's not like that. I know you're wrong.     Mia smiled twistedly. How many has he already killed? How can we evenguess?     Ri swallowed sickly.     Remember our guide? To keep our hunting territory a secret?     Ri shuddered. That's different. Don't you see? This is not at all likethat.  "

        "Query": "At what age do the residents of the Ship experience a significant event and what is its significance, as described in DOWN TO THE WORLDS OF MEN?",
        "Summary_1": "At fourteen years old, the inhabitants of the Ship are put through a Trial. During the trial, they are dropped off at the nearest colonized planet and then picked up a month later if they manage to survive on the planet. Each of the fourteen-year-olds are dropped off in separate locations on the planet. They are given a pick signal device so the scoutship that escorted them to the planet is able to locate them at the end of their 30-day Trial period. \n\nThe purpose of the trial according to the Chairman of the Council is because a closed society needs a way to ensure the physical and mental of its populations. In addition, it helps to maintain a suitable number of individuals in the population. Those that are unable to survive their Trial are presumed to be not fit for life on the Ship.  \n",
        "Summary_2": "At the age of fourteen, each of the inhabitants of the Ship are supposed to have their Trial. Simply stated, they will be dropped at a colonized planet that is the nearest to them for a month, and for this whole thirty days, the inhabitants will try to keep themselves alive. They can do this on their own, with partners, or join forces. Each of the inhabitants is provided with a sonic pistol, pickup signal, saddle, cinches, food and clothes. One month later, the Ship will come back to get them according to their pickup signal. It is important to note that, while they have all been prepared and trained to survive, some of them are still not able to make it out alive. According to the society, they are incapable of presenting themselves as useful to the Ship if they cannot make it out alive. Mia understands that this whole process is for the good of the society. And since they have all been through this training, everyone on the Ship \u2013 the society \u2013 are able to take care of themselves if they ever have to do so. Moreover, this process prevents the society from decaying, both in the mind and in the body as well as to keep a steady population. ",
        "Summary_3": "At fourteen, the inhabitants of the Ship undergo their Trial, a month-long period in which they must survive on the nearest inhabited planet by themselves. Though Mia Havero, the first-person narrator of the story, expects to return safely to the ship after the duration of her Trial, many do not survive. For her trial, Mia is left on the planet Tintera with her horse, Ninc, food and clothes, and a pickup signal.\n\tThe rationale behind the trial, as Mia presents it, is to screen for those inhabitants of the ship able to take care of themselves. Those who are unable to look after themselves and thereby fail the trial are not sufficiently prepared for life on the Ship. Additionally, Mia\u2019s father, the chairman of the council of the ship, tells her that it is to prevent its population from decaying mentally and physically, as well as to maintain the population. \n",
        "Summary_4": "When children on the ship turn fourteen, they are dropped on a planet that has been colonized. They are left alone for a month to fend for themselves and survive, then are picked up again by the ship. The children are prepared beforehand, and trained in survival and fighting in order to stand a chance at the Trial. However, not everyone makes it. The Ship's reasoning behind this is to ensure that every individual is able to take care of themselves and be properly skilled. Mia's father has also suggested other motives, including maintaining a steady population and keeping it from decreasing its value mentally and physically.",

A sub-race of men on the other side of the Galaxy. She was vocalizingabout her home planet when I managed to locate her.     Any other information?     None. Electronic guards were sliding into place as soon as I reachedher. I got out as fast as I could.     I see. The significance of that, if any, escaped him. Nevertheless,it sounded depressing.     What I want to know is, said Dimanche, why such precautions aselectronic guards? What does Travelers Aid have that's so secret?     Cassal grunted and didn't answer. Dimanche could be annoyinglyinquisitive at times.     Cassal had entered one side of a block-square building. He came out onthe other side. The agency was larger than he had thought.

Stuck? repeated Cassal. I suppose you can call it that. I'm waitingfor my ship. He frowned. He was the one who wanted to ask questions.Why all the redecoration? I thought Travelers Aid was an old agency.Why did you change so many signs? I could understand it if the agencywere new.     The old man chuckled. Re-organization. The previous first counselorresigned suddenly, in the middle of the night, they say. The new onedidn't like the name of the agency, so she ordered it changed.     She would do just that, thought Cassal. What about this Murra Foray?     The old man winked mysteriously. He opened his mouth and then seemedovercome with senile fright. Hurriedly he shuffled away.     Cassal gazed after him, baffled. The old man was afraid for his job,afraid of the first counselor. Why he should be, Cassal didn't know. Heshrugged and went on.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]        Finding a cause worth dying for is no       great trick\u2014the Universe is full of them. Finding       one worth living for is the genuine problem!        In the region of the Coal Sack Nebula, on the dead fourth planet ofa star called Tyban, Captain Steffens of the Mapping Command stoodcounting buildings. Eleven. No, twelve. He wondered if there was anysignificance in the number. He had no idea.     What do you make of it? he asked.     Lieutenant Ball, the executive officer of the ship, almost tried toscratch his head before he remembered that he was wearing a spacesuit.     Looks like a temporary camp, Ball said. Very few buildings, and allbuilt out of native materials, the only stuff available. Castaways,maybe?     Steffens was silent as he walked up onto the rise. The flat weatheredstone jutted out of the sand before him.     No inscriptions, he pointed out.     They would have been worn away. See the wind grooves? Anyway, there'snot another building on the whole damn planet. You wouldn't call itmuch of a civilization.     You don't think these are native?     Ball said he didn't. Steffens nodded.     Standing there and gazing at the stone, Steffens felt the awe of greatage. He had a hunch, deep and intuitive, that this was old\u2014      too     old.He reached out a gloved hand, ran it gently over the smooth stoneridges of the wall. Although the atmosphere was very thin, he noticedthat the buildings had no airlocks.     Ball's voice sounded in his helmet: Want to set up shop, Skipper?     Steffens paused. All right, if you think it will do any good.     You never can tell. Excavation probably won't be much use. Thesethings are on a raised rock foundation, swept clean by the wind. Andyou can see that the rock itself is native\u2014 he indicated the ledgebeneath their feet\u2014and was cut out a long while back.     How long?     Ball toed the sand uncomfortably. I wouldn't like to say off-hand.     Make a rough estimate.     Ball looked at the captain, knowing what was in his mind. He smiledwryly and said: Five thousand years? Ten thousand? I don't know.     Steffens whistled.     Ball pointed again at the wall. Look at the striations. You can tellfrom that alone. It would take even a brisk Earth wind      at least     several thousand years to cut that deep, and the wind here has only afraction of that force.     The two men stood for a long moment in silence. Man had been ininterstellar space for three hundred years and this was the firstuncovered evidence of an advanced, space-crossing, alien race. It wasan historic moment, but neither of them was thinking about history.     Man had been in space for only three hundred years. Whatever had builtthese had been in space for thousands of years.     Which ought to give      them     , thought Steffens uncomfortably, one hell ofa good head-start.   <doc-sep> Cousin Ives\u2014now that Martin was older, he was told to call thedescendants      cousin     \u2014next assumed guardianship. Ives took hisresponsibilities more seriously than the others did. He even arrangedto have Martin's work shown at an art gallery. The paintings receivedcritical approval, but failed to evoke any enthusiasm. The modestsale they enjoyed was mostly to interior decorators. Museums were notinterested.     Takes time, Ives tried to reassure him. One day they'll be buyingyour pictures, Martin. Wait and see.     Ives was the only one of the descendants who seemed to think of Martinas an individual. When his efforts to make contact with the other youngman failed, he got worried and decided that what Martin needed was achange of air and scenery.     'Course you can't go on the Grand Tour. Your son hasn't inventedspace travel yet. But we can go see this world. What's left of it.Tourists always like ruins best, anyway.     So he drew on the family's vast future resources and bought a yacht,which Martin christened      The Interregnum     . They traveled about from seato ocean and from ocean to sea, touching at various ports and makingtrips inland. Martin saw the civilized world\u2014mostly in fragments; thenearly intact semi-civilized world and the uncivilized world, much thesame as it had been for centuries. It was like visiting an enormousmuseum; he couldn't seem to identify with his own time any more.     The other cousins appeared to find the yacht a congenial head-quarters,largely because they could spend so much time far away from thecontemporary inhabitants of the planet and relax and be themselves. Sothey never moved back to land. Martin spent the rest of his life on      The Interregnum     . He felt curiously safer from Conrad there, althoughthere was no valid reason why an ocean should stop a traveler throughtime.     More cousins were in residence at once than ever before, becausethey came for the ocean voyage. They spent most of their time aboardship, giving each other parties and playing an      avant-garde     form ofshuffleboard and gambling on future sporting events. That last usuallyended in a brawl, because one cousin was sure to accuse another ofhaving got advance information about the results.     Martin didn't care much for their company and associated with them onlywhen not to have done so would have been palpably rude. And, thoughthey were gregarious young people for the most part, they didn't courthis society. He suspected that he made them feel uncomfortable.  "

Horst asserts that Mia will ride along with the men to the town of Forton. However, Mia disagrees with that statement and Horst does not like the response. Horst begins to bring out his rifle, but Mia grabs her sonic pistol before he is able to do so. She holds them at gunpoint until they drop their weapons. \n\nAfter this confrontation, Horst and Mia do not see each other again until they both end up at the same campsite. At the campsite, Horst and his companions bind Mia\u2019s arms together to prevent her from escaping them. They look through her stuff and threaten her. \n",

But he follows and asks her where she is from and going. He wants her to ride with them for protection, but Mia refuses. Interestingly, he thinks Mia is a boy. Before Horst could pull out his gun, Mia pulls out her gun first. She tells them to leave their weapons and ride along, which they did surprisingly. After a while, she tells them they can go back to gather their weapons. She finds this quite amusing. \n\nMia never thought of meeting Horst again.

She tries to scream for help, but before she could do so, her mouth gets covered by Horst. Mia still has the gun with her, so she threatens Horst to hand her the pickup signal since this is her only way of getting contact with the Ship when they are to be brought back. After he handed it to her, she asks for the name of the kid in jail. But before she could get an answer, she gets hit and lost her gun. Horst has the pickup signal now.

He and his team of four others are tasked with herding a group of ugly green creatures with squat figures and lanky limbs. \nOn his first encounter with Mia, he mistakes her for a boy and encourages her to join his team on the ride to Forton. However, when she refuses, he reaches for his gun before Mia quickly unholsters her weapon and aims it at him. She holds him and his team at gunpoint, forcing them to disarm, and makes them ride with her for twenty minutes before letting them go. \nLater, Mia is at a camp when she notices the arrival of Horst and his team. One of them recognizes her and signals Horst over. As she fights with this other man, Horst subdues her and threatens to harm her. As the other man beats Mia, Horst intervenes and tells him to stop, asserting his leadership of the group. Mia threatens to report Horst to the courts, which causes him to laugh and point out that she is obviously not from Tintera.

It was the onewho'd made the joke about me being beneath the notice of a Losel. Hewas alone with me now, but with that call the others would be up fast.     I brought the saddle around as hard as I could and then up, and hewent down. He started to get up again, so I dropped the saddle on himand reached inside my jacket for my gun. Somebody grabbed me then frombehind and pinned my arms to my side.     I opened my mouth to scream\u2014I have a good scream\u2014but a rough smellyhand clamped down over it before I had a chance to get more than alungful of air. I bit down hard\u20145000 lbs. psi, I'm told\u2014but hedidn't let me go. I started to kick, but Horst jerked me off my feetand dragged me off.     When we were behind the pen and out of earshot of the fire, he stoppeddragging me and dropped me in a heap. Make any noise, he said, andI'll hurt you.     That was a silly way to put it, but somehow it said more than if he'dthreatened to break my arm or my head. It left him a latitude of thingsto do if he pleased. He examined his hand. There was enough moonlightfor that. I ought to club you anyway, he said.     The one I'd dropped the saddle on came up then. The others were puttingthe animals in the pen. He started to kick me, but Horst stopped him.     No, he said. Look through the kid's gear, bring the horse and whatwe can use.     The other one didn't move. Get going, Jack, Horst said in a menacingtone and they stood toe to toe for a long moment before Jack finallybacked down. It seemed to me that Horst wasn't so much objecting to mebeing kicked, but was rather establishing who did the kicking in hisbunch.     But I wasn't done yet. I was scared, but I still had the pistol undermy jacket.     Horst turned back to me and I said, You can't do this and get awaywith it.     He said, Look, boy. You may not know it, but you be in a lot oftrouble. So don't give me a hard time.     He still thought I was a boy. It was not time to correct him, but Ididn't like to see the point go unchallenged. It was unflattering.     The courts won't let you get away with this, I said. I'd passeda courthouse in the town with a carved motto over the doors: EQUALJUSTICE UNDER THE LAW or TRUTH OUR SHIELD AND JUSTICE OUR SWORD orsomething stuffy like that.     He laughed, not a phony, villian-type laugh, but a real laugh, so Iknew I'd goofed.     Boy, boy. Don't talk about the courts. I be doing you a favor. I betaking what I can use of your gear, but I be letting you go. You go tocourt and they'll take everything and lock you up besides. I be leavingyou your freedom.     Why would they be doing that? I asked. I slipped my hand under myjacket.     Every time you open your mouth you shout that you be off one of theShips, Horst said. That be enough. They already have one of you bratsin jail in Forton.     I was about to bring my gun out when up came Jack leading Ninc, withall my stuff loaded on. I mentally thanked him.     He said, The kid's got some good equipment. But I can't make out whatthis be for. He held out my pickup signal.     Horst looked at it, then handed it back. Throw it away, he said.     I leveled my gun at them\u2014Hell on Wheels strikes again! I said, Handthat over to me.     Horst made a disgusted sound.     Don't make any noise, I said, or you'll fry. Now hand it over.     I stowed it away, then paused with one hand on the leather horn of thesaddle. What's the name of the kid in jail in Forton.     I can't remember, he said. But it be coming to me. Hold on.     I waited. Then suddenly my arm was hit a numbing blow from behindand the gun went flying. Jack pounced after it and Horst said, Goodenough, to the others who'd come up behind me.     I felt like a fool.     Horst stalked over and got the signal. He dropped it on the ground andsaid in a voice far colder than mine could ever be, because it wasnatural and mine wasn't, The piece be yours. Then he tromped on ituntil it cracked and fell apart.     Then he said, Pull a gun on me twice. Twice. He slapped me so hardthat my ears rang. You dirty little punk.     I said calmly, You big louse.     It was a time I would have done better to keep my mouth shut. All I canremember is a flash of pain as his fist crunched against the side of myface and then nothing.     Brains are no good if you don't use them.    <doc-sep> It was Mia's turn to shrug. Whoever they were, they couldn't have beenhunters. They'd have kept the secret better.     We didn't do so damned well.     We didn't have a chance, Mia objected. Everybody and his brother hadheard the rumor that farn beasts were somewhere around here. It wasn'tour fault Extrone found out.     I wish we hadn't shot our guide, then. I wish he was here instead ofus.     Mia shook perspiration out of his eyes. We should have shot our pilot,too. That was our mistake. The pilot must have been the one who toldExtrone we'd hunted this area.     I didn't think a Club pilot would do that.     After Extrone said he'd hunt farn beasts, even if it meant going tothe alien system? Listen, you don't know.... Wait a minute.     There was perspiration on Ri's upper lip.           I     didn't tell Extrone, if that's what you're thinking, Mia said.     Ri's mouth twisted. I didn't say you did.     Listen, Mia said in a hoarse whisper. I just thought. Listen. Tohell with how he found out. Here's the point. Maybe he'll shoot us,too, when the hunt's over.     Ri licked his lips. No. He wouldn't do that. We're not\u2014not justanybody. He couldn't kill us like that. Not even      him     . And besides,why would he want to do that? It wouldn't do any good to shoot us. Toomany people already know about the farn beasts. You said that yourself.     Mia said, I hope you're right. They stood side by side, studying theblast area in silence. Finally, Mia said, We better be getting back.     What'll we tell him?     That we saw tracks. What else can we tell him?     They turned back along their trail, stumbling over vines.     It gets hotter at sunset, Ri said nervously.     The breeze dies down.     It's screwy. I didn't think farn beasts had this wide a range. Theremust be a lot of them, to be on both sides of the ridge like this.     There may be a pass, Mia said, pushing a vine away.     Ri wrinkled his brow, panting. I guess that's it. If there were a lotof them, we'd have heard something before we did. But even so, it'sdamned funny, when you think about it.     Mia looked up at the darkening sky. We better hurry, he said.   <doc-sep> It's frightening, Ri said, to be that close to him.     Mia nodded.     The two of them, beneath the leaf-swollen branches of the gnarled tree,were seated on their sleeping bags. The moon was clear and cold andbright in a cloudless sky; a small moon, smooth-surfaced, except for acentral mountain ridge that bisected it into almost twin hemispheres.     To think of him. As flesh and blood. Not like the\u2014well; that\u2014whatwe've read about.     Mia glanced suspiciously around him at the shadows. You begin tounderstand a lot of things, after seeing him.     Ri picked nervously at the cover of his sleeping bag.     It makes you think, Mia added. He twitched. I'm afraid. I'm afraidhe'll.... Listen, we'll talk. When we get back to civilization. You,me, the bearers. About him. He can't let that happen. He'll kill usfirst.     Ri looked up at the moon, shivering. No. We have friends. We haveinfluence. He couldn't just like that\u2014     He could say it was an accident.     No, Ri said stubbornly.     He can say anything, Mia insisted. He can make people believeanything. Whatever he says. There's no way to check on it.     It's getting cold, Ri said.     Listen, Mia pleaded.     No, Ri said. Even if we tried to tell them, they wouldn't listen.Everybody would      know     we were lying. Everything they've come tobelieve would tell them we were lying. Everything they've read, everypicture they've seen. They wouldn't believe us.      He     knows that.     Listen, Mia repeated intently. This is important. Right now hecouldn't afford to let us talk. Not right now. Because the Army isnot against him. Some officers were here, just before we came back. Abearer overheard them talking. They don't      want     to overthrow him!     Ri's teeth, suddenly, were chattering.     That's another lie, Mia continued. That he protects the people fromthe Army. That's a lie. I don't believe they were      ever     plottingagainst him. Not even at first. I think they      helped     him, don't yousee?     Ri whined nervously.     It's like this, Mia said. I see it like this. The Army      put     him inpower when the people were in rebellion against military rule.  "

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in BIG ANCESTOR?",
        "Summary_1": "The story starts with four of the species of the spectrum of human development together, talking and explaining about the possibility of mating with different species on the spectrum to Taphetta the Ribboneer. Emmer is an archeologist and he sits on one end of the spectrum. Halden, the biologist is from Earth, he is somewhat towards the middle on the spectrum. Meredith is a linguist, and she is further down the spectrum. And Kelburn, the mathematician, is at the far end of it. They explain to Taphetta about the theory of ability to mate with humans that are on planets that are close to each other. However, due to movement of planets, they are no longer close to each other. But with some accurate calculations, if all the stars were to go back two hundred thousand years, the position of those stars line up in the shape of a horse shoe. And they theorize that their original home lands on where the extension of the two ends of the horse shoe cross over. And the four explorers believe they have a chance of finding their original home. They are explaining this to Taphetta because they need him to be the pilot of this expedition. \n\nAfter Taphetta suggests that he does not like the air in the ship, they realize that some animals hs been eating the plants. With failing attempts to capture them, the biologist suggest that their mental and physical state might have changed due to radiation or atomic engines. Thus they set up a play for the animal to watch so that they will get into the trap. \n\nMeredith and Halden get into a fight because Meredith thinks Halden as primitive, and Halden does not like that. When he realizes that Meredith somehow knows she can\u2019t be fertile with Kelburn, he gets so angry that he hits her nose. Then he come to realize why Meredith will not want to marry him and have children with him, even he would want superior children.",
        "Summary_2": "The story begins with Taphetta discussing with Sam Halden, the leader of the expedition, Sam\u2019s theory on the origins of humans. They talk about different species and their abilities to mate with other species depending on how closely related the species are physical. They attempt to persuade Taphetta to pilot the ship by arguing that their theory is sound in logic and could lead to a great discovery. Taphetta is skeptical of their assertions for the origins of humans. Kelburn continues to explain in an attempt to convince him to navigate their ship.\n\nEventually, Taphetta agrees to navigate their ship as long as they sign his contract. The group does sign his contract as they desperately need his skills to complete their expedition. Halden trusts that his contract will not be deceitful. Once he has agreed, the group discusses Taphetta\u2019s need for better oxygen on the ship. During this discussion, it is brought to Halden\u2019s attention that there is an unknown pest on board the ship, an animal. \n\nEmmer talks to Taphetta about how every human race has achieved space travel at some point in their existence. Taphetta questions what they hope to achieve from their expedition, assuming that there will be money and technology to gain from the mission. Emmer and Halden argue that the examination of their culture and the drive of curiosity are their motivations for the mission. \n\nAt some point, the animals on the ship engage in a fight with a knife. After, Meredith and Halden begin conversing about their potential relationship. Halden leads Meredith to his cabin where he instinctively punches her nose after she has made him upset. They exchange words of admiration and lust for each other. Halden primitively kisses Meredith with passion.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Sam Halden, a biologist from a world where humans have developed to the early-middle section of their evolution, is in conversation with Taphetta, an individual of the non-human species Ribboneers, so named because of the ribbons protruding from his head. Halden explains to Taphetta that there are hundreds of independently-evolved human species on just as many worlds, each at various stages of human development. The crew of Halden\u2019s expedition, humans from the various human-inhabited worlds, represents the range of human development: Emmer is a Neanderthal-type archeologist who represents early humanity, Halden is an early-middle human, Meredith is a linguist from an advanced-middle human society, and Kelburn is a mathematician from the far advanced side of human evolution. \nTaphetta, himself from an advanced civilization, is initially uninterested in Halden\u2019s theories of human evolution. However, as Kelburn elaborates on the adjacency mating principle, an observation supporting the humans\u2019 hypothesis of a common ancestor which distributed humans throughout the galaxy, he becomes interested. Taphetta accepts the humans\u2019 invitation to be their pilot for the expedition, on the condition that they use his contract. \n\tAn engineer from the ship\u2019s hydroponics department, which is responsible for regulation of the ship\u2019s air, reports to Meredith, who is physically attractive and wearing a revealing skirt, that Taphetta is not fond of the air. Halden learns that the air quality in the ship has been suffering due to damage to the plants caused by an animal. Despite the engineer\u2019s efforts, the animal is resistant to pesticides and is intelligent enough to avoid the electric traps. They resolve to bait it into a trap. \n\tHalden approaches the ribboneer to inform him of the infestation. As he considers using the bait, Taphetta asks Emmer about the archeological evidence of their common ancestor on his home planet. The Neanderthal reveals that relics of massive proportions indicate the size of the common ancestor, and that they were likely long-lived and able to travel faster than light. Halden hypothesizes that their ancestor was unable to find a suitable planet, so instead left modified versions of themselves on each planet they visited. Taphetta is further interested by the theory of the common ancestry and finally acquiesces to using a bait to trap the pest. He also reveals that the terms of the contract upon which he insisted prohibits that information discovered during the expedition be withheld to the benefit of any race. \n\tMeredith and Halden are now monitoring the hydroponics room. They control two pest-like puppets which enact a fight scene: the smaller puppet, initially defeated by the larger, finds a knife and is able to slay the larger. The humans hope that the pests will be lured to the knife. Meredith and Halden then retire to his cabin, where she discusses the possible father of her children. Though she loves him, she dismisses the idea of bearing his child, as it will dilute her evolved biology. He strikes her and breaks her nose, but she quickly heals. He kisses her. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Taphetta, a creature of the Ribboneer species, has recently been recruited by a team of humans to aid in navigating a mission to discover the human race's \"big ancestor\": the original source of all humans which are now scattered across the Milky Way. Curious, and slightly skeptical, of the mission, Taphetta interrogates Sam Halden, a biologist, and Kelburn, a mathematician, about their theory of how humans evolved. Through analyzing the galactic routes of the human race and their locations throughout history, the team believes they have pinned the general home of the big ancestor. Taphetta agrees to help in the mission, under the condition that the team agrees to his own proposed contract rather than their own. As Taphetta prepares for navigation, he notes to Firmon, head of hydroponics, that he is bothered by the air quality on the ship. Firmon attempts to improve the air, however is met with an issue; the plants on the ship are being eaten by an unknown animal that hides within its machinery. With options limited to rebuilding the ship or baiting the animals through a risky experiment, Taphetta is again skeptical of the conditions of the ship. He requests that the team answer more questions while he thinks it over, and inquires about the big ancestor and its qualities. Emmer, a Neanderthal archaeologist, recounts his experiences growing up around the ruins of the ancestors; the infrastructure was all that they left behind, with no other scrap of information that would indicate their existence, though it is likely that they left in search of another planet to live on while improving themselves through the alteration of their germ plasm. Taphetta then questions the motives of the mission, to which Emmer and Halden consider the abilities of the big ancestor, and how much of an achievement it would be to gain the knowledge they possessed biologically. Holden asks Taphetta what the difference was between the contract the team proposed and his own; he responds and says that his contract ensured the discoveries made on this mission would not be withheld for humans exclusively. With Taphetta agreeing to baiting the animals, the team uses a realistic puppet that resembles the pests, with a retractable knife that is able to kill them when they get close. After a successful test run, Halden and linguist Meredith, who have an intimate relationship to each other, go back to Halden's cabin, where they discuss the future, including having children. Meredith, who is of a higher race than Halden, admits that her main concern is bearing children that are as superior as possible, which requires a partner of a higher race than her. This angers Halden, resulting in him striking her, yet they both love each other and their passion overweighs their tension.",

Illustrated by Freas     Betty  looked up fromher magazine. She saidmildly, You're late.     Don't yell at me, Ifeel awful, Simon toldher. He sat down at his desk, passedhis tongue over his teeth in distaste,groaned, fumbled in a drawer for theaspirin bottle.     He looked over at Betty and said,almost as though reciting, What Ineed is a vacation.     What, Betty said, are you goingto use for money?     Providence, Simon told herwhilst fiddling with the aspirin bottle,will provide.     Hm-m-m. But before providingvacations it'd be nice if Providenceturned up a missing jewel deal, say.Something where you could deducethat actually the ruby ring had gonedown the drain and was caught in theelbow. Something that would netabout fifty dollars.     Simon said, mournful of tone,Fifty dollars? Why not make it fivehundred?     I'm not selfish, Betty said. AllI want is enough to pay me thisweek's salary.     Money, Simon said. When youtook this job you said it was the romancethat appealed to you.     Hm-m-m. I didn't know mostsleuthing amounted to snoopingaround department stores to check onthe clerks knocking down.     Simon said, enigmatically, Nowit comes.  <doc-sep> It was a weird situation, Syme thought. His mind was racing, but as yethe could see no way out. He began to wonder, if he did, could he keepthe Martians from knowing about it? Then he realized that the Martianmust have received that thought, too, and he was enraged. He stood,holding himself in check with an effort.     Will you tell us why? Tate asked.     You were brought here for that purpose. It is part of our conceptionof justice. I will tell you and your\u2014friend\u2014anything you wish toknow.     Syme noticed that the other Martians had retired to the farther side ofthe cavern. Some were munching the glowing fungus. That left only theleader, who was standing alertly on all fours a short distance awayfrom them, holding the Benson gun trained on them. Syme tried not tothink about the gun, especially about making a grab for it. It was liketrying not to think of the word hippopotamus.     Tate squatted down comfortably on the floor of the cavern, apparentlyunconcerned, but his hands were trembling slightly. First why\u2014 hebegan.     There are many secrets in Kal-Jmar, the Martian said, among them avery simple catalyzing agent which could within fifty years transformMars to a planet with Terrestrially-thick atmosphere.     I think I see, Tate said thoughtfully. That's been the ultimate aimall along, but so far the problem has us licked. If we solved it, thenwe'd have all of Mars, not just the cities. Your people would die out.You couldn't have that, of course.     He sighed deeply. He spread his gloved hands before him and lookedat them with a queer intentness. Well\u2014how about the Martians\u2014theKal-Jmar Martians, I mean? I'd dearly love to know the answer to thatone.     Neither of the alternatives in your mind is correct. They were not aseparate species, although they were unlike us. But they were not ourancestors, either. They were the contemporaries of our ancestors.     Several thousand years ago Mars' loss of atmosphere began to makeitself felt. There were two ways out. Some chose to seal themselvesinto cities like Kal-Jmar; our ancestors chose to adapt their bodies tothe new conditions. Thus the race split. Their answer to the problemwas an evasion; they remained static. Our answer was the true one, forwe progressed. We progressed beyond the need of science; they remainedits slaves. They died of a plague\u2014and other causes.     You see, he finished gently, our deception has caused a naturalconfusion in your minds. They were the degenerates, not we.     And yet, Tate mused, you are being destroyed by contact withan\u2014inferior\u2014culture.     We hope to win yet, the Martian said.     Tate stood up, his face very white. Tell me one thing, he begged.Will our two races ever live together in amity?     The Martian lowered his head. That is for unborn generations. Helooked at Tate again and aimed the energy gun. You are a brave man,he said. I am sorry.     Syme saw all his hopes of treasure and glory go glimmering down thesights of the Martian's Benson gun, and suddenly the pent-up rage inhim exploded. Too swiftly for his intention to be telegraphed, beforehe knew himself what he meant to do, he hurled himself bodily into theMartian.  "

        "Query": "What is the story about and what fate befalls Garrett in BIG ANCESTOR?",
        "Summary_1": "Taphetta the Ribboneer was on another ship that was passing by the expedition ship. Since the pilot that was supposed to fly the expedition got very sick and needed some treatment, he was taken by the other ship, and they told the explorers that they have an experienced pilot on board. After having Taphetta on the expedition ship, they introduce themselves and explains how they are at different points on the development spectrum. However, unlike human themselves, Taphetta does not see any difference between the early and late stage of humans, they are all the same to her. \n\nLater they explain the theory of horse shoe planets, the adjacency mating principle and suggest that they are likely to find their origin planet on their trip. Taphetta is interested and asks them to take her contract. Taphetta is afraid of them holding discoveries for the benefit of one race, thus offers them his own contract. While the truth is that the explorers are not going to hold anything, no one can be sure of the institutions that support this expedition. \n\nFurthermore, Taphetta senses that something is wrong with the air, which makes them realize that there has been animals consuming the plants they grew. Despite the fact that he doesn\u2019t want to risk bait for the pest, he is convinced. ",
        "Summary_2": "Taphetta is a part of the Ribboneer racial group. He has four flat legs, a wide and thin body with a flat neck. His head is thick and is topped with a dozen narrow, long ribbons. He is an experienced pilot, which is common among people in his group. Ribboneer\u2019s are well-known for their navigational ability in the universe. \n\nTaphetta was on board a ship that was passing a group in need of help. The group had a pilot that became sick and they hailed a ship that was passing by to get him to treatment. They heard that there was an experienced pilot on the passing ship, which is how Taphetta came upon their group. The group is trying to convince Taphetta to pilot them to their desired destination. He presents them with a contract that they have to accept for him to agree to the mission. His contract includes a provision that any discovery during the mission cannot be withheld to benefit one race. They accept the contract. He begins to be ready for the mission. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Taphetta is a member of the non-human species known as Ribboneers, who are renowned for their integrity and navigational skills. He is described as having four flat, ribbon-like legs which loop out and tuck under his flat body. His neck is thicker than the rest of his body, and his head has a crown of many smaller ribbons. Prior to the start of the story, the pilot of the humans\u2019 ship falls ill. They hail a ship passing by, partly in an attempt to find a new pilot. Taphetta was on that ship, and the story begins with a conversation between him and the human biologist, Sam Halden. \n\tHalden describes to Taphetta the theory behind the expedition on which the human ship has embarked, concerning an ancestor common to the many planets of humans in the Milky Way galaxy. Though initially uninterested, Taphetta is confronted with evidence for the humans\u2019 theory, and later admits that they make a compelling argument. Taphetta arees to join the crew of the expedition, on the condition that he be hired under an extensive micro-printed contract which stipulates that no discovery in which he takes part should be hidden to the benefit of any race. \nOn the ship, Taphetta suffers from the air quality. Ribboneers breathe through tubes scattered throughout their bodies. Halden discovers that the problem is animals interfering with the growth of plants in the hydroponics sector of the ship, which are responsible for air quality regulation. Halden proposes using bait to trap the pests, to which Taphetta says he needs to think on the issue. As he thinks, Taphetta enquires further about the evidence supporting the humans\u2019 theory, asking about the significance of discovering an answer, and the unequal development of humans across various planets. Aftering demonstrating interest in the answers given by his interlocutor Emmer, an archeologist, he acquiesces to use of bait to deal with the pest problem.\n",

Taphetta is also an experienced pilot, as his species specializes in navigation. Taphetta is recruited by the humans to guide their ship for their mission in finding their original ancestor, as their initial pilot became ill. Taphetta is a wary and dubious creature, so he asks several questions before agreeing to help. He also requires that the team agree to his own terms and contract, which demand transparency in their findings and condemn the withholding of information. Taphetta settles into the ship, but is uncomfortable with the cleanliness of the air; the team recognizes how crucial Taphetta's compliance is to their mission and stages an experiment to catch pests that are damaging the ship's plants. Taphetta uses this as another opportunity to ask questions and gauge more information on the mission.",
        "Article": "He stopped, and stood for a second, staring at the girl. She wassomething to invite stares, too. In the moment that lasted between hernext move, he had time to register that she was about five feet fivetall, black-haired\u2014the kind of black hair that looks like silken spundarkness\u2014dark-eyed, and possessing both a face and a form that wouldmake anyone stop and gulp.     Then the moment of half-awed survey was over, and she leveled the jeton him, and said in a trembling voice, Drop those weapons, or I'llblast you ...      pirate     !     Death Star said, That jet-gun is empty. I can see the register on themagazine. And I'm not a pirate. I'm Starrett Blade.     The useless jet-gun slid out of the girl's hand, and she gave ahalf-gasp. Starrett Blade! I\u2014I don't believe ... she broke offabruptly. So you're Death Star! A fine story for a hired killer, apirate.     Star reddened. Look, he snapped, I don't know who's been talking toyou, but ... he whirled, and his hand whipped the jet-gun from hisbelt. As he did so, the girl jerked up the jet-gun she had dropped, andflung it with all her strength. The blow landed on his arm and side,and paralyzed him long enough for the man who had leaped out behind himto land a stunning blow against his head. As Star went down, he dizzilycursed himself for becoming interested in the argument with the girl,so that he did not heed his reflexes in time ... and dimly, he wonderedwhy it had seemed so important to convince the lovely dark-haired girl.     Then a bit of the cosmos seemed to fall on Star's head, and he washurled into blackness.     An eternity seemed to pass.     Deep in the blackness, a light was born. It leaped toward him, afar-away comet rocketing along, coming from some far, unknown cornerof the galaxy. It became a flaming sun in a gray-green space, andstrangely, there seemed to be several odd planets circling about thesun. Some of them were vast pieces of queer electronic machinery. Somewere vague, villainous-looking men. One was the dark-haired girl, andthere was lovely contempt in her dark-star pools of eyes.     Then into the midst of this queer universe, there swam a new planet. Itwas the face of a man, and the man was Devil Garrett.     That brought Star up, out of his daze, onto his feet as though he hadbeen doused with cold water. He stood there, not staring, just lookingat Garrett.     The most famous killer in the void was big. He was six feet three, andtwice as strong as he looked. He wore a huge high-velocity jet-gun, anda set of electron knives, all of the finest workmanship. He was sittingon a laboratory chair of steel, and the chair bent slightly under hisgreat weight.     He smiled at Star, and there was a touch of hell in the smile. He said,Ah, Mr. Garrett.     Star's jaw dropped. Garrett? What do you\u2014 he broke off. A glance atthe girl told him what the purpose was.     Look, Mr. Devil Garrett, said the pirate, still smiling softly, MissHinton is aware of your identity. There is no need to attempt to foolus.... I've known it was you ever since I flashed that beam at yourship. And you needn't flatter yourself that the Devil's luck is goingto hold out as far as you are concerned. For in a very short while,I'm going to have you executed ... before a stellar vision screen,connected with Section Void Headquarters! I wish the authorities to seeDevil Garrett die, so that I might collect the reward that is offeredon you!     Star stood quiet, and looked straight into Garrett's eyes. After aminute of silence, Garrett's lips twisted into a smile, and he saidmockingly, Well, pirate? What are you thinking of?     Star said, in a low, cold voice, I'm thinking of putting an electronfire-blade into your face, Devil Garrett!     Garrett laughed ... huge, rather evil, bluff laughter. The mirth of aperson who is both powerful and dangerous. And then the girl leapedforward, shaking with rage.     You beast! Murderer! To accuse this man ... you fool, you might havebeen able to complete any scheme of escape you had, if you hadn'tcalled yourself Starrett Blade! Mr. Blade.... She gestured towardGarrett, who made a mocking, sardonic bow. ... has given me ampleproof that he is who he says! And this long before you came. He's shownme papers giving a description and showing a tri-dimension picture ofyou....     Fire leaped in Star's eyes. Listen ... he snapped furiously, as hestarted to step forward. Then Garrett made a signal with his hand, andsomeone drove a fist against the base of Star's skull.   <doc-sep> Star Blade stood before a transmitter, and thought about death.     He was very close to it. Garrett stood five yards away, a gun inhis hand, and the muzzle trained on Blade's chest. The gun was theuniversally used weapon of execution, an old projectile-firing weapon.     Star did not doubt that Devil Garrett was an excellent shot with it.     The girl, very round-eyed and nervous, sat by Garrett. He had explainedto her that Garrett was the type of pirate that it is law to kill, orhave executed, by anyone. Which was very true.     A man stepped away from the transmitter, and nodded to Garrett. Starfelt a surge of hope, as he saw that it was a two-way transmitter. Ifthe image of an Interstellar Command headquarters was tuned in\u2014Garrettwould undoubtedly do it, if only to show the police that he had killedStarrett Blade\u2014then Garrett could not kill him and cut the beam intime to prevent one of the police from giving a cry that would echoover the sub-space beam arriving almost instantly in this room, and letthe girl know that she had been tricked. And Garrett would not wantthat. Not that it would matter to Starrett Blade.     Then Star saw what kind of a transmitter it was, and he groaned. Itwas not a Hineson Sub-space beamer ... it was an old-style transmitterwhich had different wave speeds, because of the different space-bridgerunits in it.     The visual image would arrive many seconds before the sound did. Thusthe girl would not hear Garrett revealed, but would see only Blade'sdeath. And then ... whatever Garrett had planned, Blade wished heartilythat he could have the chance to interfere.     The beam was coming in. Star saw the mists swimming on the screenchange, solidify into a figure ... the figure of District CommanderWeddel seated at a desk. He saw Weddel's eyebrows rise, saw his lipsmove\u2014then Garrett stepped over a pace, and Weddel saw him, saw the gunin his hand....     The police officer yelled, silently, and came to his feet, anexpression of shocked surprise on his face\u2014surprise, Blade thoughtdesperately, that the girl might interpret as shock at seeing DevilGarrett.     Which was right, in a way.     Then, as Commander Weddel leapt to his feet, as Devil Garrett'sfinger tightened on the trigger, as the girl sucked in her breathinvoluntarily, Star Blade scooped up a bit of metal\u2014a fork\u2014and flungit at the vision transmitter.     Not at the screen. But at the equipment behind the dial-board. At acertain small unit, which was almost covered by wires and braces forthe large tubes. And the fork struck it, bit deep, and caused result.     Result in the form of a burned-out set. If television equipment cancurse, that set cursed them. Its spitting of sparks and blue electricflame mingled with a strange, high-pitched whine.     It was the diversion that caused Garrett to miss Star, which gave himtime to pull three or four of Garrett's men onto the floor with him.One of the men drove the butt of a jet-gun into the side of Star'shead, and for the third time, he went very limp. The last thing he sawwas the girl.     Somehow, the expression on her face was different from what it hadbeen. He was searching for the difference, when the blow struckhim. Somewhere in the space that lies between consciousness andunconsciousness, he reflected bitterly that if he kept staring at thegirl when he should be fighting, he might not recover some day. Thiswas the third time that he had been knocked out that way. It was notgetting monotonous. He still felt it a novelty.     Star awoke in the same prison cell, facing the wall away from the door.He wondered if he were still alive, tried to move his head, and decidedthat he wasn't. He didn't even get up or look around when he dimlyheard the door being opened.     But when he heard the girl's voice, he came up and around very swiftly,despite his head.     It was the girl all right. Even through the tumbled mists of his brain,he could see that she was not a dream. And as he reeled and fellagainst the wall, she was beside him in a flash, her arm supporting him.   <doc-sep> When Star came to, he was in a cell of sorts. A man standing by thedoor told him that he was to be executed, ... after Mr. Blade and thelady have eaten. Starrett swore at him, and the man went out, with amocking Goodbye, Mr. Garrett!     Star got up. His head spun, and he almost fell at first, but the dazeleft in his head from the two blows quickly cleared away. He felt forvarious weapons which he had hidden about him ... and found them gone.Garrett's men had searched carefully.     Star sat down, his head spinning more now from mystery than fromphysical pain. He had to keep himself in a whole skin, of course. Thatwas most important right now. But other things were bothering him,tugging at his mind like waves slapping around a swamped ship, eachtrying to shove it in a different direction.     There was the girl. Star wondered why she always leaped into his mindfirst. And there was the way Garrett was trying to leave the impressionthat he was Blade, so that he could kill Blade as Garrett.     Obviously, the reason for that was the girl, Miss Hinton, Garrett hadcalled her. She had been shown faked papers by Garrett, papers provingthat the two were ... were whatever Garrett had twisted the story into!     Star clutched at his head. He was in a mess. He was going to be killed,and he was going to die without knowing the score. And he didn't likethat. Nor did he like dying as Star Blade shouldn't die; executed asa wolf's-head pirate. The girl would be watching, and he felt as ifthat would make it far worse.     His head came up, and he smiled flintily. He still had an ace card! Onehand felt for it, and he shook his head slowly. It was a gamble ... butall the others had been found.     Blade looked up quickly, as the door opened. Two men came into thecell, carrying jet-guns. They motioned Blade to his feet. Come on,Blade. One began, when the other hit him across the mouth.     You fool! he hissed. You better not call him that; suppose thatgirl was to hear it? Until the boss gets what he wants on Earth, thatgirl has got to think that he's Blade! We're killing this guy as DevilGarrett! And a loud-mouthed fool like you ... look out!     Blade had landed on the bickering men, and was grappling with the onewho had called him by name. As the other leaped forward, swinging aclubbing blow with a jet-gun, Star tripped one man into the corner, andducked under the gun. He hit the man in the stomach, drove a shoulderup under his arms, and smashed the man's face in with a series of sharpblows. The man went reeling backward across the room, and Star's handleaped toward that ace card which he still held.     Devil Garrett stepped in the door, and made a mock out of a courteousbow. As he did so, Star snarled in rage, but stood very still, for theelectron knife in Garrett's hand did not waver.     Garrett gestured silently toward the door, and Star, equally silent,walked over and out, at the point of the weapon.  "

        "Query": "What kind of connection exists between Meredith and Halden in the story of BIG ANCESTOR?",
        "Summary_1": "Meredith is a linguist who sits on the middle towards end of the spectrum; Halden is a biologist that is on the middle towards beginning of the spectrum. Meredith is wearing a short skirt which gets Firmon\u2019s unwanted attention. She is also aware of the fact that she has been called \u201cmistress\u201d by the ship crews. \n\nAfter setting the trap for the plant eating animals, Meredith complements Halden for his primitiveness and calls their love barbaric, but Halden takes it a different way. He is indeed primitive in comparison to Meredith, but he clearly does not like the sound of it. He is of the lower level, she is a step up for him. In strong constrast to Taphetta\u2019s belief of all humans are the same disregarding where they are on the spectrum, Meredith thinks that this spectrum weights more than the amount of love between Meredith and Halden. They seem to have known this all along. Halden never asks Meredith if she wanted to marry him, nor will Meredith say yes to that. Halden doesn\u2019t like to be thought of the lower level human, but to his surprise, Halden later realizes that he also prefers a higher level children. ",
        "Summary_2": "Sam Halden is a biologist from Earth and Meredith is a linguist from a place located on the other side of the middle. They are from two different points on the biological spectrum of human development. Meredith is on a higher point of the scale. They have the potential to be able to successfully produce a child from mating. Halden is from a more primitive version of humans. \n\nPeople have rumored that Meredith is Halden\u2019s mistress. There is a conflict between them as a potential relationship would cause Meredith to be reproducing with a race lesser than her race. She admits that she is in love and is physically attracted to Halden, but she does not want that to convince her to be in a relationship with him. They have tension in the story that creates a fight where Halden instinctively punches Meredith in the nose. Halden recognizes that Meredith is cruel to him and perhaps using him, yet he too loves her. He is tortured by the thought that he is as manipulative as Meredith because he is attracted to the idea of marrying a woman of a higher race as it would reflect him achieving a high goal. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Meredith and Halden are both human crewmembers on an expedition with the intention of exploring the humans\u2019 common ancestor. Though they are of the same species, they are from different planets on each of which humans have evolved independently and at different rates. Halden, a biologist, is on the early-middle side of the evolutionary scale. Meredith, a linguist, though more closely related to Halden than to any of her other crewmates, is from the later-middle side of the evolutionary scale. Despite Meredith\u2019s refusal to bear children with halden, they are of similar enough evolutionary stages that they are compatible. \nAs Meredith and Halden watch the simulated fight between the puppet pests, she comments on Halden\u2019s primitive strategizing, and fetishizes this aspect of Halden. Halden briefly recalls the previous times when she did the same, before they return to his cabin. Halden reflects on Meredith\u2019s physical attractiveness, but concludes that her facial features are plain. She reiterates her desire against bearing children with him, for they would be of a lower evolutionary status than she is. Halden comments that, if she were searching for a mate who would yield offspring of the higher type, then Kelburn, a far-advanced human, would be the best choice. However, Meredith implies that she and Kelburn have previously attempted to mate, but are incompatible with one another. She nuzzles Halden, before he instinctively hits her. She quickly heals her nose, and tells him that she loves him, but will not bear his children if they marry. He kisses her. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Meredith and Halden have a passionate but high-strung relationship. They are both of the general human race; however, Halden is of an inferior species on Earth, while Meredith is slightly more advanced, of the Terran race. Halden and Meredith are in love, but face several complications: their relationship is mainly, at its surface level, physical, as Halden and the team refer to Meredith as his \"mistress\". Additionally, Meredith is preoccupied with the idea of bearing children that are biologically superior; she believes that having children with Halden would be a setback and against her morals. For these reasons, Meredith plans to explore bearing children with humans from other races, which enrages Halden. The tension between them is detrimental to their relationship, as Halden expresses it through violence. However, their love and passion for each other keeps them together in an imperfect situation.

        "Article": "   BIG ANCESTOR     By F. L. WALLACE     Illustrated by EMSH     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Galaxy Science Fiction November 1954.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]        Man's family tree was awesome enough to give every galactic       race an inferiority complex\u2014but then he tried to climb it!        In repose, Taphetta the Ribboneer resembled a fancy giant bow on apackage. His four flat legs looped out and in, the ends tucked underhis wide, thin body, which constituted the knot at the middle. His neckwas flat, too, arching out in another loop. Of all his features, onlyhis head had appreciable thickness and it was crowned with a dozen longthough narrower ribbons.     Taphetta rattled the head fronds together in a surprisingly goodimitation of speech. Yes, I've heard the legend.     It's more than a legend, said Sam Halden, biologist. The reaction wasnot unexpected\u2014non-humans tended to dismiss the data as convenientspeculation and nothing more. There are at least a hundred kinds ofhumans, each supposedly originating in strict seclusion on as manywidely scattered planets. Obviously there was no contact throughout theages before space travel\u2014      and yet each planetary race can interbreedwith a minimum of ten others     ! That's more than a legend\u2014one hell of alot more!     It is impressive, admitted Taphetta. But I find it mildlydistasteful to consider mating with someone who does not belong to myspecies.     That's because you're unique, said Halden. Outside of your ownworld, there's nothing like your species, except superficially, andthat's true of all other creatures, intelligent or not, with the soleexception of mankind. Actually, the four of us here, though it'saccidental, very nearly represent the biological spectrum of humandevelopment.       Emmer, a Neanderthal type and our archeologist, is around thebeginning of the scale. I'm from Earth, near the middle, though onEmmer's side. Meredith, linguist, is on the other side of the middle.And beyond her, toward the far end, is Kelburn, mathematician. There'sa corresponding span of fertility. Emmer just misses being able tobreed with my kind, but there's a fair chance that I'd be fertile withMeredith and a similar though lesser chance that her fertility mayextend to Kelburn.   <doc-sep> Emmer smiled, unsheathing great teeth. You've never seen any pictures?Impressive, but just a camp, monolithic one-story structures, andwe'd give something to know what they're made of. Presumably my worldwas one of the first they stopped at. They weren't used to roughingit, so they built more elaborately than they did later on. One-storystructures and that's how we can guess at their size. The doorways wereforty feet high.     Very large, agreed Taphetta. It was difficult to tell whether he wasimpressed. What did you find in the ruins?     Nothing, said Emmer. There were buildings there and that was all,not a scrap of writing or a tool or a single picture. They covereda route estimated at thirty thousand light-years in less than fivethousand years\u2014and not one of them died that we have a record of.     A faster-than-light drive and an extremely long life, mused Taphetta.But they didn't leave any information for their descendants. Why?     Who knows? Their mental processes were certainly far different fromours. They may have thought we'd be better off without it. We do knowthey were looking for a special kind of planet, like Earth, becausethey visited so many of that type, yet different from it because theynever stayed. They were pretty special people themselves, big andlong-lived, and maybe they couldn't survive on any planet they found.Perhaps they had ways of determining there wasn't the kind of planetthey needed in the entire Milky Way. Their science was tremendouslyadvanced and when they learned that, they may have altered their germplasm and left us, hoping that some of us would survive. Most of usdid.     This special planet sounds strange, murmured Taphetta.     Not really, said Emmer. Fifty human races reached space travelindependently and those who did were scattered equally among early andlate species. It's well known that individuals among my people areoften as bright as any of Halden's or Meredith's, but as a whole wedon't have the total capacity that later Man does, and yet we're asadvanced in civilization. The difference? It must lie somewhere in theplanets we live on and it's hard to say just what it is.     What happened to those who didn't develop space travel? askedTaphetta.     We helped them, said Emmer.     And they had, no matter who or what they were, biologically lateor early, in the depths of the bronze age or the threshold ofatomic\u2014because they were human. That was sometimes a frightening thingfor non-humans, that the race stuck together. They weren't actuallyaggressive, but their total number was great and they held themselvesaloof. The unknown ancestor again. Who else had such an origin and, itwas tacitly assumed, such a destiny?   <doc-sep> Taphetta changed his questioning. What do you expect to gain from thisdiscovery of the unknown ancestor?     It was Halden who answered him. There's the satisfaction of knowingwhere we came from.     Of course, rustled the Ribboneer. But a lot of money and equipmentwas required for this expedition. I can't believe that the educationalinstitutions that are backing you did so purely out of intellectualcuriosity.     Cultural discoveries, rumbled Emmer. How did our ancestors live?When a creature is greatly reduced in size, as we are, more thanphysiology is changed\u2014the pattern of life itself is altered. Thingsthat were easy for them are impossible for us. Look at their life span.     No doubt, said Taphetta. An archeologist would be interested incultural discoveries.     Two hundred thousand years ago, they had an extremely advancedcivilization, added Halden. A faster-than-light drive, and we'veachieved that only within the last thousand years.     But I think we have a better one than they did, said the Ribboneer.There may be things we can learn from them in mechanics or physics,but wouldn't you say they were better biologists than anything else?     Halden nodded. Agreed. They couldn't find a suitable planet. So,working directly with their germ plasm, they modified themselves andproduced us. They      were     master biologists.     I thought so, said Taphetta. I never paid much attention to yourfantastic theories before I signed to pilot this ship, but you've builtup a convincing case. He raised his head, speech ribbons curlingfractionally and ceaselessly. I don't like to, but we'll have to riskusing bait for your pest.     He'd have done it anyway, but it was better to have the pilot'sconsent. And there was one question Halden wanted to ask; it had beenbothering him vaguely. What's the difference between the Ribboneercontract and the one we offered you? Our terms are more liberal.     To the individual, they are, but it won't matter if you discover asmuch as you think you will. The difference is this:      My     terms don'tpermit you to withhold any discovery for the benefit of one race.     Taphetta was wrong; there had been no intention of withholdinganything. Halden examined his own attitudes.      He     hadn't intended, butcould he say that was true of the institutions backing the expedition?He couldn't, and it was too late now\u2014whatever knowledge they acquiredwould have to be shared.     That was what Taphetta had been afraid of\u2014there was one kind oftechnical advancement that multiplied unceasingly. The race that couldimprove itself through scientific control of its germ plasm had a startthat could never be headed. The Ribboneer needn't worry now.  "

        "Query": "What is the purpose of the expedition and what is its hypothesis?",
        "Summary_1": "The goal of the expedition is to find their original home. There are many different species on the human development spectrum, and it is assumed that they can only mate with the species that are close to them on the spectrum according to the adjacency mating principle. Following this principle, careful calculations are done on the orbits of those planets. By determining their location in space at different times, the team are able to find a specific time in the whole universe that not only makes the specific pattern of a horse shoe, but also has supporting data backed up this hypothesis. Furthermore, if two imaginary lines extend from the ends of the horse shoe, the two lines will eventually meet and cross over at a specific location in space. The team are able to narrow the crossing point down to a few cubic light-years. According to the team, this space should be the place that their original home is. If they are to find the planet that the hypothetical unknown ancestors belongs to, they will be making cultural discoveries, technological advances, and finding out where they actually come from. ",
        "Summary_2": "The mission of the expedition is to find the origins of the human race. Taphetta refers to this as the big ancestor. The theory is that the human race did not originate on any planets that it currently inhabits. They believe that humans evolved at a different location and then began to settle across a particular section of the Milk Way. Their evidence to support this theory is that there are worlds where humans have been before the Stone Age and are not related to anything in that world. \n\nAnother supporting theory they present is the adjacency mating principle. The principle outlines which humans can mate with each other, theorizing that those which can mate had to have been physically close at one point. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Humans have independently evolved across hundreds of planets across a stretch of the Milky Way galaxy. The patterning of planets in the galaxy on which human species have developed reveals a pattern of stars, which is hypothesized by humans to be the path of their common ancestor. Furthermore, it appears that the path traced by their ancestor attempts to gather a representative sample of planets in the Milky Way. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the ancestors\u2019 aim to find an inhabitable planet. Were the pattern extended, the original home of the common ancestors would be found, and to find this common home is the purpose of the expedition. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Across the galaxy, there are hundreds of species of humans; certain species are able to mate with others, despite them living in faraway areas with no possible contact before space travel. To make sense of these circumstances, the mission's team believes that one original ancestor exists from which all humans came from, and were then dispersed throughout the Milky Way. There is also a pattern in the ways human races can interbreed; humans can mate with other humans that were adjacent to each other two hundred thousand years ago, indicating that this historical proximity points to a source of the big ancestor. The mission of this expedition is to travel to that location in search of the big ancestor, hopefully gaining cultural insight into the species as well as their superior biological abilities that make them able to mutate and improve themselves.",
        "Article": "As Celeste and Theodor entered the committee room, Rosalind Wolver\u2014aglitter of platinum against darkness\u2014came in through the oppositedoor and softly shut it behind her. Frieda, a fair woman in blue robes,got up from the round table.     Celeste turned away with outward casualness as Theodor kissed his twoother wives. She was pleased to note that Edmund seemed impatient too.A figure in close-fitting black, unrelieved except for two red arrowsat the collar, he struck her as embodying very properly the serious,fateful temper of the moment.     He took two briefcases from his vest pocket and tossed them down on thetable beside one of the microfilm projectors.     I suggest we get started without waiting for Ivan, he said.     Frieda frowned anxiously. It's ten minutes since he phoned from theDeep Space Bar to say he was starting right away. And that's hardly atwo minutes walk.     Rosalind instantly started toward the outside door.     I'll check, she explained. Oh, Frieda, I've set the mike so you'llhear if Dotty calls.     Edmund threw up his hands. Very well, then, he said and walked over,switched on the picture and stared out moodily.     Theodor and Frieda got out their briefcases, switched on projectors,and began silently checking through their material.     Celeste fiddled with the TV and got a newscast. But she found her eyesdidn't want to absorb the blocks of print that rather swiftly succeededeach other, so, after a few moments, she shrugged impatiently andswitched to audio.     At the noise, the others looked around at her with surprise and someirritation, but in a few moments they were also listening.     The two rocket ships sent out from Mars Base to explore the orbitalpositions of Phobos and Deimos\u2014that is, the volume of space they'd beoccupying if their positions had remained normal\u2014report finding massesof dust and larger debris. The two masses of fine debris are movingin the same orbits and at the same velocities as the two vanishedmoons, and occupy roughly the same volumes of space, though the massof material is hardly a hundredth that of the moons. Physicists haveventured no statements as to whether this constitutes a confirmation ofthe Disintegration Hypothesis.     However, we're mighty pleased at this news here. There's a markedlessening of tension. The finding of the debris\u2014solid, tangiblestuff\u2014seems to lift the whole affair out of the supernatural miasma inwhich some of us have been tempted to plunge it. One-hundredth of themoons has been found.     The rest will also be!     Edmund had turned his back on the window. Frieda and Theodor hadswitched off their projectors.     Meanwhile, Earthlings are going about their business with a minimumof commotion, meeting with considerable calm the strange threat tothe fabric of their Solar System. Many, of course, are assembled inchurches and humanist temples. Kometevskyites have staged helicopterprocessions at Washington, Peking, Pretoria, and Christiana, demandingthat instant preparations be made for\u2014and I quote\u2014'Earth's comingleap through space.' They have also formally challenged all astronomersto produce an explanation other than the one contained in that strangebook so recently conjured from oblivion,      The Dance of the Planets     .     That about winds up the story for the present. There are no newreports from Interplanetary Radar, Astronomy, or the other rocket shipssearching in the extended Mars volume. Nor have any statements beenissued by the various groups working on the problem in Astrophysics,Cosmic Ecology, the Congress for the Discovery of New Purposes, and soforth. Meanwhile, however, we can take courage from the words of a poemwritten even before Dr. Kometevsky's book:   This Earth is not the steadfast place We landsmen build upon; From deep to deep she varies pace, And while she comes is gone. Beneath my feet I feel Her smooth bulk heave and dip; With velvet plunge and soft upreel She swings and steadies to her keel Like a gallant, gallant ship.  <doc-sep> Kelburn went to the projector. It would be easier if we knew all thestars in the Milky Way, but though we've explored only a small portionof it, we can reconstruct a fairly accurate representation of the past.     He pressed the controls and stars twinkled on the screen. We'relooking down on the plane of the Galaxy. This is one arm of it as it istoday and here are the human systems. He pressed another control and,for purposes of identification, certain stars became more brilliant.There was no pattern, merely a scattering of stars. The whole MilkyWay is rotating. And while stars in a given region tend to remaintogether, there's also a random motion. Here's what happens when wecalculate the positions of stars in the past.     Flecks of light shifted and flowed across the screen. Kelburn stoppedthe motion.     Two hundred thousand years ago, he said.     There was a pattern of the identified stars. They were spaced at fairlyequal intervals along a regular curve, a horseshoe loop that didn'tclose, though if the ends were extended, the lines would have crossed.     Taphetta rustled. The math is accurate?     As accurate as it can be with a million-plus body problem.     And that's the hypothetical route of the unknown ancestor?     To the best of our knowledge, said Kelburn. And whereas there arehumans who are relatively near and not fertile, they can always matewith those they were adjacent to      two hundred thousand years ago     !     The adjacency mating principle. I've never seen it demonstrated,murmured Taphetta, flexing his ribbons. Is that the only era thatsatisfies the calculations?     Plus or minus a hundred thousand years, we can still get somethingthat might be the path of a spaceship attempting to cover arepresentative section of territory, said Kelburn. However, we haveother ways of dating it. On some worlds on which there are no othermammals, we're able to place the first human fossils chronologically.The evidence is sometimes contradictory, but we believe we've got thetime right.     Taphetta waved a ribbon at the chart. And you think that where the twoends of the curve cross is your original home?     We think so, said Kelburn. We've narrowed it down to several cubiclight-years\u2014then. Now it's far more. And, of course, if it were afast-moving star, it might be completely out of the field of ourexploration. But we're certain we've got a good chance of finding itthis trip.     It seems I must decide quickly. The Ribboneer glanced out thevisionport, where another ship hung motionless in space beside them.Do you mind if I ask other questions?     Go ahead, Kelburn invited sardonically. But if it's not math, you'dbetter ask Halden. He's the leader of the expedition.     Halden flushed; the sarcasm wasn't necessary. It was true that Kelburnwas the most advanced human type present, but while there weredifferences, biological and in the scale of intelligence, it wasn'tas great as once was thought. Anyway, non-humans weren't trained inthe fine distinctions that men made among themselves. And, higher orlower, he was as good a biologist as the other was a mathematician. Andthere was the matter of training; he'd been on several expeditions andthis was Kelburn's first trip. Damn it, he thought, that rated somerespect.     The Ribboneer shifted his attention. Aside from the sudden illness ofyour pilot, why did you ask for me?     We didn't. The man became sick and required treatment we can't givehim. Luckily, a ship was passing and we hailed it because it's fourmonths to the nearest planet. They consented to take him back and toldus that there was a passenger on board who was an experienced pilot. Wehave men who could do the job in a makeshift fashion, but the regionwe're heading for, while mapped, is largely unknown. We'd prefer tohave an expert\u2014and Ribboneers are famous for their navigationalability.     Taphetta crinkled politely at the reference to his skill. I had otherplans, but I can't evade professional obligations, and an emergencysuch as this should cancel out any previous agreements. Still, what arethe incentives?     Sam Halden coughed. The usual, plus a little extra. We've copied theRibboneer's standard nature, simplifying it a little and adding a percent here and there for the crew pilot and scientist's share of theprofits from any discoveries we may make.     I'm complimented that you like our contract so well, said Taphetta,but I really must have our own unsimplified version. If you want me,you'll take my contract. I came prepared. He extended a tightly boundroll that he had kept somewhere on his person.     They glanced at one another as Halden took it.     You can read it if you want, offered Taphetta. But it will takeyou all day\u2014it's micro-printing. However, you needn't be afraid thatI'm defrauding you. It's honored everywhere we go and we go nearlyeverywhere in this sector\u2014places men have never been.     There was no choice if they wanted him, and they did. Besides, theintegrity of Ribboneers was not to be questioned. Halden signed.     Good. Taphetta crinkled. Send it to the ship; they'll forward itfor me. And you can tell the ship to go on without me. He rubbed hisribbons together. Now if you'll get me the charts, I'll examine theregion toward which we're heading.   <doc-sep> Knof Llud shook his head sorrowfully and took off the spool. Thatwas from the time when he had grown philosophical after the firstdisappointments.     He frowned thoughtfully, choosing one more spool that was only fouryears old. The recorded voice sounded weary, yet alive with a strangelonging....     We are in the heart of Pleiades; a hundred stars show brilliant onthe screens, each star encircled by a misty halo like lights glowingthrough fog, for we are traversing a vast diffuse nebula.     According to plan, the      Quest III     has reached its furthest point fromEarth. Now we turn back along a curve that will take us past many morestars and stellar systems\u2014but hope is small that any of those willprove a home for man, as have none of the thousands of stars examinedalready.     But what are a few thousand stars in a galaxy of billions? We haveonly, as it were, visited a handful of the outlying villages of theUniverse, while the lights of its great cities still blaze far aheadalong the Milky Way.     On flimsy excuses I have had Zost Relyul make observations of theglobular cluster Omega Centauri. There are a hundred thousand starsthere in a volume of space where one finds a few dozen in the Sun'sneighborhood; there if anywhere must circle the planets we seek! ButOmega Centauri is twenty thousand light years away....     Even so\u2014by expending its remaining fuel freely, the      Quest III     couldachieve a velocity that would take us there without dying of senilityof aging too greatly. It would be a one-way journey\u2014even if enoughfuel remained, there would be little point in returning to Earth aftermore than forty thousand years. By then our civilization certainly, andperhaps the human race itself, would have perished from memory.     That was why the planners limited our voyage, and those of the other      Quests     , to less than a thousand years Earth time. Even now, accordingto the sociodynamic predictions made then, our civilization\u2014if theother expeditions failed also\u2014will have reached a dangerously unstablephase, and before we can get back it may have collapsed completely fromoverpopulation.     Why go back, then with the news of our failure? Why not forget aboutEarth and go on to Omega Centauri? What use is quixotic loyalty to adecree five thousand years old, whose makers are dead and which may beforgotten back there?     Would the crew be willing? I don't know\u2014some of them still show signsof homesickness, though they know with their minds that everything thatwas once 'home' has probably been swept away....     It doesn't matter. Today I gave orders to swing the ship.     Savagely Knof Llud stabbed the button that shut off the speaker. Thenhe sat for a time with head resting in his hands, staring into nothing.     The memory of that fierce impulse to go on still had power to shakehim. A couple of lines of poetry came into his head, as he read themonce in translation from the ancient English....     ... for my purpose holds     To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths     Of all the western stars, until I die.

        "Summary_1": "The story is set in a space ship of an expedition with the goal of finding human\u2019s original home. The universe has many species of human beings at different development levels, and four of them are on board of the ship. They seem to believe that there is a planet of origin, where they evolved. They assume that later, they were brought from the original planet to the planets they now live on. There was another ship that passed the expedition ship, which allow the explorers to send their pilot home since he is sick. They learn that there is a Ribboneer on that ship. The Ribboneer is a pilot and has been to some expeditions. Thus, the team want to have him on board and be the pilot of their ship. Hence, they start to explain about their theories in trying to find out about human race and their origin. The Ribboneer is interested and decides to join the team. Later, they notice that the plants are being eaten by some animals. Thus they put on a show at the hydroponics to trick the animals. Later, we follow Halden and Meredith to Halden\u2019s cabin where they have an argument over the level of development they have and Halden punches Meredith\u2019s nose. Then, the story ends with the two of them in Halden\u2019s room. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story is set on a ship in space settled in the Milky Way. There is a projector on the spaceship that Kelburn uses to explain their theory of the origins of Man. The ship is quite isolated as it is currently located four months away from the nearest planet. The ship they are on is old, which creates some problems for them when trying to find a pest. The ship had new equipment added to its old frame, this has created hard to reach corners and small crevices that cannot be fixed without a proper rebuilding effort. There is a plant growing area on the ship that does not use soil in its growing. Halden has his own cabin on the ship. ",
        "Summary_3": "This story takes place in a human spaceship, floating in the expanse of space next to another ship. Prior to the start of the story, the human pilot falls ill and is unable to be treated with the resources on their ship. Fortunately, another ship, the one now idling next to the human ship, was passing and has agreed to return the pilot home. Coincidentally, a passenger of the other ship, Taphetta, is a ribbonrer, a species known for their navigational skills, and agrees to pilot the human ship on their expedition. \n\tLater in the story, when Meredith and Halden are monitoring the goings-on in the hydroponics room, they are in a room with a big screen displaying a night-vision feed of the hydroponics room. Meredith and Halden then return to Halden\u2019s room. \n",

The ship is designed for humans, making Taphetta's comfortability a bit more difficult to achieve, as indicated by his dissatisfaction with the air quality. The ship contains tanks of plants that, when running smoothly, produce oxygen to supply the ship. The ship also contains cabins for each team member. Outside the ship, not much is visible that indicates location; the only thing visible out the window is a neighboring ship from which Taphetta was pulled from.",

They had seen many such stars come near out of the galaxy's glitteringbackdrop, and had seen them dwindle, turn red and go out as the      QuestIII     drove on its way once more, lashed by despair toward the speed oflight, leaving behind the mockery of yet another solitary and lifelessluminary unaccompanied by worlds where men might dwell. They had grownsated with the sight of wonders\u2014of multiple systems of giant stars, ofnebulae that sprawled in empty flame across light years.     But now unwonted excitement possessed the hundred-odd members of the      Quest III's     crew. It was a subdued excitement; men and women, theycame and stood quietly gazing into the big vision screens that showedthe oncoming star, and there were wide-eyed children who had been bornin the ship and had never seen a planet. The grownups talked in lowvoices, in tones of mingled eagerness and apprehension, of what mightlie at the long journey's end. For the      Quest III     was coming home; thesun ahead was      the     Sun, whose rays had warmed their lives' beginning.   <doc-sep> It was a weird situation, Syme thought. His mind was racing, but as yethe could see no way out. He began to wonder, if he did, could he keepthe Martians from knowing about it? Then he realized that the Martianmust have received that thought, too, and he was enraged. He stood,holding himself in check with an effort.     Will you tell us why? Tate asked.     You were brought here for that purpose. It is part of our conceptionof justice. I will tell you and your\u2014friend\u2014anything you wish toknow.     Syme noticed that the other Martians had retired to the farther side ofthe cavern. Some were munching the glowing fungus. That left only theleader, who was standing alertly on all fours a short distance awayfrom them, holding the Benson gun trained on them. Syme tried not tothink about the gun, especially about making a grab for it. It was liketrying not to think of the word hippopotamus.     Tate squatted down comfortably on the floor of the cavern, apparentlyunconcerned, but his hands were trembling slightly. First why\u2014 hebegan.     There are many secrets in Kal-Jmar, the Martian said, among them avery simple catalyzing agent which could within fifty years transformMars to a planet with Terrestrially-thick atmosphere.     I think I see, Tate said thoughtfully. That's been the ultimate aimall along, but so far the problem has us licked. If we solved it, thenwe'd have all of Mars, not just the cities. Your people would die out.You couldn't have that, of course.     He sighed deeply. He spread his gloved hands before him and lookedat them with a queer intentness. Well\u2014how about the Martians\u2014theKal-Jmar Martians, I mean? I'd dearly love to know the answer to thatone.     Neither of the alternatives in your mind is correct. They were not aseparate species, although they were unlike us. But they were not ourancestors, either. They were the contemporaries of our ancestors.     Several thousand years ago Mars' loss of atmosphere began to makeitself felt. There were two ways out. Some chose to seal themselvesinto cities like Kal-Jmar; our ancestors chose to adapt their bodies tothe new conditions. Thus the race split. Their answer to the problemwas an evasion; they remained static. Our answer was the true one, forwe progressed. We progressed beyond the need of science; they remainedits slaves. They died of a plague\u2014and other causes.     You see, he finished gently, our deception has caused a naturalconfusion in your minds. They were the degenerates, not we.     And yet, Tate mused, you are being destroyed by contact withan\u2014inferior\u2014culture.     We hope to win yet, the Martian said.     Tate stood up, his face very white. Tell me one thing, he begged.Will our two races ever live together in amity?     The Martian lowered his head. That is for unborn generations. Helooked at Tate again and aimed the energy gun. You are a brave man,he said. I am sorry.     Syme saw all his hopes of treasure and glory go glimmering down thesights of the Martian's Benson gun, and suddenly the pent-up rage inhim exploded. Too swiftly for his intention to be telegraphed, beforehe knew himself what he meant to do, he hurled himself bodily into theMartian.   <doc-sep> Taphetta changed his questioning. What do you expect to gain from thisdiscovery of the unknown ancestor?     It was Halden who answered him. There's the satisfaction of knowingwhere we came from.     Of course, rustled the Ribboneer. But a lot of money and equipmentwas required for this expedition. I can't believe that the educationalinstitutions that are backing you did so purely out of intellectualcuriosity.     Cultural discoveries, rumbled Emmer. How did our ancestors live?When a creature is greatly reduced in size, as we are, more thanphysiology is changed\u2014the pattern of life itself is altered. Thingsthat were easy for them are impossible for us. Look at their life span.     No doubt, said Taphetta. An archeologist would be interested incultural discoveries.     Two hundred thousand years ago, they had an extremely advancedcivilization, added Halden. A faster-than-light drive, and we'veachieved that only within the last thousand years.     But I think we have a better one than they did, said the Ribboneer.There may be things we can learn from them in mechanics or physics,but wouldn't you say they were better biologists than anything else?     Halden nodded. Agreed. They couldn't find a suitable planet. So,working directly with their germ plasm, they modified themselves andproduced us. They      were     master biologists.     I thought so, said Taphetta. I never paid much attention to yourfantastic theories before I signed to pilot this ship, but you've builtup a convincing case. He raised his head, speech ribbons curlingfractionally and ceaselessly. I don't like to, but we'll have to riskusing bait for your pest.     He'd have done it anyway, but it was better to have the pilot'sconsent. And there was one question Halden wanted to ask; it had beenbothering him vaguely. What's the difference between the Ribboneercontract and the one we offered you? Our terms are more liberal.     To the individual, they are, but it won't matter if you discover asmuch as you think you will. The difference is this:      My     terms don'tpermit you to withhold any discovery for the benefit of one race.     Taphetta was wrong; there had been no intention of withholdinganything. Halden examined his own attitudes.      He     hadn't intended, butcould he say that was true of the institutions backing the expedition?He couldn't, and it was too late now\u2014whatever knowledge they acquiredwould have to be shared.     That was what Taphetta had been afraid of\u2014there was one kind oftechnical advancement that multiplied unceasingly. The race that couldimprove itself through scientific control of its germ plasm had a startthat could never be headed. The Ribboneer needn't worry now.  "

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in THE GIANTS RETURN?",
        "Summary_1": "A spaceship named Quest III is moving towards a color-changing star, but this time it is the Sun. The crew is excited, their journey is coming to its end and they are coming home. The captain says they have sighted Earth. Talking burst out happily, the captain's wife is anxious about nothing being the same after nine hundred years on Earth, while it was only ten for the crew in space. The course to Earth is set and the whole crew is filled with anticipation. The captain can't find how to kill time and delves into upsetting thoughts about the failure of the venture. The captain rewatches his record from the beginning of the voyage. It shows his hopes fading with every new planet proving unfit for settlement and the Earth years increasing rapidly and frighteningly. By then, the captain had an idea of going to Omega Centauri without returning to Earth, as this planet was more than forty thousand years away from Earth. The reasoning was that the captain didn't want to bring news of a failure to Earth, but eventually he decided to return no matter what. Back to reality, the captain starts thinking about his awaiting future on Earth, when a jar goes  through the ship. Very soon the captain calms down, considering a meteoroid to be the reason, but a call informs him the ship is attacked by other ships. The captain rushes up joined by his son, the whole crew is panicking. The ship is not harmed though and still landing, as there is no other place for it to go. The attack seems well-planned and the crew broadcasts an audio wave, asking the attackers who they are and introducing themselves. There is no answer and Zost, a crew member, traces no lights or urban features on Earth, even no trees or grass are detected. Suddenly, a strange voice acknowledges that the other two ships were destroyed, and Quest III will be as well if it continues towards Earth. The captain learns out soon that the voice simply tries to frighten them and is not that confident, and is told that Quest I preferred suicide to defeat and went into the Sun. The vision connection happens and the man on the other side avoids the question why, proclaiming that the Quest III's crew must die. \n",
        "Summary_2": "The Quest III has spent ten years on a voyage into space in search of a habitable planet for humanity to live on following an overpopulation crisis on Earth. However, because of space travel and how it warps time, the ten years on Quest III have actually been 900 years on Earth, and now, after failing to find said planet, the ship is returning home. The captain of Quest III, Knof Llud, reports to the crew that they have identified Earth, and the crew is excited and emotional about the prospect of going home. Llud's wife, Lesra, expresses fear about what the ship would be returning to on Earth, but Llud reassures her. Llud finds Den, the Navigator, who asks him about the reception they would get when returning to Earth. Llud goes to his cabin, feeling drained from the voyage, and reflects on the past ten years, watching old tapes documenting the trip and its discoveries. He notes another discovery that the ship had made about Omega Centauri, a global cluster that could have been the home of a planet for humanity. However, Llud had to choose between returning to Earth and going to Omega Centauri because of limited fuel on the ship, and he had hesitantly decided to return home. As Quest III approaches Earth, they are attacked by unknown spacecrafts. Fearful, the crew analyzes the spacecrafts, which are surprisingly small. Quest III has a strong armor, but the crafts repeatedly attack the ship, with more and more approaching. The crew notes these as robot crafts, but it is soon discovered that they are tiny spaceships. Since the last 900 years on Earth, humans have gotten smaller, eventually evolving into minuscule beings. One of the small men reveals that Quest I had returned and also been attacked before surrendering and flying into the Sun, and advises that Quest III do the same. Llud asks them why they want to kill Quest III, to which they respond that they \"must die\"",
        "Summary_3": "It has been nine hundred years since Quest III left Earth. The space ship that is set to explore the space and find some planet that might be suitable for living, since Earth has reached a dangerously unstable phase. Due to the time axis of a space ship approaching light speed, it has been only ten years for thee passengers aboard on the ship. The story begins with Knof Llud, the captain of Quest III, announcing that they have sighted Earth. Though it just appears as a featureless disk on the telescope, people cheered and cried. Then the captain\u2019s wife, Lesra, seems to be worried about what has happened to Earth during this nine hundred years that they were gone. She worries that they won\u2019t fit in, and everything they once were familiar with are different now. During this few hours before they reach Earth, the captain goes to his private office-cabin and started to view records of their trip. He first views one among the earliest. In the record, he was energetic and, despite a blank visit to Procyon, there was idealism. Then the captain selected a later one where they still have not find any planets. They are starting to believe that the Sun\u2019s world is a rare accident. Finally he takes a record that is only four years old, when they\u2019ve reached the furthest point from Earth, according to the plan. While they could have gone to Omega Centauri, a cluster of stars twenty thousand light years away. They decided to turn back and return to Earth. \n\nSuddenly, as they get close to Earth, they are under attack by a few very small ships. The captain was relieved since those small ships does not carry large enough weapons to damage  Quest III, the crew on board almost do not feel the vicious onslaught being done to their ship. As more and more groups of attackers arrive, while some of the earlier ones go back for refill of ammunition, they start to get worried and believe that this is a planned attack. They start to broadcast questions asking the attacker to identify themselves. Finally, the images of Earth arrive, and to their surprise, it seems as if mold has covered all the cities. Then the attackers\u2019 voice comes back, stating that they know who they are and tells them to stop coming toward Earth, or they will be destroyed like the other Quest ships. ",
        "Summary_4": "The story begins aboard a ship called Quest III. The ship has been traversing the galaxy for years and is now returning to Earth. The story begins with the captain of the ship, Knof Llud, descending into a recreation room where many of the crew members are gathered. He announces to the group that they have spotted Earth. The crowd reacts openly with feelings of excitement and joy. His wife, Lesra, expresses her own feelings of nervousness about the unknown that Earth brings. The captain too has his own doubts. \n\nThe ship gets closer to Earth and they are able to experience the Sun. The Navigator, Gwar Den, asks the captain if he has any thoughts about the reception they might receive upon their return. The captain says no one can be sure. Knof goes to his private office cabin to wait until there is more news about their approach to Earth. As he is waiting, he thinks through the 900 Earth years that he has spent on the ship. He listens through recordings of himself when he was much younger and relives the feelings it felt at the time. He thinks about how he had the option to pursue an expedition of the globular cluster of Omega Centauri but instead chose to return to Earth. He cannot think of why he really chose to return to Earth besides the longing and familiarity it had. \n\nDuring the captain\u2019s time of reflection, there is a sudden jolt on the ship. The captain because confused about the potential trouble. He is informed by Den that the ship is being attacked. He orders the alarms to be sound in response. Den details that there are multiple tiny crafts attacking their ship. The attacks were not damaging the ship, but they were dangerous because they were depleting the already very limited fuel supply. \n\nEventually, the attackers make contact with the Quest III. The captain talks to the person and believes that they are trying to frighten them because they are frightened themselves. He is able to confirm that the person he is speaking to is human, but is unable to discern why he seems so strange.

For the      Quest III     was coming home; thesun ahead was      the     Sun, whose rays had warmed their lives' beginning.   <doc-sep>   THE FIRST ONE     By HERBERT D. KASTLE     Illustrated by von Dongen     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Analog July 1961.Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyrighton this publication was renewed.]       The first man to return from beyond the Great Frontier may bewelcomed ... but will it be as a curiosity, rather than as ahero...?       There was the usual welcoming crowd for a celebrity, and the usualspeeches by the usual politicians who met him at the airport which hadonce been twenty miles outside of Croton, but which the growing city hadsince engulfed and placed well within its boundaries. But everythingwasn't usual. The crowd was quiet, and the mayor didn't seem quite asat-ease as he'd been on his last big welcoming\u2014for Corporal Berringer,one of the crew of the spaceship      Washington     , first to set Americansupon Mars. His Honor's handclasp was somewhat moist and cold. HisHonor's eyes held a trace of remoteness.     Still, he was the honored home-comer, the successful returnee, thehometown boy who had made good in a big way, and they took the triumphaltour up Main Street to the new square and the grandstand. There he satbetween the mayor and a nervous young coed chosen as homecoming queen,and looked out at the police and fire department bands, the NationalGuard, the boy scouts and girl scouts, the Elks and Masons. Several ofthe churches in town had shown indecision as to how to instruct theirparishioners to treat him. But they had all come around. The tremendousnational interest, the fact that he was the First One, had made themcome around. It was obvious by now that they would have to adjust asthey'd adjusted to all the other firsts taking place in these\u2014as thenewspapers had dubbed the start of the Twenty-first Century\u2014theGalloping Twenties.     He was glad when the official greeting was over. He was a very tired manand he had come farther, traveled longer and over darker country, thanany man who'd ever lived before. He wanted a meal at his own table, akiss from his wife, a word from his son, and later to see some oldfriends and a relative or two. He didn't want to talk about the journey.He wanted to forget the immediacy, the urgency, the terror; then perhapshe would talk.     Or would he? For he had very little to tell. He had traveled and he hadreturned and his voyage was very much like the voyages of the greatmariners, from Columbus onward\u2014long, dull periods of time passing,passing, and then the arrival.     The house had changed. He saw that as soon as the official car let himoff at 45 Roosevelt Street. The change was, he knew, for the better.They had put a porch in front. They had rehabilitated, spruced up,almost rebuilt the entire outside and grounds. But he was sorry. He hadwanted it to be as before.     The head of the American Legion and the chief of police, who hadescorted him on this trip from the square, didn't ask to go in with him.He was glad. He'd had enough of strangers. Not that he was through withstrangers. There were dozens of them up and down the street, standingbeside parked cars, looking at him. But when he looked back at them,their eyes dropped, they turned away, they began moving off. He wasstill too much the First One to have his gaze met.     He walked up what had once been a concrete path and was now an ornateflagstone path. He climbed the new porch and raised the ornamentalknocker on the new door and heard the soft music sound within. He wassurprised that he'd had to do this. He'd thought Edith would be watchingat a window.     And perhaps she      had     been watching ... but she hadn't opened the door.     The door opened; he looked at her. It hadn't been too long and shehadn't changed at all. She was still the small, slender girl he'd lovedin high school, the small, slender woman he'd married twelve years ago.Ralphie was with her. They held onto each other as if seeking mutualsupport, the thirty-three-year old woman and ten-year-old boy. Theylooked at him, and then both moved forward, still together. He said,It's good to be home!     Edith nodded and, still holding to Ralphie with one hand, put the otherarm around him. He kissed her\u2014her neck, her cheek\u2014and all the oldjokes came to mind, the jokes of travel-weary, battle-weary men, theand-      then     -I'll-put-my-pack-aside jokes that spoke of terrible hunger.She was trembling, and even as her lips came up to touch his he felt thedifference, and because of this difference he turned with urgency toRalphie and picked him up and hugged him and said, because he couldthink of nothing else to say, What a big fella, what a big fella.     Ralphie stood in his arms as if his feet were still planted on thefloor, and he didn't look at his father but somewhere beyond him. Ididn't grow much while you were gone, Dad, Mom says I don't eat enough.     So he put him down and told himself that it would all change, thateverything would loosen up just as his commanding officer, GeneralCarlisle, had said it would early this morning before he leftWashington.     Give it some time, Carlisle had said. You need the time; they needthe time. And for the love of heaven, don't be sensitive.   <doc-sep> Jorj turned, smiling. And now, gentlemen, while we wait for Maizieto celebrate, there should be just enough time for us to watch thetakeoff of the Mars rocket. He switched on a giant television screen.The others made a quarter turn, and there before them glowed the richochres and blues of a New Mexico sunrise and, in the middle distance, asilvery mighty spindle.     Like the generals, the Secretary of Space suppressed a scowl. Herewas something that ought to be spang in the center of his officialterritory, and the Thinkers had locked him completely out of it. Thatrocket there\u2014just an ordinary Earth satellite vehicle commandeeredfrom the Army, but equipped by the Thinkers with Maizie-designednuclear motors capable of the Mars journey and more. The firstspaceship\u2014and the Secretary of Space was not in on it!     Still, he told himself, Maizie had decreed it that way. And whenhe remembered what the Thinkers had done for him in rescuing himfrom breakdown with their mental science, in rescuing the wholeAdministration from collapse he realized he had to be satisfied. Andthat was without taking into consideration the amazing additionalmental discoveries that the Thinkers were bringing down from Mars.     Lord, the President said to Jorj as if voicing the Secretary'sfeeling, I wish you people could bring a couple of those wise littledevils back with you this trip. Be a good thing for the country.     Jorj looked at him a bit coldly. It's quite unthinkable, he said.The telepathic abilities of the Martians make them extremelysensitive. The conflicts of ordinary Earth minds would impinge on thempsychotically, even fatally. As you know, the Thinkers were able tocontact them only because of our degree of learned mental poise anderrorless memory-chains. So for the present it must be our task aloneto glean from the Martians their astounding mental skills. Of course,some day in the future, when we have discovered how to armor the mindsof the Martians\u2014     Sure, I know, the President said hastily. Shouldn't have mentionedit, Jorj.     Conversation ceased. They waited with growing tension for the greatviolet flames to bloom from the base of the silvery shaft.  "

        "Summary_1": "All the people are extremely excited to return, they keep talking and buzzing about it. Many are nervous about the centuries that have passed and about what they will find upon return. Lesra, the captain's wife, feels anxious, for a while she was even afraid the Earth won't be there. She is scared of how the Earth will look like now and tears fill her eyes. The navigator is also nervous about the reception they will get. When the ship is attacked, everyone is confused and scared, the mass panic starts. The captain has to maintain coolness and calm everyone down, but he is also anxious about the return. Moreover, he hates returning with failure and only does it because the ship ran out of fuel. So, the whole ship anticipates the return and misses home, but due to the long time far away, everyone is afraid of what awaits them.  ",

When they first receive the news that Earth has been identified, they are emotional and amazed; it has been 10 years for them being away from Earth, but 900 years have passed on Earth, so there is a present uncertainty about what will be waiting for them when they arrive. However, the crew is mainly happy to return to Earth, being homesick, and some of their children having never been on Earth. The crew feels a bittersweet mix of hope, fear, and relief. ",
        "Summary_3": "Once the crew heard that they have sighted Earth, they were excited. They cheered and cried. However, the captain\u2019s wife is worried that Earth has changed during this nine hundred years that they were gone. She worries that they won\u2019t fit in, and everything they once were familiar with are different now. The captain tells that she does not need to worry, they will manage. Later, during the attack, people are confused and scared. They don\u2019t know who are attacking them or why they attack. But the captain\u2019s boy is not, he has faith in his father. Moreover, the boy mentions that while the attackers are mad, they aren\u2019t. ",
        "Summary_4": "The crew on board the spaceship approaching Earth was a mixture of emotions, but a consensus surrounded excitement. Adults were discussing in hushed tones their opinions of eagerness and some of the apprehension for the unknown that they might encounter upon return. When they hear that Earth has been spotted, they begin their exciting chatter again. They embraced each other, shouted, kissed, and wept in ecstasy. Fears were not dwelled upon during the initial moments of the approach. ",

A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see noenemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath.     You hunt too near the lake, called a voice. The demons of the waterwill trap you.     Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingledwith that of a strange Zuran. He squatted.     It's Noork, he grunted. Why do I not see you?     I have stolen the skin of a demon, answered the invisible man. Go toGurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Onescan be trapped and skinned.     Why you want their skins? Ud scratched his hairy gray skull.     Go to save Gurn's ... and here Noork was stumped for words. To savehis father's woman woman, he managed at last. Father's woman womancalled Sarna.     And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now themarshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from thejungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lakeof Uzdon.     To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage junglefastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew thatthe giant bird had carried him from some other place that his batteredbrain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that mencould live elsewhere than in a jungle valley.     But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depthsof Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And theother bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon thegolden-skinned girl, was from another world also.     The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork,the Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the landof sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from thesame valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird andperhaps then he could remember better who he had been.     So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich\u2014whose memory wasgone completely\u2014again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, lastof the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-hairedyoung American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hiddenvalley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbledstructure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in thesecond of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.The Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on thislittle blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk.     The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientistpreferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of thelifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, butDietrich's spacer had crashed.     Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasadshad slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, itscrystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb.   <doc-sep> I smiled at him gratefully; he was the only member of my family whoreally seemed to like me in spite of my handicap. It won't work, Tim.I know you're trying to be kind, but\u2014     He's not saying it just to be kind, my mother put in. He means it.Not that I want to arouse false hopes, Kevin, she added with grimscrupulousness. Tim's awfully young yet and I wouldn't trust hisextracurricular prognostications too far.     Nonetheless, I couldn't help feeling a feeble renewal of old hopes.After all, young or not, Tim was a hell of a good prognosticator; hewouldn't have risen so rapidly to the position he held in the WeatherBureau if he hadn't been pretty near tops in foreboding.     Mother smiled sadly at my thoughts, but I didn't let that discourageme. As Danny had said, she      knew     but she didn't really      understand     .Nobody, for all of his or her psi power, really understood me.  "

        "Query": "What was the objective and intention behind the journey in THE GIANTS RETURN?",
        "Summary_1": "A few ships were sent to space as a part of the mission. Quest III was one of them, but there also were Quest I and II. The purpose was for the ships to find a sun similar to the Sun somewhere in space, and a planet to live on, in case Earth will become unfit. This mission was of extreme importance for the whole of humanity and the crew felt honored and ready to sacrifice all they were leaving on Earth. Nevertheless, they kept hoping to return as fast as possible, but every sun was unfit. The amount of fuel for no more than one thousand Earth years was loaded before departure and the fairest point to reach was chosen. All three ships went different ways, and were cut from any communication. Nevertheless, Quest III was unable to find any fitting planet and had to return or stay in a place located more than forty thousand Earth years away. The captain decided to return, though the failure upset him. ",
        "Summary_2": "The plan and purpose of the voyage was to find a planet that would be habitable enough to be colonized by Earth before humanity is eradicated by overpopulation and lack of resources. Three ships were sent out into space, Quest I, II, and III, and the current ship is the last to make its trip. Quest III traveled into space, stopping at countless planets, and once it reached the furthest point, turned back on a curve to return to Earth. However, the voyage was not successful, and Quest III has been unable to find a habitable planet. ",
        "Summary_3": "The purpose of the voyage is to expand mankind into the universe. Due to the fact that the population on Earth was outgrowing its room and resources, and because the man\u2019s room for growth on Earth was in sight, they have to be moved elsewhere. Thus three space ships were built, which exhausts the economy. Each ship, Quest, will try to find a habitable planet by going into the space from star to star. They plan to go to as far as one thousand years Earth time. Once a habitable planet is found, they will return to Earth, however they never find one and have to return after reaching the furthest point of their plan. ",
        "Summary_4": "The purpose of the voyage was to continue with humanity\u2019s dream and find another suitable planet to live on. Earth had begun overpopulated and humans needed to expand out of their solar system. Ships, along with Quest III, were created to search for other planets in the universe. The ships that were built were extremely costly and laborious. They required a united effort from all on Earth. The effort was energized by the hope that the human race would be able to continue and expand elsewhere in the universe.  There was hope that they would be able to return before a century on Earth, but those dreams were not realized. ",

However, there were otherseal-people here.     And they were almost human!     The resemblance was still not so much in their physical makeup\u2014thatwas little changed from the first he had found\u2014as in their obviouslygreater intelligence.     This was mainly noticeable in their facile expressions as they talked.Kaiser was even certain that he read smiles on their faces when heslipped on a particularly slick mud patch as he hurried toward them.Where the members of the first tribes had all looked almost exactlyalike, these had very marked individual characteristics. Also, thesehad no odor\u2014only a mild, rather pleasing scent. When they came to meethim, Kaiser could detect distinct syllabism in their pipings.     Most of the natives returned to the river after the first ten minutesof curious inspection, but two stayed behind as Kaiser set up his tent.     One was a female.     They made small noises while he went about his work. After a time, heunderstood that they were trying to give names to his paraphernalia. Hetried saying tent and wire and tarp as he handled each object,but their piping voices could not repeat the words. Kaiser amusedhimself by trying to imitate their sounds for the articles. He wasfairly successful. He was certain that he could soon learn enough tocarry on a limited conversation.     The male became bored after a time and left, but the girl stayed untilKaiser finished. She motioned to him then to follow. When they reachedthe river bank, he saw that she wanted him to go into the water.   <doc-sep> He sank into the softness of his bed. As he turned over on his side,his gaze fell upon an object on a bureau in a far corner of the room.     He sat straight up, his chest heaving.     The object was a tri-dimensional photo of a rock-faced man in amerchant spaceman's uniform. He was a giant of a man with a neatlytrimmed      red beard     !     Ben stared at the photo for a long time. At length, he slipped intorestless sleep. Images of faces and echoes of words spun through hisbrain.     The dead man returned to him. Bloodied lips cursed at him. Glassy eyesaccused him. Somewhere were two lost children crying in the night.     And towering above him was a red-bearded man whose great hands reacheddown and beckoned to him. Ben crawled through the night on hands andknees, his legs numb and useless. The crying of the children was achilling wail in his ears.     His head rose and turned to the red-bearded man. His pleading voicescreamed out to him in a thick, harsh cackle. Yet even as he screamed,the giant disappeared, to be replaced by white-booted feet stompingrelentlessly toward him.     He awoke still screaming....     A night without darkness passed. Ben lay waiting for Maggie's return, aquestion already formed in his mind.     She came and at once he asked, Who is the man with the red beard?     She smiled. I was right then when I gave you that thumbnail biog. You      were     looking for him, weren't you?     Who is he?     She sat on the chair beside him.     My husband, she said softly.     He began to understand. And your husband needs an astrogator? That'swhy you saved me?     We need all the good men we can get.     Where is he?     She cocked her head in mock suspicion. Somewhere between Mercury andPluto. He's building a new base for us\u2014and a home for me. When hisship returns, I'll be going to him.     Why aren't you with him now?     He said unexplored space is no place for a woman. So I've beenstudying criminal reports and photos from the Interplanetary Bureau ofInvestigation and trying to find recruits like yourself. You know howwe operate?     He told her the tales he'd heard.  "

        "Query": "What is the reason behind the captain's choice to head back to Earth instead of proceeding to Omega Centauri in THE GIANTS RETURN?",
        "Summary_1": "The whole crew was getting homesick and excited about returning, even the captain became nostalgic of the forests and green areas. On the other hand, all the people the crew knew had died a long time ago, and there was some frightening uncertainty about what awaited them upon return. Therefore, the decision was hard to make. Even more difficult it was for the captain as he didn't want to return with the news of failure. Soon, it turns out that the return was a dangerous choice and the crew is not welcome. The ship is attacked and the enemy threatens to destroy the ship, which can't turn away as it is out of fuel. Therefore, this decision put the whole crew in danger instead of fulfilling their hopes for warm welcome and excitement to come home. ",
        "Summary_2": "The captain could have advised the ship to go to Omega Centauri, a cluster of globes further past the point of Quest III's voyage. Omega Centauri contains many planets close to its Sun, and for this reason would likely be a place where several habitable planets can be found. However, Omega Centauri is too far for Quest III to make the trip there and back to Earth, so if they went there, they would not be able to return. The captain notes this risk, and decides to return back to Earth. However, this ends up being a mistake, and as Quest III returns to Earth they are attacked and unwelcome. ",
        "Summary_3": "The Omega Centauri is space clustered with stars in comparison to a few dozen in the Sun\u2019s neighborhood, but it is twenty thousand light years away. While Quest III could get to Omega Centauri with its remaining fuel, it can only be a one-way journey. Moreover, even if it has enough fuel for the round trip, forty thousand years would have passed, there is no point in returning, when it is unclear if human race itself still remains. Most importantly, the crew has been showing signs of homesick, despite the fact that what was known as home is probably gone. From the joy an tears of the passengers once they acknowledge Earth has been sighted, we know \u2013 they are happy and want to return home. Just as Llud stated, he is still a part of Earth. ",
        "Summary_4": "Omega Centauri was a globular cluster that had a hundred thousand stars in a comparatively small volume. There was hope that Omega Centauri of all places would possess the planet necessary for human survival. The issue was that it was twenty thousand light-years away. With the limited fuel reserves that the Quest III ship had left, going to Omega Centauri would be a one-way trip. If the globular cluster proved to be as useless as every other location, the ship and its crew members would have no fuel to go anywhere else. Earth was a safer option because its existence was reality, at least when the ships left 900 Earth years ago. Omega Centauri was very uncertain. ",

He frowned thoughtfully, choosing one more spool that was only fouryears old. The recorded voice sounded weary, yet alive with a strangelonging....     We are in the heart of Pleiades; a hundred stars show brilliant onthe screens, each star encircled by a misty halo like lights glowingthrough fog, for we are traversing a vast diffuse nebula.     According to plan, the      Quest III     has reached its furthest point fromEarth. Now we turn back along a curve that will take us past many morestars and stellar systems\u2014but hope is small that any of those willprove a home for man, as have none of the thousands of stars examinedalready.     But what are a few thousand stars in a galaxy of billions?

On flimsy excuses I have had Zost Relyul make observations of theglobular cluster Omega Centauri. There are a hundred thousand starsthere in a volume of space where one finds a few dozen in the Sun'sneighborhood; there if anywhere must circle the planets we seek! ButOmega Centauri is twenty thousand light years away....     Even so\u2014by expending its remaining fuel freely, the      Quest III     couldachieve a velocity that would take us there without dying of senilityof aging too greatly. It would be a one-way journey\u2014even if enoughfuel remained, there would be little point in returning to Earth aftermore than forty thousand years. By then our civilization certainly, andperhaps the human race itself, would have perished from memory.     That was why the planners limited our voyage, and those of the other      Quests     , to less than a thousand years Earth time. Even now, accordingto the sociodynamic predictions made then, our civilization\u2014if theother expeditions failed also\u2014will have reached a dangerously unstablephase, and before we can get back it may have collapsed completely fromoverpopulation.     Why go back, then with the news of our failure? Why not forget aboutEarth and go on to Omega Centauri? What use is quixotic loyalty to adecree five thousand years old, whose makers are dead and which may beforgotten back there?     Would the crew be willing? I don't know\u2014some of them still show signsof homesickness, though they know with their minds that everything thatwas once 'home' has probably been swept away....     It doesn't matter. Today I gave orders to swing the ship.     Savagely Knof Llud stabbed the button that shut off the speaker. Thenhe sat for a time with head resting in his hands, staring into nothing.     The memory of that fierce impulse to go on still had power to shakehim. A couple of lines of poetry came into his head, as he read themonce in translation from the ancient English....     ... for my purpose holds     To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths     Of all the western stars, until I die.   <doc-sep> He awoke with a start and a cry of alarm ran through him as he thoughtthat perhaps he might still be in the      Mary Lou     . The warm, smiling faceof a man quickly reassured him.     I'll call the captain, the space man said. He said to let him knowwhen you came to.     Willard could only nod in weak and grateful acceptance. It was true! Hepressed his head back against the bed's pillows. How soft! How warm! Heyawned and stretched his arms as a thrill of happiness shot through hisentire body.     He would see Earth again! That single thought ran over and over in hismind without stopping. He would see Earth again! Perhaps not this yearand perhaps not the next\u2014for the ship might be on some extra-Plutonianexpedition. But even if it would take years before it returned to homebase Willard knew that those years would fly quickly if Earth was atthe end of the trail.     Though he had aged, he still had many years before him. And thoseyears, he vowed, would be spent on Earth and nowhere else.     The captain, a pleasant old fellow, came into the room as Willard stoodup and tried to walk. The gravity here was a bit different from that ofhis ship, but he would manage.     How do you feel, Space Man Willard?     Oh, you know me? Willard looked at him in surprise, and then smiled,Of course, you looked through the log book of the      Mary Lou     .     The captain nodded and Willard noticed with surprise that he was a veryold man.     You don't know how much I suffered there, Willard said slowly,measuring each word. Years in space\u2014all alone! It's a horrible thing!     Yes? the old captain said.     Many times I thought I would go completely mad. It was only thethought and hope that some day, somehow, an Earth-ship would find meand help me get back to Earth. If it was not for that, I would havedied. I could think of nothing but of Earth, of blue green water, ofvast open spaces and the good brown earth. How beautiful it must benow!     A note of sadness, matched only by that of Willard's, entered thecaptain's eyes.     I want to walk on Earth just once\u2014then I can die.     Willard stopped. A happy dreamy smile touched his lips.     When will we go to Earth? he asked.     The Captain did not answer. Willard waited and a strange memory tuggedat him.     You don't know, the Captain said. It was not a question or astatement. The Captain found it hard to say it. His lips moved slowly.     Willard stepped back and before the Captain told him,      he knew     .     Matter is relative, he said, the existent under one condition isnon-existent under another. The real here is the non-real there. Allthings that wander alone in space are gradually drained of their massand energy until nothing is left but mere shells. That is what happenedto the      Mary Lou     . Your ship was real when we passed by twenty yearsago. It is now like ours, a vague outline in space. We cannot feelthe change ourselves, for change is relative. That is why we becamemore and more solid to you, as you became more and more faint to anyEarth-ship that might have passed. We are real\u2014to ourselves. But tosome ship from Earth which has not been in space for more than fifteenyears\u2014to that ship, to all intents and purposes, we do not exist.     Then this ship, Willard said, stunned, you and I and everything onit...     ... are doomed, the Captain said. We cannot go to Earth for thesimple reason that we would go      through     it!     The vision of Earth and green trees faded. He would never see Earthagain. He would never feel the crunch of ground under feet as hewalked. Never would listen to the voices of friends and the songs ofbirds. Never. Never. Never....     Then this is the Ghost Ship and we are the Ghosts!     Yes.    <doc-sep> On that day, I walked farther than I had intended and, by the time Igot back home, I found the rest of my family had returned before me.They seemed to be excited about something and were surprised to see meso calm.     Aren't you even interested in anything outside your own immediateconcerns, Kev? Sylvia demanded, despite Father's efforts to shush her.     Can't you remember that Kev isn't able to receive the tellies? Timshot back at her. He probably doesn't even know what's happened.     Well, what did happen? I asked, trying not to snap.     One starship got back from Alpha Centauri, Danny said excitedly.There are two inhabited Earth-type planets there!     This was for me; this was it at last! I tried not to show myenthusiasm, though I knew that was futile. My relatives could keeptheir thoughts and emotions from me; I couldn't keep mine from them.What kind of life inhabits them? Humanoid?     Uh-uh. Danny shook his head. And hostile. The crew of the starshipsays they were attacked immediately on landing. When they turned andleft, they were followed here by one of the alien ships. Must be apretty advanced race to have spaceships. Anyhow, the extraterrestrialship headed back as soon as it got a fix on where ours was going.     But if they're hostile, I said thoughtfully, it might mean war.     Of course. That's why everybody's so wrought up. We hope it's peace,but we'll have to prepare for war just in case.     There hadn't been a war on Earth for well over a hundred years, butwe hadn't been so foolish as to obliterate all knowledge of militarytechniques and weapons. The alien ship wouldn't be able to come backwith reinforcements\u2014if such were its intention\u2014in less than sixmonths. This meant time to get together a stockpile of weapons, thoughwe had no idea of how effective our defenses would be against thealiens' armament.     They might have strange and terrible weapons against which we wouldbe powerless. On the other hand, our side would have the benefitsof telekinetically guided missiles, teleported saboteurs, telepathsto pick up the alien strategy, and prognosticators to determine theoutcome of each battle and see whether it was worth fighting in thefirst place.     Everybody on Earth hoped for peace. Everybody, that is, except me. Ihad been unable to achieve any sense of identity with the world inwhich I lived, and it was almost worth the loss of personal survivalto know that my own smug species could look silly against a still moretalented race.

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in The Blue Behemoth?",
        "Summary_1": "Bucky Shannon, a space circus owner, and his business manager, Jig Bentley, have a dispute over the business' financial hardships. Suddenly, a little man interferes. Mistaking him for a bill-collector, Bucky starts a fight, when Jig notices money in the man's hands. Simon Beamish, the little man, is planning to invest in the circus and make its tour to other towns. He agrees to pay much more than the real cost is, Bucky and Jig suspect some kind of a game there, but they need money. The two go to their circus and are finally able to pay the performers. After having some fun all together, the two go to see Gertrude, a huge cansin, the main attraction, who was earlier reported to be unhappy. Upon entry, Jig feels uneasy, frightened and sorry for Gertrude, who is in desperate need of a mate. The sorrow of this creature makes the whole team sad and uneasy, full of pity, and no one could help, even Gow who saved her and is the closest to her. Exiting her tank, Jig has to carry Bucky, who is crying at the view and falling asleep at the same time. On their way, the two face the Vapor snakes let out by someone, they fall, and the snakes cover their bodies. Gow saves the two and they are burnt but alive, trying to find out who let the snakes out to hurt them and suspecting Beamish. Then the whole gang goes to Venus to meet Beamish, and there is a feeling of discontent coming from the gang and mixed with Gertrude's screams all the way. Further, the Nahali woman from the gang claims to smell death and trouble. Then they meet Sam, a hunter selling them animals until three seasons ago, and now he is crying and scared. Turns out, he has found the only male cansin and wants to take it back to prevent trouble, though he is afraid of people wanting to take the cansin from him. Suddenly, Jig discovers Beamish listening to the conversation and Sam dies. Jig then notices the suspicious silence and too much of a crowd in the bar and recognizes the man who gave Sam a cigarette a while ago. ",
        "Summary_2": "Jig Bentley and his business partner Bucky Shannon run a zoo together in space. Their ship is currently stationed on Mars. Bucky is the owner of the zoo and Jig is his right hand man. Both they and the zoo are broken. That is until one night they are visited by Simon Beamish, a mysteriously rich man who offers them 100 U.C's to charter their circus to perform on Venus. They agree, but the night before they're set to leave, they pay a visit to their main attraction, a cansin, a beast native to Venus, named Gertrude. While they are down in the area where they keep the various monsters that perform in their show, along with the zookeeper named Gow, a group of vapour snakes are released on the pair. Some unknown person let these beasts free, in an effort to kill the duo. Jig takes Bucky away from the closed off area, saving his life, then blacks out. Later they wake up, speculating over who would want to kill them. They make the trip to Venus, while Gertrude is becoming restless. She is lonely and needs a mate. If she doesn't get one, Gow fears she might break out and wreak havoc. They arrive in Venus, where Ahra, one of the performers tells Jig that something has been taken from Venus, and death is coming. Jig then notices a run down Sam Kepper, a hunter he is acquainted with. Kepper falls and the pair rush over to him. A mystery man gives Kepper a cigarette, then leaves. They bring him into a bar, where Kepper tells him that he has found and acquired  a male cansin. Kepper tells Jig that he must take it back. Soon after this, he falls unconscious. Just then, Beamish arrives at their table. Jig walks over to the bar, noticing the group of men that are in the bar. Jig asks the barman what Kepper was drinking, and when he turns around, he notices the man that gave Kepper the cigarette. \nTHE END. ",
        "Summary_3": "The Blue Behemoth story begins with Bucky Shannon and Jig sitting around a table talking about how they are not doing well with their business. Jig insults the circus and notably upsets Bucky who responds with violence. Before Bucky can hurt Jig too bad, they are interrupted by a stranger. The stranger is offering the two a lot of money for their circus. Jig does not feel comfortable with the stranger but is willing to set aside his uneasiness because they desperately need the money that the stranger is offering. They begin to listen to what the stranger is offering \u2013 a charter to their circus for money and negotiate details about monetary compensation. Gow interrupts their conversation to complain about Gertrude, a member of their circus, not acting right. When they let it slip that Gertrude is a cansin, an extremely rare animal, Beamish appears impressed by the news. Beamish agrees to the terms of the contract and leaves Bucky and Jig. \n\nOnce he leaves, Jig implies that they have to pay people back before they can enjoy a large amount of money they have come into. They return to the spaceport where Bucky\u2019s Imperial Circus is lounging around, there are about twenty of them sitting there. While in the spaceport, Bucky expresses that he wants to go see Gertrude. Jig does not. They go down a dark hallway in search of Gertrude. Jig smells a sour and wild scent emanating in the area. They hear loud screaming and can sense that Gertrude is suffering because she cannot find someone to mate. Jig emphatically tells Gow that it is impossible because a male cansin has never been seen nor proven to exist. \n\nSoon chaos is let loose. Vapor snakes are somehow let out and Jig and Bucky attempt to run away. Bucky causes Jig to stumble and the snakes are able to get to them, burning them through their clothes. They pass out and wake up in a cell with injuries. Bucky says that someone had to have let the snakes out. He wants to know why someone wanted to kill them. They are unable to figure out who did it. Someone named Sam comes up to them and then they start running towards him because they realize they recognize him. They get Sam into a shack and ask him what happened. Sam is desperately trying to communicate that he found a male cansin and wants them to take it back. He then appears to pass out and they find Beamish standing behind a curtain. Jig notices that there is something unusual about the audience at the bar and tries to explain the situation. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Bucky Shannon and Jig are the heads of Shannon's Imperial Circus, a circus that tours around space. They are sitting in a bar, defeated due to the lack of success in their circus. Bucky and Jig are out of money with their circus in pathetic condition. They are then interrupted by a small man who asks for Bucky, holding a large amount of money. Bucky introduces himself and Jig, and the man introduces himself as Beamish. Beamish has taken an interest in Shannon's Imperial Circus and offers to charter it, proposing that the circus make a tour on the settlements along the Tehara Belt, on Venus. Jig, not wanting to seem too desperate or reveal the state of the circus to Beamish, is hesitant at first, saying they would have to cancel on events. The three are interrupted by Gow, the circus' zoo-keeper, who informs Bucky that Gertrude, a Venusian cansin that is the star of the circus, is not doing well. Beamish is impressed at the presence of a cansin, given there is only one other animal of the species. Jig names a price of one hundred U.C's for Beamish to join the partnership. Though a large amount of money, Jig advises that it is reserved for the men they owe it to. Bucky and Jig return to the circus spaceport, where they meet a group of men and give them money, then proceed to beat the group of men up. Once inside, Bucky convinces Jig to see Gertrude with him, and once they see her, they notice that she is in terrible condition. Gow informs them that Gertrude wants a mate, which is practically impossible because there are only two known cansins. Jig tells Gow to do what he can to help Gertrude, as him and Bucky head to bed. Once they start to rest, they wake in a panic as the Vapor snakes attack them, having escaped in the night. Jig awakes, injured, and Bucky concludes that they have been sabotaged by whoever let the snakes out. They suspect Beamish as the culprit, but sign his contract anyway out of a need for money. They then go on their trip to Venus, stopping at Nahru and meeting with Beamish and the gang. On their way to a bar, they come across Sam Kapper, a hunter who supplies animals to attractions. Kapper is in visible pain. They take him into the bar, asking him what had happened. Kapper eventually tells them that he has found a male cansin, but before he can say where, he dies. Beamish is found to be listening in on the conversation.",
        "Article": "What is it you wish? he barked. I understood in my discussions withthe other ... ah ... civilian there'd be no further need for theseirritating conferences.     I've just learned you're placing more students abroad, Mr. Gulver. Howmany this time?     Two thousand.     And where will they be going?     Croanie. It's all in the application form I've handed in. Your job isto provide transportation.     Will there be any other students embarking this season?     Why ... perhaps. That's Boge's business. Gulver looked at Retief withpursed lips. As a matter of fact, we had in mind dispatching anothertwo thousand to Featherweight.     Another under-populated world\u2014and in the same cluster, I believe,Retief said. Your people must be unusually interested in that regionof space.     If that's all you wanted to know, I'll be on my way. I have matters ofimportance to see to.     After Gulver left, Retief called Miss Furkle in. I'd like to have abreak-out of all the student movements that have been planned under thepresent program, he said. And see if you can get a summary of whatMEDDLE has been shipping lately.     Miss Furkle compressed her lips. If Mr. Magnan were here, I'm surehe wouldn't dream of interfering in the work of other departments.I ... overheard your conversation with the gentleman from the CroanieLegation\u2014     The lists, Miss Furkle.     I'm not accustomed, Miss Furkle said, to intruding in mattersoutside our interest cluster.     That's worse than listening in on phone conversations, eh? But nevermind. I need the information, Miss Furkle.     Loyalty to my Chief\u2014     Loyalty to your pay-check should send you scuttling for the materialI've asked for, Retief said. I'm taking full responsibility. Nowscat.     The buzzer sounded. Retief flipped a key. MUDDLE, Retief speaking....     Arapoulous's brown face appeared on the desk screen.     How-do, Retief. Okay if I come up?     Sure, Hank. I want to talk to you.     In the office, Arapoulous took a chair. Sorry if I'm rushing you,Retief, he said. But have you got anything for me?     Retief waved at the wine bottles. What do you know about Croanie?     Croanie? Not much of a place. Mostly ocean. All right if you likefish, I guess. We import our seafood from there. Nice prawns in monsoontime. Over a foot long.     You on good terms with them?     Sure, I guess so. Course, they're pretty thick with Boge.     So?     Didn't I tell you? Boge was the bunch that tried to take us over herea dozen years back. They'd've made it too, if they hadn't had a lot ofbad luck. Their armor went in the drink, and without armor they're easygame.     Miss Furkle buzzed. I have your lists, she said shortly.     Bring them in, please.   <doc-sep> In the street the blue sun, Alpha, peered like an arc light under a lowcloud layer, casting flat shadows across the mud of the avenue. Thethree mounted a passing flat-car. Whonk squatted, resting the weight ofhis immense shell on the heavy plank flooring.     Would that I too could lose this burden, as has the false youth webludgeoned aboard the      Moss Rock     , he sighed. Soon will I be forcedinto retirement. Then a mere keeper of a place of papers such as Iwill rate no more than a slab on the public strand, with once-dailyfeedings. And even for a man of high position, retirement is nopleasure. A slab in the Park of Monuments is little better. A dismaloutlook for one's next thousand years!     You two carry on to the police station, said Retief. I want to playa hunch. But don't take too long. I may be painfully right.     What\u2014? Magnan started.     As you wish, Retief, said Whonk.     The flat-car trundled past the gate to the shipyard and Retief jumpeddown, headed at a run for the VIP boat. The guard post still stoodvacant. The two Youths whom he and Whonk had left trussed were gone.     That's the trouble with a peaceful world, Retief muttered. No policeprotection. He stepped down from the lighted entry and took up aposition behind the sentry box. Alpha rose higher, shedding a glaringblue-white light without heat. Retief shivered. Maybe he'd guessedwrong....     There was a sound in the near distance, like two elephants colliding.     Retief looked toward the gate. His giant acquaintance, Whonk, hadreappeared and was grappling with a hardly less massive opponent. Asmall figure became visible in the melee, scuttled for the gate. Headedoff by the battling titans, he turned and made for the opposite sideof the shipyard. Retief waited, jumped out and gathered in the fleeingGroaci.     Well, Yith, he said, how's tricks? You should pardon the expression.     Release me, Retief! the pale-featured alien lisped, his throatbladder pulsating in agitation. The behemoths vie for the privilege ofdismembering me out of hand!     I know how they feel. I'll see what I can do ... for a price.     I appeal to you, Yith whispered hoarsely. As a fellow diplomat, afellow alien, a fellow soft-back\u2014     Why don't you appeal to Slock, as a fellow skunk? said Retief. Nowkeep quiet ... and you may get out of this alive.     The heavier of the two struggling Fustians threw the other to theground. There was another brief flurry, and then the smaller figure wason its back, helpless.     That's Whonk, still on his feet, said Retief. I wonder who he'scaught\u2014and why.     Whonk came toward the      Moss Rock     dragging the supine Fustian, whokicked vainly. Retief thrust Yith down well out of sight behind thesentry box. Better sit tight, Yith. Don't try to sneak off; I canoutrun you. Stay here and I'll see what I can do. He stepped out andhailed Whonk.     Puffing like a steam engine Whonk pulled up before him. Sleep,Retief! He panted. You followed a hunch; I did the same. I sawsomething strange in this one when we passed him on the avenue. Iwatched, followed him here. Look! It is Slock, strapped into a deadcarapace! Now many things become clear.   <doc-sep>    The Blue Behemoth     By LEIGH BRACKETT     Shannon's Imperial Circus was a jinxed     space-carny leased for a mysterious tour     of the inner worlds. It made a one-night     pitch on a Venusian swamp-town\u2014to     find that death stalked it from the     jungle in a tiny ball of flame.     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Planet Stories May 1943.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      Bucky Shannon leaned forward across the little hexagonal table. Heknocked over the pitcher of      thil     , but it didn't matter. The pitcherwas empty. He jabbed me in the breastbone with his forefinger, notvery hard. Not hard enough to jar the ribs clean loose, just enough tospring them.     We, he said, are broke. We are finished, through. Washed up anddown the drain. He added, as an afterthought, Destitute.     I looked at him. I said sourly, You're kidding!     Kidding. Shannon put his elbows on the table and peered at me througha curtain of very blond hair that was trying hard to be red. He saysI'm kidding! With Shannon's Imperial Circus, the Greatest Show inSpace, plastered so thick with attachments....     It's no more plastered than you are. I was sore because he'd been alot quicker grabbing the pitcher. The Greatest Show in Space. Phooey!I've wet-nursed Shannon's Imperial Circus around the Triangle foreleven years, and I know. It's lousy, it's mangy, it's broken-down!Nothing works, from the ship to the roustabouts. In short, it stinks!     I must have had the pitcher oftener than I thought. Nobody insultsBuckhalter Shannon's Imperial Circus to Buckhalter Shannon's faceunless he's tired and wants a long rest in a comfy fracture-frame.     Shannon got up. He got up slowly. I had plenty of time to see hisgrey-green eyes get sleepy, and hear the quarter-Earth-blood Martiangirl wailing about love over by the battered piano, and watch theslanting cat-eyes of the little dark people at the tables swing roundtoward us, pleased and kind of hungry.     I had plenty of time to think how I only weigh one-thirty-seven toShannon's one-seventy-five, and how I'm not as young as I used to be.     I said, Bucky. Hold on, fella. I....     Somebody said, Excuse me, gentlemen. Is one of you Mister BuckhalterShannon?     Shannon put his hands down on his belt. He closed his eyes and smiledpleasantly and said, very gently:     Would you be collecting for the feed bill, or the fuel?     I shot a glance at the newcomer. He'd saved me from a beating, even ifhe was a lousy bill-collecter; and I felt sorry for him. Bucky Shannonsettled his shoulders and hips like a dancer.     The stranger was a little guy. He even made me look big. He was dressedin dark-green synthesilk, very conservative. There was a powdering ofgrey in his hair and his skin was pink, soft, and shaved painfullyclean. He had the kind of a face that nice maiden-ladies will trustwith their last dime. I looked for his strong-arm squad.     There didn't seem to be any. The little guy looked at Shannon with paleblue eyes like a baby, and his voice was softer than Bucky's.     He said, I don't think you understand.     I felt cold, suddenly, between the shoulders. Somebody scraped a chairback. It sounded like he'd ripped the floor open, it was so quiet. Igot my brassies on, and my hands were sweating. Bucky Shannon sighed,and let his fist start traveling, a long, deceptive arc.     Then I saw what the little guy was holding in his hand.     I yelled and knocked the table over into Bucky. It made a lot of noise.It knocked him sideways and down, and the little dark men jumped up,quivering and showing their teeth. The Martian girl screamed.     Bucky heaved the table off his lap and cursed me. What's eating you,Jig? I'm not going to hurt him.     Shut up, I said. Look what he's got there. Money!     The little guy looked at me. He hadn't turned a hair. Yes, he said.Money. Quite a lot of it. Would you gentlemen permit me to join you?     Bucky Shannon got up. He grinned his pleasantest grin. Delighted. I'mShannon. This is Jig Bentley, my business manager. He looked down atthe table. I'm sorry about that. Mistaken identity.     The little guy smiled. He did it with his lips. The rest of his facestayed placid and babyish, almost transparent. I realized with a startthat it wasn't transparent at all. It was the most complete dead-pan Iever met, and you couldn't see into those innocent blue eyes any morethan you could see through sheet metal.     I didn't like him. I didn't like him at all. But he had money. I said,Howdy. Let's go find a booth. These Marshies make me nervous, lookinglike hungry cats at a mouse-hole.     The little guy nodded. Excellent idea. My name is Beamish. SimonBeamish. I wish to\u2014ah\u2014charter your circus.  "

        "Query": "How do Bucky and Jig feel about the circus in The Blue Behemoth?",
        "Summary_1": "Bucky, the owner, is of a rather idealistic opinion of the circus. He considers it great and he loves the participants as they are loyal and good. Jig is rather realistic, he knows the circus is broken and lousy, with Gertrude, the huge cansin, being the only worthy creature, though even she is old. Jig is also not that fond of many creatures, he sees them as ugly, some scary, some absurd. The state of Gertrude made Bucky cry, and soon he confessed that he actually knows that the circus is not great, but he loves it no matter what. Jig tried to be practical and asked Gow to snap Gertrude out of this state for the good of the circus. Nevertheless, even Jig was touched by the creature's appearance and gaze full of grief, her screams made him tremble. The Nahali woman, claiming to smell death, made Jig feel anxious and scared. Throughout the story Jig keeps feeling uneasy around the creatures and tries to avoid them, limiting the interactions to business. Bucky, at the same time, sympathizes with them and tries to get closer. ",
        "Summary_2": "Bucky and Jig's attitudes towards the cirsus are very different. Jig thinks over the circus as a dump. It is merely a means of staying afloat financially for him. The things of the performers as uncivilised, unintelligent and below him. He looks down upon their superstitions and beliefs. He hates the beasts that are used in the circus, as they somehow make him feel less human. He hates that the circus itself is run down, as they are broke. \nBucky on the other hand loves the circus. He thinks of the performers as family. It is his pride and joy and he is willing to fight anyone who says otherwise, including Jig. He checks up on Gertrude, clearly showing his affection for her. He knows that the circus is run down, but he loves it still. It's like his child. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Jig shouts at Bucky that he knows the circus is in a lousy and mangy state where nothing is working. He is not satisfied with the circus and believes that it \u201cstinks\u201d. Bucky also states that he does not believe the circus is doing well, though he is not happy when Jig agrees with these assertions enthusiastically. Gertrude is a member of their circus and they describe her as temperamental. While they do not believe the circus is doing well, they feel loyal to the members of their circus. Bucky relates to Jig that he is happy they have been loyal to him and he wants to reward them for that. Bucky loves the circus no matter how ugly or no good the members appear or act. ",
        "Summary_4": "Bucky and Jig have a soft spot for their circus, having run it for eleven years. Jig is aware of the state of the circus, with Bucky in slight denial but eventually accepting its condition. What once was the Greatest Show in Space has become a broken, unappealing attraction. However, due to the amount of time that Bucky and Jig have devoted to the circus, it is their only source of purpose and income. Despite the unhopeful state of the circus, they both try to remain optimistic about improving it, leading to their contract with Beamish and their concern over Gertrude. ",

I had plenty of time to think how I only weigh one-thirty-seven toShannon's one-seventy-five, and how I'm not as young as I used to be.     I said, Bucky. Hold on, fella. I....     Somebody said, Excuse me, gentlemen. Is one of you Mister BuckhalterShannon?     Shannon put his hands down on his belt. He closed his eyes and smiledpleasantly and said, very gently:     Would you be collecting for the feed bill, or the fuel?     I shot a glance at the newcomer. He'd saved me from a beating, even ifhe was a lousy bill-collecter; and I felt sorry for him. Bucky Shannonsettled his shoulders and hips like a dancer.     The stranger was a little guy. He even made me look big. He was dressedin dark-green synthesilk, very conservative. There was a powdering ofgrey in his hair and his skin was pink, soft, and shaved painfullyclean. He had the kind of a face that nice maiden-ladies will trustwith their last dime. I looked for his strong-arm squad.     There didn't seem to be any. The little guy looked at Shannon with paleblue eyes like a baby, and his voice was softer than Bucky's.     He said, I don't think you understand.     I felt cold, suddenly, between the shoulders. Somebody scraped a chairback. It sounded like he'd ripped the floor open, it was so quiet. Igot my brassies on, and my hands were sweating. Bucky Shannon sighed,and let his fist start traveling, a long, deceptive arc.     Then I saw what the little guy was holding in his hand.     I yelled and knocked the table over into Bucky. It made a lot of noise.It knocked him sideways and down, and the little dark men jumped up,quivering and showing their teeth. The Martian girl screamed.     Bucky heaved the table off his lap and cursed me. What's eating you,Jig? I'm not going to hurt him.     Shut up, I said. Look what he's got there. Money!     The little guy looked at me. He hadn't turned a hair. Yes, he said.Money. Quite a lot of it. Would you gentlemen permit me to join you?     Bucky Shannon got up. He grinned his pleasantest grin. Delighted. I'mShannon. This is Jig Bentley, my business manager. He looked down atthe table. I'm sorry about that. Mistaken identity.     The little guy smiled. He did it with his lips. The rest of his facestayed placid and babyish, almost transparent. I realized with a startthat it wasn't transparent at all. It was the most complete dead-pan Iever met, and you couldn't see into those innocent blue eyes any morethan you could see through sheet metal.     I didn't like him. I didn't like him at all. But he had money. I said,Howdy. Let's go find a booth. These Marshies make me nervous, lookinglike hungry cats at a mouse-hole.     The little guy nodded. Excellent idea. My name is Beamish. SimonBeamish. I wish to\u2014ah\u2014charter your circus.   <doc-sep> But they didn't quiet down. Not really. They were uneasy. You can feelthem inside you when they're uneasy. I think that's why I'm scared ofthem. They make me feel like I'm not human as I thought\u2014like I wantedto put my back-hair up and snarl. Yeah. They were uneasy that night,all of a sudden....     Gow glared at us as we came up into the lantern light. She's gettin'worse, he said. She's lonesome.     That's tough, said Bucky Shannon. His grey-green eyes looked like anowl's. He swayed slightly. That's sure tough. He sniffled.     I looked at Gertrude. Her cage is the biggest and strongest in the tankand even so she looked as though she could break it open just taking adeep breath. I don't know if you've ever seen a      cansin     . There's onlytwo of them on the Triangle. If you haven't, nothing I can say willmake much difference.     They're what the brain gang calls an end of evolution. Seems oldDame Nature had an idea that didn't jell. The      cansins     were prettysuccessful for a while, it seems, but something gummed up the works andnow there's only a few left, way in the deep-swamp country, where eventhe Venusians hardly ever go. Living fossils.     I wouldn't know, of course, but Gertrude looks to me like she got stucksome place between a dinosaur and a grizzly bear, with maybe a littlebird blood thrown in. Anyway, she's big.     I couldn't help feeling sorry for her. She was crouched in the cagewith her hands\u2014yeah, hands\u2014hanging over her knees and her snaky headsunk into her shoulders, looking out. Just looking. Not at anything.Her eyes were way back in deep horny pits, like cold green fire.     The lantern light was yellow on her blue-black skin, but it made themane, or crest, of coarse wide scales that ran from between her eyesclear down to her flat, short tail, burn all colors. She looked likeold Mother Misery herself, from way back before time began.     Gow said softly, She wants a mate. And somebody better get her one.     Bucky Shannon sniffled again. I said irritably, Be reasonable, Gow!Nobody's ever seen a male      cansin     . There may not even be any.     Gertrude screamed again. She didn't move, not even to raise her head.The sadness just built up inside her until it had to come out. Thatclose, the screech was deafening, and it turned me all limp and coldinside. The loneliness, the sheer stark, simple pain....     Bucky Shannon began to cry. I snarled, You'll have to snap her out ofthis, Gow. She's driving the rest of 'em nuts.     He hammered on his gong, and things quieted down again. Gow stoodlooking out over the tank, sniffing a little, like a hound. Then heturned to Gertrude.     I saved her life, he said. When we bought her out of Hanak's wreckand everybody thought she was too hurt to live, I saved her. I knowher. I can do things with her. But this time....     He shrugged. He was huge and tough and ugly, and his voice was like awoman's talking about a sick child.     This time, he said, I ain't sure.     Well for Pete's sake, do what you can. We got a charter, and we needher. I took Shannon's arm. Come to bed, Bucky darlin'.     He draped himself over my shoulder and we went off. Gow didn't look atus. Bucky sobbed.     You were right, Jig, he mumbled. Circus is no good. I know it. Butit's all I got. I love it, Jig. Unnerstan' me? Like Gow there withGertrude. She's ugly and no good, but he loves her. I love....     Sure, sure, I told him. Stop crying down my neck.     We were a long way from the light, then. The cages and tanks loomedhigh and black over us. It was still. The secret, uneasy motion allaround us and the scruffing of our feet only made it stiller.     Bucky was almost asleep on me. I started to slap him. And then the mistrose up out of the darkness in little lazy coils, sparkling faintlywith blue, cold fire.     I yelled, Gow! Gow, the Vapor snakes! Gow\u2014for God's sake!     I started to run, back along the passageway. Bucky weighed on me, limpand heavy. The noise burst suddenly in a deafening hell of moans androars and shrieks, packed in tight by the metal walls, and above it allI could hear Gertrude's lonely, whistling scream.     I thought,       Somebody's down here. Somebody let 'em out. Somebody wantsto kill us!      I tried to yell again. It strangled in my throat. Isobbed, and the sweat was thick and cold on me.     One of Bucky's dragging, stumbling feet got between mine. We fell. Irolled on top of him, covering his face, and buried my own face in thehollow of his shoulder.     The first snake touched me. It was like a live wire, sliding along theback of my neck. I screamed. It came down along my cheek, hunting mymouth. There were more of them, burning me through my clothes.     Bucky moaned and kicked under me. I remember hanging on and thinking,This is it. This is it, and oh God, I'm scared!     Then I went out.      II     Kanza the Martian croaker, was bending over me when I woke up. Hislittle brown face was crinkled with laughter. He'd lost most of histeeth, and he gummed      thak     -weed. It smelt.     You pretty, Mis' Jig, he giggled. You funny like hell.     He slapped some cold greasy stuff on my face. It hurt. I cursed him andsaid, Where's Shannon? How is he?     Mis' Bucky okay. You save life. You big hero, Mis' Jig. Mis' Gow comenickuhtime get snakes. You hero. Haw! You funny like hell!     I said, Yeah, and pushed him away and got up. I almost fell downa couple of times, but presently I made it to the mirror over thewashstand\u2014I was in my own cell\u2014and I saw what Kanza meant. The damnedsnakes had done a good job. I looked like I was upholstered in Scotchplaid. I felt sick.     Bucky Shannon opened the door. He looked white and grim, and there wasa big burn across his neck. He said:     Beamish is here with his lawyer.     I picked up my shirt. Right with you.     Kanza went out, still giggling. Bucky closed the door.     Jig, he said, those vapor worms were all right when we went in.Somebody followed us down and let them out. On purpose.     I hurt all over. I growled, With that brain, son, you should go far.Nobody saw anything, of course? Bucky shook his head.     Question is, Jig, who wants to kill us, and why?     Beamish. He realizes he's been gypped.     One hundred U.C.'s, said Bucky softly, for a few lousy swampedgemining camps. It stinks, Jig. You think we should back out?     I shrugged. You're the boss man. I'm only the guy that beats off thecreditors.     Yeah, Bucky said reflectively. And I hear starvation isn't acomfortable death. Okay, Jig. Let's go sign. He put his hand on thelatch and looked at my feet. And\u2014uh\u2014Jig, I....     I said, Skip it. The next time, just don't trip me up, that's all!     We had a nasty trip to Venus. Gertrude kept the brute tank on edge,and Gow, on the rare occasions he came up for air, went around lookinglike a disaster hoping to happen. To make it worse, Zurt the Jovianstrong-man got hurt during the take-off, and the Mercurian cave-cat hadkittens.     Nobody would have minded that, only one of 'em had only four legs. Itlived just long enough to scare that bunch of superstitious dopes outof their pants. Circus people are funny that way.     Shannon and I did a little quiet sleuthing, but it was a waste of time.Anybody in the gang might have let those electric worms out on us. Itdidn't help any to know that somebody, maybe the guy next to you atdinner, was busy thinking ways to kill you. By the time we hit Venus, Iwas ready to do a Brodie out the refuse chute.     Shannon set the crate down on the edge of Nahru, the first stop on ouritinerary. I stood beside him, looking out the ports at the scenery. Itwas Venus, all right. Blue mud and thick green jungle and rain, and abunch of ratty-looking plastic shacks huddling together in the middleof it. Men in slickers were coming out for a look.     I saw Beamish's sleek yacht parked on a cradle over to the left, andour router's runabout beside it. Bucky Shannon groaned.     A blue one, Jig. A morgue if I ever saw one!     I snarled, What do you want, with this lousy dog-and-pony show! andwent out. He followed. The gang was converging on the lock, but theyweren't happy. You get so you can feel those things. The steamy Venusheat was already sneaking into the ship.     While we passed the hatchway to the brute tank, I could hear Gertrude,screaming.   <doc-sep> It was pretty late when we got back to the broken-down spaceport whereShannon's Imperial Circus was crouching beneath its attachments. Lateas it was, they were waiting for us. About twenty of them, sittingaround and smoking and looking very ugly.     It was awfully lonesome out there, with the desert cold and restlessunder the two moons. There's a smell to Mars, like something dead anddried long past decay, but still waiting. An unhappy smell. The blownred dust gritted in my teeth.     Bucky Shannon walked out into the glare of the light at the entrance tothe roped-off space around the main lock. He was pretty steady on hisfeet. He waved and said, Hiya, boys.     They got up off the steps, and the packing cases, and came toward us. Igrinned and got into my brassies. We felt we owed those boys a lot morethan money. It grates on a man's pride to have to sneak in and out ofhis own property through the sewage lock. This was the first time inweeks we'd come in at the front door.     I waved the money in their faces. That stopped them. Very solemnly,Bucky and I checked the bills, paid them, and pocketed the receipts.Bucky yawned and stretched sleepily.     Now? he said.     Now, I said.     We had a lot of fun. Some of the boys inside the ship came out to joinin. We raised a lot of dust and nobody got killed, quite. We all wenthome happy. They had their money, and we had their blood.     The news was all over the ship before we got inside. The freaks and thegreen girl from Tethys who could roll herself like a hoop, and Zurt themuscle man from Jupiter, and all the other assorted geeks and kinkersand joeys that make up the usual corny carnie were doing nip-ups in thepassageways and drooling over the thought of steer and toppings.     Bucky Shannon regarded them possessively, wiping blood from his nose.They're good guys, Jig. Swell people. They stuck by me, and I'verewarded them.     I said, Sure, rather sourly. Bucky hiccoughed.     Let's go see Gertrude.     I didn't want to see Gertrude. I never got over feeling funny goinginto the brute tank, especially at night or out in space. I'm a cityguy, myself. The smell and sound of wildness gives me goose bumps. ButBucky was looking stubborn, so I shrugged.     Okay. But just for a minute. Then we go beddy-bye.     You're a pal, Jif. Bes' li'l' guy inna worl'....     The fight had just put the topper on him. I was afraid he'd fall downthe ladder and break his neck. That's why I went along. If I hadn't....Oh, well, what's a few nightmares among friends?     It was dark down there in the tank. Way off at the other end, there wasa dim glow. Gow was evidently holding Gertrude's hand. We started downthe long passageway between the rows of cages and glassed-in tanks andcompression units.     Our footsteps sounded loud and empty on the iron floor. I wasn'tnear as happy as Shannon, and my skin began to crawl a little. It'sthe smell, I think; rank and sour and wild. And the sound of them,breathing and rustling in the dark, with the patient hatred walledaround them as strong as the cage bars.     Bucky Shannon lurched against me suddenly. I choked back a yell, andthen wiped the sweat off my forehead and cursed. The scream came again.A high, ragged, whistling screech like nothing this side of hell,ripping through the musty darkness. Gertrude, on the wailing wall.     It had been quiet. Now every brute in the place let go at the sametime. My stomach turned clear over. I called Gertrude every name Icould think of, and I couldn't hear myself doing it. Presently a greatmetallic clash nearly burst my eardrums, and the beasts shut up. Gowhad them nicely conditioned to that gong.  "

        "Query": "How does Jig's character evolve in The Blue Behemoth?",
        "Summary_1": "Jig argues with Bucky, the owner of the circus, whose director is the former. Jig is drunk and is careless enough to insult the circus. He almost gets beaten when a stranger interferes. Jig feels pity towards his savior at first, but then he sees a sum of money in the man\u2019s hands. Jig stops Bucky and the three of them begin to discuss business. Jig tries to show off the circus and asks for more money than it\u2019s worth. He is suspicious of the man, but they make a deal. Then, Jig goes together with Bucky to pay the members of the gang and they have fun. After that, the two friends go to check on Gertrude, the main attraction. The creature\u2019s depressing appearance makes Jig feel uneasy and pitiful, he has to carry Bucky, who is crying and falling asleep, away from the cage. Then both are attacked by Vapor snakes and Jig appears a hero by covering Bucky. He finds himself bitten all over and looking ridiculous, but at least alive. He encounters Bucky and they try to learn who wanted to kill them both. Then they go to Venus to meet Beamish, Jig feels the gang\u2019s unhappiness with the travel, and he feels uneasy himself. The Nahali woman and her death predictions make him even more scared. Then they meet Sam who used to hunt animals for their circus, his terrible appearance makes Jig feel sick. Then together with Bucky, he tries to help the hunter by asking questions in the nearby bar. Jig feels even more scared and sick when Sam starts choking and his mouth gets blue. Jig wants to rush for a doctor, but finds Beamish listening behind the curtain. When Sam dies, Jig starts understanding and suspecting something, he talks to the bartender and suddenly recognizes the man who gave a cigarette to Sam.\n",
        "Summary_2": "We hear the story from Jig\u2019s perspective. We first meet Jig when he is talking with Bucky. He insults the circus to Bucky, and just as Bucky goes to give Jig a beating, they are met by Beamish. Jig tells Beamish that they will charter out their circus to him for 100 U.C's. Jig is really pushing his luck with this offer, ready to haggle, but Beamish agrees on the fee. When Bucky tries to take the money as soon as they get it, Beamish has to take it from him, giving it to the various men waiting outside to be paid. He and Bucky get into a fight with the men for having not played them in so long. Eventually, they all go home. He agrees to go see Gertrude with Bucky, which he hates. He looks at Gertrude, and can't help feeling sorry for her. He tries to carry Bucky back to their cells but they get attacked on the way. He awakens to Kanza the Martian Croaker. He talks briefly with Kanza before finding Bucky. They discuss who might've tried to assassinate them. They soon make the journey to Venus, where he is told by Ahra the Nahali woman that something has been taken from Venus, and death is coming. He sees Sam Kepper, and runs over to him when he falls. He brings him into the bar where Sam tells Jig that he has found a male cansin, and that Jig must return it to the wild for him. He walks over to the bar, where he talks with the bartender, and then turns around to see the man who gave Kepper the cigarette. ",
        "Summary_3": "Jig is Bucky Shannon\u2019s business manager and he is not always treated well by Bucky. Bucky likes to threaten Jig physically with violence. At the beginning of the story, Jig negotiates with Beamish about the terms of a contract for chartering Bucky\u2019s circus. He is able to secure a high paycheck for himself and Bucky. After the meeting and when they receive the money, Jig goes to pay the members of the circus. \n\nWhile on the spaceport, Jig reluctantly goes with Bucky to see Gertrude who is in severe distress. Somehow, the vapor snakes are let out and they are coming after Jig and Bucky. Jig tries to run away to safety but he is tripped and pinned down by Bucky. This allows the vapor snakes to come and attack him which burn him through his clothes. He passes out due to this incident and wakes up in a cell with many injuries. \n\nLater, while on the planet Venus, Jig and Bucky run into Sam Kapper, someone they recognize. Sam tries to excitedly tell the two that there is a male cansin before he passes out and is perceived to be dead. Jig goes to pull back the curtains in the small area that they have been talking to Sam and finds Beamish hiding behind the curtains. He pulls the curtain back defiantly and walks to the bar to order a drink. During this walk, he notices that the audience for this situation is unusual. They looked out of place for the location and the setting. When he orders a drink and makes polite conversation, he sees a man that he had encountered earlier and realizes that he remember the man. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Jig works with Bucky to run Shannon's Imperial Circus. At the beginning of this story, he talks with Bucky about his pessimism toward the circus and how hopeless the prospect is. He then meets Beamish, who offers to work with Bucky on conducting a Venusian tour of their circus. Jig decides to manipulate Beamish into thinking that the circus is more successful than it actually is, and manages to negotiate a large sum of one hundred U.C's ahead of the contract. Later that day, Jig returns to the circus with Bucky, where they pay men at the entrance before fighting them. Jig then sees Gertrude and heads to bed, where he is attacked by loose Vapor snakes. The next day, the contract is officially signed, and Jig travels to Venus, where he meets Sam Kapper at his first stop. ",

I don't know if you've ever seen a      cansin     . There's onlytwo of them on the Triangle. If you haven't, nothing I can say willmake much difference.     They're what the brain gang calls an end of evolution. Seems oldDame Nature had an idea that didn't jell. The      cansins     were prettysuccessful for a while, it seems, but something gummed up the works andnow there's only a few left, way in the deep-swamp country, where eventhe Venusians hardly ever go. Living fossils.     I wouldn't know, of course, but Gertrude looks to me like she got stucksome place between a dinosaur and a grizzly bear, with maybe a littlebird blood thrown in. Anyway, she's big.     I couldn't help feeling sorry for her. She was crouched in the cagewith her hands\u2014yeah, hands\u2014hanging over her knees and her snaky headsunk into her shoulders, looking out. Just looking. Not at anything.Her eyes were way back in deep horny pits, like cold green fire.     The lantern light was yellow on her blue-black skin, but it made themane, or crest, of coarse wide scales that ran from between her eyesclear down to her flat, short tail, burn all colors. She looked likeold Mother Misery herself, from way back before time began.     Gow said softly, She wants a mate. And somebody better get her one.     Bucky Shannon sniffled again. I said irritably, Be reasonable, Gow!Nobody's ever seen a male      cansin     . There may not even be any.     Gertrude screamed again. She didn't move, not even to raise her head.The sadness just built up inside her until it had to come out. Thatclose, the screech was deafening, and it turned me all limp and coldinside. The loneliness, the sheer stark, simple pain....     Bucky Shannon began to cry. I snarled, You'll have to snap her out ofthis, Gow. She's driving the rest of 'em nuts.     He hammered on his gong, and things quieted down again. Gow stoodlooking out over the tank, sniffing a little, like a hound. Then heturned to Gertrude.     I saved her life, he said. When we bought her out of Hanak's wreckand everybody thought she was too hurt to live, I saved her. I knowher. I can do things with her. But this time....     He shrugged. He was huge and tough and ugly, and his voice was like awoman's talking about a sick child.     This time, he said, I ain't sure.     Well for Pete's sake, do what you can. We got a charter, and we needher. I took Shannon's arm. Come to bed, Bucky darlin'.     He draped himself over my shoulder and we went off. Gow didn't look atus. Bucky sobbed.     You were right, Jig, he mumbled. Circus is no good. I know it. Butit's all I got. I love it, Jig. Unnerstan' me? Like Gow there withGertrude. She's ugly and no good, but he loves her. I love....     Sure, sure, I told him. Stop crying down my neck.     We were a long way from the light, then. The cages and tanks loomedhigh and black over us. It was still. The secret, uneasy motion allaround us and the scruffing of our feet only made it stiller.     Bucky was almost asleep on me. I started to slap him. And then the mistrose up out of the darkness in little lazy coils, sparkling faintlywith blue, cold fire.     I yelled, Gow! Gow, the Vapor snakes! Gow\u2014for God's sake!     I started to run, back along the passageway. Bucky weighed on me, limpand heavy. The noise burst suddenly in a deafening hell of moans androars and shrieks, packed in tight by the metal walls, and above it allI could hear Gertrude's lonely, whistling scream.     I thought,       Somebody's down here. Somebody let 'em out. Somebody wantsto kill us!      I tried to yell again. It strangled in my throat. Isobbed, and the sweat was thick and cold on me.     One of Bucky's dragging, stumbling feet got between mine. We fell. Irolled on top of him, covering his face, and buried my own face in thehollow of his shoulder.     The first snake touched me. It was like a live wire, sliding along theback of my neck. I screamed. It came down along my cheek, hunting mymouth. There were more of them, burning me through my clothes.     Bucky moaned and kicked under me. I remember hanging on and thinking,This is it. This is it, and oh God, I'm scared!     Then I went out.      II     Kanza the Martian croaker, was bending over me when I woke up. Hislittle brown face was crinkled with laughter. He'd lost most of histeeth, and he gummed      thak     -weed. It smelt.     You pretty, Mis' Jig, he giggled. You funny like hell.     He slapped some cold greasy stuff on my face. It hurt. I cursed him andsaid, Where's Shannon? How is he?     Mis' Bucky okay. You save life. You big hero, Mis' Jig. Mis' Gow comenickuhtime get snakes. You hero. Haw! You funny like hell!     I said, Yeah, and pushed him away and got up. I almost fell downa couple of times, but presently I made it to the mirror over thewashstand\u2014I was in my own cell\u2014and I saw what Kanza meant. The damnedsnakes had done a good job. I looked like I was upholstered in Scotchplaid. I felt sick.     Bucky Shannon opened the door. He looked white and grim, and there wasa big burn across his neck. He said:     Beamish is here with his lawyer.     I picked up my shirt. Right with you.     Kanza went out, still giggling. Bucky closed the door.     Jig, he said, those vapor worms were all right when we went in.Somebody followed us down and let them out. On purpose.     I hurt all over. I growled, With that brain, son, you should go far.Nobody saw anything, of course? Bucky shook his head.     Question is, Jig, who wants to kill us, and why?     Beamish. He realizes he's been gypped.     One hundred U.C.'s, said Bucky softly, for a few lousy swampedgemining camps. It stinks, Jig. You think we should back out?     I shrugged. You're the boss man. I'm only the guy that beats off thecreditors.     Yeah, Bucky said reflectively. And I hear starvation isn't acomfortable death. Okay, Jig. Let's go sign. He put his hand on thelatch and looked at my feet. And\u2014uh\u2014Jig, I....     I said, Skip it. The next time, just don't trip me up, that's all!     We had a nasty trip to Venus. Gertrude kept the brute tank on edge,and Gow, on the rare occasions he came up for air, went around lookinglike a disaster hoping to happen. To make it worse, Zurt the Jovianstrong-man got hurt during the take-off, and the Mercurian cave-cat hadkittens.     Nobody would have minded that, only one of 'em had only four legs. Itlived just long enough to scare that bunch of superstitious dopes outof their pants. Circus people are funny that way.     Shannon and I did a little quiet sleuthing, but it was a waste of time.Anybody in the gang might have let those electric worms out on us. Itdidn't help any to know that somebody, maybe the guy next to you atdinner, was busy thinking ways to kill you. By the time we hit Venus, Iwas ready to do a Brodie out the refuse chute.     Shannon set the crate down on the edge of Nahru, the first stop on ouritinerary. I stood beside him, looking out the ports at the scenery. Itwas Venus, all right. Blue mud and thick green jungle and rain, and abunch of ratty-looking plastic shacks huddling together in the middleof it. Men in slickers were coming out for a look.     I saw Beamish's sleek yacht parked on a cradle over to the left, andour router's runabout beside it. Bucky Shannon groaned.     A blue one, Jig. A morgue if I ever saw one!     I snarled, What do you want, with this lousy dog-and-pony show! andwent out. He followed. The gang was converging on the lock, but theyweren't happy. You get so you can feel those things. The steamy Venusheat was already sneaking into the ship.     While we passed the hatchway to the brute tank, I could hear Gertrude,screaming.   <doc-sep> She inclined the lethal silver toy. Let me see those papers, Kevin.     I handed her the doctor's manuscript.     Her breath escaped slowly and loudly. It's all right. It's all right.It exists. It's real. Not even one of the unwritten ones. I've readthis myself.     Doc was lying on the cot, half his face twisted into horror.     Don't move, Kevin, she said. I'll have to shoot you\u2014maybe not tokill, but painfully.     I watched her face flash blue, red, blue and knew she meant it. But Ihad known too much in too short a time. I had to help Doc, but therewas something else.     I just want a drink of coffee from that container on the chair, Itold her.     She shook her head. I don't know what you think it does to you.     It was getting hard for me to think. Who are you?     She showed me a card from her wrist purse. Vivian Casey, Constable,North American Mounted Police.     I had to help Doc. I had to have some coffee. What do you want?     Listen, Kevin. Listen carefully to what I am saying. Doc founda method of time travel. It was almost a purely mathematical,topographical way divorced from modern physical sciences. He kept itsecret and he wanted to make money with it. He was an idealist\u2014he hadhis crusades. How can you make money with time travel?     I didn't know whether she was asking me, but I didn't know. All I knewwas that I had to help Doc and get some coffee.     It takes money\u2014money Doc didn't have\u2014to make money, Miss Caseysaid, even if you know what horse will come in and what stock willprosper. Besides, horse-racing and the stock market weren't a part ofDoc's character. He was a scholar.     Why did she keep using the past tense in reference to Doc? It scaredme. He was lying so still with the left side of his face so twisted. Ineeded some coffee.     He became a book finder. He got rare editions of books and magazinesfor his clients in absolutely mint condition. That was all right\u2014untilhe started obtaining books that      did not exist     .  "

        "Query": "What role does Beamish play in the story of Jig and Bucky's encounter with the Blue Behemoth?",
        "Summary_1": "The first encounter between Beamish and the two occurred when Jig and Bucky were at the point of a fight. Beamish prevented them from this unnecessary action, and soon he saved the circus. The circus was broke, the performers were discontent with not getting their bills, the construction was loose, etc. There would be no tour and existence of the circus overall without this encounter. Being able to pay the gang, Jig and Bucky could show up without being afraid or ashamed to show up in their circus and keep doing business. This encounter was also somehow connected with the attempt to kill the two by letting the vapor snakes out. The trip to Venus in the end was also caused by this encounter, as it was the place where Beamish awaited for his partners and the gang. Therefore, he was somehow connected with them meeting Sam, a hunter supplying animals for the circus, and his eventual weird death. Beamish listening to their dialogue and overall investing in a broke circus creates a suspicion of his actions having some hidden reason. Together with the unhappiness of the gang and one creature smelling death, Beamish's unclear intentions seem scheming and threatening, adding to the intrigue of the whole story. ",
        "Summary_2": "The meeting of Jig, Bucky and Beamish is very significant in the story. When we meet Jig and Bucky, they are in deep financial trouble. They have absolutely no money at all. When they are approached by Beamish, Jig can tell that there's something strange about him. He seems to have no emotion at all in his face. Beamish offers to charter out their circus for 100 U.C's. It's unclear where Beamish's money comes from. Because they get the money, the duo are finally able to pay back the men that they have been avoiding for weeks. They take the ship to Venus, where they hope this trip will help them escape financial ruin. Because they are in Venus, they are able to meet Kepper, who tells them about the stolen cansin. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Beamish\u2019s entrance was a welcome interruption to Jig because it distracted and stopped Bucky from hitting him. Beamish is wanting to offer Bucky and Jig money to charter their circus for a tour of different settlements along the Tehara Belt. They would have never gone to Venus if not by the order of Beamish and thus they never would have met up with Sam as they did in the story. It is significant that they meet Beamish because according to the same Beamish is a male cansin and previously Bucky and Jig did not believe they existed anymore. ",
        "Summary_4": "Beamish gives Jig and Bucky a new opportunity for their circus. Before meeting Beamish, they were out of luck, their circus in lousy condition and no money to live off of or improve their attraction. However, when Beamish comes into the picture, they are offered a new chance to showcase their circus. Though the offer is a bit shady and not completely promising, Bucky and Jig prefer it over their current situation. Taking up Beamish's offer leads Bucky and Jig to a new tour on Venus.",
        "Article": "   The Blue Behemoth     By LEIGH BRACKETT     Shannon's Imperial Circus was a jinxed     space-carny leased for a mysterious tour     of the inner worlds. It made a one-night     pitch on a Venusian swamp-town\u2014to     find that death stalked it from the     jungle in a tiny ball of flame.     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Planet Stories May 1943.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      Bucky Shannon leaned forward across the little hexagonal table. Heknocked over the pitcher of      thil     , but it didn't matter. The pitcherwas empty. He jabbed me in the breastbone with his forefinger, notvery hard. Not hard enough to jar the ribs clean loose, just enough tospring them.     We, he said, are broke. We are finished, through. Washed up anddown the drain. He added, as an afterthought, Destitute.     I looked at him. I said sourly, You're kidding!     Kidding. Shannon put his elbows on the table and peered at me througha curtain of very blond hair that was trying hard to be red. He saysI'm kidding! With Shannon's Imperial Circus, the Greatest Show inSpace, plastered so thick with attachments....     It's no more plastered than you are. I was sore because he'd been alot quicker grabbing the pitcher. The Greatest Show in Space. Phooey!I've wet-nursed Shannon's Imperial Circus around the Triangle foreleven years, and I know. It's lousy, it's mangy, it's broken-down!Nothing works, from the ship to the roustabouts. In short, it stinks!     I must have had the pitcher oftener than I thought. Nobody insultsBuckhalter Shannon's Imperial Circus to Buckhalter Shannon's faceunless he's tired and wants a long rest in a comfy fracture-frame.     Shannon got up. He got up slowly. I had plenty of time to see hisgrey-green eyes get sleepy, and hear the quarter-Earth-blood Martiangirl wailing about love over by the battered piano, and watch theslanting cat-eyes of the little dark people at the tables swing roundtoward us, pleased and kind of hungry.     I had plenty of time to think how I only weigh one-thirty-seven toShannon's one-seventy-five, and how I'm not as young as I used to be.     I said, Bucky. Hold on, fella. I....     Somebody said, Excuse me, gentlemen. Is one of you Mister BuckhalterShannon?     Shannon put his hands down on his belt. He closed his eyes and smiledpleasantly and said, very gently:     Would you be collecting for the feed bill, or the fuel?     I shot a glance at the newcomer. He'd saved me from a beating, even ifhe was a lousy bill-collecter; and I felt sorry for him. Bucky Shannonsettled his shoulders and hips like a dancer.     The stranger was a little guy. He even made me look big. He was dressedin dark-green synthesilk, very conservative. There was a powdering ofgrey in his hair and his skin was pink, soft, and shaved painfullyclean. He had the kind of a face that nice maiden-ladies will trustwith their last dime. I looked for his strong-arm squad.     There didn't seem to be any. The little guy looked at Shannon with paleblue eyes like a baby, and his voice was softer than Bucky's.     He said, I don't think you understand.     I felt cold, suddenly, between the shoulders. Somebody scraped a chairback. It sounded like he'd ripped the floor open, it was so quiet. Igot my brassies on, and my hands were sweating. Bucky Shannon sighed,and let his fist start traveling, a long, deceptive arc.     Then I saw what the little guy was holding in his hand.     I yelled and knocked the table over into Bucky. It made a lot of noise.It knocked him sideways and down, and the little dark men jumped up,quivering and showing their teeth. The Martian girl screamed.     Bucky heaved the table off his lap and cursed me. What's eating you,Jig? I'm not going to hurt him.     Shut up, I said. Look what he's got there. Money!     The little guy looked at me. He hadn't turned a hair. Yes, he said.Money. Quite a lot of it. Would you gentlemen permit me to join you?     Bucky Shannon got up. He grinned his pleasantest grin. Delighted. I'mShannon. This is Jig Bentley, my business manager. He looked down atthe table. I'm sorry about that. Mistaken identity.     The little guy smiled. He did it with his lips. The rest of his facestayed placid and babyish, almost transparent. I realized with a startthat it wasn't transparent at all. It was the most complete dead-pan Iever met, and you couldn't see into those innocent blue eyes any morethan you could see through sheet metal.     I didn't like him. I didn't like him at all. But he had money. I said,Howdy. Let's go find a booth. These Marshies make me nervous, lookinglike hungry cats at a mouse-hole.     The little guy nodded. Excellent idea. My name is Beamish. SimonBeamish. I wish to\u2014ah\u2014charter your circus.   <doc-sep> But they didn't quiet down. Not really. They were uneasy. You can feelthem inside you when they're uneasy. I think that's why I'm scared ofthem. They make me feel like I'm not human as I thought\u2014like I wantedto put my back-hair up and snarl. Yeah. They were uneasy that night,all of a sudden....     Gow glared at us as we came up into the lantern light. She's gettin'worse, he said. She's lonesome.     That's tough, said Bucky Shannon. His grey-green eyes looked like anowl's. He swayed slightly.

He hadn't shaved. The lean hard linesof his face had gone slack and his eyes were bloodshot. He was coveredwith mud, and his mouth twitched like a sick old man's.     He said thickly, I found it. I said I'd do it, and I did. I found itand brought it out.     The cigarette stub fell out of his mouth. He didn't notice it. Helpme, he said simply. I'm scared. His mouth drooled.     I got it hidden. They want to find out, but I won't tell 'em. It'sgot to go back. Back where I found it. I tried to take it, but theywouldn't let me, and I was afraid they'd find it....     He reached suddenly and grabbed the edge of the table. I don't knowhow they found out about it, but they did. I've got to get it back.I've got to....     Bucky looked at me. Kapper was blue around the mouth. I was scared,suddenly. I said, Get what back where?     Bucky got up. I'll get a doctor, he said. Stick with him. Kappergrabbed his wrist. Kapper's nails were blue and the cords in his handsstood out like guy wires.     Don't leave me. Got to tell you\u2014where it is. Got to take it back.Promise you'll take it back. He gasped and struggled over hisbreathing.     Sure, said Bucky. Sure, well take it back. What is it?     Kapper's face was horrible. I felt sick, listening to him fight forair. I wanted to go for a doctor anyway, but somehow I knew it was nouse. Kapper whispered,           Cansin     . Male. Only one. You don't know...! Take him back.     Where is it, Sam?     I reached across Bucky suddenly and jerked the curtain back. Beamishwas standing there. Beamish, bent over, with his ear cocked. Kappermade a harsh strangling noise and fell across the table.     Beamish never changed expression. He didn't move while Bucky feltKapper's pulse. Bucky didn't need to say anything. We knew.     Heart? said Beamish finally.     Yeah, said Bucky. He looked as bad as I felt. Poor Sam.     I looked at the cigarette stub smoldering on the table. I looked atBeamish with his round dead baby face. I climbed over Shannon andpushed Beamish suddenly down into his lap.     Keep this guy here till I get back, I said.     Shannon stared at me. Beamish started to get indignant. Shut up, Itold him. We got a contract. I yanked the curtains shut and walkedover to the bar.     I began to notice something, then. There were quite a lot of men in theplace. At first glance they looked okay\u2014a hard-faced, muscular bunchof miners in dirty shirts and high boots.     Then I looked at their hands. They were dirty enough. But they neverdid any work in a mine, on Venus or anywhere else.     The place was awfully quiet, for that kind of a place. The bartenderwas a big pot-bellied swamp-edger with pale eyes and thick white haircoiled up on top of his bullet head. He was not happy.     I leaned on the bar.       Lhak     , I said. He poured it, sullenly, out of agreen bottle. I reached for it, casually.     That guy we brought in, I said. He sure has a skinful. Passed outcold. What's he been spiking his drinks with?           Selak     , said a voice in my ear. As if you didn't know.     I turned. The man who had given Kapper the cigarette was standingbehind me. And I remembered him, then.  "

        "Summary_1": "The story begins in the middle of some bar or club with a girl playing piano and drinks being served. When Beamish joined them, the three moved to a booth - a quieter place there. After the conversation, Jig and Bucky go to circus. At first, they meet the whole gang, coming through the main entrance. Then they move to the tank of a huge special creature, Gertrude, which is located a bit afar. On the way back home, outside the tank, the two were attacked by snakes. They woke up in different rooms, taken care of by Kanza the Martian croaker after being bitten by snakes and brought there by Gow, a member of the circus gang. Very soon they all together with the gang set off to Venus on a space ship to meet Beamish. On Venus the gang walked towards a local bar and the story ends there. ",

That was the Doppler effect as the star'sradial velocity changed relative to the      Quest III     , as for forty hoursthe ship had decelerated.     They had seen many such stars come near out of the galaxy's glitteringbackdrop, and had seen them dwindle, turn red and go out as the      QuestIII     drove on its way once more, lashed by despair toward the speed oflight, leaving behind the mockery of yet another solitary and lifelessluminary unaccompanied by worlds where men might dwell. They had grownsated with the sight of wonders\u2014of multiple systems of giant stars, ofnebulae that sprawled in empty flame across light years.     But now unwonted excitement possessed the hundred-odd members of the      Quest III's     crew. It was a subdued excitement; men and women, theycame and stood quietly gazing into the big vision screens that showedthe oncoming star, and there were wide-eyed children who had been bornin the ship and had never seen a planet. The grownups talked in lowvoices, in tones of mingled eagerness and apprehension, of what mightlie at the long journey's end. For the      Quest III     was coming home; thesun ahead was      the     Sun, whose rays had warmed their lives' beginning.   <doc-sep> In the street the blue sun, Alpha, peered like an arc light under a lowcloud layer, casting flat shadows across the mud of the avenue.

Would that I too could lose this burden, as has the false youth webludgeoned aboard the      Moss Rock     , he sighed. Soon will I be forcedinto retirement. Then a mere keeper of a place of papers such as Iwill rate no more than a slab on the public strand, with once-dailyfeedings. And even for a man of high position, retirement is nopleasure. A slab in the Park of Monuments is little better. A dismaloutlook for one's next thousand years!     You two carry on to the police station, said Retief. I want to playa hunch. But don't take too long. I may be painfully right.     What\u2014? Magnan started.     As you wish, Retief, said Whonk.     The flat-car trundled past the gate to the shipyard and Retief jumpeddown, headed at a run for the VIP boat. The guard post still stoodvacant. The two Youths whom he and Whonk had left trussed were gone.     That's the trouble with a peaceful world, Retief muttered. No policeprotection. He stepped down from the lighted entry and took up aposition behind the sentry box. Alpha rose higher, shedding a glaringblue-white light without heat. Retief shivered. Maybe he'd guessedwrong....     There was a sound in the near distance, like two elephants colliding.     Retief looked toward the gate. His giant acquaintance, Whonk, hadreappeared and was grappling with a hardly less massive opponent. Asmall figure became visible in the melee, scuttled for the gate. Headedoff by the battling titans, he turned and made for the opposite sideof the shipyard. Retief waited, jumped out and gathered in the fleeingGroaci.     Well, Yith, he said, how's tricks? You should pardon the expression.     Release me, Retief! the pale-featured alien lisped, his throatbladder pulsating in agitation. The behemoths vie for the privilege ofdismembering me out of hand!     I know how they feel. I'll see what I can do ... for a price.     I appeal to you, Yith whispered hoarsely. As a fellow diplomat, afellow alien, a fellow soft-back\u2014     Why don't you appeal to Slock, as a fellow skunk? said Retief. Nowkeep quiet ... and you may get out of this alive.     The heavier of the two struggling Fustians threw the other to theground. There was another brief flurry, and then the smaller figure wason its back, helpless.     That's Whonk, still on his feet, said Retief. I wonder who he'scaught\u2014and why.     Whonk came toward the      Moss Rock     dragging the supine Fustian, whokicked vainly. Retief thrust Yith down well out of sight behind thesentry box. Better sit tight, Yith. Don't try to sneak off; I canoutrun you. Stay here and I'll see what I can do.

Heknocked over the pitcher of      thil     , but it didn't matter. The pitcherwas empty. He jabbed me in the breastbone with his forefinger, notvery hard. Not hard enough to jar the ribs clean loose, just enough tospring them.     We, he said, are broke. We are finished, through. Washed up anddown the drain. He added, as an afterthought, Destitute.     I looked at him. I said sourly, You're kidding!     Kidding. Shannon put his elbows on the table and peered at me througha curtain of very blond hair that was trying hard to be red. He saysI'm kidding! With Shannon's Imperial Circus, the Greatest Show inSpace, plastered so thick with attachments....     It's no more plastered than you are. I was sore because he'd been alot quicker grabbing the pitcher. The Greatest Show in Space. Phooey!I've wet-nursed Shannon's Imperial Circus around the Triangle foreleven years, and I know. It's lousy, it's mangy, it's broken-down!Nothing works, from the ship to the roustabouts. In short, it stinks!     I must have had the pitcher oftener than I thought. Nobody insultsBuckhalter Shannon's Imperial Circus to Buckhalter Shannon's faceunless he's tired and wants a long rest in a comfy fracture-frame.     Shannon got up. He got up slowly. I had plenty of time to see hisgrey-green eyes get sleepy, and hear the quarter-Earth-blood Martiangirl wailing about love over by the battered piano, and watch theslanting cat-eyes of the little dark people at the tables swing roundtoward us, pleased and kind of hungry.     I had plenty of time to think how I only weigh one-thirty-seven toShannon's one-seventy-five, and how I'm not as young as I used to be.     I said, Bucky. Hold on, fella. I....     Somebody said, Excuse me, gentlemen. Is one of you Mister BuckhalterShannon?     Shannon put his hands down on his belt. He closed his eyes and smiledpleasantly and said, very gently:     Would you be collecting for the feed bill, or the fuel?     I shot a glance at the newcomer. He'd saved me from a beating, even ifhe was a lousy bill-collecter; and I felt sorry for him. Bucky Shannonsettled his shoulders and hips like a dancer.     The stranger was a little guy. He even made me look big. He was dressedin dark-green synthesilk, very conservative. There was a powdering ofgrey in his hair and his skin was pink, soft, and shaved painfullyclean. He had the kind of a face that nice maiden-ladies will trustwith their last dime. I looked for his strong-arm squad.     There didn't seem to be any. The little guy looked at Shannon with paleblue eyes like a baby, and his voice was softer than Bucky's.     He said, I don't think you understand.     I felt cold, suddenly, between the shoulders. Somebody scraped a chairback. It sounded like he'd ripped the floor open, it was so quiet. Igot my brassies on, and my hands were sweating. Bucky Shannon sighed,and let his fist start traveling, a long, deceptive arc.     Then I saw what the little guy was holding in his hand.     I yelled and knocked the table over into Bucky. It made a lot of noise.It knocked him sideways and down, and the little dark men jumped up,quivering and showing their teeth. The Martian girl screamed.     Bucky heaved the table off his lap and cursed me. What's eating you,Jig? I'm not going to hurt him.     Shut up, I said. Look what he's got there. Money!     The little guy looked at me. He hadn't turned a hair. Yes, he said.Money. Quite a lot of it. Would you gentlemen permit me to join you?     Bucky Shannon got up. He grinned his pleasantest grin. Delighted. I'mShannon. This is Jig Bentley, my business manager. He looked down atthe table. I'm sorry about that. Mistaken identity.     The little guy smiled. He did it with his lips. The rest of his facestayed placid and babyish, almost transparent. I realized with a startthat it wasn't transparent at all. It was the most complete dead-pan Iever met, and you couldn't see into those innocent blue eyes any morethan you could see through sheet metal.     I didn't like him. I didn't like him at all.

        "Query": "Can you provide a brief summary of the storyline in SPACEMAN ON A SPREE?",
        "Summary_1": "Seymour Pond has just retired from his career as the last astronaut from the Ultrawelfare State at the age of thirty. At his going away party he is given a watch, and academics like Lifting Gubelin and Dr Hans Girarad-Perregaux speak on his behalf. Si has decided to take the money he has saved up from his time working, which most people in the Ultrawelfare state don't, and live a simple comfortable life. He intends to never work again, after his six space flights. The currency used in the state was universal, controlled by a personal credit card. Because most jobs were automated, few people had to work, so most people lived off of a set welfare, and those selected to work were given a little extra compensation. Si was one of these people. Gubelin and Perregaux are both horrified by the fact that Pond has decided to take an early retirement. He was their only pilot for their space program, and if they were to get another, it would take at least a year of training. Without a pilot, they are worried that their funding will be cut, and the space program will be shut down. They scheme together as to how to get Pond back in the space program. They think that the only way to get him back would be to make sure he was left without any money, and therefore would have no choice but to return to his former position. \nSi is planning a big night out. He has always gone and celebrated when there was a cause, and tonight, he was planning to spend at least half of all the money in his account. He gets dressed in his retirement rank suit to go out, checks his balance, and then takes his vacuum tube to New york city. Before he leaves, he books a room at a swanky hotel for the rich and famous, and after a few moments, his car transports him to his room. There is an amazing view of the city, and from his room, gets ready to go to the bar. \nAt the bar he orders a drink, before noticing a beautiful woman beside him. They get to talking and before long, she tells him she recognises him, telling him about how moved she found his whole retirement ceremony. Making it very clear she wasn't happy he was retiring. He asks why she has an interest in space, to which she replies that she always has. He begins to explain the aspects of space flight, when the right side of his mouth begins to tick, and he knocks his drink back. ",
        "Summary_2": "In the Ultrawelfare State, the kind of jobs that one does is decided through a lottery. The lottery is drawn whenever there\u2019s a need for new employees. Those that work will receive some additional Variable Basic shares to be added to their portfolios. And once their portfolios reach a certain level of Variable Basic shares, they can afford to live the life in the way they prefer. The story begins with Seymour Pond, the space pilot that has been on six trips, receiving a gold watch and a banquet from the officials including Academician Lofting Gubelin, an anachronistic man, and Doctor Hans Girard-Perregaux to persuade him not to retire. Because there is no other space pilot at this time, and it takes a few months, if not a year, and much resources to train a new pilot ready to travel to the moon. But Pond\u2019s mind is set, he\u2019s had enough anxiety over space cafard, and he has quite a large amount of Variable Basic shares to support his living and to show off to the others. \n\nIn the escape room at Gubelin\u2019s Floridian home arguing with Girard-Perregaux, who states that he would do the same in the position that Pond is currently in. Because of the way that employment works in the Ultrawelfare State, Pond doesn\u2019t need to face danger anymore. The law does not even allow him to be selected to work again. Later, they decide to use the sailor way of life method to force Pond back to being a pilot again. \n\nPond is aware of the sailor way of life, and he does not want to spend his money in such a quick rush. After dressing himself in a great retirement-rank suit, he checks his balance and makes sure that he has enough money to spend. He goes to Manhattan and settles in a nicer room of the hotel, where he can see the Empire State Building Museum and the Hudson as well as the city. Then he decides to visit the Kudos Room for a drink where celebrities sometimes go. While he was disappointed to see no celebrities, he gets to talk to a beautiful girl who seems extremely interested in space travelling and admires him a lot. As he was explaining space cafard to the girl, he felt a tic on his mouth, so he quickly finishes his drink. ",

At the retirement banquet, Pond expresses smugness and content as he knows the program will not be viable without him. \n\nAfter the party, Hans and Gubelin discuss the significance of Pond\u2019s retirement. They are upset because the Department of Space Exploration is in jeopardy because they do not have another trained space pilot to replace Pond and it would take a long time to train one. Hans and Gubelin go back and forth discussing how best to convince Pond to return to the space pilot job. \n\nSeymour was grateful for each time he returned from his space runs and was ready to retire at the age of 30, which was allowed by the Ultrawelfare State. Once he is retired, Seymour expresses his desire to throw a big celebration. He intends to use a great deal of his money and wants to do so in a more controlled and lavish manner than he previously has. He dresses in a newly purchased suit and is careful to attach his space pin that clearly identifies his previous occupation. He takes transportation to a Manhattan hotel to execute his plan. He is satisfied with his hotel room and heads to the bar to enjoy some drinks. At the bar he sees a girl that he finds very attractive. The girl, Natalie Paskov, initially responds coldly to his attention but then becomes interested when she sees the space pin on his suit. Natalie then mentions that she recognizes him because she follows space news since it is an interest of hers. She expresses her sadness that he retired.

The problem is that there are not enough young people willing to venture and explore the space. Pond is the only trained pilot in the world and they need him, while he has just enough fortune to retire with comfort. Without him the whole space exploration department will be terminated, so Gubelin and Perregaux think of means to deprive Seymour of his money and force him to go back to space. Seymour at that time is planning how to spend his money - he wants to spend a huge sum on the best entertainment. So, the ex-Space Pilot heads towards Manhattan in an automatic car. Seymour gets a luxurious room in a hotel and goes to get a drink in an expensive bar there. There he meets a graceful Oriental girl, and he offers her a drink. Soon she recognizes the famous pilot and starts treating him like a celebrity with utmost surprise of the possibility of talking to him.

I     They gave him a gold watch. It was meant to be symbolical, of course.In the old tradition. It was in the way of an antique, being one of thetimepieces made generations past in the Alpine area of Eur-Asia. Itsquaintness lay in the fact that it was wound, not electronically bypower-radio, but by the actual physical movements of the bearer, a freeswinging rotor keeping the mainspring at a constant tension.     They also had a banquet for him, complete with speeches by suchbigwigs of the Department of Space Exploration as Academician LoftingGubelin and Doctor Hans Girard-Perregaux. There was also somebodyfrom the government who spoke, but he was one of those who werepseudo-elected and didn't know much about the field of space travelnor the significance of Seymour Pond's retirement. Si didn't bother toremember his name. He only wondered vaguely why the cloddy had turnedup at all.     In common with recipients of gold watches of a score of generationsbefore him, Si Pond would have preferred something a bit more tangiblein the way of reward, such as a few shares of Variable Basic to add tohis portfolio. But that, he supposed, was asking too much.     The fact of the matter was, Si knew that his retiring had set themback. They hadn't figured he had enough shares of Basic to see himthrough decently. Well, possibly he didn't, given their standards.But Space Pilot Seymour Pond didn't have their standards. He'd hadplenty of time to think it over. It was better to retire on a limitedcrediting, on a confoundedly limited crediting, than to take the two orthree more trips in hopes of attaining a higher standard.     He'd had plenty of time to figure it out, there alone in space on theMoon run, there on the Venus or Mars runs. There on the long, longhaul to the Jupiter satellites, fearfully checking the symptoms ofspace cafard, the madness compounded of claustrophobia, monotony,boredom and free fall. Plenty of time. Time to decide that a oneroom mini-auto-apartment, complete with an autochair and built-inautobar, and with one wall a teevee screen, was all he needed tofind contentment for a mighty long time. Possibly somebody likeDoc Girard-Perregaux might be horrified at the idea of living in amini-auto-apartment ... not realizing that to a pilot it was roomybeyond belief compared to the conning tower of a space craft.     No. Even as Si listened to their speeches, accepted the watch andmade a halting little talk of his own, he was grinning inwardly. Therewasn't anything they could do. He had them now. He had enough Basic tokeep him comfortably, by his standards, for the rest of his life. Hewas never going to subject himself to space cafard again. Just thinkingabout it, now, set the tic to going at the side of his mouth.     They could count down and blast off, for all he gave a damn.   <doc-sep> II     Si Pond was a great believer in the institution of the spree. Anyexcuse would do. Back when he had finished basic education at the ageof twenty-five and was registered for the labor draft, there hadn'tbeen a chance in a hundred that he'd have the bad luck to have hisname pulled. But when it had been, Si had celebrated.     When he had been informed that his physical and mental qualificationswere such that he was eligible for the most dangerous occupation inthe Ultrawelfare State and had been pressured into taking trainingfor space pilot, he had celebrated once again. Twenty-two others hadtaken the training with him, and only he and Rod Cameroon had passedthe finals. On this occasion, he and Rod had celebrated together. Ithad been quite a party. Two weeks later, Rod had burned on a faultytake-off on what should have been a routine Moon run.     Each time Si returned from one of his own runs, he celebrated. A spree,a bust, a bat, a wing-ding, a night on the town. A commemoration ofdangers met and passed.     Now it was all over. At the age of thirty he was retired. Law preventedhim from ever being called up for contributing to the country's laborneeds again. And he most certainly wasn't going to volunteer.     He had taken his schooling much as had his contemporaries. There wasn'tany particular reason for trying to excell. You didn't want to get thereputation for being a wise guy, or a cloddy either.

        "Query": "What is the definition of the Ultrawelfare State, as mentioned in the story SPACEMAN ON A SPREE?",
        "Summary_1": "The Ultrawelfare State is a distant future society, based upon the main ideas of communism. Every person in the state is guaranteed shares in the society, which translates to money, food, clothes, housing, medical care and education. The money of the nation is doled out by the economic planning board, who determine how the communal wealth is spent. Everyone is given a universal credit card, which only they can access, and they can check their balances on the teevee phones. The way in which people are selected to work in the state is very interesting. In this society, most jobs are automated, so very few people are unfortunate enough to have to work. People are selected for different jobs based on their physical and mental qualifications. People who don't work have their assigned shares to live off of, and those that are selected to work are given a little extra as compensation. When the society was first formed, they tried to give everyone work, but they realised that it was no good to have people working for two hours, two days a week, so they created the draft lottery. Most people live in small apartments, and the fortunate living Si, are able to afford vacuum tubes, which can take you anywhere in an instant. It is only the swankiest of places that have real people working in them. All payment is automated, and different settings of rooms can be changed in an instant in fancy hotels. ",
        "Summary_2": "The Ultrawelfare State in the early days has attempted to give everyone work by providing  little amount of working hours and working days. It was not practical and people did not know their job well, thus it was not efficient. Hence later, the system is designed so that everyone at Ultrawelfare State finishes their basic education at the age of twenty-five, and they will be a part of the lottery for employment. Once they are drawn to serve in a certain industry, they cannot deny. Those at work, or are just employed will receive additional Variable Basic shares, which can be added to their portfolios, for more money, hence better and more comfortable life style. People that are born in the Ultrawelfare State obtain a number of Basic shares that allow them to enjoy the fundamental womb-to-tomb security, including food, clothing, shelter, medical care, and education. \n\nThe Department of Space Exploration at Ultrawelfare State has only one pilot, who has just resigned, and they are close to terminate as their appropriastions for expeditions has been very difficult to obtain. But the officers there believe they are onto some important breakthrough. \n\nUsing vacuum-tube vehicles, one can travel between cities very quickly and it reaches their destination directly. Moreover, one can stay at a hotel room for ten minutes to check if they are satisfactory before confirming their stay by paying with their credit card. ",
        "Summary_3": "The Ultrawelfare State dictates the lives of its citizens. The State guarantees fundamental security through issues of Basic shares that provide enough income to secure food, clothing, medical care, shelter, and education. In the Ultrawelfare State, money is tightly restricted. No one else can use or steal or con a person out of their money. The State also regulates how labor is conducted. It conducts a labor draft that requires people to participate if their name is drawn. Individuals are given extra shares depending on their job assignments. ",
        "Summary_4": "People born in the Ultrawelfare State are issued a minimum number of Basic shares which guarantee right enough income for survival. Then people get basic education and work for the country's labour. A few people were driven to work, others just lived with their Inalienable Basic stocks. There is a department of space exploration in the state and its pilots get more Basic shares and can retire after six flights. The pilots are carefully chosen upon their qualifications as the profession is the most dangerous in the state. The job brings money for life more comfortable than most people in the state have. Nevertheless, young people do not want to venture and become space pilots, they don't have this desire for adventures. People in the state mostly don't contribute to its welfare and aren't needed. All jobs are done by machines, a human bartender, for example, is a sign of luxury. ",
        "Article": "II     Si Pond was a great believer in the institution of the spree. Anyexcuse would do. Back when he had finished basic education at the ageof twenty-five and was registered for the labor draft, there hadn'tbeen a chance in a hundred that he'd have the bad luck to have hisname pulled. But when it had been, Si had celebrated.     When he had been informed that his physical and mental qualificationswere such that he was eligible for the most dangerous occupation inthe Ultrawelfare State and had been pressured into taking trainingfor space pilot, he had celebrated once again. Twenty-two others hadtaken the training with him, and only he and Rod Cameroon had passedthe finals. On this occasion, he and Rod had celebrated together. Ithad been quite a party. Two weeks later, Rod had burned on a faultytake-off on what should have been a routine Moon run.     Each time Si returned from one of his own runs, he celebrated. A spree,a bust, a bat, a wing-ding, a night on the town. A commemoration ofdangers met and passed.     Now it was all over. At the age of thirty he was retired. Law preventedhim from ever being called up for contributing to the country's laborneeds again. And he most certainly wasn't going to volunteer.     He had taken his schooling much as had his contemporaries. There wasn'tany particular reason for trying to excell. You didn't want to get thereputation for being a wise guy, or a cloddy either. Just one of thefellas. You could do the same in life whether you really studied ornot. You had your Inalienable Basic stock, didn't you? What else didyou need?

Si was going to do it differently this time.     Nothing but the best. Wine, women, song, food, entertainment. Theworks. But nothing but the best.   <doc-sep> The gold watch idea had been that of Lofting Gubelin, which wastypical, he being in the way of a living anachronism himself. In fact,Academician Gubelin was possibly the only living man on North Americawho still wore spectacles. His explanation was that a phobia againsthaving his eyes touched prohibited either surgery to remould hiseyeballs and cure his myopia, or contact lenses.     That was only an alibi so far as his closest associate, HansGirard-Perregaux, was concerned. Doctor Girard-Perregaux was convincedGubelin would have even worn facial hair, had he but a touch morecourage. Gubelin longed for yesteryear, a seldom found phenomenon underthe Ultrawelfare State.     Slumped in an autochair in the escape room of his Floridian home,Lofting Gubelin scowled at his friend. He said, acidly, Any morebright schemes, Hans? I presume you now acknowledge that appealing tothe cloddy's patriotism, sentiment and desire for public acclaim havemiserably failed.     Girard-Perregaux said easily, I wouldn't call Seymour Pond a cloddy.In his position, I am afraid I would do the same thing he has.     That's nonsense, Hans. Zoroaster! Either you or I would gladly takePond's place were we capable of performing the duties for which he hasbeen trained. There aren't two men on North America\u2014there aren't twomen in the world!\u2014who better realize the urgency of continuing ourdelving into space. Gubelin snapped his fingers. Like that, either ofus would give our lives to prevent man from completely abandoning theroad to his destiny.     His friend said drily, Either of us could have volunteered for pilottraining forty years ago, Lofting. We didn't.     At that time there wasn't such a blistering percentage of funkersthroughout this whole blistering Ultrawelfare State! Who couldforesee that eventually our whole program would face ending due tolack of courageous young men willing to take chances, willing to faceadventure, willing to react to the stimulus of danger in the manner ourancestors did?     Girard-Perregaux grunted his sarcasm and dialed a glass of iced teaand tequila. He said, Nevertheless, both you and I conform with thepresent generation in finding it far more pleasant to follow one'sway of life in the comfort of one's home than to be confronted withthe unpleasantness of facing nature's dangers in more adventurouspastimes.     Gubelin, half angry at his friend's argument, leaned forward to snaprebuttal, but the other was wagging a finger at him negatively. Facereality, Lofting. Don't require or expect from Seymour Pond morethan is to be found there. He is an average young man. Born in ourUltrawelfare State, he was guaranteed his fundamental womb-to-tombsecurity by being issued that minimum number of Basic shares in oursociety that allows him an income sufficient to secure the food,clothing, shelter, medical care and education to sustain a low levelof subsistence. Percentages were against his ever being draftedinto industry. Automation being what it is, only a fraction of thepopulation is ever called up. But Pond was. His industrial aptitudedossier revealed him a possible candidate for space pilot, and it wasyou yourself who talked him into taking the training ... pointing outthe more pragmatic advantages such as complete retirement after but sixtrips, added shares of Basic so that he could enjoy a more comfortablelife than most and the fame that would accrue to him as one of thevery few who still participate in travel to the planets. Very well.He was sold. Took his training, which, of course, required long yearsof drudgery to him. Then, performing his duties quite competently, hemade his six trips. He is now legally eligible for retirement. He wasdrafted into the working force reserves, served his time, and is nowfree from toil for the balance of his life. Why should he listen toour pleas for a few more trips?     But has he no spirit of adventure? Has he no feeling for....   <doc-sep> To start off, he dressed with great care in the honorableretirement-rank suit he had so recently purchased. His space pin heattached carefully to the lapel. That was a good beginning, he decided.A bit of prestige didn't hurt you when you went out on the town. Inthe Ultrawelfare State hardly one person in a hundred actually everperformed anything of value to society. The efforts of most weren'tneeded. Those few who did contribute were awarded honors, decorations,titles.     Attired satisfactorily, Si double-checked to see that his creditcard was in his pocket. As an after-thought, he went over to theauto-apartment's teevee-phone, flicked it on, held the card to thescreen and said, Balance check, please.     In a moment, the teevee-phone's robot voice reported, Ten shares ofInalienable Basic. Twelve shares of Variable Basic, current value, fourthousand, two hundred and thirty-three dollars and sixty-two centsapiece. Current cash credit, one thousand and eighty-four dollars. Thescreen went dead.     One thousand and eighty-four dollars. That was plenty. He could safelyspend as much as half of it, if the spree got as lively as he hoped itwould. His monthly dividends were due in another week or so, and hewouldn't have to worry about current expenses. Yes, indeedy, Si Pondwas as solvent as he had ever been in his thirty years.     He opened the small, closet-like door which housed his vacuum-tubetwo-seater, and wedged himself into the small vehicle. He brought downthe canopy, dropped the pressurizer and considered the dial. Only oneplace really made sense. The big city.     He considered for a moment, decided against the boroughs of Baltimoreand Boston, and selected Manhattan instead. He had the resources. Hemight as well do it up brown.     He dialed Manhattan and felt the sinking sensation that presaged hiscar's dropping to tube level. While it was being taken up by the robotcontrols, being shuttled here and there preparatory to the shot to hisdestination, he dialed the vehicle's teevee-phone for information onthe hotels of the island of the Hudson. He selected a swank hostelryhe'd read about and seen on the teevee casts of society and celebritygossip reporters, and dialed it on the car's destination dial.     Nothing too good for ex-Space Pilot Si Pond, he said aloud.     The car hesitated for a moment, that brief hesitation before theshot, and Si took the involuntary breath from which only heroes couldrefrain. He sank back slowly into the seat. Moments passed, and thedirection of the pressure was reversed.     Manhattan. The shuttling began again, and one or two more traversingsub-shots. Finally, the dash threw a green light and Si opened thecanopy and stepped into his hotel room.     A voice said gently, If the quarters are satisfactory, please presentyour credit card within ten minutes.     Si took his time. Not that he really needed it. It was by far the mostswank suite he had ever seen. One wall was a window of whatever sizethe guest might desire and Si touched the control that dilated it tothe full. His view opened in such wise that he could see both theEmpire State Building Museum and the Hudson. Beyond the river stretchedthe all but endless city which was Greater Metropolis.     He didn't take the time to flick on the menu, next to the auto-diningtable, nor to check the endless potables on the autobar list. All that,he well knew, would be superlative. Besides, he didn't plan to dineor do much drinking in his suite. He made a mock leer. Not unless hemanaged to acquire some feminine companionship, that was.     He looked briefly into the swimming pool and bath, then floppedhimself happily onto the bed. It wasn't up to the degree of softnesshe presently desired, and he dialed the thing to the ultimate in thatdirection so that with a laugh he sank almost out of sight into themattress.     He came back to his feet, gave his suit a quick patting so that itfell into press and, taking his credit card from his pocket, put itagainst the teevee-phone screen and pressed the hotel button so thatregistration could be completed.     For a moment he stood in the center of the floor, in thought. Take iteasy, Si Pond, take it all easy, this time. No throwing his dollarsaround in second-class groggeries, no eating in automated luncheterias.This time, be it the only time in his life, he was going to frolic inthe grand manner. No cloddy was Si Pond.     He decided a drink was in order to help him plan his strategy. A drinkat the hotel's famous Kudos Room where celebrities were reputed to be adime a dozen.     He left the suite and stepped into one of the elevators. He said,Kudos Room.     The auto-elevator murmured politely, Yes, sir, the Kudos Room.  "

        "Query": "What is the plan of Gubelin and Perregaux to bring Pond back into the space program, as mentioned in the story titled \"Spaceman on a Spree\"?",
        "Summary_1": "Gubelin and Perregaux know that they must get Pond back into their program, if they are going to save it from their funding being cut.  Perregaux tells Gubelin about a theory, where a sailor, who has been out at sea for many months, will always blow his hard earned money on one night out the minute he's back in town, no matter how much he wanted to save it. This is because of the loneliness of the sailor, and their need to make up for all the experiences that he has missed out on while he was at sea. The sailor will wake up the next morning, having spent all his money, without a cent to his name. Then, he will have to go back out to sea, to make back the money he has lost, so the cycle continues. Perregaux believes that Pond is this sailor, and if only they could set a trap for him, in which it would cause him to lose all his money in one night, he would have to go back to work for them. They plant Natalie Paskov, a beautiful woman at the bar where Pond goes. She interacts with him as if he's famous, stroking his ego. She then goes on to show her disdain for the idea that he has retired, and he orders them drinks. And so the night begins, with Pond starting to get drunk, and lose all his money to Natalie. ",
        "Summary_2": "Gubelin and Perregaux plan to get Pond back in the space program by a method similar to the sailor way of life, but a modern day version. The sailor normally goes on trips for months at the sea, where he dreams of his retirement and such. But once he reaches the port, he goes drinking, which leads to other things such as getting tattooed or even go to jail. Spending all of his money all at once, he has to go back to the sea for another trip. Gubelin and Perregaux have decided to use a similar method on Pond, so that he is forced to go back to the space program. ",
        "Summary_3": "Gubelin and Perregaux are desperate for Seymour not to retire because he is the only one capable of doing his job. Perregaux explains how they have to treat Seymour like a sailor from the past who is talking of retirement. A sailor would speak of retirement but then at a port, get too drunk, have a consequently messy night that ended with him in jail. The previous night would cause the sailor to have to continue to sail instead of retiring. They then suggest that they will have to adapt the pattern with more modern methods and apply them to Seymour. It can be assumed that Natalie, the woman he meets at the hotel bar, was sent by Gubelin and Perregaux to convince him to return to his job. ",
        "Summary_4": "For the two, the matter of bringing Seymour out of his retirement is essential. They have tried speeches about the importance of his missions and promises of enormous fame and wealth, but it didn't work. They are ready to use any means as they need Seymour to save their department. They want to make the ex-pilot lose all his money and need more. In their time it's almost impossible to steal someone's money. SO, the two decide to make him himself spend all his money. ",
        "Article": "   SPACEMAN ON A SPREE     BY MACK REYNOLDS     Illustrated by Nodel     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Worlds of Tomorrow June 1963     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      What's more important\u2014Man's conquest     of space, or one spaceman's life?      I     They gave him a gold watch. It was meant to be symbolical, of course.In the old tradition. It was in the way of an antique, being one of thetimepieces made generations past in the Alpine area of Eur-Asia. Itsquaintness lay in the fact that it was wound, not electronically bypower-radio, but by the actual physical movements of the bearer, a freeswinging rotor keeping the mainspring at a constant tension.     They also had a banquet for him, complete with speeches by suchbigwigs of the Department of Space Exploration as Academician LoftingGubelin and Doctor Hans Girard-Perregaux. There was also somebodyfrom the government who spoke, but he was one of those who werepseudo-elected and didn't know much about the field of space travelnor the significance of Seymour Pond's retirement. Si didn't bother toremember his name. He only wondered vaguely why the cloddy had turnedup at all.     In common with recipients of gold watches of a score of generationsbefore him, Si Pond would have preferred something a bit more tangiblein the way of reward, such as a few shares of Variable Basic to add tohis portfolio. But that, he supposed, was asking too much.     The fact of the matter was, Si knew that his retiring had set themback. They hadn't figured he had enough shares of Basic to see himthrough decently. Well, possibly he didn't, given their standards.But Space Pilot Seymour Pond didn't have their standards. He'd hadplenty of time to think it over. It was better to retire on a limitedcrediting, on a confoundedly limited crediting, than to take the two orthree more trips in hopes of attaining a higher standard.     He'd had plenty of time to figure it out, there alone in space on theMoon run, there on the Venus or Mars runs. There on the long, longhaul to the Jupiter satellites, fearfully checking the symptoms ofspace cafard, the madness compounded of claustrophobia, monotony,boredom and free fall. Plenty of time. Time to decide that a oneroom mini-auto-apartment, complete with an autochair and built-inautobar, and with one wall a teevee screen, was all he needed tofind contentment for a mighty long time. Possibly somebody likeDoc Girard-Perregaux might be horrified at the idea of living in amini-auto-apartment ... not realizing that to a pilot it was roomybeyond belief compared to the conning tower of a space craft.     No. Even as Si listened to their speeches, accepted the watch andmade a halting little talk of his own, he was grinning inwardly. Therewasn't anything they could do. He had them now. He had enough Basic tokeep him comfortably, by his standards, for the rest of his life. Hewas never going to subject himself to space cafard again. Just thinkingabout it, now, set the tic to going at the side of his mouth.     They could count down and blast off, for all he gave a damn.   <doc-sep> Girard-Perregaux was wagging his finger again, a gesture that,seemingly mild though it was, had an astonishing ability to break offthe conversation of one who debated with the easy-seeming, quiet spokenman.     He said, No, he hasn't. Few there are who have, nowadays. Man hasalways paid lip service to adventure, hardships and excitement, but inactuality his instincts, like those of any other animal, lead him tothe least dangerous path. Today we've reached the point where no oneneed face danger\u2014ever. There are few who don't take advantage of thefact. Including you and me, Lofting, and including Seymour Pond.     His friend and colleague changed subjects abruptly, impatiently. Let'sleave this blistering jabber about Pond's motivation and get to thepoint. The man is the only trained space pilot in the world. It willtake months, possibly more than a year, to bring another novitiatepilot to the point where he can safely be trusted to take our nextexplorer craft out. Appropriations for our expeditions have beenincreasingly hard to come by\u2014even though in      our     minds, Hans, we arenear important breakthroughs, breakthroughs which might possibly sospark the race that a new dream to push man out to the stars will takehold of us. If it is admitted that our organization has degeneratedto the point that we haven't a single pilot, then it might well bethat the Economic Planning Board, and especially those cloddieson Appropriations, will terminate the whole Department of SpaceExploration.     So.... Girard-Perregaux said gently.     So some way we've got to bring Seymour Pond out of his retirement!     Now we are getting to matters. Girard-Perregaux nodded his agreement.Looking over the rim of his glass, his eyes narrowed in thought as hisface took on an expression of Machiavellianism. And do not the endsjustify the means?     Gubelin blinked at him.     The other chuckled. The trouble with you, Lofting, is that you havefailed to bring history to bear on our problem. Haven't you ever readof the sailor and his way of life?     Sailor? What in the name of the living Zoroaster has the sailor got todo with it?     You must realize, my dear Lofting, that our Si Pond is nothing morethan a latter-day sailor, with many of the problems and view-points,tendencies and weaknesses of the voyager of the past. Have you neverheard of the seaman who dreamed of returning to the village of hisbirth and buying a chicken farm or some such? All the long months atsea\u2014and sometimes the tramp freighters or whaling craft would be outfor years at a stretch before returning to home port\u2014he would talkof his retirement and his dream. And then? Then in port, it would beone short drink with the boys, before taking his accumulated pay andheading home. The one short drink would lead to another. And morningwould find him, drunk, rolled, tattooed and possibly sleeping it off injail. So back to sea he'd have to go.     Gubelin grunted bitterly. Unfortunately, our present-day sailorcan't be separated from his money quite so easily. If he could, I'dpersonally be willing to lure him down some dark alley, knock him overthe head and roll him myself. Just to bring him back to his job again.     He brought his wallet from his pocket, and flicked it open to hisuniversal credit card. The ultimate means of exchange, he grunted.Nobody can spend your money, but you, yourself. Nobody can steal it,nobody can, ah,      con     you out of it. Just how do you expect to severour present-day sailor and his accumulated nest egg?     The other chuckled again. It is simply a matter of finding more modernmethods, my dear chap.   <doc-sep> The gold watch idea had been that of Lofting Gubelin, which wastypical, he being in the way of a living anachronism himself. In fact,Academician Gubelin was possibly the only living man on North Americawho still wore spectacles.

Like that, either ofus would give our lives to prevent man from completely abandoning theroad to his destiny.

Who couldforesee that eventually our whole program would face ending due tolack of courageous young men willing to take chances, willing to faceadventure, willing to react to the stimulus of danger in the manner ourancestors did?     Girard-Perregaux grunted his sarcasm and dialed a glass of iced teaand tequila. He said, Nevertheless, both you and I conform with thepresent generation in finding it far more pleasant to follow one'sway of life in the comfort of one's home than to be confronted withthe unpleasantness of facing nature's dangers in more adventurouspastimes.     Gubelin, half angry at his friend's argument, leaned forward to snaprebuttal, but the other was wagging a finger at him negatively. Facereality, Lofting. Don't require or expect from Seymour Pond morethan is to be found there. He is an average young man. Born in ourUltrawelfare State, he was guaranteed his fundamental womb-to-tombsecurity by being issued that minimum number of Basic shares in oursociety that allows him an income sufficient to secure the food,clothing, shelter, medical care and education to sustain a low levelof subsistence. Percentages were against his ever being draftedinto industry. Automation being what it is, only a fraction of thepopulation is ever called up. But Pond was. His industrial aptitudedossier revealed him a possible candidate for space pilot, and it wasyou yourself who talked him into taking the training ... pointing outthe more pragmatic advantages such as complete retirement after but sixtrips, added shares of Basic so that he could enjoy a more comfortablelife than most and the fame that would accrue to him as one of thevery few who still participate in travel to the planets. Very well.He was sold. Took his training, which, of course, required long yearsof drudgery to him. Then, performing his duties quite competently, hemade his six trips. He is now legally eligible for retirement. He wasdrafted into the working force reserves, served his time, and is nowfree from toil for the balance of his life. Why should he listen toour pleas for a few more trips?     But has he no spirit of adventure? Has he no feeling for....  "

        "Query": "What was the job of Seymour Pond, how did he get chosen for it, and what were his responsibilities?",
        "Summary_1": "Ponds was a space pilot for the department of space exploration. he had completed six space runs to the Moon, Mars, Venus, and Jupiter. He hated every minute of it. Initially, he was drafted into the workforce reserves. He was soon. selected for the job based on his physical attributes and mental qualifications. He had to go through rigorous training once he was selected. This training took several years. After this he was put into the field. He was crammed in a small little space cafard for what seemed like endless amounts of time. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Pond was selected through the employment lottery system where at the age of twenty-five, after he finishes his basic education, he can be drawn to a specific job. He was drawn for space pilot. After his training, out of the twenty-three only him and another person passed the finals. From then on, he has been on six different runs: to the Moon, Venus, Jupiter, and Mars. His trips consist of extremely long time alone, long enough to possibly develop space cafard; the available room in the spaceship is super small, enough for getting claustrophobia. ",
        "Summary_3": "Seymour\u2019s retirement is significant because he is the only one capable of doing his job. During his job, he took 6 trips to space; 2 of the trips were to the moon. Each trip involved being in uncomfortable quarters and was dangerous. \n\nHe was selected for the job at 25 from the labor draft after he had finished his basic education schooling. His physical and mental capabilities made him eligible to train for the space pilot position. He trained along with 22 others and only him and one other person passed that level of training. The other person who passed died during a routine Moon run that had a faulty take-off. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Seymour Pond terminated his basic education and had the minimum of Basic shares in his pocket as everyone else. He got chosen for the labor draft - a small percent of people who had to work while others were unemployed and with their minimum fortune to live. Further, his mental and physical state made him eligible for the most dangerous position in the state - a space pilot. He couldn't and didn't want to decline and was put to trainings and then successfully passed the finals with another man. Seymour completed the six flights he was obliged to and retired. The dangerous job gained him extra shares and his fortune was much more than the average, adding to the fame he got. ",
        "Article": "Girard-Perregaux was wagging his finger again, a gesture that,seemingly mild though it was, had an astonishing ability to break offthe conversation of one who debated with the easy-seeming, quiet spokenman.     He said, No, he hasn't. Few there are who have, nowadays. Man hasalways paid lip service to adventure, hardships and excitement, but inactuality his instincts, like those of any other animal, lead him tothe least dangerous path. Today we've reached the point where no oneneed face danger\u2014ever. There are few who don't take advantage of thefact. Including you and me, Lofting, and including Seymour Pond.     His friend and colleague changed subjects abruptly, impatiently. Let'sleave this blistering jabber about Pond's motivation and get to thepoint. The man is the only trained space pilot in the world. It willtake months, possibly more than a year, to bring another novitiatepilot to the point where he can safely be trusted to take our nextexplorer craft out. Appropriations for our expeditions have beenincreasingly hard to come by\u2014even though in      our     minds, Hans, we arenear important breakthroughs, breakthroughs which might possibly sospark the race that a new dream to push man out to the stars will takehold of us. If it is admitted that our organization has degeneratedto the point that we haven't a single pilot, then it might well bethat the Economic Planning Board, and especially those cloddieson Appropriations, will terminate the whole Department of SpaceExploration.     So.... Girard-Perregaux said gently.     So some way we've got to bring Seymour Pond out of his retirement!     Now we are getting to matters. Girard-Perregaux nodded his agreement.Looking over the rim of his glass, his eyes narrowed in thought as hisface took on an expression of Machiavellianism. And do not the endsjustify the means?     Gubelin blinked at him.     The other chuckled. The trouble with you, Lofting, is that you havefailed to bring history to bear on our problem. Haven't you ever readof the sailor and his way of life?     Sailor? What in the name of the living Zoroaster has the sailor got todo with it?     You must realize, my dear Lofting, that our Si Pond is nothing morethan a latter-day sailor, with many of the problems and view-points,tendencies and weaknesses of the voyager of the past. Have you neverheard of the seaman who dreamed of returning to the village of hisbirth and buying a chicken farm or some such? All the long months atsea\u2014and sometimes the tramp freighters or whaling craft would be outfor years at a stretch before returning to home port\u2014he would talkof his retirement and his dream. And then? Then in port, it would beone short drink with the boys, before taking his accumulated pay andheading home. The one short drink would lead to another. And morningwould find him, drunk, rolled, tattooed and possibly sleeping it off injail. So back to sea he'd have to go.     Gubelin grunted bitterly. Unfortunately, our present-day sailorcan't be separated from his money quite so easily. If he could, I'dpersonally be willing to lure him down some dark alley, knock him overthe head and roll him myself. Just to bring him back to his job again.     He brought his wallet from his pocket, and flicked it open to hisuniversal credit card. The ultimate means of exchange, he grunted.Nobody can spend your money, but you, yourself. Nobody can steal it,nobody can, ah,      con     you out of it. Just how do you expect to severour present-day sailor and his accumulated nest egg?     The other chuckled again. It is simply a matter of finding more modernmethods, my dear chap.   <doc-sep> At the door to the famous rendezvous of the swankiest set, Si paused amoment and looked about. He'd never been in a place like this, either.However, he stifled his first instinct to wonder about what this wasgoing to do to his current credit balance with an inner grin and madehis way to the bar.     There was actually a bartender.     Si Pond suppressed his astonishment and said, offhand, attempting anair of easy sophistication, Slivovitz Sour.     Yes, sir.     The drinks in the Kudos Room might be concocted by hand, but Si noticedthey had the routine teevee screens built into the bar for payment.He put his credit card on the screen immediately before him when thedrink came, and had to quell his desire to dial for a balance check, soas to be able to figure out what the Sour had cost him.     Well, this was something like it. This was the sort of thing he'ddreamed about, out there in the great alone, seated in the confiningconning tower of his space craft. He sipped at the drink, finding it upto his highest expectations, and then swiveled slightly on his stool totake a look at the others present.     To his disappointment, there were no recognizable celebrities. Nonethat he placed, at least\u2014top teevee stars, top politicians of theUltrawelfare State or Sports personalities.     He turned back to his drink and noticed, for the first time, the girlwho occupied the stool two down from him. Si Pond blinked. He blinkedand then swallowed.           Zo-ro-as-ter     , he breathed.     She was done in the latest style from Shanghai, even to the point ofhaving cosmetically duplicated the Mongolian fold at the corners of hereyes. Every pore, but      every     pore, was in place. She sat with the easygrace of the Orient, so seldom found in the West.     His stare couldn't be ignored.     She looked at him coldly, turned to the bartender and murmured, A FarOut Cooler, please, Fredric. Then deliberately added, I thought theKudos Room was supposed to be exclusive.     There was nothing the bartender could say to that, and he went aboutbuilding the drink.     Si cleared his throat. Hey, he said, how about letting this one beon me?     Her eyebrows, which had been plucked and penciled to carry out herOriental motif, rose. Really! she said, drawing it out.     The bartender said hurriedly, I beg your pardon, sir....     The girl, her voice suddenly subtly changed, said, Why, isn't that aspace pin?     Si, disconcerted by the sudden reversal, said, Yeah ... sure.     Good Heavens, you're a spaceman?     Sure. He pointed at the lapel pin. You can't wear one unless youbeen on at least a Moon run.     She was obviously both taken back and impressed. Why, she said,you're Seymour Pond, the pilot. I tuned in on the banquet they gaveyou.     Si, carrying his glass, moved over to the stool next to her. Call meSi, he said. Everybody calls me Si.     She said, I'm Natalie. Natalie Paskov. Just Natalie. Imagine meetingSeymour Pond. Just sitting down next to him at a bar. Just like that.     Si, Si said, gratified. Holy Zoroaster, he'd never seen anythinglike this rarified pulchritude. Maybe on teevee, of course, one of thecurrent sex symbols, but never in person. Call me Si, he said again.I been called Si so long, I don't even know who somebody's talking toif they say Seymour.     I cried when they gave you that antique watch, she said, her tonesuch that it was obvious she hadn't quite adjusted as yet to havingmet him.     Si Pond was surprised. Cried? he said. Well, why? I was kind ofbored with the whole thing. But old Doc Gubelin, I used to work underhim in the Space Exploration department, he was hot for it.           Academician     Gubelin? she said. You just call him      Doc     ?     Si was expansive. Why, sure. In the Space Department we don't havemuch time for formality. Everybody's just Si, and Doc, and Jim. Likethat.

        "Query": "What is Pond's stance on riches and notoriety in SPACEMAN ON A SPREE?",
        "Summary_1": "Pond seems to be obsessed with money. At his retirement, he is given a gold watch. He thinks to himself how much better it would have been if they had simply given him money instead. He vows to live a simple, comfortable life, keeping an eye on his money so it will last him for the rest of his days. He is very proud of the fact that he can afford a luxury like his vacuum tube. Whenever something goes well in Pond's life, he loves to splurge on a night out. He ends up spending enormous amounts of money on things that he sometimes deems as \"sub-par\" for a man of his status. On this one fateful night, he decides that he deserves the best of everything. He is obsessed with the idea of wealth and fame, and checks himself into the nicest hotel he can think of in New York City, partially because he presumes he might see some celebrities there. He checks the balance on his credit card often, and when he goes down to the hotel bar, he has to restrain himself from checking how much a single drink costs. He looks around for signs of famous people, but is disappointed when he sees none. He gives into the flattery of Natalie when she gushes over him, as if he were famous, believing her obvious depciet, and buying her a drink. Fame and money are everything to Pond. ",
        "Summary_2": "In comparison to the gold clock, Pond prefers Variable Basic shares which can be used as money. He does not want to be extremely wealthy, a one room mini-auto-apartment along with an autochair, built-in autobar, a teevee screen is enough for him. With the six trips to space, he has enough money for a comfortable life; he does not want more wealth, which can be obtained from going on more trip. But he keeps on warning himself about not spending too much money so quickly, since he has been doing that multiple times before. Moreover, he believes that reputation for being a wise guy or for being a cloddy is not good since there is the Inalienable Basic stock. However he still wears his air force pin on his suit. ",
        "Summary_3": "Seymour Pond expresses content with the basic necessities of life. He appreciates receiving more than the standard, but he is capable of being content and not needing endless excess. He seems to be content with the rations that he has accumulated but is also okay with benefitting from his wealth and fame that has come from his occupation as a space pilot. He notes that he can get preferential treatment when out of town due to his prestige as a space pilot. Seymour does not need luxurious living conditions as he was used to living in a tiny vacuum-tube vehicle during his space runs. He continuously has a desire to check his account balance even though he has a share of money larger than most people. ",
        "Summary_4": "Pond wants the dangerous job of a space pilot while no-one wants to risk and everyone is fine with the minimum fortune and unemployment. He wants fame and money at first, but during the actual trips he dreams of retirement and comfort. He  doesn't want any more trips even if they bring more wealth, he is good with small auto-apartment with a TV and having some good entertainment. This comfort is just enough for him, more than some have, and he is not greedy to desire for more. But he also enjoys this money he has and wants to spend them wisely. ",

Just thinkingabout it, now, set the tic to going at the side of his mouth.     They could count down and blast off, for all he gave a damn.   <doc-sep> II     Si Pond was a great believer in the institution of the spree. Anyexcuse would do. Back when he had finished basic education at the ageof twenty-five and was registered for the labor draft, there hadn'tbeen a chance in a hundred that he'd have the bad luck to have hisname pulled. But when it had been, Si had celebrated.     When he had been informed that his physical and mental qualificationswere such that he was eligible for the most dangerous occupation inthe Ultrawelfare State and had been pressured into taking trainingfor space pilot, he had celebrated once again. Twenty-two others hadtaken the training with him, and only he and Rod Cameroon had passedthe finals. On this occasion, he and Rod had celebrated together. Ithad been quite a party. Two weeks later, Rod had burned on a faultytake-off on what should have been a routine Moon run.     Each time Si returned from one of his own runs, he celebrated. A spree,a bust, a bat, a wing-ding, a night on the town. A commemoration ofdangers met and passed.     Now it was all over. At the age of thirty he was retired. Law preventedhim from ever being called up for contributing to the country's laborneeds again. And he most certainly wasn't going to volunteer.     He had taken his schooling much as had his contemporaries. There wasn'tany particular reason for trying to excell. You didn't want to get thereputation for being a wise guy, or a cloddy either. Just one of thefellas. You could do the same in life whether you really studied ornot. You had your Inalienable Basic stock, didn't you? What else didyou need?     It had come as a surprise when he'd been drafted for the labor force.     In the early days of the Ultrawelfare State, they had made a mistakein adapting to the automation of the second industrial revolution.They had attempted to give everyone work by reducing the number ofworking hours in the day, and the number of working days in the week.It finally became ludicrous when employees of industry were workingbut two days a week, two hours a day. In fact, it got chaotic. Itbecame obvious that it was more practical to have one worker putting inthirty-five hours a week and getting to know his job well, than it wasto have a score of employees, each working a few hours a week and noneof them ever really becoming efficient.     The only fair thing was to let the technologically unemployed remainunemployed, with their Inalienable Basic stock as the equivalent ofunemployment insurance, while the few workers still needed put in areasonable number of hours a day, a reasonable number of weeks a yearand a reasonable number of years in a life time. When new employeeswere needed, a draft lottery was held.     All persons registered in the labor force participated. If youwere drawn, you must need serve. The dissatisfaction those chosenmight feel at their poor luck was offset by the fact that they weregranted additional Variable Basic shares, according to the tasksthey fulfilled. Such shares could be added to their portfolios, thedividends becoming part of their current credit balance, or could besold for a lump sum on the market.     Yes, but now it was all over. He had his own little place, his ownvacuum-tube vehicle and twice the amount of shares of Basic that mostof his fellow citizens could boast. Si Pond had it made. A spree wasobviously called for.     He was going to do this one right. This was the big one. He'daccumulated a lot of dollars these past few months and he intendedto blow them, or at least a sizeable number of them. His credit cardwas burning a hole in his pocket, as the expression went. However, hewasn't going to rush into things. This had to be done correctly.     Too many a spree was played by ear. You started off with a few drinks,fell in with some second rate mopsy and usually wound up in a thirdrate groggery where you spent just as much as though you'd been in theclassiest joint in town. Came morning and you had nothing to show forall the dollars that had been spent but a rum-head.     Thus, Si was vaguely aware, it had always been down through thecenturies since the Phoenecian sailor, back from his year-long trip tothe tin mines of Cornwall, blew his hard earned share of the voyage'sprofits in a matter of days in the wine shops of Tyre. Nobody getsquite so little for his money as that loneliest of all workers, he whomust leave his home for distant lands, returning only periodically andusually with the salary of lengthy, weary periods of time to be spenthurriedly in an attempt to achieve the pleasure and happiness so longdenied him.     Si was going to do it differently this time.     Nothing but the best. Wine, women, song, food, entertainment. Theworks. But nothing but the best.   <doc-sep> To start off, he dressed with great care in the honorableretirement-rank suit he had so recently purchased. His space pin heattached carefully to the lapel. That was a good beginning, he decided.A bit of prestige didn't hurt you when you went out on the town. Inthe Ultrawelfare State hardly one person in a hundred actually everperformed anything of value to society. The efforts of most weren'tneeded. Those few who did contribute were awarded honors, decorations,titles.     Attired satisfactorily, Si double-checked to see that his creditcard was in his pocket. As an after-thought, he went over to theauto-apartment's teevee-phone, flicked it on, held the card to thescreen and said, Balance check, please.     In a moment, the teevee-phone's robot voice reported, Ten shares ofInalienable Basic. Twelve shares of Variable Basic, current value, fourthousand, two hundred and thirty-three dollars and sixty-two centsapiece. Current cash credit, one thousand and eighty-four dollars. Thescreen went dead.     One thousand and eighty-four dollars. That was plenty. He could safelyspend as much as half of it, if the spree got as lively as he hoped itwould. His monthly dividends were due in another week or so, and hewouldn't have to worry about current expenses. Yes, indeedy, Si Pondwas as solvent as he had ever been in his thirty years.     He opened the small, closet-like door which housed his vacuum-tubetwo-seater, and wedged himself into the small vehicle. He brought downthe canopy, dropped the pressurizer and considered the dial. Only oneplace really made sense. The big city.     He considered for a moment, decided against the boroughs of Baltimoreand Boston, and selected Manhattan instead. He had the resources. Hemight as well do it up brown.     He dialed Manhattan and felt the sinking sensation that presaged hiscar's dropping to tube level. While it was being taken up by the robotcontrols, being shuttled here and there preparatory to the shot to hisdestination, he dialed the vehicle's teevee-phone for information onthe hotels of the island of the Hudson. He selected a swank hostelryhe'd read about and seen on the teevee casts of society and celebritygossip reporters, and dialed it on the car's destination dial.     Nothing too good for ex-Space Pilot Si Pond, he said aloud.     The car hesitated for a moment, that brief hesitation before theshot, and Si took the involuntary breath from which only heroes couldrefrain. He sank back slowly into the seat. Moments passed, and thedirection of the pressure was reversed.     Manhattan. The shuttling began again, and one or two more traversingsub-shots. Finally, the dash threw a green light and Si opened thecanopy and stepped into his hotel room.     A voice said gently, If the quarters are satisfactory, please presentyour credit card within ten minutes.     Si took his time. Not that he really needed it. It was by far the mostswank suite he had ever seen. One wall was a window of whatever sizethe guest might desire and Si touched the control that dilated it tothe full. His view opened in such wise that he could see both theEmpire State Building Museum and the Hudson. Beyond the river stretchedthe all but endless city which was Greater Metropolis.     He didn't take the time to flick on the menu, next to the auto-diningtable, nor to check the endless potables on the autobar list. All that,he well knew, would be superlative. Besides, he didn't plan to dineor do much drinking in his suite. He made a mock leer. Not unless hemanaged to acquire some feminine companionship, that was.     He looked briefly into the swimming pool and bath, then floppedhimself happily onto the bed. It wasn't up to the degree of softnesshe presently desired, and he dialed the thing to the ultimate in thatdirection so that with a laugh he sank almost out of sight into themattress.     He came back to his feet, gave his suit a quick patting so that itfell into press and, taking his credit card from his pocket, put itagainst the teevee-phone screen and pressed the hotel button so thatregistration could be completed.     For a moment he stood in the center of the floor, in thought. Take iteasy, Si Pond, take it all easy, this time. No throwing his dollarsaround in second-class groggeries, no eating in automated luncheterias.This time, be it the only time in his life, he was going to frolic inthe grand manner. No cloddy was Si Pond.     He decided a drink was in order to help him plan his strategy. A drinkat the hotel's famous Kudos Room where celebrities were reputed to be adime a dozen.     He left the suite and stepped into one of the elevators. He said,Kudos Room.     The auto-elevator murmured politely, Yes, sir, the Kudos Room.  "

He starts off seeing a prisoner called Sue-Ann Bradley, who is having problems with a block guard named Sandro. She explains to him that Mathias, another prisoner, did not give her proper instructions and called the guards on her after ten minutes. O\u2019Leary gives Sue-Ann a warning, but Sandro informs him that she has already received a similar warning the day before. He changes his mind and sends her to three days in Block O. O\u2019Leary then begins to think about his job and how it is a good civil-service job. He then thinks about the figs (clerks) and how they are still important members of society even if there should not regularly be a cross between the barriers of the two classes. Sue-Ann, on the other hand, is taken to the Block O disciplinary block. The leading citizens, Flock, and Sauer begin shrieking at her as soon as she arrives. The guards exchange some words regarding the new additions to the block, and Sue-Ann walks through the gate to reach her cell. The two of them begin screaming and howling again. The guards are annoyed, and Sue-Ann starts to weep for real. Meanwhile, O\u2019Leary informs Warden Godfrey Schluckebier of the upcoming trouble he senses, but the warden brushes his concerns as nothing dangerous. The warden reminds O\u2019Leary that they each have their jobs to worry about. Suddenly, the warden gets a phone call, and he realizes that the call is made from Cell Block O by Flock. The events preceding this call cut back to Sue-Ann, who is still in her cell when Flock initially screams in agony. The guard issues a ten-minute rest period, and the tangler fields are turned off. While the inmates are getting up, the guard notices that Flock is still doubled over in pain due to his cramps. He unties the prisoner, but he sees a strange smell that is reminiscent of scorched meat. To his surprise, Flock threatens him with a hidden handmade shiv. Sauer and Flock take the guards hostage, and they threaten the warden to send a medic down for first aid for Flock. The warden then requests to speak to the governor, which triggers a huge effect on various events. Jets, rockets, and helicopters are sent to contain the possible breakout. There is also the possibility of riots starting. Everybody is fearful of what will happen once the inmates break out. However, even with this fearful anticipation from the outside world, the breakout does not seem to happen. ",
        "Summary_2": "Liam O'Leary is the captain of the \"Estates-General Correctional Institution\", also known as the \"Jug\". He is at a hearing for the inmate Sue-Ann Bradley, who has broken the rules of her imprisonment by not mopping the floor of her cell, and getting into a fight with another inmate. He sentences her to three days in \"Block O\", the section of the prison for inmates who cause trouble. O\"Leary is annoyed he has to punish the girl, as she seems to him like a decent enough person. It is revealed through by officer Sodaro, that the reason she is in the prison is for conspiracy to violate the Categorised Class laws. These laws were put in place long before, to fine comb different evolutionary traits in humanity, and to section off the people who fit these traits into groups. They all had specific jobs, they could only procreate in their section, and they could not move between \"specialisations\". \nSue-Ann is moved to Block O, or \"Greensleeves' ' where we meet the characters of Sauer and Flock. They are loud, and clearly disturbed. They seem to be permanent inmates of block O. Sue-Ann is let into the block, where Sauer and Glock begin to shout. She starts to weep. \nO'Leary speaks with the warden, he senses trouble coming. The warden tells O'leary that he's too suspicious, and that there's nothing to worry about. Soon, the warden gets a call, a call from Flock. Flock had made a shiv and taken over one of the guards, and grabbed Sauer. \nThe Warden calls the governor and word quickly spreads fast on the outside. A riot ensues in the lower class. The air forces prepare for an assault on the prison, and make their way there. But, when they get there, there is no breakout, not yet. The city of 19 million people waits. They wait for a breakout that never comes. ",
        "Summary_3": "The story begins with the Captain of the guards, Liam O\u2019Leary, wondering how a particular detainee, Sue-Anne Bradley got to the prison. A guard is telling Liam that she has not been following orders so Liam is considering putting Sue-Ann in the disciplinary O-block. Sue claims that the treatment is unfair because she did not understand the orders that she was given. Eventually, Liam decides to send her to Block O for three days. He still wonders how or why she ended up in the institution when she had such a good advantage in life. \n\nLiam then begins to recount that he is proud of his job and is satisfied with being a part of the Civil Service class. He argues that he readily understands his place in society and does not understand why Sue-Ann does not understand her place in society. A prison guard guides Sue-Ann to her cell in the Greensleeves and it appears to the guard that Sue-Ann is crying. However, she is actually trying not to throw up from the sight of seeing Sauer and Flock, two other prisoners. Sauer and Flock are referred to as \u201cwipes\u201d and they both have spent a very long time in prison. They are causing a loud ruckus within the block and Sue-Ann does not understand why they have to scream so much. \n\nLater on, the Warden and O\u2019Leary are having a conversation about O\u2019Leary\u2019s concerns. The warden does not treat them as important and ignores Liam\u2019s claims. The Warden keeps putting blue pills in his coffee and they seem to make him feel better. His phone rings, wish he picks up with annoyance. The phone call causes the Warden to apologize to O\u2019Leary because presumably his concern was appropriate and there is currently a situation at the prison. \n\nThe situation occurs in the O Block area. A guard opens Flock\u2019s cell and goes to check on him because Flock seems to be in immense pain. Flock surprises him and points a shiv at the guard. Flock phones the warden and demands to be sent a medic because he is hurt. The Warden sends out an alert that there is a riot and the news spreads around fast outside of the institution and in the city-state. The outside world is terrified of the impending riot and prepares for its emergence. The outside world prepares by heavily arming the perimeter of the prison with jets, rockets, and helicopters. They wait for the inevitable so long that they have to refuel. The breakout seems to not be happening. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Liam O'Leary is a captain of guards in a correctional institution and he senses trouble. He sympathizes with a young detainee Bradley and wonders what got her mixed up with trouble when she possessed every advantage. She claims to have broken the rules due to a misunderstanding but he still has to punish her as Sodaro, the block guard, justly insists. The captain walks away thinking about specialization and the necessity of knowing one's place and being proud of whatever it is. Bradley is led to the disciplinary block and turns out women are rarely sent there. She falls in the beginning on the tangler field and shakes from disgust at the sight of two prisoner leaders. They yell and make sarcastic jokes and remind Bradley of animals causing her to weep. O'Leary tells the Warden about unnatural events taking place and the smell of trouble. The Warden wants them both to pay attention only to their own area of the job. A sudden call acknowledges the Warden of trouble. During the rest period in Block O Flock attacks the guard with a  hidden shiv causing pain to Flock himself. After holding the guard as a hostage, Flock and Sauer call the Warden and order to call a medic as Flock is hurt badly. The news of the riot spread immediately all around to the city governor, police departments, TVs, millions of people living near the Jug. The whole city is scared and prepares for the hugest breakout from the prison with guns and helicopters but it doesn't seem to come. ",
        "Article": "O'Leary noted, with the part of his mind that always noted thosethings, that the orderly had been leaning on his broom until he'dnoticed the captain coming by. Of course, there wasn't much tosweep\u2014the spray machines and sweeperdozers had been over thecobblestones of the yard twice already that day. But it was an inmate'sjob to keep busy. And it was a guard captain's job to notice when theydidn't.     There wasn't anything wrong with that job, he told himself. It was aperfectly good civil-service position\u2014better than post-office clerk,not as good as Congressman, but a job you could be proud to hold. He      was     proud of it. It was      right     that he should be proud of it. He wascivil-service born and bred, and naturally he was proud and content todo a good, clean civil-service job.     If he had happened to be born a fig\u2014a      clerk     , he correctedhimself\u2014if he had happened to be born a clerk, why, he would have beenproud of that, too. There wasn't anything wrong with being a clerk\u2014ora mechanic or a soldier, or even a laborer, for that matter.     Good laborers were the salt of the Earth! They weren't smart, maybe,but they had a\u2014well, a sort of natural, relaxed joy of living. O'Learywas a broad-minded man and many times he had thought almost with atouch of envy how      comfortable     it must be to be a wipe\u2014a      laborer     .No responsibilities. No worries. Just an easy, slow routine of work andloaf, work and loaf.     Of course, he wouldn't      really     want that kind of life, because he wasCivil Service and not the kind to try to cross over class barriers thatweren't      meant     to be\u2014     Evening, Cap'n.     He nodded to the mechanic inmate who was, theoretically, in charge ofmaintaining the prison's car pool, just inside the gate.     Evening, Conan, he said.     Conan, now\u2014he was a big buck greaser and he would be there for thenext hour, languidly poking a piece of fluff out of the air filter onthe prison jeep. Lazy, sure. Undependable, certainly. But he kept thecars going\u2014and, O'Leary thought approvingly, when his sentence was upin another year or so, he would go back to his life with his statusrestored, a mechanic on the outside as he had been inside, and hecertainly would never risk coming back to the Jug by trying to pass asCivil Service or anything else. He knew his place.     So why didn't this girl, this Sue-Ann Bradley, know hers?      II     Every prison has its Greensleeves\u2014sometimes they are called bydifferent names. Old Marquette called it the canary; Louisiana Statecalled it the red hats; elsewhere it was called the hole, thesnake pit, the Klondike. When you're in it, you don't much care whatit is called; it is a place for punishment.     And punishment is what you get.     Block O in Estates-General Correctional Institution was thedisciplinary block, and because of the green straitjackets itsinhabitants wore, it was called the Greensleeves. It was a community ofits own, an enclave within the larger city-state that was the Jug. Andlike any other community, it had its leading citizens ... two of them.Their names were Sauer and Flock.     Sue-Ann Bradley heard them before she reached the Greensleeves. Shewas in a detachment of three unfortunates like herself, convoyed by anirritable guard, climbing the steel steps toward Block O from the floorbelow, when she heard the yelling.     Owoo-o-o, screamed Sauer from one end of the cell block andYow-w-w! shrieked Flock at the other.     The inside deck guard of Block O looked nervously at the outside deckguard. The outside guard looked impassively back\u2014after all, he was onthe outside.     The inside guard muttered: Wipe rats! They're getting on my nerves.     The outside guard shrugged.     Detail,      halt     ! The two guards turned to see what was coming in asthe three new candidates for the Greensleeves slumped to a stop at thehead of the stairs. Here they are, Sodaro told them. Take good careof 'em, will you? Especially the lady\u2014she's going to like it here,because there's plenty of wipes and greasers and figgers to keep hercompany. He laughed coarsely and abandoned his charges to the Block Oguards.     The outside guard said sourly: A woman, for God's sake. Now O'Learyknows I hate it when there's a woman in here. It gets the others allriled up.     Let them in, the inside guard told him. The others are riled upalready.     Sue-Ann Bradley looked carefully at the floor and paid them noattention. The outside guard pulled the switch that turned on thetanglefoot electronic fields that swamped the floor of the blockcorridor and of each individual cell. While the fields were on, youcould ignore the prisoners\u2014they simply could not move fast enough,against the electronic drag of the field, to do any harm. But it was arule that, even in Block O, you didn't leave the tangler fields on allthe time\u2014only when the cell doors had to be opened or a prisoner'srestraining garment removed.     Sue-Ann walked bravely forward through the opened gate\u2014and fell flaton her face. It was her first experience of a tanglefoot field. It waslike walking through molasses.     The guard guffawed and lifted her up by one shoulder. Take it easy,auntie. Come on, get in your cell. He steered her in the rightdirection and pointed to a greensleeved straitjacket on the cell cot.Put that on. Being as you're a lady, we won't tie it up, but the rulessay you got to wear it and the rules\u2014Hey. She's crying! He shook hishead, marveling. It was the first time he had ever seen a prisoner cryin the Greensleeves.     However, he was wrong. Sue-Ann's shoulders were shaking, but not fromtears. Sue-Ann Bradley had got a good look at Sauer and at Flock as shepassed them by and she was fighting off an almost uncontrollable urgeto retch.   <doc-sep> What is it you wish? he barked. I understood in my discussions withthe other ... ah ... civilian there'd be no further need for theseirritating conferences.     I've just learned you're placing more students abroad, Mr. Gulver. Howmany this time?     Two thousand.     And where will they be going?     Croanie. It's all in the application form I've handed in. Your job isto provide transportation.     Will there be any other students embarking this season?     Why ... perhaps. That's Boge's business. Gulver looked at Retief withpursed lips. As a matter of fact, we had in mind dispatching anothertwo thousand to Featherweight.     Another under-populated world\u2014and in the same cluster, I believe,Retief said. Your people must be unusually interested in that regionof space.     If that's all you wanted to know, I'll be on my way. I have matters ofimportance to see to.     After Gulver left, Retief called Miss Furkle in. I'd like to have abreak-out of all the student movements that have been planned under thepresent program, he said. And see if you can get a summary of whatMEDDLE has been shipping lately.     Miss Furkle compressed her lips. If Mr. Magnan were here, I'm surehe wouldn't dream of interfering in the work of other departments.I ... overheard your conversation with the gentleman from the CroanieLegation\u2014     The lists, Miss Furkle.     I'm not accustomed, Miss Furkle said, to intruding in mattersoutside our interest cluster.     That's worse than listening in on phone conversations, eh? But nevermind. I need the information, Miss Furkle.     Loyalty to my Chief\u2014     Loyalty to your pay-check should send you scuttling for the materialI've asked for, Retief said. I'm taking full responsibility. Nowscat.     The buzzer sounded. Retief flipped a key. MUDDLE, Retief speaking....     Arapoulous's brown face appeared on the desk screen.     How-do, Retief. Okay if I come up?     Sure, Hank. I want to talk to you.     In the office, Arapoulous took a chair. Sorry if I'm rushing you,Retief, he said. But have you got anything for me?     Retief waved at the wine bottles. What do you know about Croanie?     Croanie? Not much of a place. Mostly ocean. All right if you likefish, I guess. We import our seafood from there. Nice prawns in monsoontime. Over a foot long.     You on good terms with them?     Sure, I guess so. Course, they're pretty thick with Boge.     So?     Didn't I tell you? Boge was the bunch that tried to take us over herea dozen years back. They'd've made it too, if they hadn't had a lot ofbad luck. Their armor went in the drink, and without armor they're easygame.     Miss Furkle buzzed. I have your lists, she said shortly.     Bring them in, please.   <doc-sep>    My Lady Greensleeves     By FREDERIK POHL     Illustrated by GAUGHAN     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Galaxy Science Fiction February 1957.

I     His name was Liam O'Leary and there was something stinking in hisnostrils. It was the smell of trouble. He hadn't found what the troublewas yet, but he would. That was his business. He was a captain ofguards in Estates-General Correctional Institution\u2014better known toits inmates as the Jug\u2014and if he hadn't been able to detect the scentof trouble brewing a cell-block away, he would never have survived toreach his captaincy.     And her name, he saw, was Sue-Ann Bradley, Detainee No. WFA-656R.     He frowned at the rap sheet, trying to figure out what got a girl likeher into a place like this. And, what was more important, why shecouldn't adjust herself to it, now that she was in.     He demanded: Why wouldn't you mop out your cell?     The girl lifted her head angrily and took a step forward. The blockguard, Sodaro, growled warningly: Watch it, auntie!     O'Leary shook his head. Let her talk, Sodaro. It said in the      CivilService Guide to Prison Administration     : Detainees will be permittedto speak in their own behalf in disciplinary proceedings. And O'Learywas a man who lived by the book.     She burst out: I never got a chance! That old witch Mathias never toldme I was supposed to mop up. She banged on the door and said, 'Slushup, sister!' And then, ten minutes later, she called the guards andtold them I refused to mop.     The block guard guffawed. Wipe talk\u2014that's what she was telling youto do. Cap'n, you know what's funny about this? This Bradley is\u2014     Shut up, Sodaro.  "

        "Query": "What insights can be gained about the society depicted in My Lady Greensleeves from the dialogue between Liam O\u2019Leary and Warden Godfrey Schluckebier?",
        "Summary_1": "\nThe conversation between Liam O'Leary and Warden Godfrey Schluckebier reveals that their society heavily relies on specialization to thrive. It is initially said that the direction of evolution is towards specialization, and this also includes mankind. However, humans can create whatever environment they want to specialize in. The warden tells O'Leary that he should not involve himself in the warden's affairs and that he had his own job to do too. He emphasizes that everybody's jobs are important, but it is even more essential to stick to one's own and not pass on another person's occupation. Although O'Leary is upset at how the warden ignores his warnings, Schluckebier reminds him that 'specialization is the goal for civilization,' which means he does not want to worry about O'Leary's job nor should O'Leary worry about his. This goal also reveals how extreme the belief that a specialized society is one of a higher degree. Letting any specialization mix will only result in half-specialists, who fall in the same category as people who cannot specialize and ultimately serve no purpose to the future of humanity. ",
        "Summary_2": "Their conversation reveals the divides and the prejudices at play in the society in which they live in. O'Leary mentions how he thinks it's not right that men of different sections should be mixing together, not even for playing ball. The Warden seems to take a much kinder approach to this outlook. He thinks that while everyone should just stick to their own job, every job is important, and every person is important. The idea of passing is brought up. It is the idea that someone would eventually overcome their social class based on merit. This idea seems both taboo, and ok, as it is the main reason for sectioning in the first place. ",
        "Summary_3": "From the conversation between O\u2019Leary and Warden Godfrey, Liam is discussing how he is worried because 2 different classes of people were interacting in a recreational manner with each other. This demonstrates that in this particular society, this course of action is not supposed to happen. Thus, it can be deduced that in the society they live in, different classes of people are not to mix. In addition, someone else cannot do another person\u2019s job in this society. The goal of their society is specialization, which means each person has a particular service they specialize in and provide. ",
        "Summary_4": "The society is concerned about improving the civilization. It aims towards total specialization with everyone minding their own business in which they are genuinely good. When the trouble comes indeed, turns out the Warden should have listened to Liam. Therefore, this strict accordance to specialization doesn't always make good and when two specializations interfere it may be too late. It shows how the desire to make a perfect civilization so badly makes it full of stupid flaws.",
        "Article": "Sauer and Flock were what are called prison wolves. They werelaborers\u2014wipes, for short\u2014or, at any rate, they had been once.They had spent so much time in prisons that it was sometimes hard evenfor them to remember what they really were, outside. Sauer was a big,grinning redhead with eyes like a water moccasin. Flock was a lithefive-footer with the build of a water moccasin\u2014and the sad, stupideyes of a calf.     Sauer stopped yelling for a moment. Hey, Flock!     What do you want, Sauer? called Flock from his own cell.     We got a lady with us! Maybe we ought to cut out this yelling soas not to disturb the lady! He screeched with howling, maniacallaughter. Anyway, if we don't cut this out, they'll get us in trouble,Flock!     Oh, you think so? shrieked Flock. Jeez, I wish you hadn't said that,Sauer. You got me scared! I'm so scared, I'm gonna have to yell!     The howling started all over again.     The inside guard finished putting the new prisoners away and turned offthe tangler field once more. He licked his lips. Say, you want to takea turn in here for a while?     Uh-uh. The outside guard shook his head.     You're yellow, the inside guard said moodily. Ah, I don't know why Idon't quit this lousy job. Hey, you! Pipe down or I'll come in and beatyour head off!     Ee-ee-ee! screamed Sauer in a shrill falsetto. I'm scared! Then hegrinned at the guard, all but his water-moccasin eyes. Don't you knowyou can't hurt a wipe by hitting him on the head, Boss?     Shut      up     ! yelled the inside guard.     Sue-Ann Bradley's weeping now was genuine. She simply could not helpit. The crazy yowling of the hard-timers, Sauer and Flock, was gettingunder her skin. They weren't even\u2014even      human     , she told herselfmiserably, trying to weep silently so as not to give the guards thesatisfaction of hearing her\u2014they were animals!     Resentment and anger, she could understand. She told herself doggedlythat resentment and anger were natural and right. They were perfectlynormal expressions of the freedom-loving citizen's rebellion againstthe vile and stifling system of Categoried Classes. It was      good     thatSauer and Flock still had enough spirit to struggle against the vicioussystem\u2014     But did they have to scream so?     The senseless yelling was driving her crazy. She abandoned herself toweeping and she didn't even care who heard her any more. Senseless!     It never occurred to Sue-Ann Bradley that it might not be senseless,because noise hides noise. But then she hadn't been a prisoner verylong.      III     I smell trouble, said O'Leary to the warden.     Trouble? Trouble? Warden Schluckebier clutched his throat and hislittle round eyes looked terrified\u2014as perhaps they should have. WardenGodfrey Schluckebier was the almighty Caesar of ten thousand inmates inthe Jug, but privately he was a fussy old man trying to hold onto thelast decent job he would have in his life.     Trouble?      What     trouble?     O'Leary shrugged. Different things. You know Lafon, from Block A? Thisafternoon, he was playing ball with the laundry orderlies in the yard.     The warden, faintly relieved, faintly annoyed, scolded: O'Leary, whatdid you want to worry me for? There's nothing wrong with playing ballin the yard. That's what recreation periods are for.     You don't see what I mean, Warden. Lafon was a professional on theoutside\u2014an architect. Those laundry cons were laborers. Pros and wipesdon't mix; it isn't natural. And there are other things.     O'Leary hesitated, frowning. How could you explain to the warden thatit didn't      smell     right?     For instance\u2014Well, there's Aunt Mathias in the women's block. She'sa pretty good old girl\u2014that's why she's the block orderly. She's alifer, she's got no place to go, she gets along with the other women.But today she put a woman named Bradley on report. Why? Because shetold Bradley to mop up in wipe talk and Bradley didn't understand. NowMathias wouldn't\u2014     The warden raised his hand. Please, O'Leary, don't bother me aboutthat kind of stuff. He sighed heavily and rubbed his eyes. He pouredhimself a cup of steaming black coffee from a brewpot, reached in adesk drawer for something, hesitated, glanced at O'Leary, then droppeda pale blue tablet into the cup. He drank it down eagerly, ignoring thescalding heat.     He leaned back, looking suddenly happier and much more assured.     O'Leary, you're a guard captain, right? And I'm your warden. You haveyour job, keeping the inmates in line, and I have mine. Now your job isjust as important as my job, he said piously.       Everybody's     job isjust as important as everybody else's, right? But we have to stick toour own jobs. We don't want to try to      pass     .     O'Leary snapped erect, abruptly angry. Pass! What the devil way wasthat for the warden to talk to him?     Excuse the expression, O'Leary, the warden said anxiously. I mean,after all, 'Specialization is the goal of civilization,' right? He wasa great man for platitudes, was Warden Schluckebier.       You     know youdon't want to worry about      my     end of running the prison. And      I     don'twant to worry about      yours     . You see? And he folded his hands andsmiled like a civil-service Buddha.   <doc-sep> O'Leary choked back his temper. Warden, I'm telling you that there'strouble coming up. I smell the signs.     Handle it, then! snapped the warden, irritated at last.     But suppose it's too big to handle. Suppose\u2014     It isn't, the warden said positively. Don't borrow trouble withall your supposing, O'Leary. He sipped the remains of his coffee,made a wry face, poured a fresh cup and, with an elaborate show of notnoticing what he was doing, dropped three of the pale blue tablets intoit this time.     He sat beaming into space, waiting for the jolt to take effect.     Well, then, he said at last. You just remember what I've told youtonight, O'Leary, and we'll get along fine. 'Specialization is the\u2014'Oh, curse the thing.     His phone was ringing. The warden picked it up irritably.     That was the trouble with those pale blue tablets, thought O'Leary;they gave you a lift, but they put you on edge.     Hello, barked the warden, not even glancing at the viewscreen. Whatthe devil do you want? Don't you know I'm\u2014What? You did      what     ?You're going to WHAT?     He looked at the viewscreen at last with a look of pure horror.Whatever he saw on it, it did not reassure him. His eyes opened likeclamshells in a steamer.     O'Leary, he said faintly, my mistake.     And he hung up\u2014more or less by accident; the handset dropped from hisfingers.     The person on the other end of the phone was calling from Cell Block O.     Five minutes before, he hadn't been anywhere near the phone and itdidn't look as if his chances of ever getting near it were very good.Because five minutes before, he was in his cell, with the rest of thehard-timers of the Greensleeves.     His name was Flock.     He was still yelling. Sue-Ann Bradley, in the cell across from him,thought that maybe, after all, the man was really in pain. Maybe thecrazy screams were screams of agony, because certainly his face was theface of an agonized man.     The outside guard bellowed: Okay, okay. Take ten!     Sue-Ann froze, waiting to see what would happen. What actually didhappen was that the guard reached up and closed the switch thatactuated the tangler fields on the floors of the cells.

        "Query": "What are the characteristics of Sue-Ann Bradley, the protagonist of My Lady Greensleeves?",
        "Summary_1": "Sue-Ann Bradley is also known as Detainee No. WFA-656R at the Estates-General Correctional Institution. She is a recent prisoner and has not been in prison for as long as many other inmates. Her parents both work in Civil Service. She has an excellent educational background and basically whatever a girl could want. However, she chooses to abandon all of that when she lets herself get tangled in dirty business that leads to her arrest. The main reason for her arrest is for conspiracy to violate the Categoried Class laws. She is also described to be a figger-lover because of her actions. Sue-Ann comes off as defiant and courageous when she first steps forward to confront Sandro and O\u2019Leary to explain her side regarding the offense that Mathias reports her for doing. Inside Block O, she tries to walk bravely across the tanglefoot electronic fields only to fall on her face. Even though Sue-Ann is grateful to the guard for letting her attend to her affairs, she does make an effort to ignore him proudly. Despite this brave exterior that Sue-Ann exhibits, she does have moments of weakness. She begins to weep sincerely once the howling and screaming get worse. Although she initially refuses to let the guards hear her, she is eventually driven crazy by the senseless yelling and begins to weep freely. ",
        "Summary_2": "Sue-Ann Bradley is a young girl, of quite a high status, the idea of which she tries to reject throughout the story. Her parents are civil service, which, while not the highest status, is respectable. She has tried to violate the categorised class laws, by being in love with a person who is below her own class. She has been put in prison for it. She is clearly not used to the gruff nature of the prison system, and doesn't understand the slang that the other inmates use. She is clearly quite emotional, not calling the Captain ``Sir\" out of anger, retching when she sees Flock and Sauer and weeping eventually in her cell. When she is in Block O, she notes to herself that it is a good thing that Sauer and Flock were still fighting against the system. She clearly values freedom. Freedom of speech, freedom to love whoever, freedom from this sectorial way of life. ",
        "Summary_3": "Sue-Ann Bradley is a detainee at the Estates-General Correctional Institution. Captain O\u2019Leary describes her as a beautiful young girl. She is in the institution because of conspiracy to violate the Categoried Class laws. Her parents are of the Civil Service class and she was given a good education. Sue-Ann does not like to show that she is scared or nervous and it is evident that is very prideful from the way she conducts herself throughout the prison. She is not afraid to defend herself. ",
        "Summary_4": "Sue-Ann Bradley is a young and attractive detainee in a correctional institution. She was brought up in a perfect environment and surprisingly got mixed into violating the Categories Class laws. She insists she made mistakes in the institution due to the lack of knowledge about her duties. She is emotional and appears angry with the unjust accusations and on the verge of hysteria. She tries to behave boldly and be careful, but just the sight of some makes her shake from the desire to retch. She appreciates resentment and anger and possesses these features. She is scared and disgusted with animal-like behavior and screams though. She is strong, nevertheless, and manages to behave decently. She even feels gratitude for the smallest things she gets at Block O. ",

Of course, there wasn't much tosweep\u2014the spray machines and sweeperdozers had been over thecobblestones of the yard twice already that day. But it was an inmate'sjob to keep busy. And it was a guard captain's job to notice when theydidn't.     There wasn't anything wrong with that job, he told himself. It was aperfectly good civil-service position\u2014better than post-office clerk,not as good as Congressman, but a job you could be proud to hold. He      was     proud of it. It was      right     that he should be proud of it. He wascivil-service born and bred, and naturally he was proud and content todo a good, clean civil-service job.     If he had happened to be born a fig\u2014a      clerk     , he correctedhimself\u2014if he had happened to be born a clerk, why, he would have beenproud of that, too. There wasn't anything wrong with being a clerk\u2014ora mechanic or a soldier, or even a laborer, for that matter.     Good laborers were the salt of the Earth! They weren't smart, maybe,but they had a\u2014well, a sort of natural, relaxed joy of living. O'Learywas a broad-minded man and many times he had thought almost with atouch of envy how      comfortable     it must be to be a wipe\u2014a      laborer     .No responsibilities. No worries. Just an easy, slow routine of work andloaf, work and loaf.     Of course, he wouldn't      really     want that kind of life, because he wasCivil Service and not the kind to try to cross over class barriers thatweren't      meant     to be\u2014     Evening, Cap'n.     He nodded to the mechanic inmate who was, theoretically, in charge ofmaintaining the prison's car pool, just inside the gate.     Evening, Conan, he said.     Conan, now\u2014he was a big buck greaser and he would be there for thenext hour, languidly poking a piece of fluff out of the air filter onthe prison jeep. Lazy, sure. Undependable, certainly. But he kept thecars going\u2014and, O'Leary thought approvingly, when his sentence was upin another year or so, he would go back to his life with his statusrestored, a mechanic on the outside as he had been inside, and hecertainly would never risk coming back to the Jug by trying to pass asCivil Service or anything else. He knew his place.     So why didn't this girl, this Sue-Ann Bradley, know hers?      II     Every prison has its Greensleeves\u2014sometimes they are called bydifferent names. Old Marquette called it the canary; Louisiana Statecalled it the red hats; elsewhere it was called the hole, thesnake pit, the Klondike. When you're in it, you don't much care whatit is called; it is a place for punishment.     And punishment is what you get.     Block O in Estates-General Correctional Institution was thedisciplinary block, and because of the green straitjackets itsinhabitants wore, it was called the Greensleeves. It was a community ofits own, an enclave within the larger city-state that was the Jug. Andlike any other community, it had its leading citizens ... two of them.Their names were Sauer and Flock.     Sue-Ann Bradley heard them before she reached the Greensleeves. Shewas in a detachment of three unfortunates like herself, convoyed by anirritable guard, climbing the steel steps toward Block O from the floorbelow, when she heard the yelling.     Owoo-o-o, screamed Sauer from one end of the cell block andYow-w-w! shrieked Flock at the other.     The inside deck guard of Block O looked nervously at the outside deckguard. The outside guard looked impassively back\u2014after all, he was onthe outside.     The inside guard muttered: Wipe rats! They're getting on my nerves.     The outside guard shrugged.     Detail,      halt     ! The two guards turned to see what was coming in asthe three new candidates for the Greensleeves slumped to a stop at thehead of the stairs. Here they are, Sodaro told them. Take good careof 'em, will you? Especially the lady\u2014she's going to like it here,because there's plenty of wipes and greasers and figgers to keep hercompany. He laughed coarsely and abandoned his charges to the Block Oguards.     The outside guard said sourly: A woman, for God's sake. Now O'Learyknows I hate it when there's a woman in here. It gets the others allriled up.     Let them in, the inside guard told him. The others are riled upalready.     Sue-Ann Bradley looked carefully at the floor and paid them noattention. The outside guard pulled the switch that turned on thetanglefoot electronic fields that swamped the floor of the blockcorridor and of each individual cell. While the fields were on, youcould ignore the prisoners\u2014they simply could not move fast enough,against the electronic drag of the field, to do any harm. But it was arule that, even in Block O, you didn't leave the tangler fields on allthe time\u2014only when the cell doors had to be opened or a prisoner'srestraining garment removed.     Sue-Ann walked bravely forward through the opened gate\u2014and fell flaton her face. It was her first experience of a tanglefoot field. It waslike walking through molasses.     The guard guffawed and lifted her up by one shoulder. Take it easy,auntie. Come on, get in your cell. He steered her in the rightdirection and pointed to a greensleeved straitjacket on the cell cot.Put that on. Being as you're a lady, we won't tie it up, but the rulessay you got to wear it and the rules\u2014Hey. She's crying! He shook hishead, marveling. It was the first time he had ever seen a prisoner cryin the Greensleeves.     However, he was wrong. Sue-Ann's shoulders were shaking, but not fromtears.

I smell the signs.     Handle it, then! snapped the warden, irritated at last.     But suppose it's too big to handle. Suppose\u2014     It isn't, the warden said positively. Don't borrow trouble withall your supposing, O'Leary. He sipped the remains of his coffee,made a wry face, poured a fresh cup and, with an elaborate show of notnoticing what he was doing, dropped three of the pale blue tablets intoit this time.     He sat beaming into space, waiting for the jolt to take effect.     Well, then, he said at last. You just remember what I've told youtonight, O'Leary, and we'll get along fine. 'Specialization is the\u2014'Oh, curse the thing.     His phone was ringing. The warden picked it up irritably.     That was the trouble with those pale blue tablets, thought O'Leary;they gave you a lift, but they put you on edge.     Hello, barked the warden, not even glancing at the viewscreen. Whatthe devil do you want? Don't you know I'm\u2014What? You did      what     ?You're going to WHAT?     He looked at the viewscreen at last with a look of pure horror.Whatever he saw on it, it did not reassure him. His eyes opened likeclamshells in a steamer.     O'Leary, he said faintly, my mistake.     And he hung up\u2014more or less by accident; the handset dropped from hisfingers.     The person on the other end of the phone was calling from Cell Block O.     Five minutes before, he hadn't been anywhere near the phone and itdidn't look as if his chances of ever getting near it were very good.Because five minutes before, he was in his cell, with the rest of thehard-timers of the Greensleeves.     His name was Flock.     He was still yelling. Sue-Ann Bradley, in the cell across from him,thought that maybe, after all, the man was really in pain. Maybe thecrazy screams were screams of agony, because certainly his face was theface of an agonized man.     The outside guard bellowed: Okay, okay. Take ten!     Sue-Ann froze, waiting to see what would happen. What actually didhappen was that the guard reached up and closed the switch thatactuated the tangler fields on the floors of the cells. The prisonrules were humanitarian, even for the dregs that inhabited theGreensleeves. Ten minutes out of every two hours, even the worst casehad to be allowed to take his hands out of the restraining garment.     Rest period it was called\u2014in the rule book. The inmates had a lesslovely term for it.  "

        "Query": "What is the primary location in My Lady Greensleeves?",
        "Summary_1": "The main setting of the story is inside of a prison. The cells need to be mopped out, and there is also a mess hall. There is also a water fountain that is marked as \u201cCivil Service\u201d that O\u2019Leary drinks out of. Outside, the prison also has a cobblestone yard that the spray machines and sweeperdozers constantly clean. Some prisoners, however, still clean as a means of keeping themselves busy. Apart from the courtyard, there is a car pool inside the prison gates too. \n\nThe Block O portion of the prison, also known as Greensleeves, has cells with green straitjackets for the prisoners to wear and steel-slat beds. Prisoners must take steel steps up to the block and walk through a gate. The most impressive feature of Block O is the tanglefoot electronic fields that can be turned on by a switch. Prisoners are unable to move against the electronic drag of the field, which makes them essentially harmless. There is a telephone in Block O as well, that one can use to call the warden. ",
        "Summary_2": "The main setting of the story is the \"Estates-General Correctional Institution'' or the \"Jug\". It is a prison in a future society. There are cells in which inmates sleep. There is a mess hall, and there seems to be a courtroom where disciplinary hearings take place. There is a mess hall where the inmates dine, and a yard where they have recreational facilities. In the prison, there is a special section called \"Block O ''. It is where inmates who are serving disciplinary action go for short periods of time. All the inmates in Block O, or \"The Jug'' wore green straightjackets. There are steel steps that lead to the block. At the top of the stairs is a cell block. There are \"tanglefoot electronic fields' ' on the floor of the cell which impedes the movement of the prisoners. These were only turned on when a door was opened or a straightjacket was taken off. ",
        "Summary_3": "The main setting of the story is at the Estates-General Correctional Institution. There is a block within the prison called O Block and it is a place for disciplinary action. It is referred to as Greensleeves because prisoners are made to wear green straitjackets while in the area. The Greensleeves area has an electric mechanism that makes walking in it feel like the person is walking through molasses. The correctional institution is colloquially referred to as the Jug and it exists as its own community within a larger city-state. ",

Then the setting moves to the cell blocks and to the yard. Suddenly, the setting switches to the place of punishment, Block O, the disciplinary block. Its inhabitants wear green straitjackets and Block O reminds of a noisy community. Inside, the tangler fields are turned on from time to time to slow down the prisoners. Prisoners are divided into cells. For a while the story moves to the Warden's office and then back to the cells, Flock's one in particular. Then the setting goes outside the prison to the playing a game city governor following the news of the riot which spread all the way to a game field, police departments, TVs, etc. The whole city gets up, every house is alarmed, rockets and helicopters are everywhere in the state of anticipation of trouble.

You must remember Antlers Park has been onthis moon five years and during that time he must have acquaintedhimself with many of its secrets. Probably he learned long ago justwhat to do to make a cockatoo create a mental image.     As for the men going out into the Baldric, that was more of Park'sdiabolical work. In the walls of the barracks besides those lensbuttons were also miniature electro-hypnotic plates, with the mastercontrolling unit located in that valley. Park knew that when the minerswere in a drugged condition from the effects of the fever they wouldbe susceptible to the machine's lure.... And now, Billy-boy, are youcoming with me?     Coming with you? I repeated. Where?     The old lady lit a cigarette. Pluto maybe, she said. There's a penalcolony there, you know, and that ought to tie in nicely with a newcrime story.

Unlike normal street brawls or bar-room fights within the individual classes, the civilians see the Jug as where all classes end up together. This fact is extremely dangerous, because it goes against the values and goals of a higher civilization that the specialization society tries so hard to maintain. While most of the bonds that people form with one another are in their specialization classes, people from the Jug do not have to uphold this same obligation. There is also fear that once these criminals break out of the Jug, the neatly organized class order will become disrupted, and a riot larger than any prison can handle will occur amongst the people in the outside world. In the story, many already begin to prepare for the riots that will inevitably happen when the criminals break out of the Jug. ",
        "Summary_2": "The Jug is a symbol of anarchy to the outside world. They are the lowest of the low in society. They scare the outside world so much because they break the rules of the civilisation which has been created. The prisoners all live and work together, despite their status in the outside world. It is a forgeign concept to those on the outside, who are forbidden to mingle with people of different classes. The Jug is also a symbol of how quickly you can get in trouble for trying to break the status quo. It is a symbol that is clearly used to incite fear into anyone who thinks of trying to pass as someone from a higher station to acquire a better job, or for two people of different sections who try to have a relationship together. It is a symbol above all of the consequences of not following the rules. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The Jug is where all classes are grouped together. Outside of the Jug, the classes are completely separate and by that, they live in their own neighborhoods and perform separate jobs. The Jug represents a threat to the outside world because it breaks the standards that are followed. The outside world has constructed itself to be fit into neat compartmentations of society that separate individuals into different classes. Those classes do not exist in the Jug and could influence and thus threaten the operations of the outside world if the concept were to spread. ",
        "Summary_4": "The Jug is the corrupt sludge on which the whole city-state is based. All classes are cast together in the Jug. Therefore, a riot there affects every class in the city. All the civilians are filled with horror and seek ways for defense. Lots of rockets and helicopters are immediately sent to the prison after this notice of possible riot as it must be prevented by all means. Aircraftswomen are scared knowing how the wipes are towards their kind and rush for weapons. The anxiety of the governor shows the level of danger as he sends such great forces to the prison. To keep the city-state alive there can be no mixing between classes. The riot would break this essential class division. And as we know from the other parts of the text, specialization was the most important thing for people by then. ",
        "Article": "O'Leary noted, with the part of his mind that always noted thosethings, that the orderly had been leaning on his broom until he'dnoticed the captain coming by. Of course, there wasn't much tosweep\u2014the spray machines and sweeperdozers had been over thecobblestones of the yard twice already that day. But it was an inmate'sjob to keep busy. And it was a guard captain's job to notice when theydidn't.     There wasn't anything wrong with that job, he told himself. It was aperfectly good civil-service position\u2014better than post-office clerk,not as good as Congressman, but a job you could be proud to hold. He      was     proud of it. It was      right     that he should be proud of it. He wascivil-service born and bred, and naturally he was proud and content todo a good, clean civil-service job.     If he had happened to be born a fig\u2014a      clerk     , he correctedhimself\u2014if he had happened to be born a clerk, why, he would have beenproud of that, too. There wasn't anything wrong with being a clerk\u2014ora mechanic or a soldier, or even a laborer, for that matter.     Good laborers were the salt of the Earth! They weren't smart, maybe,but they had a\u2014well, a sort of natural, relaxed joy of living. O'Learywas a broad-minded man and many times he had thought almost with atouch of envy how      comfortable     it must be to be a wipe\u2014a      laborer     .No responsibilities. No worries. Just an easy, slow routine of work andloaf, work and loaf.     Of course, he wouldn't      really     want that kind of life, because he wasCivil Service and not the kind to try to cross over class barriers thatweren't      meant     to be\u2014     Evening, Cap'n.     He nodded to the mechanic inmate who was, theoretically, in charge ofmaintaining the prison's car pool, just inside the gate.     Evening, Conan, he said.     Conan, now\u2014he was a big buck greaser and he would be there for thenext hour, languidly poking a piece of fluff out of the air filter onthe prison jeep. Lazy, sure. Undependable, certainly. But he kept thecars going\u2014and, O'Leary thought approvingly, when his sentence was upin another year or so, he would go back to his life with his statusrestored, a mechanic on the outside as he had been inside, and hecertainly would never risk coming back to the Jug by trying to pass asCivil Service or anything else. He knew his place.     So why didn't this girl, this Sue-Ann Bradley, know hers?      II     Every prison has its Greensleeves\u2014sometimes they are called bydifferent names. Old Marquette called it the canary; Louisiana Statecalled it the red hats; elsewhere it was called the hole, thesnake pit, the Klondike. When you're in it, you don't much care whatit is called; it is a place for punishment.     And punishment is what you get.     Block O in Estates-General Correctional Institution was thedisciplinary block, and because of the green straitjackets itsinhabitants wore, it was called the Greensleeves. It was a community ofits own, an enclave within the larger city-state that was the Jug. Andlike any other community, it had its leading citizens ... two of them.Their names were Sauer and Flock.     Sue-Ann Bradley heard them before she reached the Greensleeves. Shewas in a detachment of three unfortunates like herself, convoyed by anirritable guard, climbing the steel steps toward Block O from the floorbelow, when she heard the yelling.     Owoo-o-o, screamed Sauer from one end of the cell block andYow-w-w! shrieked Flock at the other.     The inside deck guard of Block O looked nervously at the outside deckguard. The outside guard looked impassively back\u2014after all, he was onthe outside.     The inside guard muttered: Wipe rats! They're getting on my nerves.     The outside guard shrugged.     Detail,      halt     ! The two guards turned to see what was coming in asthe three new candidates for the Greensleeves slumped to a stop at thehead of the stairs. Here they are, Sodaro told them. Take good careof 'em, will you? Especially the lady\u2014she's going to like it here,because there's plenty of wipes and greasers and figgers to keep hercompany. He laughed coarsely and abandoned his charges to the Block Oguards.     The outside guard said sourly: A woman, for God's sake. Now O'Learyknows I hate it when there's a woman in here. It gets the others allriled up.     Let them in, the inside guard told him. The others are riled upalready.     Sue-Ann Bradley looked carefully at the floor and paid them noattention. The outside guard pulled the switch that turned on thetanglefoot electronic fields that swamped the floor of the blockcorridor and of each individual cell. While the fields were on, youcould ignore the prisoners\u2014they simply could not move fast enough,against the electronic drag of the field, to do any harm. But it was arule that, even in Block O, you didn't leave the tangler fields on allthe time\u2014only when the cell doors had to be opened or a prisoner'srestraining garment removed.     Sue-Ann walked bravely forward through the opened gate\u2014and fell flaton her face. It was her first experience of a tanglefoot field. It waslike walking through molasses.     The guard guffawed and lifted her up by one shoulder. Take it easy,auntie. Come on, get in your cell. He steered her in the rightdirection and pointed to a greensleeved straitjacket on the cell cot.Put that on. Being as you're a lady, we won't tie it up, but the rulessay you got to wear it and the rules\u2014Hey. She's crying! He shook hishead, marveling. It was the first time he had ever seen a prisoner cryin the Greensleeves.     However, he was wrong. Sue-Ann's shoulders were shaking, but not fromtears. Sue-Ann Bradley had got a good look at Sauer and at Flock as shepassed them by and she was fighting off an almost uncontrollable urgeto retch.   <doc-sep> At the guard's yell, the inmates jumped to their feet.     Bradley was a little slow getting off the edge of the steel-slatbed\u2014nobody had warned her that the eddy currents in the tangler fieldshad a way of making metal smoke-hot. She gasped but didn't cry out.Score one more painful lesson in her new language course. She rubbedthe backs of her thighs gingerly\u2014and slowly, slowly, for the eddycurrents did not permit you to move fast. It was like pushing againstrubber; the faster you tried to move, the greater the resistance.     The guard peered genially into her cell. You're okay, auntie. Sheproudly ignored him as he slogged deliberately away on his rounds.He didn't have to untie her and practically stand over her whileshe attended to various personal matters, as he did with the maleprisoners. It was not much to be grateful for, but Sue-Ann Bradley wasgrateful. At least she didn't have to live      quite     like a fig\u2014like anunderprivileged clerk, she told herself, conscience-stricken.     Across the hall, the guard was saying irritably: What the hell'sthe matter with you? He opened the door of the cell with anasbestos-handled key held in a canvas glove.     Flock was in that cell and he was doubled over.     The guard looked at him doubtfully. It could be a trick, maybe.Couldn't it? But he could see Flock's face and the agony in it was realenough. And Flock was gasping, through real tears: Cramps. I\u2014I\u2014     Ah, you wipes always got a pain in the gut. The guard lumbered aroundFlock to the draw-strings at the back of the jacket. Funny smell inhere, he told himself\u2014not for the first time. And imagine, some peopledidn't believe that wipes had a smell of their own! But this time, herealized cloudily, it was a rather unusual smell. Something burning.Almost like meat scorching.     It wasn't pleasant. He finished untying Flock and turned away; let thestinking wipe take care of his own troubles. He only had ten minutes toget all the way around Block O and the inmates complained like crazy ifhe didn't make sure they all got the most possible free time. He waspretty good at snowshoeing through the tangler field. He was a littlevain about it, even; at times he had been known to boast of his abilityto make the rounds in two minutes, every time.     Every time but this.     For Flock moaned behind him, oddly close.     The guard turned, but not quickly enough. There wasFlock\u2014astonishingly, he was half out of his jacket; his arms hadn'tbeen in the sleeves at all! And in one of the hands, incredibly, therewas something that glinted and smoked.     All right, croaked Flock, tears trickling out of eyes nearly shutwith pain.     But it wasn't the tears that held the guard; it was the shining,smoking thing, now poised at his throat. A shiv! It looked as thoughit had been made out of a bed-spring, ripped loose from its frame Godknows how, hidden inside the greensleeved jacket God knows how\u2014filed,filed to sharpness over endless hours.     No wonder Flock moaned\u2014the eddy currents in the shiv were slowlycooking his hand; and the blister against his abdomen, where the shivhad been hidden during other rest periods, felt like raw acid.       All right, whispered Flock, just walk out the door and you won't gethurt. Unless the other screw makes trouble, you won't get hurt, so tellhim not to, you hear?     He was nearly fainting with the pain.     But he hadn't let go.     He didn't let go. And he didn't stop.      IV     It was Flock on the phone to the warden\u2014Flock with his eyes stillstreaming tears, Flock with Sauer standing right behind him, menacingthe two bound deck guards.     Sauer shoved Flock out of the way. Hey, Warden! he said, and thevoice was a cheerful bray, though the serpent eyes were cold andhating. Warden, you got to get a medic in here. My boy Flock, he hurthimself real bad and he needs a doctor. He gestured playfully at theguards with the shiv. I tell you, Warden. I got this knife and I gotyour guards here. Enough said? So get a medic in here quick, you hear?     And he snapped the connection.     O'Leary said: Warden, I told you I smelled trouble!     The warden lifted his head, glared, started feebly to speak, hesitated,and picked up the long-distance phone. He said sadly to the prisonoperator: Get me the governor\u2014fast.       Riot!       The word spread out from the prison on seven-league boots.     It snatched the city governor out of a friendly game of Senioritywith his manager and their wives\u2014and just when he was holding thePorkbarrel Joker concealed in the hole.     It broke up the Base Championship Scramble Finals at Hap Arnold Fieldto the south, as half the contestants had to scramble in earnest to aRed Alert that was real.     It reached to police precinct houses and TV newsrooms and highwaycheckpoints, and from there it filtered into the homes and lives of thenineteen million persons that lived within a few dozen miles of the Jug.     Riot. And yet fewer than half a dozen men were involved.     A handful of men, and the enormous bulk of the city-state quivered inevery limb and class. In its ten million homes, in its hundreds ofthousands of public places, the city-state's people shook under theimpact of the news from the prison.     For the news touched them where their fears lay. Riot! And not merelya street brawl among roistering wipes, or a bar-room fight of greasersrelaxing from a hard day at the plant. The riot was down among thecorrupt sludge that underlay the state itself. Wipes brawled with wipesand no one cared; but in the Jug, all classes were cast together.   <doc-sep>    My Lady Greensleeves     By FREDERIK POHL     Illustrated by GAUGHAN     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Galaxy Science Fiction February 1957.

        "Query": "What is the storyline of CALL HIM NEMESIS?",
        "Summary_1": "The story opens up on a bank robbery. Three men, wearing identical outfits and masks, walk in and threaten the citizens in the bank, raising a weapon. As the men are taking money from behind the counter, a woman, Miss English, makes a run for the door. She is shot at but missed, caught by one of the men at the door, and another citizen, Mr. Anderson, manages to escape and call for help. The men flee the bank and hop into a stolen car, just missing the incoming police. As the men get away, the car suddenly malfunctions and crashes into another car, and they are eventually caught by the police. Detective Stevenson discusses the incident with Detective Pauling, and he is perplexed by how the tires of the stolen car seemed to melt instantly, and how the words \"The Scorpion\" were branded into the car. The owner of the stolen car, John Hastings, arrives, and he confirms that the words were not on the car before it was stolen. Two days later, the Daily News receives a crank letter, addressed from \"The Scorpion\" and explaining that he fights crime, threatening criminals. The letter was not published. About a month after the robbery, another incident occurs in Brooklyn, where Jerome Higgins murders his wife and injures his sister after spending days in his bedroom. Police and cameramen arrive at his home, where a standoff occurs for an hour before Higgins suddenly throws his rifle and runs outside, his hands burned severely. Stevenson finds the rifle and sees \"The Scorpion\" burned into the side of it. Stevenson goes to Captain Hanks, questioning the similarities between the two events, and Hanks dismisses his conspiracies. The Daily Mail receives another letter, but still does not publish it. On Halloween, two gangs, the Challengers and the Scarlet Raiders, plan a rumble over territory. Judy Canzanetti is a lookout for the Scarlet Raiders, and she is guarding the street when a group of children approach her. Judy warns them to leave, but one of the children goes around her and runs down the street. Suddenly, the police arrive, and Judy warns the gang, but then sees them jumping around and throwing their weapons and jackets. Again, the words \"The Scorpion\" are found on the jackets of both gangs. Stevenson brings this up to Hanks again, but he denies it and tells him to stop bringing the theory up.",
        "Summary_2": "The story begins in a bank. It is under control of three bank robbers, who have taken nine other people in the bank hostage. One man escapes out the door, shouting for help. The robbers quickly run outside to meet their getaway driver, where they speed off. They are followed by police. The getaway car reaches ahead until the car crashes, and the police clap handcuffs on the robbers, taking them to the station. \nBack in the station Detective-Sergeant Stevenson discusses with his colleague what happened. The tires of the getaway car seemed to have melted. The car was normal, apart from the words \"the scorpion\", burned in big black letters on the trunk lid. They meet the owner of the stolen car at the station, who tells them that he never put that sign on the car. That was on Wednesday. On Friday, the Daily News is sent a crank letter from someone signed \"the scorpion\" who tells the paper to warn their readers that \"the scorpion fights crime\" and that criminals are not safe.\nJerome Higgins, a man from Brooklyn goes crazy and kills his wife and injures his sister with a gun. Both neighbours and police surround the house after his sister Mrs.Strober escapes the house. inside, Higgins goes ballistic, shooting at random. That is until Higgins runs out of the house, his hands and shoulder having severe burns. He is taken to get his wounds treated, and then to jail. On the gun, it is burned into the wood \"The Scorpion\". \nThe Sergeant and his Captain discuss these cases. Stevenson thinks that they must be connected, but the Captain tells Stevenson to stop looking into this fantasy, as they have nothing in common, and it's a mere coincidence. The Daily News received another letter of warning that was never published. \nIt is Halloween night. The gangs \"The Challengers\" and \"The Scarlet Raiders\" are getting ready for a fight. The two leaders of the gang have agreed to a knife fight over a schoolyard for territory. Judy Canzanetti is sent out by the Scarlet Raiders as a lookout for any kids or cops going by. She sees a group of kids, who she tries to divert, but when one of them escapes and runs in the direction of the fight, she is caught off guard. That is until she hears sirens, and goes to warn the gang. Before she gets there though, all the members of the two gangs jump around, throwing their weapons on the ground and taking off their jackets. It is explained later on by Steavenson that their weapons all of a sudden became freezing cold, as did their jackets, with \"the scorpion\" burned into the backs of them. The captain once again tells Stevenson to let this \"nonsense\" go, and it's nothing more than a coincidence. ",
        "Summary_3": "The story starts with a bank robbery in late June. There are twelve people in the bank when it is robbed. The three robbers, who look like triplets, all wear the same outfits. One man draws a pistol while the other one takes the guard's pistol, Mr. Anderson. The last one takes a black satchel bag and fills it with money. Then, they join the fourth robber in a stolen car while the police chase them. It seems that they will get away, but the tires melt, which gives the police the opportunity to apprehend them. On Wednesday, Detective-Sergeant Stevenson finds it very strange, but Detective-Sergeant Pauling tells him it is common for plans to have these flaws. Stevenson mentions that the car has 'The Scorpion' burned into it just as the owner arrives. John Hastings says that he reported his car as soon as it was stolen. Stevenson is surprised that he would leave his keys in it, but Hastings says it is usually safe for him because he is a wine and liquor salesman. Hastings is angry at the police for melting his tires, but Stevenson says the police had no part in that. Both of them are confused by the writing on the car since it was not there before. On Friday, the Daily News receives a letter from The Scorpion that warns the readers of the paper because it fights crime. However, the letter is ignored and filed into the wastebasket instead. The second incident happens in early August when a Brooklyn man named Jerome Higgins goes berserk after failing a Civil Service exam for the third time. The crime is in Canarsie, in southeast Brooklyn near Jamaica Bay. Mrs. Higgins and his sister, Mrs. Thelma Stodbetter, try to wake him up; Mister Higgins kills his wife and injures his sister with a hunting rifle. He then goes on a rampage, barricading himself in the house and shooting at anything that moves. Policemen, firemen, neighbors, ambulance attendants, and even two cameramen from the mobile unit are present. After one hour, Higgins plans to shoot at the camera, but he suddenly throws his rifle away. He then complains about his hands, which are severely burned, and Stevenson finds the words 'The Scorpion' present again. Precinct Captain Hanks tells him that his idea of an external force fighting crime out there is silly, while the Daily News receives a second letter from The Scorpion. The third case details a Hallowe'en rumble in a schoolyard. Judy Canzanetti is made to stand chicken, and she tells a group of kids in Hallowe'en masks to stay away from the schoolyard. The kid named Eddie dashes down the street, and the cops soon appear after. Stevenson tries to bring up how strange it is for both gangs to have 'The Scorpion' on their jackets when the conflict was a territorial war. Hanks refutes his points and tells him to stop worrying about any Scorpion nonsense.",
        "Summary_4": "A bank is being robbed by three similar looking men. Picking a moment, one of the hostages, Miss English, rushes out, but she is stopped, while another captive, Mr. Anderson, manages to escape and call the police. The robbers hit Miss English into unconsciousness and run away. Police cars come and go in the wrong way, but surprisingly manage to capture the robbers after all. The stupid mistake of the robbers seems suspicious as the car's tires melted for no reason and the stolen car was very noticeable with \"The Scorpion\" written in the back. When the car owner comes, he is very angry and upset, and he mentions the inscription wasn't there before the robbery. Soon, a letter from \"The Scorpion\" is received by a newspaper, saying that the sender will keep fighting crime. About one month later, a clerk murders his wife from a rifle after going berserk. This man, Mr. Higgins, barricades himself at home and fires outside in defense, while his sister runs to the police and the neighbors call. After an hour of no success in arresting the man, he runs out himself with his hands being terribly burnt. The same detective who led the first case, Stevenson, comes to the scene, and sees an engraving \"The Scorpion\" on the rifle. Higgins' lawyer claims the inscription was put by his client, while the least denies it, which the lawyer uses to proclaim him insane. Stevenson holds on to someone else making those inscriptions while Captain Hanks denies the version. Stevenson keeps posing questions making the case strange, but Hanks tries to close the case with explaining everything as primitively as possible. Hanks orders Stevenson to forget his ideas of someone pretending to be a superhero and even threatens him reminding about a precedent. Another warning letter to the readers comes from \"The Scorpion\" to the newspaper, but it's not printed again. Another story takes place on Halloween, two gangs meet to fight for a school yard with knifes and chains. A fifteen year old girl Judy stands chicken on the corner during the fight and sees a bunch of kids heading home, she says them to go another way, but one kid sees the rumble and rushes there. Suddenly the cops come and the gangs do not hear Judy's warning, everyone is arrested. \"The Scorpion\" appears on the participants' jackets after the fight. Turns out the fight didn't happen as all the metallic weapons and leather jackets suddenly got extremely cold to hold. Hanks again finds an explanation - the kids threw all of these away not tore arrested. He again tells Stevenson to stop with this nonsense from the superhero books. ",

This is a holdup.     There were twelve people in the bank. There was Mr. Featherhall athis desk, refusing to okay a personal check from a perfect stranger.There was the perfect stranger, an itinerant garage mechanic namedRodney (Rod) Strom, like the check said. There were Miss English andMiss Philicoff, the girls in the gilded teller cages. There was MisterAnderson, the guard, dozing by the door in his brown uniform. There wasMrs. Elizabeth Clayhorn, depositing her husband's pay check in theirjoint checking account, and with her was her ten-year-old son Edward(Eddie) Clayhorn, Junior. There was Charlie Casale, getting ten dollarsdimes, six dollars nickels and four dollars pennies for his fatherin the grocery store down the street. There was Mrs. Dolly Daniels,withdrawing money from her savings account again. And there were threebank robbers.     The three bank robbers looked like triplets. From the ground up, theyall wore scuffy black shoes, baggy-kneed and unpressed khaki trousers,brown cracked-leather jackets over flannel shirts, white handkerchiefsover the lower half of their faces and gray-and-white check caps pulledlow over their eyes. The eyes themselves looked dangerous.     The man who had spoken withdrew a small but mean-looking thirty-twocalibre pistol from his jacket pocket. He waved it menacingly. One ofthe others took the pistol away from Mister Anderson, the guard, andsaid to him in a low voice, Think about retirement, my friend. Thethird one, who carried a black satchel like a doctor's bag, walkedquickly around behind the teller's counter and started filling it withmoney.     It was just like the movies.     The man who had first spoken herded the tellers, Mr. Featherhall andthe customers all over against the back wall, while the second manstayed next to Mr. Anderson and the door. The third man stuffed moneyinto the black satchel.     The man by the door said, Hurry up.     The man with the satchel said, One more drawer.     The man with the gun turned to say to the man at the door, Keep yourshirt on.     That was all Miss English needed. She kicked off her shoes and ranpelting in her stocking feet for the door.   <doc-sep> Dotty suddenly began to turn and toss, and a look of terror came overher sleeping face. Celeste leaned forward apprehensively.     The child's lips worked and Celeste made out the sleepy-fuzzy words:They've found out where we're hiding. They're coming to get us. No!Please, no!     Celeste's reactions were mixed. She felt worried about Dotty and atthe same time almost in terror of her, as if the little girl were anagent of supernatural forces. She told herself that this fear was anexpression of her own hostility, yet she didn't really believe it. Shetouched the child's hand.     Dotty's eyes opened without making Celeste feel she had quite comeawake. After a bit she looked at Celeste and her little lips parted ina smile.     Hello, she said sleepily. I've been having such funny dreams. Then,after a pause, frowning, I really am a god, you know. It feels veryqueer.     Yes, dear? Celeste prompted uneasily. Shall I call Frieda?     The smile left Dotty's lips. Why do you act so nervous around me? sheasked. Don't you love me, Mummy?     Celeste started at the word. Her throat closed. Then, very slowly, herface broke into a radiant smile. Of course I do, darling. I love youvery much.     Dotty nodded happily, her eyes already closed again.

Washington will haveto decide what to do with the machine.     Listen, Professor, Carmen began, the Mafia\u2014     What makes you think I'm any more afraid of the Mafia than I am of theF.B.I.? I may have already sealed my fate by letting you in on thismuch. Machinegunning is hardly a less attractive fate to me than a poorsecurity rating. To me, being dead professionally would be as bad asbeing dead biologically.     Tony Carmen laid a heavy hand on my shoulder. I finally deduced heintended to be cordial.     Of course, he said smoothly you have to give this to Washington butthere are      ways     , Professor. I know. I'm a business man\u2014     You      are     ? I said.     He named some of the businesses in which he held large shares of stock.     You      are     .     I've had experience in this sort of thing. We simply      leak     theinformation to a few hundred well selected persons about all that yourmachine can do. We'll call 'em Expendables, because they can expendanything.     I, I interjected, planned to call it the Venetti Machine.     Professor, who calls the radio the Marconi these days?     There are Geiger-Muller Counters, though, I said.     You don't have to give a Geiger counter the sex appeal of a TV set ora hardtop convertible. We'll call them Expendables. No home will becomplete without one.     Perfect for disposing of unwanted bodies, I mused. The murder ratewill go alarmingly with those devices within easy reach.     Did that stop Sam Colt or Henry Ford? Tony Carmen asked reasonably....     Naturally, I was aware that the government would      not     be interested inmy machine. I am not a Fortean, a psychic, a psionicist or a screwball.But the government frequently gets things it doesn't know what to dowith\u2014like airplanes in the 'twenties. When it doesn't know what to do,it doesn't do it.     There have been hundreds of workable perpetual motion machinespatented, for example. Of course, they weren't vices in the strictestsense of the word. Many of them used the external power of gravity,they would wear out or slow down in time from friction, but for themeanwhile, for some ten to two hundred years they would just sit there,moving. No one had ever been able to figure out what to do with them.     I knew the AEC wasn't going to dump tons of radioactive waste (withsome possible future reclaimation value) into a machine which theydidn't believe actually could work.     Tony Carmen knew exactly what to do with an Expendable once he got hishands on it.     Naturally, that was what I had been afraid of.  "

        "Query": "What is the common thread in the crimes that raises Stevenson's suspicions in CALL HIM NEMESIS?",
        "Summary_1": "In all three incidents that take place in the story, the criminals were stopped and caught by the police. They all seemed to be mysteriously burned in one way or another: the tires on the car melted off, Higgins' hands were burned by the rifle, and the jackets and weapons of the gang members seemed to have the same effect. Additionally, all three events were tagged by \"The Scorpion\": the words were branded on the car, the rifle, and the jackets.",
        "Summary_2": "There is a very odd pattern that Stevenson notices in the crimes that makes him suspicious. In all the crimes mentioned in the story, there has been the words \"The Scorpion\" left behind on some piece of evidence relating to the crime by an unknown source. There is also the connection of heat in all three cases. In the bank robbery case, the tires melt without explanation, and \"the scorpion\" is burned onto the outside of the car. \nIn the murder case, the gun which Mr Higgins holds burns his hands and his shoulder, and the words are left burned into the wooden part of the gun. \nIn the incident involving the two gangs, their weapons and jackets become increasingly cold, up to the point where they can no longer touch them. The words \"the scorpion\" and imprinted on the back of their jackets. ",
        "Summary_3": "Stevenson notices that shortly after all of the criminals are arrested, the mark of \u2018The Scorpion\u2019 is left behind. In the bank robbery, the writing is burned into the lid of the car. In the Brooklyn rampage incident, it is burned onto the wood stock of Mister Higgin\u2019s hunting rifle. In the schoolyard incident, the word is written on the back of all the jackets of the two gangs. These patterns make him suspicious because although there is no evidence of any external interference, the word appears whenever the criminals\u2019 plans have been thwarted and the police have arrived. The words also do not seem to be written by the criminals themselves either. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Each crime is very different - a bank robbery, a domestic murder and a kids gangs fight. Nevertheless, they bare linked with an inscription \"The Scorpion\" appearing on some attributes and weird things preventing the crimes. First, well-organized robbers make a stupid mistake of picking a noticeable car and their tires burn for no cause, then a rifle gets hot all of a sudden and burns the hands holding it. In the end, weapons and jackets become impossible to hold as they are extremely cold. Thus, the thee crimes are stopped. And the same inscription is told by everyone not to have been there before. ",
        "Article": "On the way around, Stevenson said, I believe you reported the carstolen almost immediately after it happened.     That's right, said Hastings. I stepped into a bar on my route. I'ma wine and liquor salesman. When I came out five minutes later, my carwas gone.     You left the keys in it?     Well, why not? demanded Hastings belligerently. If I'm making justa quick stop\u2014I never spend more than five minutes with any onecustomer\u2014I always leave the keys in the car. Why not?     The car was stolen, Stevenson reminded him.     Hastings grumbled and glared. It's always been perfectly safe up tillnow.     Yes, sir. In here.     Hastings took one look at his car and hit the ceiling. It's ruined!he cried. What did you do to the tires?     Not a thing, sir. That happened to them in the holdup.     Hastings leaned down over one of the front tires. Look at that!There's melted rubber all over the rims. Those rims are ruined! Whatdid you use, incendiary bullets?     Stevenson shook his head. No, sir. When that happened they were twoblocks away from the nearest policeman.     Hmph. Hastings moved on around the car, stopping short to exclaim,What in the name of God is that? You didn't tell me a bunch of      kids     had stolen the car.     It wasn't a bunch of kids, Stevenson told him. It was fourprofessional criminals, I thought you knew that. They were using it ina bank holdup.     Then why did they do      that     ?     Stevenson followed Hastings' pointing finger, and saw again thecrudely-lettered words, The Scorpion burned black into the paint ofthe trunk lid. I really don't know, he said. It wasn't there beforethe car was stolen?     Of course not!     Stevenson frowned. Now, why in the world did they do that?     I suggest, said Hastings with heavy sarcasm, you ask them that.     Stevenson shook his head. It wouldn't do any good. They aren't talkingabout anything. I don't suppose they'll ever tell us. He looked at thetrunk lid again. It's the nuttiest thing, he said thoughtfully....     That was on Wednesday.     The Friday afternoon mail delivery to the      Daily News     brought a crankletter. It was in the crank letter's most obvious form; that is,the address had been clipped, a letter or a word at a time, from anewspaper and glued to the envelope. There was no return address.     The letter itself was in the same format. It was brief and to the point:     Dear Mr. Editor:     The Scorpion has struck. The bank robbers were captured. The Scorpionfights crime. Crooks and robbers are not safe from the avengingScorpion. WARN YOUR READERS!     Sincerely yours,     THE SCORPION     The warning was duly noted, and the letter filed in the wastebasket. Itdidn't rate a line in the paper.      II     The bank robbery occurred in late June. Early in August, a Brooklyn manwent berserk.     It happened in Canarsie, a section in southeast Brooklyn near JamaicaBay. This particular area of Canarsie was a residential neighborhood,composed of one and two family houses. The man who went berserk was aMotor Vehicle Bureau clerk named Jerome Higgins.     Two days before, he had flunked a Civil Service examination for thethird time. He reported himself sick and spent the two days at home,brooding, a bottle of blended whiskey at all times in his hand.     As the police reconstructed it later, Mrs. Higgins had attempted toawaken him on the third morning at seven-thirty, suggesting that hereally ought to stop being so foolish, and go back to work. He thenallegedly poked her in the eye, and locked her out of the bedroom.     Mrs. Higgins then apparently called her sister-in-law, a Mrs. ThelmaStodbetter, who was Mr. Higgins' sister. Mrs. Stodbetter arrived at thehouse at nine o'clock, and spent some time tapping at the still-lockedbedroom door, apparently requesting Mr. Higgins to unlock the door andstop acting like a child. Neighbors reported to the police that theyheard Mr. Higgins shout a number of times, Go away! Can't you let aman sleep?     At about ten-fifteen, neighbors heard shots from the Higgins residence,a two-story one-family pink stucco affair in the middle of a block ofsimilar homes. Mr. Higgins, it was learned later, had suddenly eruptedfrom his bedroom, brandishing a .30-.30 hunting rifle and, beingannoyed at the shrieks of his wife and sister, had fired seven shellsat them, killing his wife on the spot and wounding his sister in thehand and shoulder.     Mrs. Stodbetter, wounded and scared out of her wits, raced screamingout the front door of the house, crying for the police and shouting,Murder! Murder! At this point, neighbors called the police. Oneneighbor additionally phoned three newspapers and two televisionstations, thereby earning forty dollars in news-tips rewards.   <doc-sep> You don't get to be Precinct Captain on nothing but politicalconnections. Those help, of course, but you need more than that. AsCaptain Hanks was fond of pointing out, you needed as well to be bothmore imaginative than most\u2014You gotta be able to second-guess thesmart boys\u2014and to be a complete realist\u2014You gotta have both feeton the ground. If these were somewhat contradictory qualities, it wasbest not to mention the fact to Captain Hanks.     The realist side of the captain's nature was currently at the fore.Just what are you trying to say, Stevenson? he demanded.     I'm not sure, admitted Stevenson. But we've got these two things.First, there's the getaway car from that bank job. The wheels melt forno reason at all, and somebody burns 'The Scorpion' onto the trunk.Then, yesterday, this guy Higgins out in Canarsie. He says the rifleall of a sudden got too hot to hold, and he's got the burn marks toprove it. And there on the rifle stock it is again. 'The Scorpion'.     He says he put that on there himself, said the captain.     Stevenson shook his head. His      lawyer     says he put it on there.Higgins says he doesn't remember doing it. That's half the lawyer'scase. He's trying to build up an insanity defense.     He put it on there himself, Stevenson, said the captain with wearypatience. What are you trying to prove?     I don't know. All I know is it's the nuttiest thing I ever saw. Andwhat about the getaway car? What about those tires melting?     They were defective, said Hanks promptly.     All four of them at once? And what about the thing written on thetrunk?     How do I know? demanded the captain. Kids put it on before the carwas stolen, maybe. Or maybe the hoods did it themselves, who knows?What do      they     say?     They say they didn't do it, said Stevenson. And they say they neversaw it before the robbery and they would have noticed it if it'd beenthere.     The captain shook his head. I don't get it, he admitted. What areyou trying to prove?     I guess, said Stevenson slowly, thinking it out as he went along, Iguess I'm trying to prove that somebody melted those tires, and madethat rifle too hot, and left his signature behind.     What? You mean like in the comic books? Come on, Stevenson! What areyou trying to hand me?     All I know, insisted Stevenson, is what I see.     And all      I     know, the captain told him, is Higgins put that name onhis rifle himself. He says so.     And what made it so hot?     Hell, man, he'd been firing that thing at people for an hour! What doyou      think     made it hot?     All of a sudden?     He noticed it all of a sudden, when it started to burn him.     How come the same name showed up each time, then? Stevenson askeddesperately.     How should I know? And why not, anyway? You know as well as I do thesethings happen. A bunch of teen-agers burgle a liquor store and theywrite 'The Golden Avengers' on the plate glass in lipstick. It happensall the time. Why not 'The Scorpion'? It couldn't occur to two people?     But there's no explanation\u2014 started Stevenson.     What do you mean, there's no explanation? I just      gave     you theexplanation. Look, Stevenson, I'm a busy man. You got a nuttyidea\u2014like Wilcox a few years ago, remember him? Got the idea therewas a fiend around loose, stuffing all those kids into abandonedrefrigerators to starve. He went around trying to prove it, and gettingall upset, and pretty soon they had to put him away in the nut hatch.Remember?     I remember, said Stevenson.     Forget this silly stuff, Stevenson, the captain advised him.     Yes, sir, said Stevenson....     The day after Jerome Higgins went berserk, the afternoon mail brought acrank letter to the      Daily News     :     Dear Mr. Editor,     You did not warn your readers. The man who shot all those people couldnot escape the Scorpion. The Scorpion fights crime. No criminal issafe from the Scorpion. WARN YOUR READERS.     Sincerely yours,     THE SCORPION     Unfortunately, this letter was not read by the same individual who hadseen the first one, two months before. At any rate, it was filed in thesame place, and forgotten.      III     Hallowe'en is a good time for a rumble. There's too many kids aroundfor the cops to keep track of all of them, and if you're picked upcarrying a knife or a length of tire chain or something, why, you're onyour way to a Hallowe'en party and you're in costume. You're going as aJD.     The problem was this schoolyard. It was a block wide, with entranceson two streets. The street on the north was Challenger territory, andthe street on the south was Scarlet Raider territory, and both sidesclaimed the schoolyard. There had been a few skirmishes, a few guysfrom both gangs had been jumped and knocked around a little, but thathad been all. Finally, the War Lords from the two gangs had met, anddetermined that the matter could only be settled in a war.     The time was chosen: Hallowe'en. The place was chosen: the schoolyard.The weapons were chosen: pocket knives and tire chains okay, but nopistols or zip-guns. The time was fixed: eleven P.M. And the winnerwould have undisputed territorial rights to the schoolyard, bothentrances.     The night of the rumble, the gangs assembled in their separateclubrooms for last-minute instructions. Debs were sent out to playchicken at the intersections nearest the schoolyard, both to warn ofthe approach of cops and to keep out any non-combatant kids who mightcome wandering through.     Judy Canzanetti was a Deb with the Scarlet Raiders. She was fifteenyears old, short and black-haired and pretty in a movie-magazine,gum-chewing sort of way. She was proud of being in the Auxiliary of theScarlet Raiders, and proud also of the job that had been assigned toher. She was to stand chicken on the southwest corner of the street.     Judy took up her position at five minutes to eleven. The streets weredark and quiet. Few people cared to walk this neighborhood after dark,particularly on Hallowe'en. Judy leaned her back against the telephonepole on the corner, stuck her hands in the pockets of her ScarletRaider jacket and waited.     At eleven o'clock, she heard indistinct noises begin behind her. Therumble had started.     At five after eleven, a bunch of little kids came wandering down thestreet. They were all about ten or eleven years old, and most of themcarried trick-or-treat shopping bags. Some of them had Hallowe'en maskson.     They started to make the turn toward the schoolyard. Judy said, Hey,you kids. Take off.     One of them, wearing a red mask, turned to look at her. Who, us?     Yes, you! Stay out of that street. Go on down that way.     The subway's this way, objected the kid in the red mask.     Who cares? You go around the other way.   <doc-sep> Captain Hanks was still in his realistic cycle this morning, and he wasimpatient as well. All right, Stevenson, he said. Make it fast, I'vegot a lot to do this morning. And I hope it isn't this comic-book thingof yours again.     I'm afraid it is, Captain, said Stevenson. Did you see the morningpaper?     So what?     Did you see that thing about the gang fight up in Manhattan?     Captain Hanks sighed. Stevenson, he said wearily, are you going totry to connect every single time the word 'scorpion' comes up? What'sthe problem with this one? These kid gangs have names, so what?     Neither one of them was called 'The Scorpions,' Stevenson toldhim. One of them was the Scarlet Raiders and the other gang was theChallengers.     So they changed their name, said Hanks.     Both gangs? Simultaneously? To the same name?     Why not? Maybe that's what they were fighting over.     It was a territorial war, Stevenson reminded him. They've admittedthat much. It says so in the paper. And it also says they all deny everseeing that word on their jackets until after the fight.     A bunch of juvenile delinquents, said Hanks in disgust. You taketheir word?     Captain, did you read the article in the paper?     I glanced through it.     All right. Here's what they say happened: They say they startedfighting at eleven o'clock. And they just got going when all at onceall the metal they were carrying\u2014knives and tire chains and coins andbelt buckles and everything else\u2014got freezing cold, too cold to touch.And then their leather jackets got freezing cold, so cold they had topull them off and throw them away. And when the jackets were latercollected, across the name of the gang on the back of each one had beenbranded 'The Scorpion.'     Now, let      me     tell      you     something, said Hanks severely. They heardthe police sirens, and they threw all their weapons away. Then theythrew their jackets away, to try to make believe they hadn't beenpart of the gang that had been fighting. But they were caught beforethey could get out of the schoolyard. If the squad cars had showedup a minute later, the schoolyard wouldn't have had anything in itbut weapons and jackets, and the kids would have been all over theneighborhood, nice as you please, minding their own business and notbothering anybody.      That's     what happened. And all this talk aboutfreezing cold and branding names into jackets is just some smart-alecpunk's idea of a way to razz the police. Now, you just go back toworrying about what's happening in this precinct and forget about kidgangs up in Manhattan and comic book things like the Scorpion, oryou're going to wind up like Wilcox, with that refrigerator business.Now, I don't want to hear any more about this nonsense, Stevenson.     Yes, sir, said Stevenson.  "

There was Mr. Featherhall athis desk, refusing to okay a personal check from a perfect stranger.There was the perfect stranger, an itinerant garage mechanic namedRodney (Rod) Strom, like the check said. There were Miss English andMiss Philicoff, the girls in the gilded teller cages. There was MisterAnderson, the guard, dozing by the door in his brown uniform.

But ever sincethe engines somewhere in the rear of the world had changed their tone,from the steady whining Rikud had heard all twenty-five years of hislife, to the sullen roar that came to his ears now, the feelings hadgrown.     If anyone else had noticed the change, he failed to mention it. Thisdisturbed Rikud, although he could not tell why.

That was the Doppler effect as the star'sradial velocity changed relative to the      Quest III     , as for forty hoursthe ship had decelerated.     They had seen many such stars come near out of the galaxy's glitteringbackdrop, and had seen them dwindle, turn red and go out as the      QuestIII     drove on its way once more, lashed by despair toward the speed oflight, leaving behind the mockery of yet another solitary and lifelessluminary unaccompanied by worlds where men might dwell.

The grownups talked in lowvoices, in tones of mingled eagerness and apprehension, of what mightlie at the long journey's end. For the      Quest III     was coming home; thesun ahead was      the     Sun, whose rays had warmed their lives' beginning.  "

        "Query": "What is the connection between Stevenson and Hanks in CALL HIM NEMESIS?",
        "Summary_1": "Stevenson and Hanks have a tense relationship. Though they are both in high positions at the police precinct, Hanks is the Captain, Stevenson's superior. This power dynamic is evident throughout the story, particularly when Stevenson tries to bring up his theories and suspicions about The Scorpion. Instead of hearing him out, Hanks refuses to listen, becoming increasingly frustrated and calling Stevenson's thoughts childlike nonsense. Despite this, Stevenson is still determined to get his idea through to Hanks.",
        "Summary_2": "There are multiple settings in this story. The first part of this story is set in a bank, where the hostages are ousted against the back wall. That is until the action is taken out onto the street, where a high speed car chase and shootout take place between the police and the perpetrators. \nIn the next part of the story, we see the precaint. Detective Steavenson takes the Chevy owner to the police garage around the corner. \nAfter this, the story moves to Southeast Brooklyn, to the home of Jerome Higgins, who after locking himself in his bedroom, shot his wife and sister, injuring one and killing the other. The house is surrounded on the street by neighbours and police. \nIn the final setting of the story, we see a schoolyard, which the Challengers and Scarlet Raiders are fighting for the right to control over. The rumble takes place on Halloween night. ",
        "Summary_3": "Hanks is the Precinct Captain, while Stevenson works under him as a Detective-Sergeant. Hanks and Stevenson share a good working relationship; however, Hank gets annoyed whenever Stevenson brings up his theories about \u201cThe Scorpion\u201d and thinks of them as nonsense. He refutes every point realistically, saying that Higgins burned the words onto the rifle himself. When Stevenson brings up the earlier robbery incident, Hanks refuses to accept those observations and says Stevenson\u2019s points are similar to that of a comic book. During the schoolyard incident, Hank is extremely annoyed at Stevenson trying to connect more points to \u2018The Scorpion\u2019 and tells him that the children just had a silly brawl. He also warns Stevenson to stop thinking about these foolish ideas and return to doing his job in the precinct. \n\n",
        "Summary_4": "Stevenson and Hanks are both important people in the police with years of experience. They have completely different views on the described crimes. Stevenson wants to check every possibility, something doesn't adds up for him and he wants to keep investigating. He is determined to find out the truth and he is passionate about it, he is also emotional in proving his point and thinks a lot about the cases. Hanks simply wants to close the cases as fast as possible and Stevenson's guesses irritate him. He is not interested in other possibilities and has rather realistic explanations. He uses his position and authority to threaten Stevenson into shutting up and stopping irritated Hanks.",
        "Article": "Captain Hanks was still in his realistic cycle this morning, and he wasimpatient as well. All right, Stevenson, he said. Make it fast, I'vegot a lot to do this morning. And I hope it isn't this comic-book thingof yours again.     I'm afraid it is, Captain, said Stevenson. Did you see the morningpaper?     So what?     Did you see that thing about the gang fight up in Manhattan?     Captain Hanks sighed. Stevenson, he said wearily, are you going totry to connect every single time the word 'scorpion' comes up? What'sthe problem with this one? These kid gangs have names, so what?     Neither one of them was called 'The Scorpions,' Stevenson toldhim. One of them was the Scarlet Raiders and the other gang was theChallengers.     So they changed their name, said Hanks.     Both gangs? Simultaneously? To the same name?     Why not? Maybe that's what they were fighting over.     It was a territorial war, Stevenson reminded him. They've admittedthat much. It says so in the paper. And it also says they all deny everseeing that word on their jackets until after the fight.     A bunch of juvenile delinquents, said Hanks in disgust. You taketheir word?     Captain, did you read the article in the paper?     I glanced through it.     All right. Here's what they say happened: They say they startedfighting at eleven o'clock. And they just got going when all at onceall the metal they were carrying\u2014knives and tire chains and coins andbelt buckles and everything else\u2014got freezing cold, too cold to touch.And then their leather jackets got freezing cold, so cold they had topull them off and throw them away. And when the jackets were latercollected, across the name of the gang on the back of each one had beenbranded 'The Scorpion.'     Now, let      me     tell      you     something, said Hanks severely. They heardthe police sirens, and they threw all their weapons away. Then theythrew their jackets away, to try to make believe they hadn't beenpart of the gang that had been fighting. But they were caught beforethey could get out of the schoolyard. If the squad cars had showedup a minute later, the schoolyard wouldn't have had anything in itbut weapons and jackets, and the kids would have been all over theneighborhood, nice as you please, minding their own business and notbothering anybody.      That's     what happened. And all this talk aboutfreezing cold and branding names into jackets is just some smart-alecpunk's idea of a way to razz the police. Now, you just go back toworrying about what's happening in this precinct and forget about kidgangs up in Manhattan and comic book things like the Scorpion, oryou're going to wind up like Wilcox, with that refrigerator business.Now, I don't want to hear any more about this nonsense, Stevenson.     Yes, sir, said Stevenson.   <doc-sep> You don't get to be Precinct Captain on nothing but politicalconnections. Those help, of course, but you need more than that. AsCaptain Hanks was fond of pointing out, you needed as well to be bothmore imaginative than most\u2014You gotta be able to second-guess thesmart boys\u2014and to be a complete realist\u2014You gotta have both feeton the ground. If these were somewhat contradictory qualities, it wasbest not to mention the fact to Captain Hanks.     The realist side of the captain's nature was currently at the fore.Just what are you trying to say, Stevenson? he demanded.     I'm not sure, admitted Stevenson. But we've got these two things.First, there's the getaway car from that bank job. The wheels melt forno reason at all, and somebody burns 'The Scorpion' onto the trunk.Then, yesterday, this guy Higgins out in Canarsie. He says the rifleall of a sudden got too hot to hold, and he's got the burn marks toprove it. And there on the rifle stock it is again. 'The Scorpion'.     He says he put that on there himself, said the captain.     Stevenson shook his head. His      lawyer     says he put it on there.Higgins says he doesn't remember doing it. That's half the lawyer'scase. He's trying to build up an insanity defense.     He put it on there himself, Stevenson, said the captain with wearypatience. What are you trying to prove?     I don't know. All I know is it's the nuttiest thing I ever saw. Andwhat about the getaway car? What about those tires melting?     They were defective, said Hanks promptly.     All four of them at once? And what about the thing written on thetrunk?     How do I know? demanded the captain. Kids put it on before the carwas stolen, maybe. Or maybe the hoods did it themselves, who knows?What do      they     say?     They say they didn't do it, said Stevenson. And they say they neversaw it before the robbery and they would have noticed it if it'd beenthere.     The captain shook his head. I don't get it, he admitted. What areyou trying to prove?     I guess, said Stevenson slowly, thinking it out as he went along, Iguess I'm trying to prove that somebody melted those tires, and madethat rifle too hot, and left his signature behind.     What? You mean like in the comic books? Come on, Stevenson! What areyou trying to hand me?     All I know, insisted Stevenson, is what I see.     And all      I     know, the captain told him, is Higgins put that name onhis rifle himself. He says so.     And what made it so hot?     Hell, man, he'd been firing that thing at people for an hour! What doyou      think     made it hot?     All of a sudden?     He noticed it all of a sudden, when it started to burn him.     How come the same name showed up each time, then? Stevenson askeddesperately.     How should I know? And why not, anyway? You know as well as I do thesethings happen. A bunch of teen-agers burgle a liquor store and theywrite 'The Golden Avengers' on the plate glass in lipstick. It happensall the time. Why not 'The Scorpion'? It couldn't occur to two people?     But there's no explanation\u2014 started Stevenson.     What do you mean, there's no explanation? I just      gave     you theexplanation. Look, Stevenson, I'm a busy man. You got a nuttyidea\u2014like Wilcox a few years ago, remember him? Got the idea therewas a fiend around loose, stuffing all those kids into abandonedrefrigerators to starve. He went around trying to prove it, and gettingall upset, and pretty soon they had to put him away in the nut hatch.Remember?     I remember, said Stevenson.     Forget this silly stuff, Stevenson, the captain advised him.     Yes, sir, said Stevenson....     The day after Jerome Higgins went berserk, the afternoon mail brought acrank letter to the      Daily News     :     Dear Mr. Editor,     You did not warn your readers. The man who shot all those people couldnot escape the Scorpion. The Scorpion fights crime. No criminal issafe from the Scorpion. WARN YOUR READERS.     Sincerely yours,     THE SCORPION     Unfortunately, this letter was not read by the same individual who hadseen the first one, two months before. At any rate, it was filed in thesame place, and forgotten.      III     Hallowe'en is a good time for a rumble. There's too many kids aroundfor the cops to keep track of all of them, and if you're picked upcarrying a knife or a length of tire chain or something, why, you're onyour way to a Hallowe'en party and you're in costume. You're going as aJD.     The problem was this schoolyard. It was a block wide, with entranceson two streets. The street on the north was Challenger territory, andthe street on the south was Scarlet Raider territory, and both sidesclaimed the schoolyard. There had been a few skirmishes, a few guysfrom both gangs had been jumped and knocked around a little, but thathad been all. Finally, the War Lords from the two gangs had met, anddetermined that the matter could only be settled in a war.     The time was chosen: Hallowe'en. The place was chosen: the schoolyard.The weapons were chosen: pocket knives and tire chains okay, but nopistols or zip-guns. The time was fixed: eleven P.M. And the winnerwould have undisputed territorial rights to the schoolyard, bothentrances.     The night of the rumble, the gangs assembled in their separateclubrooms for last-minute instructions. Debs were sent out to playchicken at the intersections nearest the schoolyard, both to warn ofthe approach of cops and to keep out any non-combatant kids who mightcome wandering through.     Judy Canzanetti was a Deb with the Scarlet Raiders. She was fifteenyears old, short and black-haired and pretty in a movie-magazine,gum-chewing sort of way. She was proud of being in the Auxiliary of theScarlet Raiders, and proud also of the job that had been assigned toher. She was to stand chicken on the southwest corner of the street.     Judy took up her position at five minutes to eleven. The streets weredark and quiet. Few people cared to walk this neighborhood after dark,particularly on Hallowe'en. Judy leaned her back against the telephonepole on the corner, stuck her hands in the pockets of her ScarletRaider jacket and waited.     At eleven o'clock, she heard indistinct noises begin behind her. Therumble had started.     At five after eleven, a bunch of little kids came wandering down thestreet. They were all about ten or eleven years old, and most of themcarried trick-or-treat shopping bags. Some of them had Hallowe'en maskson.     They started to make the turn toward the schoolyard. Judy said, Hey,you kids. Take off.     One of them, wearing a red mask, turned to look at her. Who, us?     Yes, you! Stay out of that street. Go on down that way.     The subway's this way, objected the kid in the red mask.     Who cares? You go around the other way.   <doc-sep> It was the nuttiest thing, said Detective-Sergeant Stevenson. Anoperation planned that well, you'd think they'd pay attention to theirgetaway car, you know what I mean?     Detective-Sergeant Pauling shrugged. They always slip up, he said.Sooner or later, on some minor detail, they always slip up.     Yes, but their      tires     .     Well, said Pauling, it was a stolen car. I suppose they just grabbedwhatever was handiest.     What I can't figure out, said Stevenson, is exactly what made thosetires do that. I mean, it was a hot day and all, but it wasn't      that     hot. And they weren't going that fast. I don't think you could go fastenough to melt your tires down.     Pauling shrugged again. We got them. That's the important thing.     Still and all, it's nutty. They're free and clear, barrelling outRockaway toward the Belt, and all at once their tires melt, the tubesblow out and there they are. Stevenson shook his head. I can't figureit.     Don't look a gift horse in the mouth, suggested Pauling. They pickedthe wrong car to steal.     And      that     doesn't make sense, either, said Stevenson. Why steal acar that could be identified as easily as that one?     Why? What was it, a foreign make?     No, it was a Chevvy, two-tone, three years old, looked just like halfthe cars on the streets. Except that in the trunk lid the owner hadburned in 'The Scorpion' in big black letters you could see half ablock away.     Maybe they didn't notice it when they stole the car, said Pauling.     For a well-planned operation like this one, said Stevenson, theymade a couple of really idiotic boners. It doesn't make any sense.     What do they have to say about it? Pauling demanded.     Nothing, what do you expect? They'll make no statement at all.     The squad-room door opened, and a uniformed patrolman stuck his headin. The owner of that Chevvy's here, he said.     Right, said Stevenson. He followed the patrolman down the hall to thefront desk.     The owner of the Chevvy was an angry-looking man of middle age, talland paunchy. John Hastings, he said. They say you have my car here.     I believe so, yes, said Stevenson. I'm afraid it's in pretty badshape.     So I was told over the phone, said Hastings grimly. I've contactedmy insurance company.     Good. The car's in the police garage, around the corner. If you'd comewith me?  "

        "Summary_1": "The Scorpion is a mysterious figure, self-proclaimed to be fighting crime, as stated in the crank letters to the Daily Mail. The true identity of The Scorpion is unknown, and no one has ever seen him. However, The Scorpion is a powerful force in the story, as he ends up being responsible for the capturing of several criminals. The Scorpion makes his presence known by tagging his signature at different crime scenes through branding, but the characters in the story, especially Stevenson, are determined to know who he is.",
        "Summary_2": "The Scorpion is an unknown vigilante, who seeks to fight crime, with some mysterious super power. They send messages to the daily news, asking them to warn their readers that they will be after any criminals. It seems as though whoever they are, they have the ability to control heat in objects. They melt the tires of the Chevy, they heat the gun to such an intense level that it burns Mr. Higgins' hands, and they cool the weapons and jackets of the two hangs so much that they have to get rid of both. Detective Stevenson thinks that the scorpion is all the same force, affecting these three cases, but his boss, Captain Hanks, doesn't see one. \n",
        "Summary_3": "\u201cThe Scorpion\u201d is an anonymous bringer of justice. Their identity is never revealed, but they send warning letters to the Daily News explaining their intentions of stopping crime and helping the police arrest the criminals to bring justice. They are significant because the crimes could have gotten out of hand without them. In the first case, it looked as though the robbers would get away, but \u201cThe Scorpion\u201d managed to stop them in time for the police to come. They can also help stop crime a lot faster than the police. Furthermore, \u201cThe Scorpion\u201d also becomes an object of interest for Stevenson and leads him to start following these patterns. \n",
        "Summary_4": "\"The Scorpion\"'s identity is not exposed. It is a person or an organization which decided to take the mission of fighting crime. He is like a modern superhero dealing with any kind of crime. He stops the criminals and makes them surrender to the police. After every intervention he leaves an inscription saying \"The Scorpion\" as a mark of his intervention. He also sends letters to a newspaper warning people about his existence.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      The man with the handkerchief mask said, All right, everybody, keeptight. This is a holdup.     There were twelve people in the bank. There was Mr. Featherhall athis desk, refusing to okay a personal check from a perfect stranger.There was the perfect stranger, an itinerant garage mechanic namedRodney (Rod) Strom, like the check said. There were Miss English andMiss Philicoff, the girls in the gilded teller cages. There was MisterAnderson, the guard, dozing by the door in his brown uniform. There wasMrs. Elizabeth Clayhorn, depositing her husband's pay check in theirjoint checking account, and with her was her ten-year-old son Edward(Eddie) Clayhorn, Junior. There was Charlie Casale, getting ten dollarsdimes, six dollars nickels and four dollars pennies for his fatherin the grocery store down the street. There was Mrs. Dolly Daniels,withdrawing money from her savings account again. And there were threebank robbers.     The three bank robbers looked like triplets. From the ground up, theyall wore scuffy black shoes, baggy-kneed and unpressed khaki trousers,brown cracked-leather jackets over flannel shirts, white handkerchiefsover the lower half of their faces and gray-and-white check caps pulledlow over their eyes. The eyes themselves looked dangerous.     The man who had spoken withdrew a small but mean-looking thirty-twocalibre pistol from his jacket pocket. He waved it menacingly. One ofthe others took the pistol away from Mister Anderson, the guard, andsaid to him in a low voice, Think about retirement, my friend. Thethird one, who carried a black satchel like a doctor's bag, walkedquickly around behind the teller's counter and started filling it withmoney.     It was just like the movies.     The man who had first spoken herded the tellers, Mr. Featherhall andthe customers all over against the back wall, while the second manstayed next to Mr. Anderson and the door. The third man stuffed moneyinto the black satchel.     The man by the door said, Hurry up.     The man with the satchel said, One more drawer.     The man with the gun turned to say to the man at the door, Keep yourshirt on.     That was all Miss English needed. She kicked off her shoes and ranpelting in her stocking feet for the door.   <doc-sep> Captain Hanks was still in his realistic cycle this morning, and he wasimpatient as well. All right, Stevenson, he said. Make it fast, I'vegot a lot to do this morning. And I hope it isn't this comic-book thingof yours again.     I'm afraid it is, Captain, said Stevenson.

Yes, sir, said Stevenson.   <doc-sep> On the way around, Stevenson said, I believe you reported the carstolen almost immediately after it happened.     That's right, said Hastings. I stepped into a bar on my route. I'ma wine and liquor salesman. When I came out five minutes later, my carwas gone.     You left the keys in it?     Well, why not? demanded Hastings belligerently. If I'm making justa quick stop\u2014I never spend more than five minutes with any onecustomer\u2014I always leave the keys in the car. Why not?     The car was stolen, Stevenson reminded him.     Hastings grumbled and glared. It's always been perfectly safe up tillnow.     Yes, sir. In here.     Hastings took one look at his car and hit the ceiling. It's ruined!he cried. What did you do to the tires?     Not a thing, sir. That happened to them in the holdup.     Hastings leaned down over one of the front tires. Look at that!There's melted rubber all over the rims. Those rims are ruined! Whatdid you use, incendiary bullets?     Stevenson shook his head. No, sir. When that happened they were twoblocks away from the nearest policeman.     Hmph. Hastings moved on around the car, stopping short to exclaim,What in the name of God is that? You didn't tell me a bunch of      kids     had stolen the car.     It wasn't a bunch of kids, Stevenson told him. It was fourprofessional criminals, I thought you knew that. They were using it ina bank holdup.     Then why did they do      that     ?     Stevenson followed Hastings' pointing finger, and saw again thecrudely-lettered words, The Scorpion burned black into the paint ofthe trunk lid. I really don't know, he said. It wasn't there beforethe car was stolen?     Of course not!     Stevenson frowned. Now, why in the world did they do that?     I suggest, said Hastings with heavy sarcasm, you ask them that.     Stevenson shook his head. It wouldn't do any good. They aren't talkingabout anything. I don't suppose they'll ever tell us. He looked at thetrunk lid again. It's the nuttiest thing, he said thoughtfully....     That was on Wednesday.     The Friday afternoon mail delivery to the      Daily News     brought a crankletter. It was in the crank letter's most obvious form; that is,the address had been clipped, a letter or a word at a time, from anewspaper and glued to the envelope. There was no return address.     The letter itself was in the same format. It was brief and to the point:     Dear Mr. Editor:     The Scorpion has struck. The bank robbers were captured. The Scorpionfights crime. Crooks and robbers are not safe from the avengingScorpion. WARN YOUR READERS!     Sincerely yours,     THE SCORPION     The warning was duly noted, and the letter filed in the wastebasket. Itdidn't rate a line in the paper.      II     The bank robbery occurred in late June. Early in August, a Brooklyn manwent berserk.     It happened in Canarsie, a section in southeast Brooklyn near JamaicaBay. This particular area of Canarsie was a residential neighborhood,composed of one and two family houses. The man who went berserk was aMotor Vehicle Bureau clerk named Jerome Higgins.     Two days before, he had flunked a Civil Service examination for thethird time. He reported himself sick and spent the two days at home,brooding, a bottle of blended whiskey at all times in his hand.     As the police reconstructed it later, Mrs. Higgins had attempted toawaken him on the third morning at seven-thirty, suggesting that hereally ought to stop being so foolish, and go back to work. He thenallegedly poked her in the eye, and locked her out of the bedroom.     Mrs. Higgins then apparently called her sister-in-law, a Mrs. ThelmaStodbetter, who was Mr. Higgins' sister. Mrs. Stodbetter arrived at thehouse at nine o'clock, and spent some time tapping at the still-lockedbedroom door, apparently requesting Mr. Higgins to unlock the door andstop acting like a child. Neighbors reported to the police that theyheard Mr. Higgins shout a number of times, Go away! Can't you let aman sleep?     At about ten-fifteen, neighbors heard shots from the Higgins residence,a two-story one-family pink stucco affair in the middle of a block ofsimilar homes. Mr. Higgins, it was learned later, had suddenly eruptedfrom his bedroom, brandishing a .30-.30 hunting rifle and, beingannoyed at the shrieks of his wife and sister, had fired seven shellsat them, killing his wife on the spot and wounding his sister in thehand and shoulder.     Mrs. Stodbetter, wounded and scared out of her wits, raced screamingout the front door of the house, crying for the police and shouting,Murder! Murder! At this point, neighbors called the police. Oneneighbor additionally phoned three newspapers and two televisionstations, thereby earning forty dollars in news-tips rewards.  "

        "Query": "Can you give me a summary of the storyline in THE BIG HEADACHE?",
        "Summary_1": "Ferris and Mitchell discuss the struggles they are experiencing with their research. They are eager to test their new research and want the test subject to be Elliot Macklin, a well-known and attractive scientist with a reputation akin to Albert Einstein. Macklin experiences migraines and the two believe that their injection shot could cure them. The two want Macklin to participate because it could ensure that their research will have strong financial support.\n\nMacklin soon enters their laboratory and begins to ask about what they\u2019re looking to do with their research. Ferris and Mitchell discuss their theory with Macklin and how their supposed cure works. They mention to Macklin, to his dismay, that it has only been tested on animals. Macklin is skeptical and considers the injection too risky and initially does not agree to take the treatment. \n\nMacklin begins to start experiencing a migraine. As he suffers through a migraine, Ferris and Mitchell use the opportunity to try again to convince him to participate in the research. They further emphasize the very minimal potential risk. Macklin finally agrees to take the injection due to the immense pain he is experiencing. \n\nLater on, Mitchell is upset with Ferris for sharing their unverified results with the press. Ferris exclaims to Mitchell that the experiment with Macklin was a success and that he should not be concerned. The phone rings and Ferris answers it but quickly passes it to Mitchell. Macklin\u2019s wife is on the phone accusing them of giving her husband heroin as Macklin appears to be in a trance. The doctors are concerned by the news and decide to check on the test animals. They do not find anything of concern with the test animals and go to Macklin\u2019s house. Ferris does not seem worried to Mitchell as they wait to be let into the house. When they enter the house, an army Colonel meets them and expresses his unhappiness with their actions. \n\nAs the group heads into the living room, they greet an army physician that tells them that medically there is nothing wrong with Macklin\u2019s health the only difference is that Macklin is no longer a mathematical genius. The three go into the hallway and discuss how the experiment most likely went wrong. The Colonel becomes upset because Macklin was very important to many missions because of his invaluable research. Mitchell suddenly exclaims that he thinks that Macklin can be cured. \n\nHowever, Macklin overhears the possibility of a cure and protests receiving the treatment. The Colonel is upset at Macklin\u2019s reaction and tries to convince Macklin\u2019s wife to force him to be cured. Macklin\u2019s wife does not wish to go against her husband\u2019s wishes. They leave the house without convincing Macklin or his wife. Later on, Mitchell wakes up and calls Macklin. Mitchell attempts to get Macklin to trust him and goes about luring Macklin back to the laboratory by saying that he can help with the new types of worries that Macklin experiences. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Dr. Mitchell and Dr. Ferris are preparing to test out their new medical breakthrough on world renowned scientist, Dr. Macklin. Their new injection that they have discovered will potentially cure Macklin of his incessant migraines, which plague the genius' daily life. Macklin is famed for being at the forefront of the research team that is almost finished developing a faster than light drive, to help the US army reach Pluto. The only thing in the way of the completion of this project could be Macklin's headaches. Mitchell and Ferris ask Macklin if he would like to be the trial patient for their new antidote, which they only have funding to test out on one person. The antidote consists of a virus that is injected into a specific spot in the brain, blocking off oxygen from entering, curing the patient of any headaches. After walking Macklin through the science behind it and Macklin signing some waivers, they deliver the treatment to him. \nThe next day, Ferris gives the story of their success with the Doctor to the newspapers, that is until they get a call form Macklin's wife. She tells him that her husband seems to be high on a form of heroin. To this the two scientists protest, but then go to check on their previous animal test subjects to see their state. All the animals tested appear fine, yet subdued. They decide to go and check up on Macklin. \nThey arrive at his house to meet a colonel at the door, who invites them into the living room, where Macklin is sitting. He has just been evaluated by the doctor, and it turns out that the vaccine has reduced his brain capacity, to the point where he is now a \"moron\". The oxygen that the brain has been denied has made Macklin stupid, almost childlike. The two scientists propose they can fix this quite easily, and they just need to reverse the treatment they gave him, which would return him to his original state. Both Macklin and his wife refuse this. Macklin wants to live a life without pain, and the thoughts about the universe that would keep him up worrying, late at night. His wife tells the men that she doesn't want to go against her husband's wishes, and if the US government wants to take the pair to court over it, so that Macklin might regain full consciousness and continue with his work on the Pluto project, the court would side in her and her husband's favour. \nThe men leave, defeated. That is until Mitchell wakes up in the middle of the night, and calls Macklin, convincing him that it's in his best interest to come to his lab, so that he might make him better. The colonel has given his wife a sedative, so she won't wake up. Macklin leaves to unknowingly go to have his treatment reversed. ",
        "Summary_3": "The story starts with Steven Mitchell and Harold Ferris arguing over the candidate that they should test their discovery on. While Ferris suggests Mitchell to be the candidate, Mitchell points out that it wouldn\u2019t be ethical. He suggests that Elliot Macklin, the late Albert Einstein, has more reputation and his migraine is well known. He is the perfect candidate they have. After a knock on the door, Mitchell and Ferris invite Macklin inside. They introduce the injection and claim that his headache can be cured forever with this one simple injection. Macklin notices that they have not yet tested this on a human being, but they assert that it worked fine on rats and chimps. They explain their situation to Macklin, which is a lack of time and money. They have the resources to cure one person. However, Macklin is still suspicious of the injection. Mitchell and Ferris assure that there is practically no possibility of getting a low enough blood pressure to stop the heart. Along with another attack of the migraine, Macklin gives them permission to inject. \n\nMacklin\u2019s wife calls and blames them for giving her husband heroin. Being confused, Mitchell and Ferris look at the test animals and realize that the ones with injections are much more calmer and have less energy. They go to see Macklin. Macklin has become the healthiest, happiest person, but he also becomes a moron, namely not very intelligent. After Mitchell explains that he has the antitoxin to fix him, Carson demands them to give it to Macklin. However, Macklin refuses. He used to be worried all the time, but now he is peaceful. Since he is legally responsible, he can definitely refuse the antitoxin. Thus, they go to Mrs. Macklin, hoping that she will be able to persuade Macklin to take the antitoxin. She also refuses. Later, Mitchell calls Macklin pointing out that he is still doing a lot of thinking. Mitchell tells him that he can get rid of them if he wants. ",
        "Summary_4": "Ferris and Mitchell are two biologists that are in the process of developing a cure to the common headache. They want to test their cure on Elliot Macklin, a well-known genius mathematician who suffered from a stroke and is victim to periodic migraines. Macklin arrives, and the two inform him of their plan. They want to create a cure to the headache using an injection of a virus that attacks pituitrin, which causes migraines. They have had no confirmation of success of their cure on humans, only animals, so there is uncertainty with their experiment. Macklin initially tells them that there is too much of a risk, and that too many people rely on him for him to take the risk. However, after some consideration, Macklin agrees to take the injection. Later on, Mitchell scolds Ferris after learning that he had released the story to the press, despite the results not being confirmed yet. They then receive a call from Macklin's wife, hsyterically accusing them of giving Macklin narcotics and claiming that he has been put under a trance. Ferris and Mitchell visit Macklin, where they meet a team of Army doctors and officials, and find Macklin to be in a mellow, relaxed state. The army doctor claims that Macklin is happy and healthy, but that the injection has caused him to become dumber due to a miscalculation. Ferris and Mitchell suggest fixing the issue by wiping out the virus, but Macklin refuses, not wanting to return to his previous state. They ask Mrs. Macklin, who wants to support her husband's best interests. The two suspect that she is jealous of Macklin's genius and wants to keep him subdued in his current condition. One night, Mitchell wakes and calls Macklin, asking him to come to his lab to fix him. ",

But those crummy trustees didn't even leave us enough for afield test. Ferris scrubbed his thin hand over the bony ridge of hisforehead.

Ferris, would you consider\u2014?     No! the smaller man yelled. You can't expect me to violateprofessional ethics and test my own discovery on myself.           Our     discovery, Mitchell said politely.     That's what I meant to say. But I'm not sure it would be completelyethical with even a discovery partly mine.     You're right. Besides who cares if you or I are cured of headaches?Our reputations don't go outside our own fields, Mitchell said. Butnow Macklin\u2014     Elliot Macklin had inherited the reputation of the late Albert Einsteinin the popular mind. He was the man people thought of when the wordmathematician or even scientist was mentioned. No one knew whetherhis Theory of Spatium was correct or not because no one had yet beenable to frame an argument with it. Macklin was in his early fifties butlooked in his late thirties, with the build of a football player. Thegovernment took up a lot of his time using him as the symbol of theIdeal Scientist to help recruit Science and Engineering Cadets.     For the past seven years Macklin\u2014who      was     the Advanced StudiesDepartment of Firestone University\u2014had been involved in devising afaster-than-light drive to help the Army reach Pluto and eventually thenearer stars. Mitchell had overheard two coeds talking and so knewthat the project was nearing completion. If so, it was a case of      Adastra per aspirin     .     The only thing that could delay the project was Macklin's health.     Despite his impressive body, some years before he had suffered a mildstroke ... or at least a vascular spasm of a cerebral artery. It wasknown that he suffered from the vilest variety of migraine. A cycle ofthe headaches had caused him to be absent from his classes for severalweeks, and there were an unusual number of military uniforms seenaround the campus.   <doc-sep> Ferris paced off the tidy measurements of the office outside thelaboratory in the biology building. Mitchell sat slumped in the chairbehind the blond imitation wood desk, watching him disinterestedly.     Do you suppose the Great Man will actually show up? Ferris demanded,pausing in mid-stride.     I imagine he will, Mitchell said. Macklin's always seemed a decentenough fellow when I've had lunch with him or seen him at the trusteesmeetings.     He's always treated me like dirt, Ferris said heatedly. Everyone onthis campus treats biologists like dirt. Sometimes I want to bash intheir smug faces.     Sometimes, Mitchell reflected, Ferris displayed a certain lack ofscientific detachment.     There came a discreet knock on the door.     Please come in, Mitchell said.     Elliot Macklin entered in a cloud of pipe smoke and a tweed jacket. Helooked more than a little like a postgraduate student, and Mitchellsuspected that that was his intention.     He shook hands warmly with Mitchell. Good of you to ask me over,Steven.     Macklin threw a big arm across Ferris' shoulders. How have you been,Harold?     Ferris' face flickered between pink and white. Fine, thank you,doctor.     Macklin dropped on the edge of the desk and adjusted his pipe. Nowwhat's this about you wanting my help on something? And please keep theexplanation simple. Biology isn't my field, you know.     Mitchell moved around the desk casually. Actually, Doctor, we haven'tthe right to ask this of a man of your importance. There may be anelement of risk.     The mathematician clamped onto his pipe and showed his teeth. Now youhave me intrigued. What is it all about?     Doctor, we understand you have severe headaches, Mitchell said.     Macklin nodded. That's right, Steven. Migraine.     That must be terrible, Ferris said. All your fine reputation andlavish salary can't be much consolation when that ripping, tearingagony begins, can it?     No, Harold, it isn't, Macklin admitted. What does your project haveto do with my headaches?     Doctor, Mitchell said, what would you say the most common complaintof man is?     I would have said the common cold, Macklin replied, but I supposefrom what you have said you mean headaches.   <doc-sep> Headaches, Mitchell agreed. Everybody has them at some time in hislife. Some people have them every day. Some are driven to suicide bytheir headaches.     Yes, Macklin said.     But think, Ferris interjected, what a boon it would be if everyonecould be cured of headaches      forever     by one simple injection.     I don't suppose the manufacturers of aspirin would like you. But itwould please about everybody else.     Aspirins would still be used to reduce fever and relieve muscularpains, Mitchell said.     I see. Are you two saying you      have     such a shot? Can you cureheadaches?     We think we can, Ferris said.     How can you have a specific for a number of different causes? Macklinasked. I know that much about the subject.     There      are     a number of different causes for headaches\u2014nervousstrain, fatigue, physical diseases from kidney complaints to tumors,over-indulgence\u2014but there is one      effect     of all of this, the one realcause of headaches, Mitchell announced.     We have definitely established this for this first time, Ferris added.     That's fine, Macklin said, sucking on his pipe. And this effect thatproduces headaches is?     The pressure effect caused by pituitrin in the brain, Mitchellsaid eagerly. That is, the constriction of blood vessels in thetelencephalon section of the frontal lobes. It's caused by anover-production of the pituitary gland. We have artificially bred avirus that feeds on pituitrin.     That may mean the end of headaches, but I would think it would meanthe end of the race as well, Macklin said. In certain areas it isvaluable to have a constriction of blood vessels.     The virus, Ferris explained, can easily be localized and stabilized.A colony of virus in the brain cells will relax the cerebralvessels\u2014and only the cerebral vessels\u2014so that the cerebrospinal fluiddoesn't create pressure in the cavities of the brain.     The mathematician took the pipe out of his mouth. If this reallyworks, I could stop using that damned gynergen, couldn't I? The stuffmakes me violently sick to my stomach. But it's better than themigraine. How should I go about removing my curse? He reinserted thepipe.     I assure you, you can forget ergotamine tartrate, Ferris said. Ourdiscovery will work.  "

She's an intelligent woman unconsciously jealousof her husband's genius.     Maybe, Carson said. I don't know. I don't know what the hell to tellthe Pentagon. I think I'll go out and get drunk.     I'll go with you, Ferris said.     Mitchell glanced sharply at the little biologist.     Carson squinted. Any particular reason, doctor?     To celebrate, Ferris said.     The colonel shrugged. That's as good a reason as any.     On the street, Mitchell watched the two men go off together inbewilderment.      IV     Macklin was playing jacks.     He didn't have a head on his shoulders and he was squatting on a greatcurving surface that was Spacetime, and his jacks were Earth and Plutoand the rest of the planets. And for a ball he was using a head. Nothis head. Mitchell's. Both heads were initialed M so it was all thesame.       Mitchell forced himself to awaken, with some initial difficulty.     He lay there, blinking the sleep out of his eyes, listening to hisheart race, and then convulsively snatched the telephone receiver fromthe nightstand. He stabbed out a number with a vicious index finger.     After a time there came a dull click and a sleepy answer.     Hello? Elliot Macklin said.     Mitchell smiled to himself. He was in luck; Macklin had answered thephone instead of his wife.     Can you speak freely, doctor? Mitchell asked.     Of course, the mathematician said. I can talk fine.     I mean, are you alone?     Oh, you want to know if my wife is around. No, she's asleep. That Armydoctor, Colonel Sidney, he gave her a sedative. I wouldn't let him giveme anything, though.     Good boy, the biologist said. Listen, doctor\u2014Elliot\u2014El, old son.I'm not against you like all the others. I don't want to make you goback to all that worrying and thinking and headaches. You believe me,don't you?     There was a slight hesitation.     Sure, Macklin said, if you say so. Why shouldn't I believe you?     But there was a hesitation there, El. You worried for just a second ifI could have some reason for not telling you the truth.     I suppose so, Macklin said humbly.     You've found yourself worrying\u2014thinking\u2014about a lot of otherproblems since we left you, haven't you? Maybe not the same kind ofscientific problem. But more personal ones, ones you didn't used tohave time to think about.     If you say so.     Now, you know it's so. But how would you like to get rid of thoseworries just as you got rid of the others? Mitchell asked.     I guess I'd like that, the mathematician replied.     Then come on over to my laboratory. You remember where it's at, don'tyou?     No, I\u2014yes, I guess I do. But how do I know you won't try to put meback where I was instead of helping me more?     I couldn't do that against your wishes. That would be illegal!     If you say so. But I don't guess I can come anyway. The Army iswatching me pretty close.     That's alright, Mitchell said quickly. You can bring along ColonelCarson.     But he won't like you fixing me up more.     But he can't stop me! Not if you want me to do it. Now listen to me\u2014Iwant you to come right on over here, El.     If you say so, Macklin said uncertainly.   <doc-sep>    THE BIG HEADACHE     BY JIM HARMON     What's the principal cause of headaches?     Why, having a head, of course!     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Worlds of If Science Fiction, September 1962.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      I     Do you think we'll have to use force on Macklin to get him tocooperate in the experiment? Ferris asked eagerly.     How are you going to go about forcing him, Doctor? Mitchell inquired.He outweighs you by fifty pounds and you needn't look to      me     for helpagainst that repatriated fullback.     Ferris fingered the collar of his starched lab smock. Guess I gotcarried away for a moment. But Macklin is exactly what we need for aquick, dramatic test. We've had it if he turns us down.     I know, Mitchell said, exhaling deeply. Somehow the men with themoney just can't seem to understand basic research. Who would havefinanced a study of cyclic periods of the hedgehog? Yet the informationgained from that study is vital in cancer research.     When we prove our results that should be of enough practical value foranyone. But those crummy trustees didn't even leave us enough for afield test. Ferris scrubbed his thin hand over the bony ridge of hisforehead. I've been worrying so much about this I've got the ancestorof all headaches.     Mitchell's blue eyes narrowed and his boyish face took on an expressionof demonic intensity. Ferris, would you consider\u2014?     No! the smaller man yelled. You can't expect me to violateprofessional ethics and test my own discovery on myself.           Our     discovery, Mitchell said politely.     That's what I meant to say. But I'm not sure it would be completelyethical with even a discovery partly mine.     You're right. Besides who cares if you or I are cured of headaches?Our reputations don't go outside our own fields, Mitchell said. Butnow Macklin\u2014     Elliot Macklin had inherited the reputation of the late Albert Einsteinin the popular mind. He was the man people thought of when the wordmathematician or even scientist was mentioned. No one knew whetherhis Theory of Spatium was correct or not because no one had yet beenable to frame an argument with it. Macklin was in his early fifties butlooked in his late thirties, with the build of a football player. Thegovernment took up a lot of his time using him as the symbol of theIdeal Scientist to help recruit Science and Engineering Cadets.     For the past seven years Macklin\u2014who      was     the Advanced StudiesDepartment of Firestone University\u2014had been involved in devising afaster-than-light drive to help the Army reach Pluto and eventually thenearer stars. Mitchell had overheard two coeds talking and so knewthat the project was nearing completion. If so, it was a case of      Adastra per aspirin     .     The only thing that could delay the project was Macklin's health.     Despite his impressive body, some years before he had suffered a mildstroke ... or at least a vascular spasm of a cerebral artery. It wasknown that he suffered from the vilest variety of migraine. A cycle ofthe headaches had caused him to be absent from his classes for severalweeks, and there were an unusual number of military uniforms seenaround the campus.   <doc-sep> Ferris paced off the tidy measurements of the office outside thelaboratory in the biology building. Mitchell sat slumped in the chairbehind the blond imitation wood desk, watching him disinterestedly.     Do you suppose the Great Man will actually show up? Ferris demanded,pausing in mid-stride.     I imagine he will, Mitchell said. Macklin's always seemed a decentenough fellow when I've had lunch with him or seen him at the trusteesmeetings.     He's always treated me like dirt, Ferris said heatedly. Everyone onthis campus treats biologists like dirt. Sometimes I want to bash intheir smug faces.     Sometimes, Mitchell reflected, Ferris displayed a certain lack ofscientific detachment.     There came a discreet knock on the door.     Please come in, Mitchell said.     Elliot Macklin entered in a cloud of pipe smoke and a tweed jacket. Helooked more than a little like a postgraduate student, and Mitchellsuspected that that was his intention.     He shook hands warmly with Mitchell. Good of you to ask me over,Steven.     Macklin threw a big arm across Ferris' shoulders. How have you been,Harold?     Ferris' face flickered between pink and white. Fine, thank you,doctor.     Macklin dropped on the edge of the desk and adjusted his pipe. Nowwhat's this about you wanting my help on something? And please keep theexplanation simple. Biology isn't my field, you know.     Mitchell moved around the desk casually. Actually, Doctor, we haven'tthe right to ask this of a man of your importance. There may be anelement of risk.     The mathematician clamped onto his pipe and showed his teeth. Now youhave me intrigued. What is it all about?     Doctor, we understand you have severe headaches, Mitchell said.     Macklin nodded. That's right, Steven. Migraine.     That must be terrible, Ferris said. All your fine reputation andlavish salary can't be much consolation when that ripping, tearingagony begins, can it?     No, Harold, it isn't, Macklin admitted. What does your project haveto do with my headaches?     Doctor, Mitchell said, what would you say the most common complaintof man is?     I would have said the common cold, Macklin replied, but I supposefrom what you have said you mean headaches.  "

        "Query": "How does the experiment function and what are its mechanisms?",
        "Summary_1": "Ferris and Mitchell believe they have an injection that can cure headaches forever. They acknowledge during their initial discussion with Macklin that there is a potential risk with the injection, but they heavily downplay the risk. From their research, the two doctors believe that the over-production in the pituitary gland creates a pressure effect that constricts blood vessels in a section of the frontal lobe. Their injection is synthetically made that is meant to feed on the pituitrin that causes the pressure effect. They believe their virus is safe because it is able to target a specific area and remain stabilized within the brain cells. \n\nAfter they give Macklin the injection, they later receive news that he has become a moron and is no longer a mathematical genius. The injection was successful in stopping the pain but in doing so it stopped the brain cells from functioning properly because the vessels cannot pump the necessary amount of blood through the brain to maintain an active and alert mind. \n",
        "Summary_2": "The experiment is used to try and eliminate headaches. Headaches are said to cause pressure to pituitrin in the brain. It is a constriction of blood vessels in the front of the brain. This is caused by an overproduction of the pituitary gland. The two men have created a virus that feeds on this pituitrin. The localised virus will relax the cerebral vessels, so that the cerebrospinal fluid won't create pressure in the cavities of the brain. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Since headaches are caused by over-productions of the pituitary gland, which will constrict the blood vessels leading to pressure differences in the brain. Because the virus created by them feeds on pituitrin, the pressure effect can be eliminated. The experiment is to inject the right amount of virus into the body so that the brain cells will relax the pressure effect. Moreover, since the virus can be easily localized and stabilized, it will only affect the cerebral vessels. Other cavities of the brain will not be effected. However, in reality, there is a miscalculation and the amount of control needed in stopping the pain is too much for the brain cells to still function properly. ",
        "Summary_4": "The experiment that Ferris and Mitchell have come up with aims to cure headaches permanently. They plan to do so by targeting pituitrin, the main cause of constricting blood vessels that cause headaches. The cure is in the form of an injection containing a virus. This virus would feed on pituitrin and put an end to headache production. The virus can be stabilized, and is only designed to target the necessary vessels without interfering with other functions of the brain.",
        "Article": "Penobscot, Maine     July 20     Dear Joe:     Now you tell me not to drink alcohol. Why not? You never mentioned itin any of your vibrations to us, gleebs ago, when you first came acrossto this world. It will stint my powers? Nonsense! Already I have had aquart of the liquid today. I feel wonderful. Get that? I actually feelwonderful, in spite of this miserable imitation of a body.     There are long hours during which I am so well-integrated into thisbody and this world that I almost consider myself a member of it. NowI can function efficiently. I sent Blgftury some long reports todayoutlining my experiments in the realm of chemistry where we mustfinally defeat these people. Of course, I haven't made the experimentsyet, but I will. This is not deceit, merely realistic anticipation ofthe inevitable. Anyway, what the old xbyzrt doesn't know won't muss hisvibrations.     I went to what they call a nightclub here and picked out ablonde-haired woman, the kind that the books say men prefer. She wasattracted to me instantly. After all, the body I have devised isperfect in every detail ... actually a not-world ideal.     I didn't lose any time overwhelming her susceptibilities. I rememberdistinctly that just as I stooped to pick up a large roll of money Ihad dropped, her eyes met mine and in them I could see her admiration.We went to my suite and I showed her one of the money rooms. Would youbelieve it? She actually took off her shoes and ran around through themoney in her bare feet! Then we kissed.     Concealed in the dermis of the lips are tiny, highly sensitized nerveends which send sensations to the brain. The brain interprets theseimpulses in a certain manner. As a result, the fate of secretion in theadrenals on the ends of the kidneys increases and an enlivening of theentire endocrine system follows. Thus I felt the beginnings of love.     I sat her down on a pile of money and kissed her again. Again thetingling, again the secretion and activation. I integrated myselfquickly.     Now in all the motion pictures\u2014true representations of life and lovein this world\u2014the man with a lot of money or virtue kisses the girland tries to induce her to do something biological. She then refuses.This pleases both of them, for he wanted her to refuse. She, in turn,wanted him to want her, but also wanted to prevent him so that he wouldhave a high opinion of her. Do I make myself clear?     I kissed the blonde girl and gave her to understand what I then wanted.Well, you can imagine my surprise when she said yes! So I had failed. Ihad not found love.     I became so abstracted by this problem that the blonde girl fellasleep. I thoughtfully drank quantities of excellent alcohol called ginand didn't even notice when the blonde girl left.     I am now beginning to feel the effects of this alcohol again. Ha. Don'tI wish old Blgftury were here in the vibrational pattern of an olive?I'd get the blonde in and have her eat him out of a Martini. That is agin mixture.     I think I'll get a hot report off to the old so-and-so right now. It'lltake him a gleeb to figure this one out. I'll tell him I'm setting upan atomic reactor in the sewage systems here and that all we have to dois activate it and all the not-people will die of chain asphyxiation.     Boy, what an easy job this turned out to be. It's just a vacation. Joe,you old gold-bricker, imagine you here all these gleebs living off thefat of the land. Yak, yak. Affectionately.     Glmpauszn   <doc-sep> Fownes stopped on the porch to brush the plaster of paris off hisshoes. He hadn't seen the patrol car and this intense preoccupationof his was also responsible for the dancing house\u2014he simply hadn'tnoticed. There was a certain amount of vibration, of course. Hehad a bootleg pipe connected into the dome blower system, and thehigh-pressure air caused some buffeting against the thin walls of thehouse. At least, he called it buffeting; he'd never thought to watchfrom outside.     He went in and threw his jacket on the sofa, there being no roomleft in the closets. Crossing the living room he stopped to twist adraw-pull.     Every window slammed shut.     Tight as a kite, he thought, satisfied. He continued on toward thecloset at the foot of the stairs and then stopped again. Was thatright? No,      snug as a hug in a rug     . He went on, thinking:      The olddevils.       The downstairs closet was like a great watch case, a profusion ofwheels surrounding the Master Mechanism, which was a miniature see-sawthat went back and forth 365-1/4 times an hour. The wheels had acurious stateliness about them. They were all quite old, salvaged fromgrandfather's clocks and music boxes and they went around in gracefulcircles at the rate of 30 and 31 times an hour ... although therewas one slightly eccentric cam that vacillated between 28 and 29. Hewatched as they spun and flashed in the darkness, and then set them forseven o'clock in the evening, April seventh, any year.     Outside, the domed city vanished.     It was replaced by an illusion. Or, as Fownes hoped it might appear,the illusion of the domed city vanished and was replaced by a moresatisfactory, and, for his specific purpose, more functional, illusion.Looking through the window he saw only a garden.     Instead of an orange sun at perpetual high noon, there was a red sunsetting brilliantly, marred only by an occasional arcover which leftthe smell of ozone in the air. There was also a gigantic moon. It hid ahuge area of sky, and it sang. The sun and moon both looked down upon agarden that was itself scintillant, composed largely of neon roses.     Moonlight, he thought, and roses. Satisfactory.      And cocktails fortwo.     Blast, he'd never be able to figure that one out! He watched asthe moon played,      Oh, You Beautiful Doll     and the neon roses flashedslowly from red to violet, then went back to the closet and turned onthe scent. The house began to smell like an immensely concentrated roseas the moon shifted to      People Will Say We're In Love     .   <doc-sep> Pouring and tumbling through the Lifo kit, consulting the manualdiligently, Manet concluded that there weren't enough parts left in thebox to go around.     The book gave instructions for The Model Mother, The Model Father, TheModel Sibling and others. Yet there weren't parts enough in the kit.     He would have to take parts from Ronald or Veronica in order to makeany one of the others. And he could not do that without the Modifier.     He wished Trader Tom would return and extract some higher price fromhim for the Modifier, which was clearly missing from the kit.     Or to get even more for simply repossessing the kit.     But Trader Tom would not be back. He came this way only once.     Manet thumbed through the manual in mechanical frustration. As he didso, the solid piece of the last section parted sheet by sheet.     He glanced forward and found the headings:      The Final Model     .     There seemed something ominous about that finality. But he had paida price for the kit, hadn't he? Who knew what price, when it came tothat? He had every right to get everything out of the kit that hecould.     He read the unfolding page critically. The odd assortment ofill-matched parts left in the box took a new shape in his mind andunder his fingers....     Manet gave one final spurt from the flesh-sprayer and stood back.     Victor was finished. Perfect.     Manet stepped forward, lifted the model's left eyelid, tweaked his nose.     Move!     Victor leaped back into the Lifo kit and did a jig on one of theflesh-sprayers.     As the device twisted as handily as good intentions, Manet realizedthat it was not a flesh-sprayer but the Modifier.     It's finished! were Victor's first words. It's done!     Manet stared at the tiny wreck. To say the least.     Victor stepped out of the oblong box. There is something you shouldunderstand. I am different from the others.     They all say that.     I am not your friend.     No?     No. You have made yourself an enemy.     Manet felt nothing more at this information than an esthetic pleasureat the symmetry of the situation.     It completes the final course in socialization, Victor continued. Iam your adversary. I will do everything I can to defeat you. I have      all     your knowledge.      You     do not have all your knowledge. If you letyourself know some of the things, it could be used against you. It ismy function to use everything I possibly can against you.     When do you start?     I've finished. I've done my worst. I have destroyed the Modifier.     What's so bad about that? Manet asked with some interest.     You'll have Veronica and Ronald and me forever now. We'll neverchange. You'll get older, and we'll never change. You'll lose yourinterest in New York swing and jet combat and Daniel Boone, and we'llnever change. We don't change and you can't change us for others. I'vemade the worst thing happen to you that can happen to any man.      I'veseen that you will always keep your friends.       "

        "Summary_1": "When Macklin overhears the possibility of receiving a cure to return him back to his previous state before the injection, he protests that he does not want to receive a cure. He does not want to reverse the injection because he remembers how awful the migraines were and refuses to return back to his original state where he has to experience them. He recollects how he was always worrying back then. He is perfectly content with living in a peaceful existence as he has all the money he could want and an attractive wife. \n\nThe Colonel is shocked at Macklin\u2019s revelation and is upset when he realizes he cannot force Macklin to be cured. The Colonel, Ferris, and Mitchell go to Macklin\u2019s wife to try to convince her to get him to be cured. The Colonel is desperate as he wants to use Macklin\u2019s intelligence since it is such a great advantage for the country. \n\nMacklin\u2019s wife supports her husband\u2019s decision because she recognizes the pain and suffering Macklin has experienced. She is glad that he can be peaceful and happy, even if he is childish. \n\nFerris seems unphased and is overall happy to celebrate that the injection did work to cure headaches. Mitchell still wants to attempt to convince Macklin to take the cure. \n",

He is happy he no longer has the worries of his day to day life that he used to have. Now he can just lead a happy, healthy life with his wife. His wife feels the same way, but for more complicated reasons. She is addicted to controlling her husband, and she sees this as an opportunity to do this completely now, as he has the wits of a child. The colonel is enraged by the fact that the virus has turned Macklin's brain to mush. Macklin is the US government's biggest asset, and he fears what they will do if Macklin doesn't go back to the way he was. Mitchell is remorseful for what the virus has done to Macklin, and goes about finding a way to convince Macklin to reverse the effects. Ferris, while completely on board with the idea of returning Macklin to normal, is happy that the experiment was not a complete failure. ",

However, after hearing that it has not been tested on humans, he believes that there are too much risk involved and refuses to take the injection. After they assure that there is practically no possibility of getting a low blood pressure to the point that the heart stops and along with another attack of the migraine, Macklin gives them permission to inject, immediately. Later Mrs. Macklin calls and blames them for giving his husband heroin, and orders them to make him better. But later, she does not want to go against Macklin\u2019s wish of staying in the current state. Carson has always wanted Macklin to become normal again since the Army still need his intelligence.

The capitalis replaceable. But the chances of an Elliot Macklin are very nearlyonce in a human race.     Just a moment, Mitchell interrupted, we can cure Macklin.     You      can     ? Carson said. For a moment Mitchell thought the man wasgoing to clasp his hands and sink to his knees.     Certainly. We have learned to stabilize the virus colonies. We haveantitoxin to combat the virus. We had always thought of it as abeneficial parasite, but we can wipe it out if necessary.     Good! Carson clasped his hands and gave at least slightly at theknees.     Just you wait a second now, boys, Elliot Macklin said. He was leaningin the doorway, holding his pipe. I've been listening to what you'vebeen saying and I don't like it.     What do you mean you don't like it? Carson demanded. He added, Sir?     I figure you mean to put me back like I used to be.     Yes, doctor, Mitchell said eagerly, just as you used to be.           With     my headaches, like before?     Mitchell coughed into his fist for an instant, to give him time toframe an answer. Unfortunately, yes. Apparently if your mind functionsproperly once again you will have the headaches again. Our research isa dismal failure.     I wouldn't go that far, Ferris remarked cheerfully.     Mitchell was about to ask his associate what he meant when he sawMacklin slowly shaking his head.     No, sir! the mathematician said. I shall not go back to my originalstate. I can remember what it was like. Always worrying, worrying,worrying.     You mean wondering, Mitchell said.     Macklin nodded. Troubled, anyway. Disturbed by every little thing.How high was up, which infinity was bigger than what infinity\u2014say,what was an infinity anyway? All that sort of schoolboy things. It'speaceful this way. My head doesn't hurt. I've got a good-looking wifeand all the money I need. I've got it made. Why worry?     Colonel Carson opened his mouth, then closed it.     That's right, Colonel. There's no use in arguing with him, Mitchellsaid.     It's not his decision to make, the colonel said. He's an idiot now.     No, Colonel. As you said, he's a moron. He seems an idiot compared tohis former level of intelligence but he's legally responsible. Thereare millions of morons running around loose in the United States. Theycan get married, own property, vote, even hold office. Many of themdo. You can't force him into being cured.... At least, I don't      think     you can.     No, I can't. This is hardly a totalitarian state. The colonel lookedmomentarily glum that it wasn't.     Mitchell looked back at Macklin. Where did his wife get to, Colonel?I don't think that even previously he made too many personal decisionsfor himself. Perhaps she could influence him.     Maybe, the colonel said. Let's find her.   <doc-sep> I assumed a baffled expression. I didn't have the slightest idea ofwhat he was driving at and I told him so.     Ed, he said, if you could build an electronic brain capable ofmaking decisions, how would you build it?     Hell, I don't know, I confessed.     Well, if I could build an electronic brain like the one running thisship, I'd build it with a      conscience     so it'd do its best at alltimes.     Machines always do their best, I argued. Come on, untie us. I'mgetting a crick in my back! I didn't like the idea of being sluggedwhile asleep. If Kane had been sober and if his wife hadn't beenpresent, I would have let him know exactly what I thought of him.           Our     machines always do their best, he argued, because we punchbuttons and they respond in predetermined patterns. But the electronicbrain in this ship isn't automatic. It makes decisions and I'll bet iteven has to decide how much energy and time to put into each process!     So what?     He shrugged muscular shoulders. So this ship is operated by athinking, conscientious machine. It's the first time I've encounteredsuch a machine, but I think I know what will happen. I spent hours lastnight figuring\u2014     What are you talking about? I interrupted. Are you so drunk that youdon't know\u2014     I'll show you, Ed.

Yes, the electronic brain replied.     Watch!     Kane tightened his fingers around my throat.     Verana and Marie screamed shrilly.     My head seemed to swell like a balloon; my throat gurgled painfully.     Please stop, the machine pleaded.     What will your masters think of you if I kill all of us?

I have attuned myself to a fetuswithin the body of a not-woman in the not-world. Already I am staticand for hours have looked into this weird extension of the Universewith fear and trepidation.     As soon as my stasis was achieved, I tried to contact you, but gotno response. What could have diminished your powers of articulatewave interaction to make you incapable of receiving my messages andreturning them? My wave went out to yours and found it, barely pulsingand surrounded with an impregnable chimera.     Quickly, from the not-world vibrations about you, I learned thenot-knowledge of your location. So I must communicate with you by whatthe not-world calls mail till we meet. For this purpose I mustutilize the feeble vibrations of various not-people through whoseinadequate articulation I will attempt to make my moves known to you.Each time I will pick a city other than the one I am in at the time.     I, Glmpauszn, come equipped with powers evolved from your fragmentaryreports before you ceased to vibrate to us and with a vast treasuryof facts from indirect sources. Soon our tortured people will be freeof the fearsome not-folk and I will be their liberator. You failed inyour task, but I will try to get you off with light punishment when wereturn again.     The hand that writes this letter is that of a boy in the not-city ofBombay in the not-country of India. He does not know he writes it.Tomorrow it will be someone else. You must never know of my exactlocation, for the not-people might have access to the information.     I must leave off now because the not-child is about to be born. When itis alone in the room, it will be spirited away and I will spring fromthe pod on the gateway into its crib and will be its exact vibrationallikeness.     I have tremendous powers. But the not-people must never know I am amongthem. This is the only way I could arrive in the room where the gatewaylies without arousing suspicion. I will grow up as the not-child inorder that I might destroy the not-people completely.     All is well, only they shot this information file into my matrix toofast. I'm having a hard time sorting facts and make the right decision.Gezsltrysk, what a task!     Farewell till later.     Glmpauszn  "

        "Summary_1": "Orison McCall is applying for a job at the William Howard Taft National Bank and Trust Company. She is a government spy who has been selected from the Treasury Department to work at the bank. The man who she meets for the job is Mr. Wanji, the First Vice President. He dresses strangely compared to the regular banker. Mr. Wanji also speaks to Orison in strange slang and leaves her with the job of reading newspapers into a microphone. She takes her lunch break at noon, eats a tuna salad on whole-wheat, and returns to reading at her desk until five. Orison gets the job and notes that the bank is very bizarre. All of the workers wear earmuffs, and her only task is to read into a microphone. After her dinner, she goes home and waits to receive a call from Washington. At eleven-thirty, she receives a call from Monitor J-12 from the Department of Treasury. He asks Orison for a report but flirts with her slightly by calling her beautiful and kissing the microphone. The next morning, the bank President Dink Gerding personally welcomes her. She notes that he is as crazy as the rest of the bank, and he asks her out for dinner even though they have just met. Once Orison begins reading a copy of yesterday\u2019s Congressional Record, Auga Vingt silently comes and introduces herself. She threatens Orison to stay away from Dink, to which Orison agrees and tells her to leave. Then, Kraft Gerding introduces himself to her, and she threatens to quit because of how crazy this bank is. Orison then receives a call from Wanji, and he tells her to tell Dink that escudo green is pale. Although she is banned from taking the elevator to the upper floor, she takes the stairs to the seventh floor instead and is greeted by the sight of millions of spiders in pink liquid. Kraft threatens to toss her into the tank, but then Dink comes and rescues her. He crashes his fist into Kraft\u2019s jaw, and the perpetrators leave him and Orison alone. He explains to her that the creatures are Microfabridae and are more closely related to shellfish than spiders. She holds one, and Dink says that the company is raising them in secret because it does not have a patent. He lets her listen to the hymn of the Microfabridae and feed the tiny creatures. Orison swears that she can see Benjamin Franklin winking at her, but she believes it is nonsense. \n",

After the first day, the new employee is feeling very confused with her tasks, her boss, everyone in the office wearing earmuffs and forbidden upper floors. Turns out she is to spy for Washington in this bank and she writes down her observations. Orison gets a food and a drink and heads home, waiting for a call from Washington. As she doesn't get it, she goes to bed and suddenly hears a voice.   They establish an every day time for the talks and Orison tell everything she saw.

On the seventh floor she finds a huge room full of tanks and sees green liquid with pink bubbles inside. The bubbles turn out to be millions of spiders and Orison screams rushing back. There she is captured by Kraft and two earmuffs, who ask about the reasons for her entering the room. Suddenly, Dink enters and frees her, he beats his brother, who knelt to Dink's rank, and everyone leaves except Orison and Dink.

She only has to read newspapers and fairy-tales to a microphone every day. After finishing a day of work at the Taft Bank, Orison reports what she saw to Washington. Since there has not been any calls, she decides to go to sleep. However, as she lies down, a radio in her pillow talks to her. She is surprised, but agrees to report to the pillow at 11:15 every day from then on.

However, both Mr. Kraft, the elder brother of Dink, and Auga Vingt, who thinks that Dink is hers, warned Orison to keep a distance from Dink.\n\nLater, Mr. Wanji calls Orison and wants her to bring a message to Dink. This gives Orison a vague excuse to explore the higher floors. Through a stairway, Orison goes to the 6th floor, but the door is locked. The door to the 7th floor is not. She pushes through the door and enters. She first thinks that she sees Benjamin Franklin. She got so scared that she screams. Then, mistakenly thinks that the Microfabridae are spiders, which Orison was afraid of, she screams again. Then, the appearance of Kraft and two other men with earmuffs make Orison unable to leave.

She screams, and backs into the arms of Kraft. His two men take her by the wrists. He threatens to throw her into the spider tanks if she doesn't tell him what she's doing there. She tells him she has a message for Dink. Dink enters the room, and the two men, including Dink's brother, drop to the floor. Dink goes to her, soothing her, then punches Kraft. He orders the three men to leave. He tells her that the spiders are not spiders at all. They are tiny frustrations called Microfabridae, who eat stone and metal. He tells her he can't explain what they do, as it's confidential. They listen as the tiny creatures sing. ",

We use them in a commercialprocess we're developing. That's why we keep this floor closed off andsecret. We don't have a patent on the use of Microfabridae, you see.     What do they do? Orison asked.     That's still a secret, Dink said, smiling. I can't tell even youthat, not yet, even though you're my most confidential secretary.     What's he doing now? Orison asked, watching the Microfabridus,perched up on the rear four of his six microscopic legs, scratchingagainst her high-school class-ring with his tiny chelae.     They like gold, Dink explained, peering across her shoulder,comfortably close. They're attracted to it by a chemical tropism, aschildren are attracted to candy. Toss him back into his tank, Orison.We'd better get you down where you belong.     Orison brushed the midget crustacean off her finger into the nearesttank, where he joined the busy boil of his fellows. She felt her ring.It was pitted where the Microfabridus had been nibbling. Strange,using crawdads in a bank, she said. She stood silent for a moment. Ithought I heard music, she said. I heard it when I came in. Somethinglike the sighing of wind in winter trees.     That's the hymn of the Microfabridae, Dink said. They all singtogether while they work, a chorus of some twenty million voices. Hetook her arm. If you listen very carefully, you'll find the song theselittle workers sing the most beautiful music in the world.     Orison closed her eyes, leaning back into Dink's arms, listening tothe music that seemed on the outermost edge of her hearing. Wildness,storm and danger were its theme, counterpointed by promises of peaceand harbor. She heard the wash of giant waves in the song, the crashof breakers against granite, cold and insatiable. And behind this, thequiet of sheltered tide-pools, the soft lub of sea-arms landlocked.It's an ancient song, Dink said. The Microfabridae have beensinging it for a million years. He released her, and opened awood-covered wooden box. He scooped up a cupful of the sand inside.Hold out your hands, he told Orison. He filled them with the sand.Throw our singers some supper for their song, he said.     Orison went with her cupped hands to the nearest tank and sprinkled themineral fishfood around inside it. The Microfabridae leaped from theliquid like miniature porpoises, seizing the grains of sand in mid-air.They're so very strange, Orison said. At the bottom of the tank shethought she saw Ben Franklin again, winking at her through the bubblinglife. Nonsense, she thought, brushing her hands.   <doc-sep> Matheny puffed smoke and looked around. His feet ached from the weighton them. Where could a man sit down? It was hard to make out anyindividual sign through all that flimmering neon. His eye fell on onethat was distinguished by relative austerity.     THE CHURCH OF CHOICE       Enter, Play, Pray       That would do. He took an upward slideramp through several hundred feetof altitude, stepped past an aurora curtain, and found himself in amarble lobby next to an inspirational newsstand.     Ah, brother, welcome, said a red-haired usherette in demure blackleotards. The peace that passeth all understanding be with you. Therestaurant is right up those stairs.     I\u2014I'm not hungry, stammered Matheny. I just wanted to sit in\u2014     To your left, sir.     The Martian crossed the lobby. His pipe went out in the breeze from ananimated angel. Organ music sighed through an open doorway. The seriesof rooms beyond was dim, Gothic, interminable.     Get your chips right here, sir, said the girl in the booth.     Hm? said Matheny.     She explained. He bought a few hundred-dollar tokens, dropped afifty-buck coin down a slot marked CONTRIBUTIONS, and sipped themartini he got back while he strolled around studying the games.He stopped, frowned. Bingo? No, he didn't want to bother learningsomething new. He decided that the roulette wheels were either honestor too deep for him. He'd have to relax with a crap game instead.     He had been standing at the table for some time before the rest of thecongregation really noticed him. Then it was with awe. The first fewpasses he had made were unsuccessful. Earth gravity threw him off.But when he got the rhythm of it, he tossed a row of sevens. It was acustomary form of challenge on Mars. Here, though, they simply pushedchips toward him. He missed a throw, as anyone would at home: simplecourtesy. The next time around, he threw for a seven just to get thefeel. He got a seven. The dice had not been substituted on him.     I say! he exclaimed. He looked up into eyes and eyes, all around thegreen table. I'm sorry. I guess I don't know your rules.     You did all right, brother, said a middle-aged lady with an obviouslysurgical bodice.     But\u2014I mean\u2014when do we start actually      playing     ? What happened to thecocked dice?   <doc-sep> The room was six feet in all directions and the walls were five feethigh. The other foot was finished in chicken wire. There was a winosinging on the left, a wino praying on the right, and the door didn'thave any lock on it. At last, Doc and I were alone.     I laid Doc out on the gray-brown cot and put his forearm over his faceto shield it some from the glare of the light bulb. I swept off all thebedbugs in sight and stepped on them heavily.     Then I dropped down into the painted stool chair and let my burningeyes rest on the obscene wall drawings just to focus them. I was sodirty, I could feel the grime grinding together all over me. My shaggyscalp still smarted from the alcohol I had stolen from a convertible'sgas tank to get rid of Doc's and my cooties. Lucky that I never neededto shave and that my face was so dirty, no one would even notice that Ididn't need to.     The cramp hit me and I folded out of the chair onto the littered,uncovered floor.     It stopped hurting, but I knew it would begin if I moved. I stared at ajagged cut-out nude curled against a lump of dust and lint, giving itan unreal distortion.     Doc began to mumble louder.     I knew I had to move.     I waited just a moment, savoring the painless peace. Then, finally, Imoved.     I was bent double, but I got from the floor to the chair and foundmy notebook and orb-point in my hands. I found I couldn't focus bothmy mind and my eyes through the electric flashes of agony, so Iconcentrated on Doc's voice and trusted my hands would follow theirhabit pattern and construct the symbols for his words.

        "Query": "What are the defining traits of Dink Gerding, the character in the Cinderella Story?",
        "Summary_1": "Dink Gerding is the eccentric president of the bank. He is a tall, handsome man, and Orison assumes that he is around twenty-eight the first time she meets him. He has an older brother named Kraft, but he is higher in power than his brother. When Dink first meets Orison, he is courteous and personally welcomes her to the office. However, he is also rather confident. Dink casually asks her out for dinner despite never meeting her before, and he even offers to dance. However, it is noted that Dink has some form of military experience as a soldier. His shoulders are square, and the crisp clicking of his steps is similar to a military metronome. Nevertheless, Dink is protective of Orison; this is especially shown during the confrontation with his brother. He is also gentle to her around the Microfabridae and is extremely happy when she takes an interest in holding one. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Dink Gerding is the president of Taft Bank. He is a tall handsome man, he is young and full of grace. He is confident and direct as he almost immediately asks Orison on a date, being very convincing. He has muscles and European manners. He also has some connection to military, probably a former soldier. He doesn't look like a bank president, he is respected by everyone and his appearance impresses Orison deeply. Dink is also the highest in rank, which is why everyone bows to him - they have some sort of hierarchy. Even his elder brother kneels to him and has to obey. Dink is rather mild, he saves Orison from his brother and tells as much as he could about the secret Microfabridae. ",
        "Summary_3": "Mr. Dink Gerding is the President of the bank, who has the highest rank. He does not wear earmuffs. To Orison\u2019s mind, he is a handsome, tall, good-mannered and straightforward man. When Orison first meets him, Dink acts like a solider, such as his crisp clicking steps. Also, he does not hide his interest on Orison. Though they just meet and introduced themselves to each other, Dink directly asks Orison out for a dinner together.",
        "Summary_4": "Dink Gerding is the president of the bank where Orizon is spying on. He is a handsome, gentlemanly fellow, who walks with a very purposeful stride, his leather heels clicking as he walks. He bows at Orizon when they first meet, showing his old fashioned manners, something Orizon thinks he must've picked up in Europe, or perhaps more likely, the military. He looks to be around twenty eight, and very tall. Orizon notices how \"kooky\" he is due to his demeanour. He asks her to call him Dink instead of \"Sir\", unusual for a boss who has never met his employee. He then shows his forwardness by asking her out immediately. Later, when Orzion is being threatened by Kraft, Dink comes to her rescue. He holds Orizon, punching Kraft in the face, showing his chivalry. He is understanding when Orizon explains why she is on the upper floors, and shows his kindness when he helps her get over her fear of the Microfabridae. ",
        "Article": "Suddenly she was dropped. Her mountainous keepers were on the floor asthough struck by lightning, their arms thrown out before them, theirfaces abject against the floor. Kraft Gerding was slowly loweringhimself to one knee. Dink had entered the spider-room. Withoutquestions, he strode between the shiko-ing Earmuffs and put his armsaround Orison.     They can't harm you, he said. She turned to press her face againsthis chest. You're all right, child. Breathe deep, swallow, and turnyour brain back on. All right, now?     All right, she said, still trembling. They were going to throw me tothe spiders.     Kraft told you that? Dink Gerding released her and turned to thekneeling man. Stand up, Elder Brother.     I....     Dink brought his right fist up from hip-level, crashing it into Kraft'sjaw. Kraft Gerding joined the Earmuffs on the floor.     If you'd care to stand again, Elder Brother, you may attempt torecover your dignity without regard for the difference in our rank.Kraft struggled to one knee and remained kneeling, gazing up at Dinkthrough half-closed eyes. No? Then get out of here, all of you.      Samma!          Kraft Gerding arose, stared for a moment at Dink and Orison, then, withthe merest hint of a bow, led his two giant Earmuffs to the elevator.     I wish you hadn't come up here, Orison, Dink said. Why did you doit?     Have you read the story of Bluebeard? Orison asked. She stood closeto Dink, keeping her eyes on the nearest spidertank. I had to seewhat it was you kept up here so secretly, what it was that I wasforbidden to see. My excuse was to have been that I was looking foryou, to deliver a message from Mr. Wanji. He said I was to tell youthat the escudo green is pale.     You're too curious, and Wanji is too careless, Dink said. Now, whatis this thing you have about spiders?     I've always been terrified of them, Orison said. When I was a littlegirl, I had to stay upstairs all day one Sunday because there was aspider hanging from his thread in the stairway. I waited until Dad camehome and took it down with a broom. Even then, I didn't have appetitefor supper.     Strange, Dink said. He walked over to the nearest tank and pluckedone of the tiny pink creatures from a web-bridge. This is no spider,Orison, he said.     She backed away from Dink Gerding and the minuscule creature he cuppedin the palm of his hand. These are Microfabridae, more nearly relatedto shellfish than to spiders, he said. They're stone-and-metaleaters. They literally couldn't harm a fly. Look at it, Orison. Heextended his palm. Orison forced herself to look. The little creature,flesh-colored against his flesh, was nearly invisible, scuttling aroundthe bowl of his hand. Pretty little fellow, isn't he? Dink asked.Here. You hold him.     I'd rather not, she protested.     I'd be happier if you did, Dink said.   <doc-sep> Orison finished the      Wall Street Journal     by early afternoon. Apage came up a moment later with fresh reading-matter: a copy ofyesterday's      Congressional Record     . She launched into the      Record     ,thinking as she read of meeting again this evening that handsomemadman, that splendid lunatic, that unlikely bank-president. You readso      well     , darling, someone said across the desk.     Orison looked up. Oh, hello, she said. I didn't hear you come up.     I walk ever so lightly, the woman said, standing hip-shot in frontof the desk, and pounce ever so hard. She smiled. Opulent, Orisonthought. Built like a burlesque queen. No, she thought, I don't likeher. Can't. Wouldn't if I could. Never cared for cats.     I'm Orison McCall, she said, and tried to smile back without showingteeth.     Delighted, the visitor said, handing over an undelighted palm. I'mAuga Vingt. Auga, to my friends.     Won't you sit down, Miss Vingt?     So kind of you, darling, Auga Vingt said, but I shan't have time tovisit. I just wanted to stop and welcome you as a Taft Bank co-worker.One for all, all for one. Yea, Team. You know.     Thanks, Orison said.     Common courtesy, Miss Vingt explained. Also, darling, I'd like todraw your attention to one little point. Dink Gerding\u2014you know, theshoulders and muscles and crewcut? Well, he's posted property. Shouldyou throw your starveling charms at my Dink, you'd only get your littleeyes scratched out. Word to the wise,      n'est-ce pas     ?     Sorry you have to leave so suddenly, Orison said, rolling her      WallStreet Journal     into a club and standing. Darling.     So remember, Tiny, Dink Gerding is mine. You're all alone up here.You could get broken nails, fall down the elevator shaft, all sorts ofannoyance. Understand me, darling?     You make it very clear, Orison said. Now you'd best hurry back toyour stanchion, Bossy, before the hay's all gone.     Isn't it lovely, the way you and I reached an understanding rightoff? Auga asked. Well, ta-ta. She turned and walked to the elevator,displaying, Orison thought, a disgraceful amount of ungirdled rhumbamotion.     The elevator stopped to pick up the odious Auga. A passenger, male,stepped off. Good morning, Mr. Gerding, Miss Vingt said, bowing.     Carry on, Colonel, the stranger replied. As the elevator door closed,he stepped up to Orison's desk. Good morning. Miss McCall, he said.     What is this? Orison demanded. Visiting-day at the zoo? She pausedand shook her head. Excuse me, sir, she said. It's just that ...Vingt thing....     Auga is rather intense, the new Mr. Gerding said.     Yeah, intense, Orison said. Like a kidney-stone.     I stopped by to welcome you to the William Howard Taft National Bankand Trust Company family, Miss McCall, he said. I'm Kraft Gerding,Dink's elder brother. I understand you've met Dink already.     Yes, sir, Orison said. The hair of this new Mr. Gerding was croppedeven closer than Dink's. His mustache was gray-tipped, like a patchof frosted furze; and his eyes, like Dink's, were cobalt blue. Thehead, Orison mused, would look quite at home in one of Kaiser Bill'sspike-topped      Pickelhauben     ; but the ears were in evidence, and seemednormal. Mr. Kraft Gerding bowed\u2014what continental manners these bankershad!\u2014and Orison half expected him to free her hand from the rolled-uppaper she still clutched and plant a kiss on it.   <doc-sep> Instead, Kraft Gerding smiled a smile as frosty as his mustache andsaid, I understand that my younger brother has been talking with you,Miss McCall. Quite proper, I know. But I must warn you against mixingbusiness with pleasure.     Orison jumped up, tossing the paper into her wastebasket. I quit! sheshouted. You can take this crazy bank ... into bankruptcy, for all Icare. I'm not going to perch up here, target for every uncaged idiot infinance, and listen to another word.     Dearest lady, my humblest pardon, Kraft Gerding said, bowing again,a bit lower. Your work is splendid; your presence is Taft Bank's mostcharming asset; my only wish is to serve and protect you. To this end,dear lady, I feel it my duty to warn you against my brother. A word tothe wise....           N'est-ce pas?      Orison said. Well, Buster, here's a word to thefoolish. Get lost.     Kraft Gerding bowed and flashed his gelid smile. Until we meet again?     I'll hold my breath, Orison promised. The elevator is just behindyou. Push a button, will you? And      bon voyage     .     Kraft Gerding called the elevator, marched aboard, favored Orison witha cold, quick bow, then disappeared into the mysterious heights abovefifth floor.     First the unspeakable Auga Vingt, then the obnoxious Kraft Gerding.Surely, Orison thought, recovering the      Wall Street Journal     from herwastebasket and smoothing it, no one would convert a major Midwesternbank into a lunatic asylum. How else, though, could the behaviorof the Earmuffs be explained? Could madmen run a bank? Why not, shethought. History is rich in examples of madmen running nations, banksand all. She began again to read the paper into the microphone. If shefinished early enough, she might get a chance to prowl those Off-Limitsupper floors.     Half an hour further into the paper, Orison jumped, startled by thesudden buzz of her telephone. She picked it up.       Wanji e-Kal, Datto.Dink ger-Dink d'summa.          Orison scribbled down this intelligence in bemused Gregg beforereplying, I'm a local girl. Try me in English.     Oh. Hi, Miss McCall, the voice said. Guess I goofed. I'm in kindaclutch. This is Wanji. I got a kite for Mr. Dink Gerding. If you seehim, tell him the escudo green is pale. Got that, doll?     Yes, Mr. Wanji. I'll tell Mr. Gerding. Orison clicked the phone down.What now, Mata Hari? she asked herself. What was the curious languageMr. Wanji had used? She'd have to report the message to Washington bytonight's pillow, and let the polyglots of Treasury Intelligence puzzleit out. Meanwhile, she thought, scooting her chair back from her desk,she had a vague excuse to prowl the upper floors. The Earmuffs couldonly fire her.     Orison folded the paper and put it in the Out basket. Someone wouldbe here in a moment with something new to read. She'd best get going.The elevator? No. The operators had surely been instructed to keep heroff the upstairs floors.     But the building had a stairway.      III     The door on the sixth floor was locked. Orison went on up the stairs toseven. The glass of the door there was painted black on the inside, andthe landing was cellar-dark. Orison closed her eyes for a moment. Therewas a curious sound. The buzzing of a million bees, barely within thefringes of her hearing. Somehow, a very pleasant sound.     She opened her eyes and tried the knob. The door opened.     Orison was blinded by the lights, brilliant as noonday sun. The roomextended through the entire seventh floor, its windows boarded shut,its ceiling a mass of fluorescent lamps. Set about the floor weregalvanized steel tanks, rectangular and a little bigger than bathtubs.Orison counted the rows of tanks. Twelve rows, nine tiers. One hundredand eight tanks. She walked closer. The tubs were laced together bystrands of angel-hair, delicate white lattices scintillating withpink. She walked to the nearest of the tubs and looked in. It was halffull of a greenish fluid, seething with tiny pink bubbles. For a momentOrison thought she saw Benjamin Franklin winking up at her from theliquid. Then she screamed.       The pink bubbles, the tiny flesh-colored flecks glinting light fromthe spun-sugar bridges between the tanks, were spiders. Millionsupon millions of spiders, each the size of a mustard-seed; crawling,leaping, swinging, spinning webs, seething in the hundred tanks. Orisonput her hands over her ears and screamed again, backing toward thestairway door.     Into a pair of arms.     I had hoped you'd be happy here, Miss McCall, Kraft Gerding said.Orison struggled to release herself. She broke free only to haveher wrists seized by two Earmuffs that had appeared with the elderGerding. It seems that our Pandora doesn't care for spiders, hesaid. Really, Miss McCall, our little pets are quite harmless. Werewe to toss you into one of these tanks.... Orison struggled againsther two      sumo     -sized captors, whose combined weights exceeded hers bysome quarter-ton, without doing more than lifting her feet from thefloor. ... your flesh would be unharmed, though they spun and dartedall around you. Our Microfabridae are petrovorous, Miss McCall. Ofcourse, once they discovered your teeth, and through them a skeleton ofcalcium, a delicacy they find most toothsome, you'd be filleted withinminutes.     Elder Compassion wouldn't like your harming the girl, Sire, one ofthe earmuffed      sumo     -wrestlers protested.     Elder Compassion has no rank, Kraft Gerding said. Miss McCall, youmust tell me what you were doing here, or I'll toss you to the spiders.     Dink ... Dink! Orison shouted.     My beloved younger brother is otherwise engaged than in the rescue ofdamsels in distress, Kraft said. Someone, after all, has to mind thebank.     I came to bring a message to Dink, Orison said. Let me go, youacromegalic apes!     The message? Kraft Gerding demanded.     Something about escudo green. Put me down!  "

To top off his outfit, he matches it with a pair of rough-leather desert boots. Orison does not know his ethnicity, but she guesses if he is Oriental based on his name. He speaks strangely too, and Orison finds herself unable to understand him unless he says in plain English. It is a very casual form of speech with lots of slang mixed in. Later, when he calls Orison, he speaks in a completely different language. Mr. Wanji is loud and carefree, as he did not hesitate to give Orison more money than supposedly her last job paid. When she asks him about tax numbers and social security information, he waves it off as if it is nothing.

[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Worlds of If Science Fiction, May 1961.

His suit ofhound's-tooth checks, the scarlet vest peeping above the vee of hisjacket, were enough to assure Orison that the Taft Bank was a curiousbank indeed. I gotta say, chick, these references of yours reallyswing, said the Vice-President, Mr. Wanji. Your last boss says youcome on real cool in the secretary-bit.     He was a very kind employer, Orison said. She tried to keep fromstaring at the most remarkable item of Mr. Wanji's costume, a pair offurry green earmuffs. It was not cold.     Mr. Wanji returned to Orison her letters of reference. What colorbread you got eyes for taking down, baby? he asked.     Beg pardon?     What kinda salary you bucking for? he translated, bouncing up anddown on the toes of his rough-leather desert boots.     I was making one-twenty a week in my last position, Miss McCall said.     You're worth more'n that, just to jazz up the decor, Mr. Wanji said.What you say we pass you a cee-and-a-half a week. Okay? He caughtOrison's look of bewilderment. One each, a Franklin and a Grant, heexplained further. She still looked blank. Sister, you gonna workin a bank, you gotta know who's picture's on the paper. That's ahunnerd-fifty a week, doll.     That will be most satisfactory, Mr. Wanji, Orison said. It was indeed.     Crazy! Mr. Wanji grabbed Orison's right hand and shook it withathletic vigor. You just now joined up with our herd. I wanna tellyou, chick, it's none too soon we got some decent scenery aroundthis tomb, girlwise. He took her arm and led her toward the bank ofelevators. The uniformed operator nodded to Mr. Wanji, bowed slightlyto Orison. He, too, she observed, wore earmuffs. His were more formalthan Mr. Wanji's, being midnight blue in color. Lift us to five, Mac,Mr. Wanji said. As the elevator door shut he explained to Orison,You can make the Taft Bank scene anywhere between the street floorand floor five. Basement and everything higher'n fifth floor is IronCurtain Country far's you're concerned. Dig, baby?     Yes, sir, Orison said. She was wondering if she'd be issued earmuffs,now that she'd become an employee of this most peculiar bank.     The elevator opened on five to a tiny office, just large enough tohold a single desk and two chairs. On the desk were a telephone anda microphone. Beside them was a double-decked In and Out basket.Here's where you'll do your nine-to-five, honey, Mr. Wanji said.     What will I be doing, Mr. Wanji? Orison asked.     The Vice-President pointed to the newspaper folded in the In basket.Flip on the microphone and read the paper to it, he said. When youget done reading the paper, someone will run you up something new toread. Okay?     It seems a rather peculiar job, Orison said. After all, I'm asecretary. Is reading the newspaper aloud supposed to familiarize mewith the Bank's operation?     Don't bug me, kid, Mr. Wanji said. All you gotta do is read thatthere paper into this here microphone. Can do?     Yes, sir, Orison said. While you're here, Mr. Wanji, I'd like toask you about my withholding tax, social security, credit union,coffee-breaks, union membership, lunch hour and the like. Shall we takecare of these details now? Or would you\u2014     You just take care of that chicken-flickin' kinda stuff any way seemsbest to you, kid, Mr. Wanji said.     Yes, sir, Orison said. This laissez-faire policy of Taft Bank'smight explain why she'd been selected from the Treasury Department'ssecretarial pool to apply for work here, she thought. Orison McCall,girl Government spy. She picked up the newspaper from the In basket,unfolded it to discover the day's      Wall Street Journal     , and began atthe top of column one to read it aloud. Wanji stood before the desk,nodding his head as he listened. You blowing real good, kid, he said.The boss is gonna dig you the most.     Orison nodded. Holding her newspaper and her microphone, she read theone into the other. Mr. Wanji flicked his fingers in a good-by, thentook off upstairs in the elevator.   <doc-sep> Instead, Kraft Gerding smiled a smile as frosty as his mustache andsaid, I understand that my younger brother has been talking with you,Miss McCall. Quite proper, I know. But I must warn you against mixingbusiness with pleasure.     Orison jumped up, tossing the paper into her wastebasket. I quit! sheshouted. You can take this crazy bank ... into bankruptcy, for all Icare. I'm not going to perch up here, target for every uncaged idiot infinance, and listen to another word.     Dearest lady, my humblest pardon, Kraft Gerding said, bowing again,a bit lower. Your work is splendid; your presence is Taft Bank's mostcharming asset; my only wish is to serve and protect you. To this end,dear lady, I feel it my duty to warn you against my brother. A word tothe wise....           N'est-ce pas?      Orison said. Well, Buster, here's a word to thefoolish. Get lost.     Kraft Gerding bowed and flashed his gelid smile. Until we meet again?     I'll hold my breath, Orison promised. The elevator is just behindyou. Push a button, will you? And      bon voyage     .     Kraft Gerding called the elevator, marched aboard, favored Orison witha cold, quick bow, then disappeared into the mysterious heights abovefifth floor.     First the unspeakable Auga Vingt, then the obnoxious Kraft Gerding.Surely, Orison thought, recovering the      Wall Street Journal     from herwastebasket and smoothing it, no one would convert a major Midwesternbank into a lunatic asylum. How else, though, could the behaviorof the Earmuffs be explained? Could madmen run a bank? Why not, shethought. History is rich in examples of madmen running nations, banksand all. She began again to read the paper into the microphone. If shefinished early enough, she might get a chance to prowl those Off-Limitsupper floors.     Half an hour further into the paper, Orison jumped, startled by thesudden buzz of her telephone. She picked it up.       Wanji e-Kal, Datto.Dink ger-Dink d'summa.          Orison scribbled down this intelligence in bemused Gregg beforereplying, I'm a local girl. Try me in English.     Oh. Hi, Miss McCall, the voice said. Guess I goofed. I'm in kindaclutch. This is Wanji. I got a kite for Mr. Dink Gerding. If you seehim, tell him the escudo green is pale. Got that, doll?     Yes, Mr. Wanji. I'll tell Mr. Gerding. Orison clicked the phone down.What now, Mata Hari? she asked herself. What was the curious languageMr. Wanji had used? She'd have to report the message to Washington bytonight's pillow, and let the polyglots of Treasury Intelligence puzzleit out. Meanwhile, she thought, scooting her chair back from her desk,she had a vague excuse to prowl the upper floors. The Earmuffs couldonly fire her.     Orison folded the paper and put it in the Out basket. Someone wouldbe here in a moment with something new to read. She'd best get going.The elevator? No. The operators had surely been instructed to keep heroff the upstairs floors.     But the building had a stairway.      III     The door on the sixth floor was locked. Orison went on up the stairs toseven. The glass of the door there was painted black on the inside, andthe landing was cellar-dark. Orison closed her eyes for a moment. Therewas a curious sound. The buzzing of a million bees, barely within thefringes of her hearing. Somehow, a very pleasant sound.     She opened her eyes and tried the knob. The door opened.     Orison was blinded by the lights, brilliant as noonday sun. The roomextended through the entire seventh floor, its windows boarded shut,its ceiling a mass of fluorescent lamps. Set about the floor weregalvanized steel tanks, rectangular and a little bigger than bathtubs.Orison counted the rows of tanks. Twelve rows, nine tiers. One hundredand eight tanks. She walked closer. The tubs were laced together bystrands of angel-hair, delicate white lattices scintillating withpink. She walked to the nearest of the tubs and looked in. It was halffull of a greenish fluid, seething with tiny pink bubbles. For a momentOrison thought she saw Benjamin Franklin winking up at her from theliquid. Then she screamed.       The pink bubbles, the tiny flesh-colored flecks glinting light fromthe spun-sugar bridges between the tanks, were spiders. Millionsupon millions of spiders, each the size of a mustard-seed; crawling,leaping, swinging, spinning webs, seething in the hundred tanks. Orisonput her hands over her ears and screamed again, backing toward thestairway door.     Into a pair of arms.     I had hoped you'd be happy here, Miss McCall, Kraft Gerding said.Orison struggled to release herself. She broke free only to haveher wrists seized by two Earmuffs that had appeared with the elderGerding. It seems that our Pandora doesn't care for spiders, hesaid. Really, Miss McCall, our little pets are quite harmless. Werewe to toss you into one of these tanks.... Orison struggled againsther two      sumo     -sized captors, whose combined weights exceeded hers bysome quarter-ton, without doing more than lifting her feet from thefloor. ... your flesh would be unharmed, though they spun and dartedall around you. Our Microfabridae are petrovorous, Miss McCall. Ofcourse, once they discovered your teeth, and through them a skeleton ofcalcium, a delicacy they find most toothsome, you'd be filleted withinminutes.     Elder Compassion wouldn't like your harming the girl, Sire, one ofthe earmuffed      sumo     -wrestlers protested.     Elder Compassion has no rank, Kraft Gerding said. Miss McCall, youmust tell me what you were doing here, or I'll toss you to the spiders.     Dink ... Dink! Orison shouted.     My beloved younger brother is otherwise engaged than in the rescue ofdamsels in distress, Kraft said. Someone, after all, has to mind thebank.     I came to bring a message to Dink, Orison said. Let me go, youacromegalic apes!     The message? Kraft Gerding demanded.     Something about escudo green. Put me down!   <doc-sep> Suddenly she was dropped. Her mountainous keepers were on the floor asthough struck by lightning, their arms thrown out before them, theirfaces abject against the floor. Kraft Gerding was slowly loweringhimself to one knee. Dink had entered the spider-room. Withoutquestions, he strode between the shiko-ing Earmuffs and put his armsaround Orison.     They can't harm you, he said. She turned to press her face againsthis chest. You're all right, child. Breathe deep, swallow, and turnyour brain back on. All right, now?     All right, she said, still trembling. They were going to throw me tothe spiders.     Kraft told you that? Dink Gerding released her and turned to thekneeling man. Stand up, Elder Brother.     I....     Dink brought his right fist up from hip-level, crashing it into Kraft'sjaw. Kraft Gerding joined the Earmuffs on the floor.     If you'd care to stand again, Elder Brother, you may attempt torecover your dignity without regard for the difference in our rank.Kraft struggled to one knee and remained kneeling, gazing up at Dinkthrough half-closed eyes. No? Then get out of here, all of you.      Samma!          Kraft Gerding arose, stared for a moment at Dink and Orison, then, withthe merest hint of a bow, led his two giant Earmuffs to the elevator.     I wish you hadn't come up here, Orison, Dink said. Why did you doit?     Have you read the story of Bluebeard? Orison asked. She stood closeto Dink, keeping her eyes on the nearest spidertank. I had to seewhat it was you kept up here so secretly, what it was that I wasforbidden to see. My excuse was to have been that I was looking foryou, to deliver a message from Mr. Wanji. He said I was to tell youthat the escudo green is pale.     You're too curious, and Wanji is too careless, Dink said. Now, whatis this thing you have about spiders?     I've always been terrified of them, Orison said. When I was a littlegirl, I had to stay upstairs all day one Sunday because there was aspider hanging from his thread in the stairway. I waited until Dad camehome and took it down with a broom. Even then, I didn't have appetitefor supper.     Strange, Dink said. He walked over to the nearest tank and pluckedone of the tiny pink creatures from a web-bridge. This is no spider,Orison, he said.     She backed away from Dink Gerding and the minuscule creature he cuppedin the palm of his hand. These are Microfabridae, more nearly relatedto shellfish than to spiders, he said. They're stone-and-metaleaters. They literally couldn't harm a fly. Look at it, Orison. Heextended his palm. Orison forced herself to look. The little creature,flesh-colored against his flesh, was nearly invisible, scuttling aroundthe bowl of his hand. Pretty little fellow, isn't he? Dink asked.Here. You hold him.     I'd rather not, she protested.     I'd be happier if you did, Dink said.  "

        "Query": "Can you give me a summary of the storyline in THE LONG REMEMBERED THUNDER?",
        "Summary_1": "With pressure coming from Fred, who elected him into this investigation, Tremaine first goes to the police station to meet his friend who works here so that he can get familiar with the town and learn about unusual activities and strange events if there are any. Jess, the police officer, is surprised to see Tremaine coming back to this town. Tremaine asks Jess if he has any idea of a transmitter in this area, however, Jess does not seem really interested in the transmitters as he think drawing is a beer advertisement. Afterwards, Jess tells Tremaine about the old man Bram who seems to have lived in this town forever. He is the mystery man of the town. As a foreigner who no one knows much about, he seems strange. Knowing that Bram has lived on the same property since as long as anyone could remember, he goes to the Municipal Office of Records to check the last time that there was a change of hands on Bram\u2019s property.  \n\nThen Tremaine goes to the Elsby Public Library, checking for the newspapers around the time when Bram bought the property. On his way back to the hotel that he is staying at, he notices Grammond\u2019s men. But Tremaine has told Grammond to keep his men away from this town for now. Apparently, Grammond didn\u2019t listen, Tremaine is afraid that with the police searching around the town, the person they are looking for will sense that something is off, and will hide before they are able to find him/her.\n\nDesiring to learn more about this old man, Jess has also mentioned to Tremaine that Linda Carroll had been with Bram for a while when Carroll was in her twenties, which is a few decades ago. So then Tremaine goes to Carroll\u2019s house hoping to learn more about the mysterious man Bram. Then after he left Carroll\u2019s house, he goes to Bram\u2019s house together with Jess. Shots were fired, the house is empty, but Bram is not there. They go straight to Hull Gaskin to ask questions since he did set fire on Bram\u2019s place before. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Tremaine, a former hyperwave lab worker, dials Washington from a hotel room in his old hometown. On the other end Fred, an appointive official, is impatiently waiting for Tremaine to catch the transmitter who intervened with their Top Secret project. Jimmy Tremaine visits an old acquaintance Jess in a local police department, the former shares details of his secret mission and asks whether Jess has any idea who can be the transmitter. Jess says everyone around is bad with technologies, but Mr. Bram is a mystery man, so it could be him. The man is a foreigner but he has been living in the town for so long that no one knows when and where he came from. Not long ago his house was set on fire by a bunch of kids, nothing serious. Jess tells a story about the past: a local beauty by then, Miss Carol, wanted nothing to do with locals and set her trap for Mr. Bram. They left a party together and the next morning she was back alone. Her reputation was destroyed, she never married and now works as a teacher. Tremaine heads towards the Elsby Town Hall, he learns that Bram bought his property in 1901. Then in the local public library he finds an article concerning this purchase, then he sees an article of July 7, 1900 regarding a severe thunderstorm. Near the hotel he notices a car and heads after the police to ask Grammond, the chief, to keep the police away from the hotel so as not to scare off the intermitter. Grammond is offended by being kept ignorant. Further, Jimmy heads to Miss Carol's and asks questions about Mr. Bram, she can't answer them for sure and a tear drops from her eye. Soon, she decides to tell about the night at Bram's place back in the years : he told he fought evil every night, went downstairs for the whole night and left her alone. Then he gave her a locket and said to press in a particular way if he is ever needed. Miss Carol considered him crazy and never met me again. She says Bram fears thunder and gives Jimmy the locket. Jess picks Jimmy up to look for Bram who hasn't shown up recently. The two enter the deserted house with Tremaine's gun, they see blood in the kitchen making up a trail. They go back to talk to Hull, a boy who set Bram's house on fire recently. Turns out he considered Bram a spy as he is a foreigner and a communist, and the boy heard the boys were looking for spies. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Jimmy Tremaine works for the government, conducting a secret operation about implementing hyperwaves in the military. An interfering transmission had recently been detected tampering with the hyperwaves, and when tracked down, the source seems to come from Elsby, Tremaine's hometown. Fred, Tremaine's superior, orders Tremaine to figure out where the transmission is coming from before he interferes his own way. Tremaine visits Elsby's police station, where he meets Jess. Tremaine tells Jess about the transmission and asks if he has any ideas or leads on the situation. Jess is stumped, but notes that Mr. Bram is an odd character at Elsby, who has been there for an unusually long amount of time. Curious about Mr. Bram, Tremaine goes to the Office of Record, where he bribes the man at the counter to tell him the year that Mr. Bram purchased his home, which is revealed to be 1901. The clerk also tells Tremaine that no one has seen Bram between sundown and sunup. Tremaine then visits the library, where he finds an article about Bram purchasing the house, as well as an account of a thunderstorm that occurred there a year before the purchase. On his way back from the library, Tremaine sees a police car speeding off, and he follows. He gets in contact with the State Police Chief, who does not approve of being left out of Tremaine's investigation. Tremaine speaks to Miss Carroll, known to have had a history with Bram. She tells Tremaine about her encounter with Bram and how he kept her in a cave under his house for the night, and she never spoke to him again. She also tells Tremaine that Bram is afraid of thunder. As Tremaine walks back to his room, Jess finds him and asks how the investigation is going, and Tremaine replies that he is stumped. Jess suggests that they visit Bram's house together, and the two enter and see an empty gun shell. They find blood in the kitchen. Jess and Tremaine then visit a police station where they find Hull Gaskin, who admits to shooting Bram after some cops prompted him to help catch spies. ",
        "Summary_4": "Tremaine calls Fred from his hotel room and gives him an update on his progress. Fred expresses his frustration with the progress and complains that General Margrave has been breathing down his neck about the case. Tremaine tells Fred to be confident in him and Fred ends by yelling that he wants the transmitter and for someone to pay. Tremaine eventually leaves his hotel room and heads towards the local police station. At the station, Tremaine greets Jess once he enters the building. The two go to have a private conversation where Tremaine tries to get Jess\u2019s help with a case. Jess tells Tremaine what he knows about Bram from what he\u2019s heard and what he\u2019s seen. It is clear that Bram lives a very private life. \n\nOnce his conversation with Jess finishes, Tremaine goes to the Municipal office of Records at the town hall. He has to bribe a reluctant man in the office to let him look for the information that he needs. He is able to find out information about Bram\u2019s property and then leaves to go to the library to gather more information. At the library, Tremaine looks through old newspapers. He learns from one newspaper about a severe thunderstorm that affected the Bram property.  \n\nBack at his hotel room, Tremaine has a tense phone call with Fred. When it ends, he pours himself a glass of scotch. After finishing his drink, he goes to Miss Carroll\u2019s nearby house Tremaine asks her about Bram. She is unable to give him many details about Bram. However, Miss Carroll does willingly detail her personal relationship with Bram. Carroll mentions that Bram gave her a locket and to use it to contact him if she ever needed his help. Tremaine asks for the locket and she hands it over to him. She mentions that she remembers how Bram was afraid of thunder. With all the information that he could gather from Miss Carroll, Tremaine leaves her house.\n\nUpon leaving Miss Carroll\u2019s house, Jess pulls up to Tremaine on the street in his car and they decide to go check on Bram as he hasn\u2019t been seen in a while. The two get out of their car once they reach the property and inspect the outside of the house. They become alert by the suspicious state of the house, especially because of the empty shotgun shell that they find, so they retrieve a gun from the car for their safety. They start hearing strange noises once they enter the house, causing them both to become uneasy. Inside the kitchen, they spot a suspicious trail of blood and hear another strange sound. They decide to go to the police station to ask Hull Gaskin \u2013 one of the teens arrested for setting fire to Bram\u2019s property- some questions. Hull says that he was approached by cops asking him to help them find spies. He says he told them about Bram because he\u2019s a foreigner.  \n",

She was calculating the fine as he closedthe door.     Humphrey Fownes' preoccupation finally came to an end when he was oneblock away from his house. It was then that he realized somethingunusual must have occurred. An orange patrol car of the security policewas parked at his front door. And something else was happening too.     His house was dancing.     It was disconcerting, and at the same time enchanting, to watch one'sresidence frisking about on its foundation. It was such a strange sightthat for the moment he didn't give a thought to what might be causingit. But when he stepped gingerly onto the porch, which was doing itsown independent gavotte, he reached for the doorknob with an immensecuriosity.     The door flung itself open and knocked him back off the porch.     From a prone position on his miniscule front lawn, Fownes watched ashis favorite easy chair sailed out of the living room on a blast ofcold air and went pinwheeling down the avenue in the bright sunshine. Awild wind and a thick fog poured out of the house. It brought chairs,suits, small tables, lamps trailing their cords, ashtrays, sofacushions. The house was emptying itself fiercely, as if disgorging anold, spoiled meal. From deep inside he could hear the rumble of hisancient upright piano as it rolled ponderously from room to room.     He stood up; a wet wind swept over him, whipping at his face, toyingwith his hair. It was a whistling in his ears, and a tingle on hischeeks. He got hit by a shoe.     As he forced his way back to the doorway needles of rain played overhis face and he heard a voice cry out from somewhere in the living room.     Help! Lieutenant MacBride called.     Standing in the doorway with his wet hair plastered down on hisdripping scalp, the wind roaring about him, the piano rumbling in thedistance like thunder, Humphrey Fownes suddenly saw it all very clearly.           Winds     , he said in a whisper.     What's happening? MacBride yelled, crouching behind the sofa.           March     winds, he said.     What?!     April showers!     The winds roared for a moment and then MacBride's lost voice emergedfrom the blackness of the living room. These are      not     Optimum DomeConditions! the voice wailed.

Inside, Tremaine followed apaper-dry woman of indeterminate age to a rack of yellowed newsprint.     You'll find back to nineteen-forty here, the librarian said. Theolder are there in the shelves.     I want nineteen-oh-one, if they go back that far.     The woman darted a suspicious look at Tremaine. You have to handlethese old papers carefully.     I'll be extremely careful. The woman sniffed, opened a drawer, leafedthrough it, muttering.     What date was it you wanted?     Nineteen-oh-one; the week of May nineteenth.     The librarian pulled out a folded paper, placed it on the table,adjusted her glasses, squinted at the front page. That's it, shesaid. These papers keep pretty well, provided they're stored in thedark. But they're still flimsy, mind you.     I'll remember. The woman stood by as Tremaine looked over the frontpage. The lead article concerned the opening of the Pan-AmericanExposition at Buffalo. Vice-President Roosevelt had made a speech.Tremaine leafed over, reading slowly.     On page four, under a column headed      County Notes     he saw the name Bram:     Mr. Bram has purchased a quarter section of fine grazing land,north of town, together with a sturdy house, from J. P. Spivey ofElsby. Mr. Bram will occupy the home and will continue to graze afew head of stock. Mr. Bram, who is a newcomer to the county, hasbeen a resident of Mrs. Stoate's Guest Home in Elsby for the pastmonths.     May I see some earlier issues; from about the first of the year?     The librarian produced the papers. Tremaine turned the pages, read theheads, skimmed an article here and there. The librarian went back toher desk. An hour later, in the issue for July 7, 1900, an item caughthis eye:     A Severe Thunderstorm. Citizens of Elsby and the country were muchalarmed by a violent cloudburst, accompanied by lightning andthunder, during the night of the fifth. A fire set in the pinewoods north of Spivey's farm destroyed a considerable amount oftimber and threatened the house before burning itself out alongthe river.     The librarian was at Tremaine's side. I have to close the library now.You'll have to come back tomorrow.     Outside, the sky was sallow in the west: lights were coming on inwindows along the side streets. Tremaine turned up his collar against acold wind that had risen, started along the street toward the hotel.     A block away a black late-model sedan rounded a corner with a faintsqueal of tires and gunned past him, a heavy antenna mounted forwardof the left rear tail fin whipping in the slipstream. Tremaine stoppedshort, stared after the car.     Damn! he said aloud. An elderly man veered, eyeing him sharply.Tremaine set off at a run, covered the two blocks to the hotel, yankedopen the door to his car, slid into the seat, made a U-turn, and headednorth after the police car.   <doc-sep> Miss Carroll looked at him for a long moment. Will what I tell you beused against him?     There'll be nothing done against him, Miss Carroll ... unless it needsto be in the national interest.     I'm not at all sure I know what the term 'national interest' means,James. I distrust these glib phrases.     I always liked Mr. Bram, said Tremaine. I'm not out to hurt him.     Mr. Bram came here when I was a young woman. I'm not certain of theyear.     What does he do for a living?     I have no idea.     Why did a healthy young fellow like Bram settle out in that isolatedpiece of country? What's his story?     I'm ... not sure that anyone truly knows Bram's story.     You called him 'Bram', Miss Carroll. Is that his first name ... or hislast?     That is his only name. Just ... Bram.     You knew him well once, Miss Carroll. Is there anything\u2014     A tear rolled down Miss Carroll's faded cheek. She wiped it awayimpatiently.     I'm an unfulfilled old maid, James, she said. You must forgive me.     Tremaine stood up. I'm sorry. Really sorry. I didn't mean to grillyou. Miss Carroll. You've been very kind. I had no right....     Miss Carroll shook her head. I knew you as a boy, James. I havecomplete confidence in you. If anything I can tell you about Bram willbe helpful to you, it is my duty to oblige you; and it may help him.She paused. Tremaine waited.     Many years ago I was courted by Bram. One day he asked me to go withhim to his house. On the way he told me a terrible and pathetic tale.He said that each night he fought a battle with evil beings, alone, ina cave beneath his house.     Miss Carroll drew a deep breath and went on. I was torn between pityand horror. I begged him to take me back. He refused. Miss Carrolltwisted her fingers together, her eyes fixed on the long past. Whenwe reached the house, he ran to the kitchen. He lit a lamp and threwopen a concealed panel. There were stairs. He went down ... and left methere alone.     I waited all that night in the carriage. At dawn he emerged. He triedto speak to me but I would not listen.     He took a locket from his neck and put it into my hand. He told me tokeep it and, if ever I should need him, to press it between my fingersin a secret way ... and he would come. I told him that until he wouldconsent to see a doctor, I did not wish him to call. He drove me home.He never called again.     This locket, said Tremaine, do you still have it?     Miss Carroll hesitated, then put her hand to her throat, lifted asilver disc on a fine golden chain. You see what a foolish old woman Iam, James.     May I see it?     She handed the locket to him. It was heavy, smooth. I'd like toexamine this more closely, he said. May I take it with me?     Miss Carroll nodded.     There is one other thing, she said, perhaps quite meaningless....     I'd be grateful for any lead.     Bram fears the thunder.      III     As Tremaine walked slowly toward the lighted main street of Elsby a carpulled to a stop beside him. Jess leaned out, peered at Tremaine andasked:     Any luck, Jimmy?     Tremaine shook his head. I'm getting nowhere fast. The Bram idea's adud, I'm afraid.     Funny thing about Bram. You know, he hasn't showed up yet. I'm gettinga little worried. Want to run out there with me and take a look around?     Sure. Just so I'm back by full dark.     As they pulled away from the curb Jess said, Jimmy, what's this aboutState Police nosing around here? I thought you were playing a lone handfrom what you were saying to me.     I thought so too, Jess. But it looks like Grammond's a jump ahead ofme. He smells headlines in this; he doesn't want to be left out.     Well, the State cops could be mighty handy to have around. I'mwondering why you don't want 'em in. If there's some kind of spy ringworking\u2014     We're up against an unknown quantity. I don't know what's behind thisand neither does anybody else. Maybe it's a ring of Bolsheviks ...and maybe it's something bigger. I have the feeling we've made enoughmistakes in the last few years; I don't want to see this botched.     The last pink light of sunset was fading from the clouds to the west asJess swung the car through the open gate, pulled up under the old treesbefore the square-built house. The windows were dark. The two men gotout, circled the house once, then mounted the steps and rapped on thedoor. There was a black patch of charred flooring under the window, andthe paint on the wall above it was bubbled. Somewhere a cricket set upa strident chirrup, suddenly cut off. Jess leaned down, picked up anempty shotgun shell. He looked at Tremaine. This don't look good, hesaid. You suppose those fool boys...?     He tried the door. It opened. A broken hasp dangled. He turned toTremaine. Maybe this is more than kid stuff, he said. You carry agun?     In the car.     Better get it.     Tremaine went to the car, dropped the pistol in his coat pocket,rejoined Jess inside the house. It was silent, deserted. In the kitchenJess flicked the beam of his flashlight around the room. An empty platelay on the oilcloth-covered table.     This place is empty, he said. Anybody'd think he'd been gone a week.     Not a very cozy\u2014 Tremaine broke off. A thin yelp sounded in thedistance.     I'm getting jumpy, said Jess. Dern hounddog, I guess.     A low growl seemed to rumble distantly. What the devil's that?Tremaine said.     Jess shone the light on the floor. Look here, he said. The ring oflight showed a spatter of dark droplets all across the plank floor.     That's blood, Jess.... Tremaine scanned the floor. It was of broadslabs, closely laid, scrubbed clean but for the dark stains.     Maybe he cleaned a chicken. This is the kitchen.     It's a trail. Tremaine followed the line of drops across the floor.It ended suddenly near the wall.     What do you make of it. Jimmy?     A wail sounded, a thin forlorn cry, trailing off into silence. Jessstared at Tremaine. I'm too damned old to start believing in spooks,he said. You suppose those damn-fool boys are hiding here, playingtricks?     I think. Tremaine said, that we'd better go ask Hull Gaskin a fewquestions.   <doc-sep> I've never seen any harm in Bram, said Jess. But you know how thistown is about foreigners, especially when they're a mite addled. Bramhas blue eyes and blond hair\u2014or did before it turned white\u2014and hetalks just like everybody else. From a distance he seems just like anordinary American. But up close, you feel it. He's foreign, all right.But we never did know where he came from.     How long's he lived here in Elsby?     Beats me, Jimmy. You remember old Aunt Tress, used to know all aboutancestors and such as that? She couldn't remember about Mr. Bram. Shewas kind of senile, I guess. She used to say he'd lived in that sameold place out on the Concord road when she was a girl. Well, she diedfive years ago ... in her seventies. He still walks in town everyWednesday ... or he did up till yesterday anyway.     Oh? Tremaine stubbed out his cigarette, lit another. What happenedthen?     You remember Soup Gaskin? He's got a boy, name of Hull. He's Soup allover again.     I remember Soup, Tremaine said. He and his bunch used to come inthe drug store where I worked and perch on the stools and kid aroundwith me, and Mr. Hempleman would watch them from over back of theprescription counter and look nervous. They used to raise cain in theother drug store....     Soup's been in the pen since then. His boy Hull's the same kind. Himand a bunch of his pals went out to Bram's place one night and set iton fire.     What was the idea of that?     Dunno. Just meanness, I reckon. Not much damage done. A car waspassing by and called it in. I had the whole caboodle locked up herefor six hours. Then the sob sisters went to work: poor little tykeroutine, high spirits, you know the line. All of 'em but Hull are backin the streets playin' with matches by now. I'm waiting for the daythey'll make jail age.     Why Bram? Tremaine persisted. As far as I know, he never had anydealings to speak of with anybody here in town.     Oh hoh, you're a little young, Jimmy, Jess chuckled. You never knewabout Mr. Bram\u2014the young Mr. Bram\u2014and Linda Carroll.     Tremaine shook his head.     Old Miss Carroll. School teacher here for years; guess she was retiredby the time you were playing hookey. But her dad had money, and inher day she was a beauty. Too good for the fellers in these parts. Iremember her ridin by in a high-wheeled shay, when I was just a nipper.Sitting up proud and tall, with that red hair piled up high. I used tothink she was some kind of princess....     What about her and Bram? A romance?  "

        "Summary_1": "From Jess, Tremaine learns that the school teacher, Linda Carroll had a relationship with Bram while they were young. Carroll\u2019s family is quite wealthy and she was very beautiful. People in the town was not really up to her standards. Bram is a foreigner and does not really like social events. However, apparently, Carroll went off together with Bram one day afternoon with almost the whole town there. Then the next day Bram was not by her side, she came back by herself. This made her reputation really bad and she could not even be hired as a teacher for 10 years afterwards. From Carroll, Tremaine learns another story. She seems to not know Bram well. She confirms that she and Bram was in a relationship. And after Bram invited her to his place one day, he explains that he has to fight evil beings below his house every night. After they arrived at his house, she was left in the carriage for the whole night while he was below the house until dawn. Thus she decided to not talk to him when him came to see her in the carriage again. He gave her a locket where a pattern of tapping would allow him to get to her if she ever needs him. Interestingly, she also tells Tremaine that Bram is afraid of the thunder.",
        "Summary_2": "Back in the years, when Carol was in her twenties and Bram a couple years older, he courted her. She was the prettiest young lady in town, unmarried as all locals were too good for her. She was determined to get this foreigner and even made a plan. He was a handsome young man, not a social type of a person, but he was somehow dragged to a shiny. He left together with Carol in the evening, took her to his house and scared her on the way. He talked about fighting evil every night and some other crazy things and disappeared downstairs. She waited outside the whole night and was scared of his madness, she had no intention of listening to him. He gave her a locket which would summon him if used in the right way. They never met again. The memories are still painful for Carol, her reputation was destroyed and she stayed unmarried. ",
        "Summary_3": "In the past, Bram and Carroll had pursued a romantic relationship. He had courted her and taken her to his house, where he scared her by telling her that he fights with evil beings in his house and then locking her beneath the kitchen. The next morning, Bram gave Carroll a locket to keep. Carroll refused to speak to Bram again, telling him that he needed to seek a doctor. The two had not spoken since, but it is revealed that Carroll kept the locket Bram had given her since. ",

However, from his knowledge, it did not end well and Carroll\u2019s reputation was ruined from the events. \n\nFrom Miss Carroll\u2019s own words, she says that her experience with Bram was a bad one. He took her out on a date but began to act strange and talking as if he was crazy. He disappeared, running down a set of stays. Meanwhile, she stayed alone in the car all night.

It looks like Grammond's not willing to be left out in the cold, Fred.Tell him if he queers this\u2014     I don't know but what he might have something, the voice came backover the filtered hum. Suppose he smokes them out\u2014     Don't go dumb on me, Fred. We're not dealing with West Virginiamoonshiners.     Don't tell me my job, Tremaine! the voice snapped. And don't try outyour famous temper on me. I'm still in charge of this investigation.     Sure. Just don't get stuck in some senator's hip pocket. Tremainehung up the telephone, went to the dresser and poured two fingers ofScotch into a water glass. He tossed it down, then pulled on his coatand left the hotel.     He walked south two blocks, turned left down a twilit side street. Hewalked slowly, looking at the weathered frame houses. Number 89 was aonce-stately three-storied mansion overgrown with untrimmed vines, itswindows squares of sad yellow light. He pushed through the gate in theancient picket fence, mounted the porch steps and pushed the buttonbeside the door, a dark panel of cracked varnish. It was a long minutebefore the door opened. A tall woman with white hair and a fine-bonedface looked at him coolly.     Miss Carroll, Tremaine said. You won't remember me, but I\u2014     There is nothing whatever wrong with my faculties, James, MissCarroll said calmly. Her voice was still resonant, a deep contralto.Only a faint quaver reflected her age\u2014close to eighty, Tremainethought, startled.     I'm flattered you remember me, Miss Carroll, he said.     Come in. She led the way to a pleasant parlor set out with thefurnishings of another era. She motioned Tremaine to a seat and took astraight chair across the room from him.     You look very well, James, she said, nodding. I'm pleased to seethat you've amounted to something.     Just another bureaucrat, I'm afraid.     You were wise to leave Elsby. There is no future here for a young man.     I often wondered why you didn't leave, Miss Carroll. I thought, evenas a boy, that you were a woman of great ability.     Why did you come today, James? asked Miss Carroll.     I.... Tremaine started. He looked at the old lady. I want someinformation. This is an important matter. May I rely on yourdiscretion?     Of course.     How long has Mr. Bram lived in Elsby?  "

Jess is surprised to see Tremaine showing up at Elsby again after being away for such a long time. Tremaine has explained to Jess that he is here to figure out the location of a transmitter. While Jess does not seem to be interested in the transmitters, he tells Tremaine about Bram. He explains to him that Bram is quite mysterious, which lead Tremaine to investigate on Bram\u2019s properties. He informs Tremaine about Bram\u2019s relationship with Linda Carroll, and then Tremaine pays her a visit and asks about Bram.

There'll be nothing done against him, Miss Carroll ... unless it needsto be in the national interest.     I'm not at all sure I know what the term 'national interest' means,James. I distrust these glib phrases.     I always liked Mr. Bram, said Tremaine. I'm not out to hurt him.     Mr. Bram came here when I was a young woman. I'm not certain of theyear.     What does he do for a living?     I have no idea.     Why did a healthy young fellow like Bram settle out in that isolatedpiece of country? What's his story?     I'm ... not sure that anyone truly knows Bram's story.     You called him 'Bram', Miss Carroll. Is that his first name ... or hislast?     That is his only name. Just ... Bram.     You knew him well once, Miss Carroll. Is there anything\u2014     A tear rolled down Miss Carroll's faded cheek. She wiped it awayimpatiently.     I'm an unfulfilled old maid, James, she said. You must forgive me.     Tremaine stood up. I'm sorry. Really sorry. I didn't mean to grillyou. Miss Carroll. You've been very kind. I had no right....     Miss Carroll shook her head. I knew you as a boy, James. I havecomplete confidence in you. If anything I can tell you about Bram willbe helpful to you, it is my duty to oblige you; and it may help him.She paused. Tremaine waited.     Many years ago I was courted by Bram. One day he asked me to go withhim to his house. On the way he told me a terrible and pathetic tale.He said that each night he fought a battle with evil beings, alone, ina cave beneath his house.     Miss Carroll drew a deep breath and went on. I was torn between pityand horror. I begged him to take me back. He refused. Miss Carrolltwisted her fingers together, her eyes fixed on the long past. Whenwe reached the house, he ran to the kitchen. He lit a lamp and threwopen a concealed panel. There were stairs. He went down ... and left methere alone.     I waited all that night in the carriage. At dawn he emerged. He triedto speak to me but I would not listen.     He took a locket from his neck and put it into my hand. He told me tokeep it and, if ever I should need him, to press it between my fingersin a secret way ... and he would come. I told him that until he wouldconsent to see a doctor, I did not wish him to call. He drove me home.He never called again.     This locket, said Tremaine, do you still have it?     Miss Carroll hesitated, then put her hand to her throat, lifted asilver disc on a fine golden chain. You see what a foolish old woman Iam, James.     May I see it?     She handed the locket to him. It was heavy, smooth. I'd like toexamine this more closely, he said. May I take it with me?     Miss Carroll nodded.     There is one other thing, she said, perhaps quite meaningless....     I'd be grateful for any lead.     Bram fears the thunder.      III     As Tremaine walked slowly toward the lighted main street of Elsby a carpulled to a stop beside him. Jess leaned out, peered at Tremaine andasked:     Any luck, Jimmy?     Tremaine shook his head. I'm getting nowhere fast. The Bram idea's adud, I'm afraid.     Funny thing about Bram. You know, he hasn't showed up yet. I'm gettinga little worried. Want to run out there with me and take a look around?     Sure. Just so I'm back by full dark.     As they pulled away from the curb Jess said, Jimmy, what's this aboutState Police nosing around here? I thought you were playing a lone handfrom what you were saying to me.     I thought so too, Jess. But it looks like Grammond's a jump ahead ofme. He smells headlines in this; he doesn't want to be left out.     Well, the State cops could be mighty handy to have around. I'mwondering why you don't want 'em in. If there's some kind of spy ringworking\u2014     We're up against an unknown quantity. I don't know what's behind thisand neither does anybody else. Maybe it's a ring of Bolsheviks ...and maybe it's something bigger. I have the feeling we've made enoughmistakes in the last few years; I don't want to see this botched.     The last pink light of sunset was fading from the clouds to the west asJess swung the car through the open gate, pulled up under the old treesbefore the square-built house. The windows were dark. The two men gotout, circled the house once, then mounted the steps and rapped on thedoor. There was a black patch of charred flooring under the window, andthe paint on the wall above it was bubbled. Somewhere a cricket set upa strident chirrup, suddenly cut off. Jess leaned down, picked up anempty shotgun shell. He looked at Tremaine. This don't look good, hesaid. You suppose those fool boys...?     He tried the door. It opened. A broken hasp dangled. He turned toTremaine. Maybe this is more than kid stuff, he said. You carry agun?     In the car.     Better get it.     Tremaine went to the car, dropped the pistol in his coat pocket,rejoined Jess inside the house. It was silent, deserted. In the kitchenJess flicked the beam of his flashlight around the room. An empty platelay on the oilcloth-covered table.     This place is empty, he said. Anybody'd think he'd been gone a week.     Not a very cozy\u2014 Tremaine broke off. A thin yelp sounded in thedistance.     I'm getting jumpy, said Jess. Dern hounddog, I guess.     A low growl seemed to rumble distantly. What the devil's that?Tremaine said.     Jess shone the light on the floor. Look here, he said. The ring oflight showed a spatter of dark droplets all across the plank floor.     That's blood, Jess.... Tremaine scanned the floor. It was of broadslabs, closely laid, scrubbed clean but for the dark stains.     Maybe he cleaned a chicken. This is the kitchen.     It's a trail. Tremaine followed the line of drops across the floor.It ended suddenly near the wall.     What do you make of it. Jimmy?     A wail sounded, a thin forlorn cry, trailing off into silence. Jessstared at Tremaine. I'm too damned old to start believing in spooks,he said. You suppose those damn-fool boys are hiding here, playingtricks?     I think. Tremaine said, that we'd better go ask Hull Gaskin a fewquestions.   <doc-sep> Tremaine left the hotel, walked two blocks west along Commerce Streetand turned in at a yellow brick building with the words ELSBYMUNICIPAL POLICE cut in the stone lintel above the door. Inside, aheavy man with a creased face and thick gray hair looked up from behindan ancient Underwood. He studied Tremaine, shifted a toothpick to theopposite corner of his mouth.     Don't I know you, mister? he said. His soft voice carried a note ofauthority.     Tremaine took off his hat. Sure you do, Jess. It's been a while,though.     The policeman got to his feet. Jimmy, he said, Jimmy Tremaine. Hecame to the counter and put out his hand. How are you, Jimmy? Whatbrings you back to the boondocks?     Let's go somewhere and sit down, Jess.     In a back room Tremaine said, To everybody but you this is just avisit to the old home town. Between us, there's more.     Jess nodded. I heard you were with the guv'ment.     It won't take long to tell; we don't know much yet. Tremaine coveredthe discovery of the powerful unidentified interference on thehigh-security hyperwave band, the discovery that each transmissionproduced not one but a pattern of fixes on the point of origin. Hepassed a sheet of paper across the table. It showed a set of concentriccircles, overlapped by a similar group of rings.     I think what we're getting is an echo effect from each of thesepoints of intersection. The rings themselves represent the diffractionpattern\u2014     Hold it, Jimmy. To me it just looks like a beer ad. I'll take yourword for it.     The point is this, Jess: we think we've got it narrowed down to thissection. I'm not sure of a damn thing, but I think that transmitter'snear here. Now, have you got any ideas?     That's a tough one, Jimmy. This is where I should come up with thenews that Old Man Whatchamacallit's got an attic full of gear he saysis a time machine. Trouble is, folks around here haven't even takento TV. They figure we should be content with radio, like the Lordintended.     I didn't expect any easy answers, Jess. But I was hoping maybe you hadsomething ...     Course, said Jess, there's always Mr. Bram ...     Mr. Bram, repeated Tremaine. Is he still around? I remember him as ahundred years old when I was kid.     Still just the same, Jimmy. Comes in town maybe once a week, buys hisgroceries and hikes back out to his place by the river.     Well, what about him?     Nothing. But he's the town's mystery man. You know that. A littletouched in the head.     There were a lot of funny stories about him, I remember, Tremainesaid. I always liked him. One time he tried to teach me somethingI've forgotten. Wanted me to come out to his place and he'd teach me.I never did go. We kids used to play in the caves near his place, andsometimes he gave us apples.   <doc-sep> I've never seen any harm in Bram, said Jess. But you know how thistown is about foreigners, especially when they're a mite addled. Bramhas blue eyes and blond hair\u2014or did before it turned white\u2014and hetalks just like everybody else. From a distance he seems just like anordinary American. But up close, you feel it. He's foreign, all right.But we never did know where he came from.     How long's he lived here in Elsby?     Beats me, Jimmy. You remember old Aunt Tress, used to know all aboutancestors and such as that? She couldn't remember about Mr. Bram. Shewas kind of senile, I guess. She used to say he'd lived in that sameold place out on the Concord road when she was a girl. Well, she diedfive years ago ... in her seventies. He still walks in town everyWednesday ... or he did up till yesterday anyway.     Oh? Tremaine stubbed out his cigarette, lit another. What happenedthen?     You remember Soup Gaskin? He's got a boy, name of Hull. He's Soup allover again.     I remember Soup, Tremaine said. He and his bunch used to come inthe drug store where I worked and perch on the stools and kid aroundwith me, and Mr. Hempleman would watch them from over back of theprescription counter and look nervous. They used to raise cain in theother drug store....     Soup's been in the pen since then. His boy Hull's the same kind. Himand a bunch of his pals went out to Bram's place one night and set iton fire.     What was the idea of that?     Dunno. Just meanness, I reckon. Not much damage done. A car waspassing by and called it in. I had the whole caboodle locked up herefor six hours. Then the sob sisters went to work: poor little tykeroutine, high spirits, you know the line. All of 'em but Hull are backin the streets playin' with matches by now. I'm waiting for the daythey'll make jail age.     Why Bram? Tremaine persisted. As far as I know, he never had anydealings to speak of with anybody here in town.     Oh hoh, you're a little young, Jimmy, Jess chuckled. You never knewabout Mr. Bram\u2014the young Mr. Bram\u2014and Linda Carroll.     Tremaine shook his head.     Old Miss Carroll. School teacher here for years; guess she was retiredby the time you were playing hookey. But her dad had money, and inher day she was a beauty. Too good for the fellers in these parts. Iremember her ridin by in a high-wheeled shay, when I was just a nipper.Sitting up proud and tall, with that red hair piled up high. I used tothink she was some kind of princess....     What about her and Bram? A romance?  "

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in A PLANET NAMED JOE?",
        "Summary_1": "Major Polk is given orders by his Boss, Colonel Walsh, to go to Venus in search of a man named Joe. Mars is in open revolt against the Colonel and the system that he runs, and Walsh tells Polk that there is a man on Venus who will be able to solve the problem of the revolt, as he spent time on Mars, and knows the natives. The Major and the Colonel hate each other, and it's clear from the get-go that the Colonel is setting the Major up for a trap. He tells Polk that the man's name is Joe, and that he has an affinity for Terran cigarettes. The Major travels to Venus to find this man, and complete the mission. When he arrives though, it becomes clear to him soon that every native Venusian is named Joe, and they all love cigarettes. Polk calls the Major from the office on Venus, asking for extra information, but the Colonel gives none. He has screwed him. The Major decides to look for this man regardless, as returning to Earth without having completed the mission could mean a demotion or a loss of job. He hires a guide to take him through the jungle terrain of Venus, obviously named Joe. As they spend weeks traveling through the jungle together they quickly become friends. They stop at various villages together, where they meet the locals, they chat on their walks and the Major tells Joe all about his past. After a few weeks, they arrive at a village, where a starship and the Colonel are waiting for them. He has a gun pointer and Polk, informing him he plans on killing him, because Polk ratted on Walsh when they were in the academy together about dozing off while he was on watch over a tank filled with uranium. Just before he goes to shoot the Major, he starts insulting the locals of Mars, and then natives in general. Joe becomes visibly upset. The story ends, and it's presumed that Joe will save the Major. ",
        "Summary_2": "Colonel Walsh has appointed Major Polk for a mission on Venus. The two hate each other strongly due to a history at the Academy and Walsh's totalitarian nature towards natives on Mars. The Colonel tells Major Polk that he is to find a specific Venusian native named Joe, who is experienced in trading and loves cigarettes. Major Polk arrives on Mars and immediately meets a Venusian named Joe, but he soon realizes that it is not the man in question. The Major goes into the Officer's Club, where the Venusian bartender is also named Joe. Perplexed, the Major realizes that every native on Venus is named Joe. He meets with Captain Bransten, who tells him that since becoming in contact with Terran men, the Venusians had picked up their mannerisms and behaviors, including their love for cigarettes. Major Polk realizes that the Colonel has sent him on a goose chase, in impossible search of a man. Major Polk calls the Colonel, who smugly assures him that he can find the man in the jungle. The Major decides to play along with Walsh's trick and find a man for the mission. He meets a Venusian tour guide to take him through the jungle, who he gradually befriends as they visit several villages. With still no luck finding the right Joe, Major Polk soon encounters Walsh aboard his ship flying above him. Walsh tells Polk that he will kill him, recalling the time Polk reported him at the Academy. He then expresses his frustration with dealing with the natives on Mars.",

The Colonel says that the man is a Venusian native that holds very valuable information about Mars. He says the man is named Joe and that he likes cigarettes. The Major tries to gather more information but the Colonel only gives him vague answers with a grin on his face. So, with his orders, the Major heads to Venus. When he steps off the ship, he is greeted by a man named Joe. He is shocked because he initially believes it could be the Joe he needs. However, he soon realizes that it is not the correct Joe and asks to be directed to the Officer\u2019s Club. Once he gets inside and goes to the bar, the bartender introduces himself as Joe. \n\nThe Major realizes that Walsh played a trick on him. He\u2019s upset at Walsh for sending him on a petty, retaliatory trip. Frustrated, he heads to the Captain\u2019s shack, where he asks why everyone is named Joe. The Captain chuckles in response and replies that it\u2019s an unoriginal culture. Joe grows angry upon learning this. He\u2019s taken to his sleeping quarters after the meeting. He calls the Colonel and asks for more information on the Joe he\u2019s meant to find. The Colonel finds amusement knowing that Polk has realized his predicament. All the Colonel offers up to the Major is that Joe is somewhere in the jungle. In response, he asks for a guide to take him. As he\u2019s waiting, he thinks of the Colonel\u2019s intentions and how he should respond. The Major decides to go along with the trip and do his best. Once he meets his guide, they head off through the jungle. \n\nHis guide takes him through the jungle, proving to be helpful and useful. They find themselves going from village to village with days turning into weeks spent in the jungle searching for a specific Joe. Joe smiles at some of the Major\u2019s complaints of the tedious nature of the journey in an unusual way during their journey. They eventually reach another village and Joe smiles very wide when he delivers the news to Major Polk. The Major notices that there are no natives in the new village. He sees the Colonel standing near a ship with a stun gun pointed at him. It also seems like Joe knew that the Colonel would be there. Walsh tells the Major that he is going to kill him. As they tensely converse with each other, Joe chuckles and is excited with glee during the conversation. However, when Mars is mentioned, Joe stops being excited and a frown starts to form on his face. Walsh begins to shout hateful words about natives when he realizes that Joe is a native. Joe changes his attitude and looks at the Colonel in confusion. \n",

Despite the fact that he has never been to Venus and Venus is not even in their jurisdiction, Colonel Walsh calls it a simple assignment and asks the Major to travel to Venus. After arriving on Venus, he immediately encounters a boy called Joe. However, this Joe is not the person that he is looking for. Before reporting to Captain Bransten, the Major decides to stop for a drink. He asks Joe to take him there. Somehow, this Joe realizes that the Major is new to this place after he tips him. After arriving at the bar, he meets two more Joes talking to each other, calling each other Joe. Neither is the one that the Major needs to find. Later, he learns from the Captain that the name Joe is just a culture here on Venus, and the natives all like cigarettes. This makes the Major furious since those are two of the few characteristics provided by Colonel Walsh. After chow, the Major calls Walsh, who is on Earth. After getting the information that this Joe is in the jungle, he asks a Joe to find him a guide for going into the jungle. Then, Major begins to realize that maybe Colonel Walsh didn\u2019t want him back since he is the next in line for command. He decides to be more careful. Following the guide, the Major walks from village to village, searching the natives for that particular Joe. The Major and the guide get close and become friend. However, the next village they visit does not have any natives, only Colonel Walsh. And Colonel is there to kill the Major.",
        "Article": "Captain Bransten was a mousey, unimpressive sort of man. He was wearinga tropical tunic, but he still resembled a wilted lily more than he didan officer.     Have a seat, Major, he offered. He reached for a cigarette box on thedesk and extended it to me. He coughed in embarrassment when he saw itwas empty. Quickly, he pressed a button on his desk and the door poppedopen. A tall, blue Venusian stepped lithely into the room.     Sir? the Venusian asked.     We're out of cigarettes, Joe, the Captain said. Will you get ussome, please?     Sure thing, the Venusian answered. He smiled broadly and closed thedoor behind him.       Another Joe     , I thought.      Another damned Joe.       They steal them, Captain Bransten said abruptly.     Steal what? I asked.     Cigarettes. I sometimes think the cigarette is one of the few thingsthey like about Terran culture.     So Walsh had taken care of that angle too.      He does have a peculiarhabit, though. He has an affinity for Terran cigarettes.     Cigaretteswas the tip I should have given; not solars.     All right, I said, suppose we start at the beginning.     Captain Bransten opened his eyes wide. Sir? he asked.     What's with all this Joe business? It may be a very original name butI think its popularity here is a little outstanding.     Captain Bransten began to chuckle softly. I personally didn't think itwas so funny. I tossed him my withering Superior Officer's gaze andwaited for his explanation.     I hadn't realized this was your first time on Venus, he said.     Is there a local hero named Joe? I asked.     No, no, nothing like that, he assured me. It's a simple culture, youknow. Not nearly as developed as Mars.     I can see that, I said bitingly.     And the natives are only now becoming acquainted with Terran culture.Lots of enlisted men, you know.     I began to get the idea. And I began to appreciate Walsh's doubtfulancestry more keenly.     It's impossible to tell exactly where it all started, of course,Bransten was saying.     I was beginning to get angry. Very angry. I was thinking of Walshsitting back in a nice cozy foam chair back on Earth.     Get to the point, Captain! I barked.     Easy, sir, Bransten said, turning pale. I could see that the Captainwasn't used to entertaining Majors. The enlisted men. You know howthey are. They'll ask a native to do something and they'll call himJoe. 'Hey, Joe, give me a hand with this.' Or 'Listen, Joe, how'd youlike to earn some cigarettes?' Do you follow?     I follow, all right, I said bitterly.     Well, Bransten went on, that sort of thing mushrooms. The nativesare a simple, almost childish people. It appealed to them\u2014the Joebusiness, I mean. Now they're all Joe. They like it. That and thecigarettes.     He cleared his throat and looked at me apologetically as if he werepersonally responsible for Venusian culture. In fact, he looked as ifhe were responsible for having put Venus in the heavens in the firstplace.     Do you understand, Major? Just a case of extended idiom, that's all.     Just a case of extended      idiot     , I thought. An idiot on a wild goosechase a hell of a long way from home.     I understand perfectly, I snapped. Where are my quarters?     Bransten asked a Venusian named Joe to show me my quarters, remindingme that chow was at thirteen hundred. As I was leaving, the firstVenusian came back with the cigarettes Bransten had ordered.     I could tell by the look on his face that he probably had half a cartonstuffed into his pockets. I shrugged and went to change into a tropicaltunic.     I called Earth right after chow. The Captain assured me that this sortof thing was definitely against regulations, but he submitted when Itwinkled my little gold leaf under his nose.     Walsh's face appeared on the screen. He was smiling, looking like a fatpussy cat.     What is it, Major? he asked.     This man Joe, I said. Can you give me any more on him?     Walsh's grin grew wider. Why, Major, he said, you're not having anydifficulties, are you?     None at all, I snapped back. I just thought I'd be able to find hima lot sooner if....     Take your time, Major, Walsh beamed. There's no rush at all.     I thought....     I'm sure you can do the job, Walsh cut in. I wouldn't have sent youotherwise.     Hell, I was through kidding around. Look....     He's somewhere in the jungle, you know, Walsh said.     I wanted to ram my fist into the screen, right smack up against thosebig white teeth. Instead, I cut off the transmission and watched thesurprised look on his face as his screen went blank millions of milesaway.     He blinked at the screen, trying to realize I'd deliberately hung up onhim.     Polk! he shouted, can you hear me?     I smiled, saw the twisted hatred on his features, and then the screenon my end went blank, too.       He's somewhere in the jungle, you know.       I thanked Captain Bransten for his hospitality and went back to myquarters.     As I saw it, there were two courses for me to follow.     One: I could say the hell with Walsh and Venus. That would mean hoppingthe next ship back to Earth.     It would also mean disobeying the direct order of a superior officer.It might mean demotion, and it might mean getting bounced out of theService altogether.     Two: I could assume there really was a guy name Joe somewhere in thatjungle, a Joe separate and apart from the other Joes on this planet, atrader Joe who knew the Martians well. I could always admit failure, ofcourse, and return empty handed. Mission not accomplished. Or, I mightreally find a guy who was trader Joe.     I made my decision quickly. I wanted to stay in the Service, andbesides Walsh may have been on the level for the first time in hislife. Maybe there was a Joe here who could help us on Mars. If therewas I'd try to find him. It was still a hell of a trick though.     I cursed Walsh again and pushed the buzzer near my bed.     A tall Venusian stepped into the room.     Joe? I asked, just to be sure.     Who else, boss? he answered.     I'm trying to locate someone, I said. I'll need a guide to take meinto the jungle. Can you get me one?     It'll cost you, boss, the Venusian said.     How much?     Two cartons of cigarettes at least.     Who's the guide? I asked.     How's the price sound?     Fine, fine, I said impatiently. And the Captain had said they werealmost a childish people!     His name is Joe, the Venusian told me. Best damn guide on theplanet. Take you anywhere you want to go, do anything you want to do.Courageous. Doesn't know the meaning of fear. I've known him to....     Skip it, I said, cutting the promotion short. Tell him to show uparound fifteen hundred with a complete list of what we'll need.     The Venusian started to leave.     And Joe, I said, stopping him at the door, I hope you're notoverlooking your commission on the deal.     His face broke into a wide grin. No danger of that, boss, he said.     When he was gone I began figuring out a plan of action. Obviously, I'djust have to traipse through the jungle looking for a guy named Joe ona planet where everyone was named Joe. Everybody, at least, but theCaptain, the small garrison attached to the Station, and me.   <doc-sep>   A PLANET NAMED JOE     By S. A. LOMBINO       There were more Joes on Venus than you could shake       a ray-gun at. Perhaps there was method in Colonel       Walsh's madness\u2014murder-madness\u2014when he ordered Major       Polk to scan the planet for a guy named Joe.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the     U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      Colonel Walsh had a great sense of humor. I hated his guts ever sincewe went through the Academy together, but he had a great sense of humor.     For example, he could have chosen a Second Looie for the job on Venus.He might even have picked a Captain. But he liked me about as much asI liked him, and so he decided the job was just right for a Major. Atleast, that's what he told me.     I stood at attention before his desk in the Patrol Station. We weresomewhere in Area Two on Earth, takeoff point for any operations inSpace II. The duty was fine, and I liked it a lot. Come to think ofit, the most I ever did was inspect a few defective tubes every now andthen. The rest was gravy, and Colonel Walsh wasn't going to let me getby with gravy.     It will be a simple assignment, Major, he said to me, peering overhis fingers. He held them up in front of him like a cathedral.     Yes, sir, I said.     It will involve finding one man, a Venusian native.     I wanted to say, Then why the hell don't you send a green kid onthe job? Why me? Instead, I nodded and watched him playing with hisfingers.     The man is a trader of sorts. Rather intelligent. He paused, thenadded, For a native, that is.     I had never liked Walsh's attitude toward natives. I hadn't liked theway he'd treated the natives on Mars ever since he'd taken over there.Which brought to mind an important point.     I always figured Venus was under the jurisdiction of Space III, sir. Ithought our activities were confined to Mars.     He folded his fingers like a deck of cards and dropped them on his deskas if he were waiting for me to cut.     Mmmm, he said, yes, that's true. But this is a special job. It sohappens this Venusian is the one man who can help us understand justwhat's happening on Mars.     I tried to picture a Venusian understanding Mars and I didn't get veryfar.     He's had many dealings with the natives there, Walsh explained. Ifanyone can tell us the reasons for the revolt, he can.     If Walsh really wanted to know the reasons for the revolt, I could givethem to him in one word: Walsh. I had to laugh at the way he calledit revolt. It had been going on for six months now and we'd lost atleast a thousand men from Space II. Revolt.     And this man is on Venus now? I asked for confirmation. I'd neverbeen to Venus, being in Space II ever since I'd left the Moon run. Itwas just like Walsh to ship me off to a strange place.     Yes, Major, he said. This man is on Venus.     At the Academy he had called me Fred. That was before I'd reportedhim for sleeping on Boiler Watch. He'd goofed off on a pile of uraniumthat could've, and almost did, blow the barracks sky-high that night.He still thought it was my fault, as if I'd done the wrong thing byreporting him. And now, through the fouled-up machinery that exists inany military organization, he outranked me.     And the man's name, sir?     Joe. A tight smile played on his face.     Joe what? I asked.     Just Joe.     Just Joe?     Yes, Walsh said. A native, you know. They rarely go in for more thanfirst names. But then, it should be simple to find a man with a namelike Joe. Among the natives, I mean.     I don't know, sir.     A relatively simple assignment, Walsh said.     Can you tell me anything else about this man? Physical appearance?Personal habits? Anything?     Walsh seemed to consider this for a moment. Well, physically he's likeany of the other Venusians, so I can't give you much help there. Hedoes have a peculiar habit, though.     What's that?     He has an affinity for Terran cigarettes.     I sighed. Well, it's not very much to go on.     You'll find him, Walsh said, grinning. I'm sure of it.   <doc-sep> What is it you wish? he barked. I understood in my discussions withthe other ... ah ... civilian there'd be no further need for theseirritating conferences.     I've just learned you're placing more students abroad, Mr. Gulver. Howmany this time?     Two thousand.     And where will they be going?     Croanie. It's all in the application form I've handed in. Your job isto provide transportation.     Will there be any other students embarking this season?     Why ... perhaps. That's Boge's business. Gulver looked at Retief withpursed lips. As a matter of fact, we had in mind dispatching anothertwo thousand to Featherweight.     Another under-populated world\u2014and in the same cluster, I believe,Retief said. Your people must be unusually interested in that regionof space.     If that's all you wanted to know, I'll be on my way. I have matters ofimportance to see to.     After Gulver left, Retief called Miss Furkle in. I'd like to have abreak-out of all the student movements that have been planned under thepresent program, he said. And see if you can get a summary of whatMEDDLE has been shipping lately.     Miss Furkle compressed her lips. If Mr. Magnan were here, I'm surehe wouldn't dream of interfering in the work of other departments.I ... overheard your conversation with the gentleman from the CroanieLegation\u2014     The lists, Miss Furkle.     I'm not accustomed, Miss Furkle said, to intruding in mattersoutside our interest cluster.     That's worse than listening in on phone conversations, eh? But nevermind. I need the information, Miss Furkle.     Loyalty to my Chief\u2014     Loyalty to your pay-check should send you scuttling for the materialI've asked for, Retief said. I'm taking full responsibility. Nowscat.     The buzzer sounded. Retief flipped a key. MUDDLE, Retief speaking....     Arapoulous's brown face appeared on the desk screen.     How-do, Retief. Okay if I come up?     Sure, Hank. I want to talk to you.     In the office, Arapoulous took a chair. Sorry if I'm rushing you,Retief, he said. But have you got anything for me?     Retief waved at the wine bottles. What do you know about Croanie?     Croanie? Not much of a place. Mostly ocean. All right if you likefish, I guess. We import our seafood from there. Nice prawns in monsoontime. Over a foot long.     You on good terms with them?     Sure, I guess so. Course, they're pretty thick with Boge.     So?     Didn't I tell you? Boge was the bunch that tried to take us over herea dozen years back. They'd've made it too, if they hadn't had a lot ofbad luck. Their armor went in the drink, and without armor they're easygame.     Miss Furkle buzzed. I have your lists, she said shortly.     Bring them in, please.  "

        "Query": "What is the reason for the animosity between the Colonel and the Major in A PLANET NAMED JOE?",
        "Summary_1": "The Colonel and the Major seemed as if they were acquaintances before they first fell out. The Colonel had called the Major, by his first name, Fred. Now, he only calls him Major, as a mark of disrespect, since the colonel somehow outranks him. The Colonel also demands that Polk use his proper title, as a way of putting him down. They initially fell out because one night, while the Colonel was supposed to be on boiled watch, guarding the uranium in a tank beneath the barracks, he fell asleep on duty. The entire barracks could've been blown up. The Major had to report him to their superiors. This meant that the colonel's career took a big hit, and he had to fight his way back into the ranks. He felt as if the Major betrayed him, and ratted him out. Now, the Colonel is in charge of Mars, where he has caused a revolt based on his shocking treatment of the natives. His prejudice towards the native people of Venus and Mars is another reason the Major hates him. ",
        "Summary_2": "The Colonel and the Major attended the Academy together, and the two have despised each other since. At the Academy, Major Polk had reported the Colonel for falling asleep on duty, risking severe damage. Major Polk also holds reservations about the Colonel because of Walsh's treatment of natives, specifically on Mars after conquering the planet. He understands why there is a revolt against Walsh on Mars, given the way he degrades its natives. Colonel Walsh still holds reservations towards Major Polk since he reported him.",
        "Summary_3": "Colonel Walsh and Major Polk have hated each other ever since they both went through the Academy at the same time. The Major does not like Walsh\u2019s attitude towards natives, especially how he treats them. From this, it is able to be discerned that Walsh has a very unfavorable attitude towards natives and regularly insults or hurts them. He also does not believe that the Colonel is understanding the severity of the current military situation. The Major also believes that Walsh does a bad job of managing the planet. The hatred that the Colonel has towards the Major is because the Major reported him for sleeping on the job while they were both at the Academy. The Major defends his reporting of the Colonel by arguing that the Colonel was supposed to be watching a uranium supply that was very dangerous and could have killed many people. \n\nThe Colonel appears to be threatened by the Major because he would be next in line of command if the Colonel is ousted from his position. The Colonel acknowledges that he is possibly failing at his job with the Mars issue and does not want to be demoted and for Major Polk to take over his job. \n",
        "Summary_4": "The Major and Colonel were in the same Academy. But one time, the Colonel fell asleep on Boiler Watch. There was a pile of uranium that could\u2019ve blown up the whole Academy. When the Major caught this he reported him. But apparently, the Colonel still thinks that it is the Major\u2019s fault for reporting him. The Major also dislikes the way that the Colonel treats the natives. He calls them savages. The Colonel sends the Major to Venus and tells him a non-description of a man that he needs to find. This annoys the Major. He gets angry especially when he finds out that the description is completely useless since every man here names Joe and likes cigarette. The Colonel actually sends the Major here to kill him. ",

There were no natives rushing outto greet us. No cries of Cigarettes? Cigarettes? I caught up with Joe.     What's the story? I whispered.     He shrugged knowingly and continued walking.     And then I saw the ship, nose pointing into space, catching the rays ofthe sun like a great silver bullet.     What...? I started.     It's all right, Joe said, smiling.     The ship looked vaguely familiar. I noticed the crest of Space II nearthe nose, and a lot of things became clear then. I also saw Walshstanding near one of the huts, a stun gun in his hand.     Hello, Major, he called, almost cheerfully. The gun didn't lookcheerful, though. It was pointed at my head.     Fancy meeting you here, Colonel, I said, trying to match hisjoviality. Somehow it didn't quite come off.     Joe was walking beside me, waving at the colonel, beaming all over withhappiness.     I see you found your man, Walsh said.     I turned rapidly. Joe nodded and kept grinning, a grin that told me hewas getting a big kick out of all this. Like a kid playing a game.     I faced Walsh again. Okay, what's it all about, pal?     Colonel, Walsh corrected me. You mustn't forget to say Colonel,      Major     . He emphasized my rank, and he said it with a sort of ruthlessfinality.     I waited. I could see he was just busting to tell me how clever he'dbeen. Besides, there wasn't much I could do but wait. Not with Walshpointing the stun gun at my middle.     We've come a long way since the Academy, haven't we, Major?     If you mean in miles, I said, looking around at the plants, we surehave.     Walsh grinned a little. Always the wit, he said drily. And then thesmile faded from his lips and his eyes took on a hard lustre. I'mgoing to kill you, you know. He said it as if he were saying, I thinkit'll rain tomorrow.     Joe almost clapped his hands together with glee. He was really enjoyingthis. Another of those funny Terran games.     You gave me a powerful handicap to overcome, Walsh said. I suppose Ishould thank you, really.     You're welcome, I said.     It wasn't easy living down the disgrace you caused me.     It was your own damn fault, I said. You knew what you were doingwhen you decided to cork off.     Beside me, Joe chuckled a little, enjoying the game immensely.     You didn't have to report me, Walsh said.     No? Maybe I should have forgotten all about it? Maybe I should havenudged you and served you orange juice? So you could do it againsometime and maybe blow up the whole damn Academy!     Walsh was silent for a long time. When he spoke his voice was barelyaudible. The heat was oppressive, as if it were concentrated on thislittle spot in the jungle, focusing all its penetration on a small,unimportant drama.     I could hear Joe breathing beside me.     I'm on my way out, Walsh rasped. Finished, do you understand?     Good, I said. And I meant it.     This Mars thing. A terrible fix. Terrible.     Beside me, a slight frown crossed Joe's face. Apparently he couldn'tunderstand the seriousness of our voices. What had happened to thegame, the fun?     You brought the Mars business on yourself, I told Walsh. There wasnever any trouble before you took command.     The natives, he practically shouted. They ... they....     Joe caught his breath sharply, and I wondered what Walsh was going tosay about the natives. Apparently he'd realized that Joe was a native.Or maybe Joe's knife had something to do with it.     What about the natives? I asked.     Nothing, Walsh said. Nothing. He was silent for a while.     A man of my calibre, he said then, his face grim. Dealing withsavages. He caught himself again and threw a hasty glance at Joe.The perplexed frown had grown heavier on Joe's face. He looked at thecolonel in puzzlement.   <doc-sep> The trip to Venus came off without a hitch. I did a lot of thinking onthat trip. I thought about Mars and the revolt there. And I thoughtabout Colonel Leonard Walsh and how he was supposed to be quelling thatrevolt. Ever since Walsh had taken command, ever since he'd startedpushing the natives around, there'd been trouble. It was almost as ifthe whole damned planet had blown up in our faces the moment he tookover. Swell guy, Walsh.     Venus was hotter than I'd expected it to be. Much too hot for the tunicI was wearing. It smelled, too. A funny smell I couldn't place. Likea mixture of old shoe and after-shave. There were plants everywhereI looked. Big plants and small ones, some blooming with flowers I'dnever seen before, and some as bare as cactus.     I recognized a blue figure as one of the natives the pilot had told meabout. He was tall, looking almost human except that everything abouthim was elongated. His features, his muscles, everything seemed to havebeen stretched like a rubber band. I kept expecting him to pop back tonormal. Instead, he flashed a double row of brilliant teeth at me.     I wondered if he spoke English. Hey, boy, I called.     He ambled over with long-legged strides that closed the distancebetween us in seconds.     Call me Joe, he said.     I dropped my bags and stared at him. Maybe this      was     going to be asimple assignment after all. I sure am glad to see you, Joe, I said.     Same here, Toots, he answered.     The guys back in Space II are searching high and low for you, I toldhim.     You've got the wrong number, he said, and I was a little surprised athis use of Terran idiom.     You are Joe, aren't you? Joe the trader?     I'm Joe, all right, he said. Only thing I ever traded, though, was apocketknife. Got a set of keys for it.     Oh, I said, my voice conveying my disappointment. I sighed and beganwondering just how I should go about contacting the Joe I was lookingfor. My orders said I was to report to Captain Bransten immediatelyupon arrival. I figured the hell with Captain Bransten. I outranked himanyway, and there wasn't much he could do if I decided to stop for adrink first.     Where's the Officer's Club? I asked the Venusian.     Are you buying information or are you just curious?     Can you take me there? I asked.     Sure thing, Toots. He picked up my bags and started walking up aheavily overgrown path. We'd probably walked for about ten minutes whenhe dropped my bags and said, There it is.     The Officer's Club was a plasteel hut with window shields thatprotected it from the heat of the sun. It didn't look too comfortablebut I really wanted that drink. I reached into my tunic and slippedthe native thirty solars.     He stared at the credits curiously and then shrugged his shoulders. Ohwell, you're new here. We'll let it go.     He took off then, while I stared after him, wondering just what he'dmeant. Had I tipped him too little?     I shrugged and looked over at the Officer's Club. From the outside itlooked as hot as hell.     On the inside it was about two degrees short of that mark. I began tocurse Walsh for taking me away from my nice soft job in Space II.     There wasn't much inside the club. A few tables and chairs, a dart gameand a bar. Behind the bar a tall Venusian lounged.     I walked over and asked, What are you serving, pal?     Call me Joe, he answered.     He caught me off balance. What?     Joe, he said again.     A faint glimmer of understanding began to penetrate my thick skull.You wouldn't happen to be Joe the trader? The guy who knows all aboutMars, would you?     I never left home, he said simply. What are you drinking?     That rat! That dirty, filthy, stinking, unprincipled....       But then, it should be simple to find a man with a name like     Joe.      Among the natives, I mean.       Sure. Oh sure. Real simple. Walsh was about the lowest, mostcontemptible....     What are you drinking, pal? the Venusian asked again.     Skip it, I said. How do I get to the captain's shack?     Follow your nose, pal. Can't miss it.     I started to pick up my bag as another Venusian entered. He waved atthe bartender.     Hello, Joe, he said. How's it going?     Not so hot, Joe, the bartender replied.     I listened in fascination. Joe, Joe, Joe. So this was Walsh's idea of agreat gag. Very funny. Very....     You Major Polk, sweetheart? the Venusian who'd just come in asked.     Yes, I said, still thinking of Colonel Walsh.     You better get your butt over to the captain's shack, he said. He'sabout ready to post you as overdue.     Sure, I said wearily. Will you take my bags, please?     Roger, he answered. He picked up the bags and nodded at the bar.     So long, Joe, he said to the bartender.     See you, Joe, the bartender called back.  "

        "Query": "What is the primary location in which the events of A PLANET NAMED JOE take place?",
        "Summary_1": "The main setting of the story is the planet Venus. The planet is described as being extremely hot, and having the scent of an old shoe and after shave. There are plants everywhere, of all sizes and varieties, some with strange and wonderful flowers. There is a station for Space II, which includes The Officers Club: a small shack which functions as a bar, and The Captain's Shack. The world is covered in thick jungle, which is impossible to orient unless you're a local. The floor of the jungle is filled with sharp undergrowth that would shred your feet. In the jungle are little hidden pathways that lead to small villages, where native Venusians live. \n",
        "Summary_2": "The story mainly takes place on the planet Venus, its climate primarily consisting of thick jungles and rainforests. Major Polk describes the planet as very hot with a strange smell, with unfamiliar plants. The natives on Venus are tall, blue, human looking figures. Major Polk first visits the Officer's Club, a tiny hut. Later in the story, Major Polk is guided through the jungles of Venus by Joe, which are described as impenetrable and humid.",
        "Summary_3": "The story begins on Earth. Major Polk is at the Patrol Station in Area Two on Earth to meet with the Colonel. Major Polk is assigned to find a man on Venus by the Colonel. So, he heads to Venus. The Major describes the planet as incredibly hot and uncomfortable. It also has a smell that isn\u2019t easily discernible. There are large and small plants with unusual flowers dotted all over the place. The first place that the Major goes to on Venus is the Officer\u2019s Club, a hut with window shields meant to protect from the heat. Nevertheless, the place was still very hot inside. Inside there were some seating, basic bar games, and the bar where a Venusian bartender stood. Once he leaves the bar, he heads to the Captain\u2019s shack to find more information on the situation. Eventually leaving the Captain\u2019s shack, he goes to his sleeping quarters. After finding a guide, the Major and his guide head off into the jungle in search of a Joe. They go through a thick jungle, encountering different villages along the way. The jungle is so thick that occasionally, the guide has to use a knife to cut through the brush. After weeks, they make it to one particular village where the Major spots a ship that catches the rays of the sun. The Colonel is standing near the ship with a gun pointed at Major Polk. ",
        "Summary_4": "The main setting of the story is on Venus, where the temperature is very hot and has a strange smell. The whole planet is filled with plants, big and small, blooming and bare. There is a heavily overgrown path that leads to the Officer\u2019s Club. The bar has pastel hut and window shields for protection against the sun. The bar has some chairs and tables, a dart game, and a bar. Captain Bransten\u2019s office has a desk and there is a button on the desk that would call for a Venusian. There is also a screen for calling Earth. The Major\u2019s quarter also has a buzzer near his bed. The jungle is filled with plants, and sometimes even fogs. The villages have natives and huts that they live in. Later in the village where there is no natives, there is only a ship that has the crest of Space II. ",
        "Article": "Captain Bransten was a mousey, unimpressive sort of man. He was wearinga tropical tunic, but he still resembled a wilted lily more than he didan officer.     Have a seat, Major, he offered. He reached for a cigarette box on thedesk and extended it to me. He coughed in embarrassment when he saw itwas empty. Quickly, he pressed a button on his desk and the door poppedopen. A tall, blue Venusian stepped lithely into the room.     Sir? the Venusian asked.     We're out of cigarettes, Joe, the Captain said. Will you get ussome, please?     Sure thing, the Venusian answered. He smiled broadly and closed thedoor behind him.       Another Joe     , I thought.      Another damned Joe.       They steal them, Captain Bransten said abruptly.     Steal what? I asked.     Cigarettes. I sometimes think the cigarette is one of the few thingsthey like about Terran culture.     So Walsh had taken care of that angle too.      He does have a peculiarhabit, though. He has an affinity for Terran cigarettes.     Cigaretteswas the tip I should have given; not solars.     All right, I said, suppose we start at the beginning.     Captain Bransten opened his eyes wide. Sir? he asked.     What's with all this Joe business? It may be a very original name butI think its popularity here is a little outstanding.     Captain Bransten began to chuckle softly. I personally didn't think itwas so funny. I tossed him my withering Superior Officer's gaze andwaited for his explanation.     I hadn't realized this was your first time on Venus, he said.     Is there a local hero named Joe? I asked.     No, no, nothing like that, he assured me. It's a simple culture, youknow. Not nearly as developed as Mars.     I can see that, I said bitingly.     And the natives are only now becoming acquainted with Terran culture.Lots of enlisted men, you know.     I began to get the idea. And I began to appreciate Walsh's doubtfulancestry more keenly.     It's impossible to tell exactly where it all started, of course,Bransten was saying.     I was beginning to get angry. Very angry. I was thinking of Walshsitting back in a nice cozy foam chair back on Earth.     Get to the point, Captain! I barked.     Easy, sir, Bransten said, turning pale. I could see that the Captainwasn't used to entertaining Majors. The enlisted men. You know howthey are. They'll ask a native to do something and they'll call himJoe. 'Hey, Joe, give me a hand with this.' Or 'Listen, Joe, how'd youlike to earn some cigarettes?' Do you follow?     I follow, all right, I said bitterly.     Well, Bransten went on, that sort of thing mushrooms. The nativesare a simple, almost childish people. It appealed to them\u2014the Joebusiness, I mean. Now they're all Joe. They like it. That and thecigarettes.     He cleared his throat and looked at me apologetically as if he werepersonally responsible for Venusian culture. In fact, he looked as ifhe were responsible for having put Venus in the heavens in the firstplace.     Do you understand, Major? Just a case of extended idiom, that's all.     Just a case of extended      idiot     , I thought. An idiot on a wild goosechase a hell of a long way from home.     I understand perfectly, I snapped. Where are my quarters?     Bransten asked a Venusian named Joe to show me my quarters, remindingme that chow was at thirteen hundred. As I was leaving, the firstVenusian came back with the cigarettes Bransten had ordered.     I could tell by the look on his face that he probably had half a cartonstuffed into his pockets. I shrugged and went to change into a tropicaltunic.     I called Earth right after chow. The Captain assured me that this sortof thing was definitely against regulations, but he submitted when Itwinkled my little gold leaf under his nose.     Walsh's face appeared on the screen. He was smiling, looking like a fatpussy cat.     What is it, Major? he asked.     This man Joe, I said. Can you give me any more on him?     Walsh's grin grew wider. Why, Major, he said, you're not having anydifficulties, are you?     None at all, I snapped back. I just thought I'd be able to find hima lot sooner if....     Take your time, Major, Walsh beamed. There's no rush at all.     I thought....     I'm sure you can do the job, Walsh cut in. I wouldn't have sent youotherwise.     Hell, I was through kidding around. Look....     He's somewhere in the jungle, you know, Walsh said.     I wanted to ram my fist into the screen, right smack up against thosebig white teeth. Instead, I cut off the transmission and watched thesurprised look on his face as his screen went blank millions of milesaway.     He blinked at the screen, trying to realize I'd deliberately hung up onhim.     Polk! he shouted, can you hear me?     I smiled, saw the twisted hatred on his features, and then the screenon my end went blank, too.       He's somewhere in the jungle, you know.       I thanked Captain Bransten for his hospitality and went back to myquarters.     As I saw it, there were two courses for me to follow.     One: I could say the hell with Walsh and Venus. That would mean hoppingthe next ship back to Earth.     It would also mean disobeying the direct order of a superior officer.It might mean demotion, and it might mean getting bounced out of theService altogether.     Two: I could assume there really was a guy name Joe somewhere in thatjungle, a Joe separate and apart from the other Joes on this planet, atrader Joe who knew the Martians well. I could always admit failure, ofcourse, and return empty handed. Mission not accomplished. Or, I mightreally find a guy who was trader Joe.     I made my decision quickly. I wanted to stay in the Service, andbesides Walsh may have been on the level for the first time in hislife. Maybe there was a Joe here who could help us on Mars. If therewas I'd try to find him. It was still a hell of a trick though.     I cursed Walsh again and pushed the buzzer near my bed.     A tall Venusian stepped into the room.     Joe? I asked, just to be sure.     Who else, boss? he answered.     I'm trying to locate someone, I said. I'll need a guide to take meinto the jungle. Can you get me one?     It'll cost you, boss, the Venusian said.     How much?     Two cartons of cigarettes at least.     Who's the guide? I asked.     How's the price sound?     Fine, fine, I said impatiently. And the Captain had said they werealmost a childish people!     His name is Joe, the Venusian told me. Best damn guide on theplanet. Take you anywhere you want to go, do anything you want to do.Courageous. Doesn't know the meaning of fear. I've known him to....     Skip it, I said, cutting the promotion short. Tell him to show uparound fifteen hundred with a complete list of what we'll need.     The Venusian started to leave.     And Joe, I said, stopping him at the door, I hope you're notoverlooking your commission on the deal.     His face broke into a wide grin. No danger of that, boss, he said.     When he was gone I began figuring out a plan of action. Obviously, I'djust have to traipse through the jungle looking for a guy named Joe ona planet where everyone was named Joe. Everybody, at least, but theCaptain, the small garrison attached to the Station, and me.   <doc-sep>   A PLANET NAMED JOE     By S. A. LOMBINO       There were more Joes on Venus than you could shake       a ray-gun at. Perhaps there was method in Colonel       Walsh's madness\u2014murder-madness\u2014when he ordered Major       Polk to scan the planet for a guy named Joe.       [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories     November 1952. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the     U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      Colonel Walsh had a great sense of humor. I hated his guts ever sincewe went through the Academy together, but he had a great sense of humor.     For example, he could have chosen a Second Looie for the job on Venus.He might even have picked a Captain. But he liked me about as much asI liked him, and so he decided the job was just right for a Major. Atleast, that's what he told me.     I stood at attention before his desk in the Patrol Station. We weresomewhere in Area Two on Earth, takeoff point for any operations inSpace II. The duty was fine, and I liked it a lot. Come to think ofit, the most I ever did was inspect a few defective tubes every now andthen. The rest was gravy, and Colonel Walsh wasn't going to let me getby with gravy.     It will be a simple assignment, Major, he said to me, peering overhis fingers. He held them up in front of him like a cathedral.     Yes, sir, I said.     It will involve finding one man, a Venusian native.     I wanted to say, Then why the hell don't you send a green kid onthe job? Why me? Instead, I nodded and watched him playing with hisfingers.     The man is a trader of sorts. Rather intelligent. He paused, thenadded, For a native, that is.     I had never liked Walsh's attitude toward natives. I hadn't liked theway he'd treated the natives on Mars ever since he'd taken over there.Which brought to mind an important point.     I always figured Venus was under the jurisdiction of Space III, sir. Ithought our activities were confined to Mars.     He folded his fingers like a deck of cards and dropped them on his deskas if he were waiting for me to cut.     Mmmm, he said, yes, that's true. But this is a special job. It sohappens this Venusian is the one man who can help us understand justwhat's happening on Mars.     I tried to picture a Venusian understanding Mars and I didn't get veryfar.     He's had many dealings with the natives there, Walsh explained. Ifanyone can tell us the reasons for the revolt, he can.     If Walsh really wanted to know the reasons for the revolt, I could givethem to him in one word: Walsh. I had to laugh at the way he calledit revolt. It had been going on for six months now and we'd lost atleast a thousand men from Space II. Revolt.     And this man is on Venus now? I asked for confirmation. I'd neverbeen to Venus, being in Space II ever since I'd left the Moon run. Itwas just like Walsh to ship me off to a strange place.     Yes, Major, he said. This man is on Venus.     At the Academy he had called me Fred. That was before I'd reportedhim for sleeping on Boiler Watch. He'd goofed off on a pile of uraniumthat could've, and almost did, blow the barracks sky-high that night.He still thought it was my fault, as if I'd done the wrong thing byreporting him. And now, through the fouled-up machinery that exists inany military organization, he outranked me.     And the man's name, sir?     Joe. A tight smile played on his face.     Joe what? I asked.     Just Joe.     Just Joe?     Yes, Walsh said. A native, you know. They rarely go in for more thanfirst names. But then, it should be simple to find a man with a namelike Joe. Among the natives, I mean.     I don't know, sir.     A relatively simple assignment, Walsh said.     Can you tell me anything else about this man? Physical appearance?Personal habits? Anything?     Walsh seemed to consider this for a moment. Well, physically he's likeany of the other Venusians, so I can't give you much help there. Hedoes have a peculiar habit, though.     What's that?     He has an affinity for Terran cigarettes.     I sighed. Well, it's not very much to go on.     You'll find him, Walsh said, grinning. I'm sure of it.   <doc-sep> Hendricks reached into a pocket, withdrew several bills and extendedthem. I'll loan you some money. You can sign an IOU and pay me back alittle at a time.     Joe waved the money away. Listen, why don't you do me a favor? Whydon't you frame me? If I'm such a nuisance, pin a crime on me\u2014anycrime.     Can't do it. Convicting a man of a crime he didn't commit is aviolation of Civil Rights and a crime in itself.     Umm.     Why don't you take the free psycho treatment? A man doesn't      have     tobe a DCT. With the free treatment, psychologists can remove all yourcriminal tendencies and\u2014     Go to those      head-shrinkers     ?     Hendricks shrugged again. Have it your way.     Joe laughed. If your damned CPA is so all-powerful, why can't you      make     me go?     Violation of Civil Rights.     Damn it, there must be some way you can help me! We both want the samething. We both want to see me convicted of a crime.     How can I help you without committing a crime myself? Hendrickswalked to his desk, opened a drawer and removed a small black book.See this? It contains names and addresses of all the people in NewYork who aren't properly protected. Every week we find people whoaren't protected properly\u2014blind spots in our protection devices. Assoon as we find them, we take steps to install anti-robbery devices,but this is a big city and sometimes it takes days to get the work done.     In the meantime, any one of these people could be robbed. But what canI do? I can't hold this book in front of your nose and say, 'Here, Joe,pick a name and go out and rob him.' He laughed nervously. If I didthat, I'd be committing a crime myself!     He placed the book on the desk top, took a handkerchief from a pocketagain and wiped sweat from his face. Excuse me a minute. I'm dying ofthirst. There's a water cooler in the next room.     Joe stared at the door to the adjoining office as it closed behind thebig man. Hendricks was\u2014unbelievably\u2014offering him a victim, offeringhim a crime!     Almost running to the desk, Joe opened the book, selected a name andaddress and memorized it:      John Gralewski, Apt. 204, 2141 Orange St.       When Hendricks came back, Joe said, Thanks.     Huh? Thanks for what? I didn't do anything.  "

        "Query": "How are Major Polk and his guide, Joe, connected in the story \"A Planet Named Joe\"?",
        "Summary_1": "The relationship between the two characters starts off as one of business. Polk hires Joe to show him through the jungle. Joe is described as the best that there is, as he has lived there all his life. The two set off immediately for the jungle. As they journey through the forest, they begin to talk. Polk finds that he really enjoys the company of the Venusian. He likes that Joe always seems to be happy, and knows just what to say to cheer Polk up. He admires that he's so friendly to the locals, and immediately chats and laughs with them. Polk soon begins speaking freely to Joe, telling him about his past, as Joe would listen with the sympathetic ear. They found that they hsa a lot in common. This is why it was shocking to discover that Joe was in fact working for the Colonel the whole time, leading Polk right to him, and right to his death. ",
        "Summary_2": "The relationship between Major Polk and Joe initially starts out as strictly professional, with Joe guiding him through the jungle. As the trip progresses the two become companions, speaking to each other casually. Major Polk notes the passion Joe has for the jungle and how much he enjoys the trip, and says that Joe provides a refreshing and uplifting presence throughout the trip. The two eventually begin telling each other about their own lives, sharing stories and becoming friends.",
        "Summary_3": "At the beginning of their time together, Joe the guide seems to be very helpful to Polk. He recommends the supplies the Major would need to have a more comfortable journey in the jungle and they prove to be very useful during their adventure. During their time together, the Major observes that Joe seems to really enjoy his job. Days into their journey, the Major is feeling very dejected by not making any progress while Joe seems to be very content. It appears Joe is always in a good mood and is not influenced by the Major\u2019s emotionally discontent. The Major notes that the relationship started off as an employer and employee constrained type but it soon became very friendly and developed to where they were sharing stories with each other. The Major increasingly talks freely with his guide. \n\nWhile the relationship appeared to be very friendly during the journey in the jungle, it appears that Major Polk should have not trusted the guide. The guide appears to have already known that the Colonel would be in a clearing waiting with a stun gun for Polk as he laughs during the beginning of their encounter. It becomes clearer that Joe planned this with the Colonel, and thus betraying the friendly relationship he made with Polk. However, Joe\u2019s attitude begins to change as he responds with a confused look towards the Colonel\u2019s remarks about natives and Mars. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Major Polk has a formal relationship with his guide in the beginning. He would pay the guide, Joe, cigarettes and he would simply follow Joe as he finds his way through the jungle. Later, they started to talk more freely as the journey progresses. It was much less formal but more casual as the time went by. The Major starts to talk about Earth, the Academy, the Moon run, etc. And Joe is a great listener. Thus, they become friends. ",

Two: I could assume there really was a guy name Joe somewhere in thatjungle, a Joe separate and apart from the other Joes on this planet, atrader Joe who knew the Martians well. I could always admit failure, ofcourse, and return empty handed. Mission not accomplished. Or, I mightreally find a guy who was trader Joe.     I made my decision quickly. I wanted to stay in the Service, andbesides Walsh may have been on the level for the first time in hislife. Maybe there was a Joe here who could help us on Mars. If therewas I'd try to find him. It was still a hell of a trick though.     I cursed Walsh again and pushed the buzzer near my bed.     A tall Venusian stepped into the room.     Joe? I asked, just to be sure.     Who else, boss? he answered.     I'm trying to locate someone, I said. I'll need a guide to take meinto the jungle. Can you get me one?     It'll cost you, boss, the Venusian said.     How much?     Two cartons of cigarettes at least.     Who's the guide? I asked.     How's the price sound?     Fine, fine, I said impatiently. And the Captain had said they werealmost a childish people!     His name is Joe, the Venusian told me. Best damn guide on theplanet. Take you anywhere you want to go, do anything you want to do.Courageous. Doesn't know the meaning of fear. I've known him to....     Skip it, I said, cutting the promotion short. Tell him to show uparound fifteen hundred with a complete list of what we'll need.     The Venusian started to leave.     And Joe, I said, stopping him at the door, I hope you're notoverlooking your commission on the deal.     His face broke into a wide grin. No danger of that, boss, he said.     When he was gone I began figuring out a plan of action. Obviously, I'djust have to traipse through the jungle looking for a guy named Joe ona planet where everyone was named Joe. Everybody, at least, but theCaptain, the small garrison attached to the Station, and me.   <doc-sep>   A PLANET NAMED JOE     By S. A. LOMBINO       There were more Joes on Venus than you could shake       a ray-gun at. Perhaps there was method in Colonel       Walsh's madness\u2014murder-madness\u2014when he ordered Major       Polk to scan the planet for a guy named Joe.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the     U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      Colonel Walsh had a great sense of humor. I hated his guts ever sincewe went through the Academy together, but he had a great sense of humor.     For example, he could have chosen a Second Looie for the job on Venus.He might even have picked a Captain. But he liked me about as much asI liked him, and so he decided the job was just right for a Major. Atleast, that's what he told me.     I stood at attention before his desk in the Patrol Station. We weresomewhere in Area Two on Earth, takeoff point for any operations inSpace II. The duty was fine, and I liked it a lot. Come to think ofit, the most I ever did was inspect a few defective tubes every now andthen. The rest was gravy, and Colonel Walsh wasn't going to let me getby with gravy.     It will be a simple assignment, Major, he said to me, peering overhis fingers. He held them up in front of him like a cathedral.     Yes, sir, I said.     It will involve finding one man, a Venusian native.     I wanted to say, Then why the hell don't you send a green kid onthe job? Why me? Instead, I nodded and watched him playing with hisfingers.     The man is a trader of sorts. Rather intelligent. He paused, thenadded, For a native, that is.     I had never liked Walsh's attitude toward natives. I hadn't liked theway he'd treated the natives on Mars ever since he'd taken over there.Which brought to mind an important point.     I always figured Venus was under the jurisdiction of Space III, sir. Ithought our activities were confined to Mars.     He folded his fingers like a deck of cards and dropped them on his deskas if he were waiting for me to cut.     Mmmm, he said, yes, that's true. But this is a special job. It sohappens this Venusian is the one man who can help us understand justwhat's happening on Mars.     I tried to picture a Venusian understanding Mars and I didn't get veryfar.     He's had many dealings with the natives there, Walsh explained. Ifanyone can tell us the reasons for the revolt, he can.     If Walsh really wanted to know the reasons for the revolt, I could givethem to him in one word: Walsh. I had to laugh at the way he calledit revolt. It had been going on for six months now and we'd lost atleast a thousand men from Space II. Revolt.     And this man is on Venus now? I asked for confirmation. I'd neverbeen to Venus, being in Space II ever since I'd left the Moon run. Itwas just like Walsh to ship me off to a strange place.     Yes, Major, he said. This man is on Venus.     At the Academy he had called me Fred. That was before I'd reportedhim for sleeping on Boiler Watch. He'd goofed off on a pile of uraniumthat could've, and almost did, blow the barracks sky-high that night.He still thought it was my fault, as if I'd done the wrong thing byreporting him. And now, through the fouled-up machinery that exists inany military organization, he outranked me.     And the man's name, sir?     Joe. A tight smile played on his face.     Joe what? I asked.     Just Joe.     Just Joe?     Yes, Walsh said. A native, you know. They rarely go in for more thanfirst names. But then, it should be simple to find a man with a namelike Joe. Among the natives, I mean.     I don't know, sir.     A relatively simple assignment, Walsh said.     Can you tell me anything else about this man? Physical appearance?Personal habits? Anything?     Walsh seemed to consider this for a moment. Well, physically he's likeany of the other Venusians, so I can't give you much help there. Hedoes have a peculiar habit, though.     What's that?     He has an affinity for Terran cigarettes.     I sighed. Well, it's not very much to go on.     You'll find him, Walsh said, grinning. I'm sure of it.   <doc-sep> The trip to Venus came off without a hitch. I did a lot of thinking onthat trip. I thought about Mars and the revolt there. And I thoughtabout Colonel Leonard Walsh and how he was supposed to be quelling thatrevolt. Ever since Walsh had taken command, ever since he'd startedpushing the natives around, there'd been trouble. It was almost as ifthe whole damned planet had blown up in our faces the moment he tookover. Swell guy, Walsh.     Venus was hotter than I'd expected it to be. Much too hot for the tunicI was wearing. It smelled, too. A funny smell I couldn't place. Likea mixture of old shoe and after-shave. There were plants everywhereI looked. Big plants and small ones, some blooming with flowers I'dnever seen before, and some as bare as cactus.     I recognized a blue figure as one of the natives the pilot had told meabout. He was tall, looking almost human except that everything abouthim was elongated. His features, his muscles, everything seemed to havebeen stretched like a rubber band. I kept expecting him to pop back tonormal. Instead, he flashed a double row of brilliant teeth at me.     I wondered if he spoke English. Hey, boy, I called.     He ambled over with long-legged strides that closed the distancebetween us in seconds.     Call me Joe, he said.     I dropped my bags and stared at him. Maybe this      was     going to be asimple assignment after all. I sure am glad to see you, Joe, I said.     Same here, Toots, he answered.     The guys back in Space II are searching high and low for you, I toldhim.     You've got the wrong number, he said, and I was a little surprised athis use of Terran idiom.     You are Joe, aren't you? Joe the trader?     I'm Joe, all right, he said. Only thing I ever traded, though, was apocketknife. Got a set of keys for it.     Oh, I said, my voice conveying my disappointment. I sighed and beganwondering just how I should go about contacting the Joe I was lookingfor. My orders said I was to report to Captain Bransten immediatelyupon arrival. I figured the hell with Captain Bransten. I outranked himanyway, and there wasn't much he could do if I decided to stop for adrink first.     Where's the Officer's Club? I asked the Venusian.     Are you buying information or are you just curious?     Can you take me there? I asked.     Sure thing, Toots. He picked up my bags and started walking up aheavily overgrown path. We'd probably walked for about ten minutes whenhe dropped my bags and said, There it is.     The Officer's Club was a plasteel hut with window shields thatprotected it from the heat of the sun. It didn't look too comfortablebut I really wanted that drink. I reached into my tunic and slippedthe native thirty solars.     He stared at the credits curiously and then shrugged his shoulders. Ohwell, you're new here. We'll let it go.     He took off then, while I stared after him, wondering just what he'dmeant. Had I tipped him too little?     I shrugged and looked over at the Officer's Club. From the outside itlooked as hot as hell.     On the inside it was about two degrees short of that mark. I began tocurse Walsh for taking me away from my nice soft job in Space II.     There wasn't much inside the club. A few tables and chairs, a dart gameand a bar. Behind the bar a tall Venusian lounged.     I walked over and asked, What are you serving, pal?     Call me Joe, he answered.     He caught me off balance. What?     Joe, he said again.     A faint glimmer of understanding began to penetrate my thick skull.You wouldn't happen to be Joe the trader? The guy who knows all aboutMars, would you?     I never left home, he said simply. What are you drinking?     That rat! That dirty, filthy, stinking, unprincipled....       But then, it should be simple to find a man with a name like     Joe.      Among the natives, I mean.       Sure. Oh sure. Real simple. Walsh was about the lowest, mostcontemptible....     What are you drinking, pal? the Venusian asked again.     Skip it, I said. How do I get to the captain's shack?     Follow your nose, pal. Can't miss it.     I started to pick up my bag as another Venusian entered. He waved atthe bartender.     Hello, Joe, he said. How's it going?     Not so hot, Joe, the bartender replied.     I listened in fascination. Joe, Joe, Joe. So this was Walsh's idea of agreat gag. Very funny. Very....     You Major Polk, sweetheart? the Venusian who'd just come in asked.     Yes, I said, still thinking of Colonel Walsh.     You better get your butt over to the captain's shack, he said. He'sabout ready to post you as overdue.     Sure, I said wearily. Will you take my bags, please?     Roger, he answered. He picked up the bags and nodded at the bar.     So long, Joe, he said to the bartender.     See you, Joe, the bartender called back.  "

        "Query": "What is the way in which the Major discovers that the indigenous people are all named Joe, and what is the reason for their fondness for cigarettes in the story titled A PLANET NAMED JOE?",
        "Summary_1": "When the Major first arrives, he meets a man named Joe. He is a native. The Major thinks that he may have found his man already, but when he asks him if he's a trader, which would match the description that the colonel gave him, the native tells him that he's never traded anything in his life. He then keeps meeting natives, all of whom are named Joe. He asks the Captain why all the Venusians are named Joe. The captain explains that it's because when the men of the Terran space program arrived they used their slang with the locals, all calling them Joe. The men would tell them that if they did a job for them, they would get a pack of cigarettes. Because the Venusians had no names of their own before this, eventually the name \"Joe\" stuck, and everyone on the planet answered to it. They also kept an affinity for cigarettes. \n",
        "Summary_2": "When the Major lands on Venus, the first native he comes across introduces himself as Joe. Thinking that he had found the man he was assigned to find, the Major is pleased, but he then realizes that the man is not the right one. As the Major goes through Venus, he begins to notice that every Venusian native addresses the other as \"Joe\", and he realizes that they all share the same name. Captain Bransten then informs the Major of the phenomenon. When Terran men were enlisted on Venus, they would often call the natives \"Joe\" as a nickname, and reward them with cigarettes. Eventually, the natives caught on and began to adapt this behavior into their own culture. ",
        "Summary_3": "Once Major Polk meets the bartender, it is the second person that he meets on the planet named Joe. He realizes from this second encounter that the Colonel had set him up by sending him on an impossible mission. \n\nHis first hint that the natives like cigarettes are when the Captain offers him a cigarette as soon as he sits down in his office. The Captain says that the Venusians steal them during their conversation. The Captain explains that it is a part of the native Venusian culture to like cigarettes. He further realizes how important cigarettes are to natives when he is told the price for a guide can be paid with cigarette cartons. When they go through each village during their time in the jungle, the natives consistently ask for cigarettes. \n",
        "Summary_4": "The Major first encounters three Venusian natives, all with the name Joe. Even the server of Captain Bransten is named Joe. Thus he asks the Captain about this popular name. Because the enlisted man would call the native Joe, they like the name. Thus they are all called Joe. The Captain also reveals that the natives like the cigarettes because the enlisted men keep on asking them if they want to earn some cigarettes. The natives seem to only like these two things about Terran culture. This makes the Major realize that the tips given to one of the Joe that led him to the bar should have been cigarettes. Moreover, the Captain also notes that the natives like to steal the cigarettes.",
        "Article": "Captain Bransten was a mousey, unimpressive sort of man. He was wearinga tropical tunic, but he still resembled a wilted lily more than he didan officer.     Have a seat, Major, he offered. He reached for a cigarette box on thedesk and extended it to me. He coughed in embarrassment when he saw itwas empty. Quickly, he pressed a button on his desk and the door poppedopen. A tall, blue Venusian stepped lithely into the room.     Sir? the Venusian asked.     We're out of cigarettes, Joe, the Captain said. Will you get ussome, please?     Sure thing, the Venusian answered. He smiled broadly and closed thedoor behind him.       Another Joe     , I thought.      Another damned Joe.       They steal them, Captain Bransten said abruptly.     Steal what? I asked.     Cigarettes. I sometimes think the cigarette is one of the few thingsthey like about Terran culture.     So Walsh had taken care of that angle too.      He does have a peculiarhabit, though. He has an affinity for Terran cigarettes.     Cigaretteswas the tip I should have given; not solars.     All right, I said, suppose we start at the beginning.     Captain Bransten opened his eyes wide. Sir? he asked.     What's with all this Joe business? It may be a very original name butI think its popularity here is a little outstanding.     Captain Bransten began to chuckle softly. I personally didn't think itwas so funny. I tossed him my withering Superior Officer's gaze andwaited for his explanation.     I hadn't realized this was your first time on Venus, he said.     Is there a local hero named Joe? I asked.     No, no, nothing like that, he assured me. It's a simple culture, youknow. Not nearly as developed as Mars.     I can see that, I said bitingly.     And the natives are only now becoming acquainted with Terran culture.Lots of enlisted men, you know.     I began to get the idea. And I began to appreciate Walsh's doubtfulancestry more keenly.     It's impossible to tell exactly where it all started, of course,Bransten was saying.     I was beginning to get angry. Very angry. I was thinking of Walshsitting back in a nice cozy foam chair back on Earth.     Get to the point, Captain! I barked.     Easy, sir, Bransten said, turning pale. I could see that the Captainwasn't used to entertaining Majors. The enlisted men. You know howthey are. They'll ask a native to do something and they'll call himJoe. 'Hey, Joe, give me a hand with this.' Or 'Listen, Joe, how'd youlike to earn some cigarettes?' Do you follow?     I follow, all right, I said bitterly.     Well, Bransten went on, that sort of thing mushrooms. The nativesare a simple, almost childish people. It appealed to them\u2014the Joebusiness, I mean. Now they're all Joe. They like it. That and thecigarettes.     He cleared his throat and looked at me apologetically as if he werepersonally responsible for Venusian culture. In fact, he looked as ifhe were responsible for having put Venus in the heavens in the firstplace.     Do you understand, Major? Just a case of extended idiom, that's all.     Just a case of extended      idiot     , I thought. An idiot on a wild goosechase a hell of a long way from home.     I understand perfectly, I snapped. Where are my quarters?     Bransten asked a Venusian named Joe to show me my quarters, remindingme that chow was at thirteen hundred. As I was leaving, the firstVenusian came back with the cigarettes Bransten had ordered.     I could tell by the look on his face that he probably had half a cartonstuffed into his pockets. I shrugged and went to change into a tropicaltunic.     I called Earth right after chow. The Captain assured me that this sortof thing was definitely against regulations, but he submitted when Itwinkled my little gold leaf under his nose.     Walsh's face appeared on the screen. He was smiling, looking like a fatpussy cat.     What is it, Major? he asked.     This man Joe, I said. Can you give me any more on him?     Walsh's grin grew wider. Why, Major, he said, you're not having anydifficulties, are you?     None at all, I snapped back. I just thought I'd be able to find hima lot sooner if....     Take your time, Major, Walsh beamed. There's no rush at all.     I thought....     I'm sure you can do the job, Walsh cut in. I wouldn't have sent youotherwise.     Hell, I was through kidding around. Look....     He's somewhere in the jungle, you know, Walsh said.     I wanted to ram my fist into the screen, right smack up against thosebig white teeth. Instead, I cut off the transmission and watched thesurprised look on his face as his screen went blank millions of milesaway.     He blinked at the screen, trying to realize I'd deliberately hung up onhim.     Polk! he shouted, can you hear me?     I smiled, saw the twisted hatred on his features, and then the screenon my end went blank, too.       He's somewhere in the jungle, you know.       I thanked Captain Bransten for his hospitality and went back to myquarters.     As I saw it, there were two courses for me to follow.     One: I could say the hell with Walsh and Venus. That would mean hoppingthe next ship back to Earth.     It would also mean disobeying the direct order of a superior officer.It might mean demotion, and it might mean getting bounced out of theService altogether.     Two: I could assume there really was a guy name Joe somewhere in thatjungle, a Joe separate and apart from the other Joes on this planet, atrader Joe who knew the Martians well. I could always admit failure, ofcourse, and return empty handed. Mission not accomplished. Or, I mightreally find a guy who was trader Joe.     I made my decision quickly. I wanted to stay in the Service, andbesides Walsh may have been on the level for the first time in hislife. Maybe there was a Joe here who could help us on Mars. If therewas I'd try to find him. It was still a hell of a trick though.     I cursed Walsh again and pushed the buzzer near my bed.     A tall Venusian stepped into the room.     Joe? I asked, just to be sure.     Who else, boss? he answered.     I'm trying to locate someone, I said. I'll need a guide to take meinto the jungle. Can you get me one?     It'll cost you, boss, the Venusian said.     How much?     Two cartons of cigarettes at least.     Who's the guide? I asked.     How's the price sound?     Fine, fine, I said impatiently. And the Captain had said they werealmost a childish people!

There were no natives rushing outto greet us. No cries of Cigarettes? Cigarettes? I caught up with Joe.     What's the story? I whispered.     He shrugged knowingly and continued walking.     And then I saw the ship, nose pointing into space, catching the rays ofthe sun like a great silver bullet.     What...? I started.     It's all right, Joe said, smiling.     The ship looked vaguely familiar. I noticed the crest of Space II nearthe nose, and a lot of things became clear then. I also saw Walshstanding near one of the huts, a stun gun in his hand.     Hello, Major, he called, almost cheerfully. The gun didn't lookcheerful, though. It was pointed at my head.     Fancy meeting you here, Colonel, I said, trying to match hisjoviality. Somehow it didn't quite come off.     Joe was walking beside me, waving at the colonel, beaming all over withhappiness.     I see you found your man, Walsh said.     I turned rapidly. Joe nodded and kept grinning, a grin that told me hewas getting a big kick out of all this. Like a kid playing a game.     I faced Walsh again. Okay, what's it all about, pal?     Colonel, Walsh corrected me. You mustn't forget to say Colonel,      Major     . He emphasized my rank, and he said it with a sort of ruthlessfinality.     I waited. I could see he was just busting to tell me how clever he'dbeen. Besides, there wasn't much I could do but wait. Not with Walshpointing the stun gun at my middle.     We've come a long way since the Academy, haven't we, Major?     If you mean in miles, I said, looking around at the plants, we surehave.     Walsh grinned a little. Always the wit, he said drily. And then thesmile faded from his lips and his eyes took on a hard lustre. I'mgoing to kill you, you know. He said it as if he were saying, I thinkit'll rain tomorrow.     Joe almost clapped his hands together with glee. He was really enjoyingthis. Another of those funny Terran games.     You gave me a powerful handicap to overcome, Walsh said. I suppose Ishould thank you, really.     You're welcome, I said.     It wasn't easy living down the disgrace you caused me.     It was your own damn fault, I said. You knew what you were doingwhen you decided to cork off.     Beside me, Joe chuckled a little, enjoying the game immensely.     You didn't have to report me, Walsh said.     No? Maybe I should have forgotten all about it? Maybe I should havenudged you and served you orange juice? So you could do it againsometime and maybe blow up the whole damn Academy!     Walsh was silent for a long time. When he spoke his voice was barelyaudible. The heat was oppressive, as if it were concentrated on thislittle spot in the jungle, focusing all its penetration on a small,unimportant drama.     I could hear Joe breathing beside me.     I'm on my way out, Walsh rasped. Finished, do you understand?     Good, I said. And I meant it.     This Mars thing. A terrible fix. Terrible.     Beside me, a slight frown crossed Joe's face. Apparently he couldn'tunderstand the seriousness of our voices. What had happened to thegame, the fun?     You brought the Mars business on yourself, I told Walsh. There wasnever any trouble before you took command.     The natives, he practically shouted. They ... they....     Joe caught his breath sharply, and I wondered what Walsh was going tosay about the natives. Apparently he'd realized that Joe was a native.Or maybe Joe's knife had something to do with it.     What about the natives? I asked.     Nothing, Walsh said. Nothing. He was silent for a while.     A man of my calibre, he said then, his face grim. Dealing withsavages. He caught himself again and threw a hasty glance at Joe.The perplexed frown had grown heavier on Joe's face. He looked at thecolonel in puzzlement.  "

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in COSMIC YO-YO?",
        "Summary_1": "Bob Parker, the President of Interplanetary Hauling & Moving Co., sells asteroids to wealthy people on earth. Clients ask for asteroids with size parameters and specifications, and Bob finds them in space and hauls them to earth. His company is almost bankrupt because a rival company, Saylor & Saylor, stole his idea and now offers the same services. Bob receives mail from Mr. Andrew S. Burnside with a request for an asteroid that he would like to use in an upcoming wedding.\n\nBob and his partner Queazy set out to find the perfect asteroid for Mr. Burnside, although they know it\u2019s a longshot. Fairly quickly, they find one that looks perfect. The men land on the asteroid, and Bob deploys his atomic-whirl spectroscope to test it. Suddenly, a beautiful woman interrupts him and demands that they leave the asteroid. She pulls out her spasticizer gun before telling them that they can have it in a month after she\u2019s gone. Bob explains that they are desperate, but the girl retorts that her fate is worse than death if she leaves.\n\nSuddenly, the Saylor brothers\u2019 ship appears, and Bob tells the girl that they have to fight this enemy together. Wally and Billy Saylor, along with three other men, jump out of the ship. Bob tells them that Mr. Burnside has ordered this asteroid, and the Saylor brothers say that they received the same order. Bob quickly grabs the girl\u2019s spasticizer while Queazy throws his body at Billy. However, Wally manages to shoot the gun out of Bob\u2019s hand and attack him. Bob is knocked unconscious in the scuffle. \n\nWhen Bob wakes up, he is completely alone, floating in space. He panics because he has very little oxygen left. Finally, he hears Queazy\u2019s voice explaining that the girl used her ship\u2019s technology to find them both. The mystery girl introduces herself as Starre Lowenthal, the granddaughter of Mr. Burnside. She concedes that this entire mission was fake. She told her grandfather that she would only marry her fiance Mac if he could get this particular asteroid, and then she made plans to conquer and protect the asteroid so it could not be supplied for the wedding. \n\nBob is confident that they can reach the Saylor brothers before they bring the asteroid back to earth, but his plan does nothing to protect Starre from marrying a man she doesn\u2019t love. She agrees to help Bob and Queazy. Within five days, Bob realizes he is in love with Starre. \n\nStarre compares her small ship to a yo-yo, and Bob gets an idea - they will use Starre\u2019s ship like a yo-yo to retrieve the asteroid from the Saylor brothers. Once the team catches up to the Saylor brothers, Bob flings Starre\u2019s ship at the asteroid several times, and Wally calls them to tell them that they might die as a result of the damage their ship has sustained. Bob makes it clear that they have no intention of stopping, and the Saylor brothers release the asteroid. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Bob Parker and his business partner Quentin \"Queazy\" Zuyler fly through an asteroid belt searching for one with exact specifications in terms of size and mineral composition requested by a wealthy client, Andrew S. Burnside. Bob and Queazy operate the Interplanetary Hauling Company, which provides the innovative service of delivering an asteroid to the client's home. Bob had invented this service, but his business is suffering thanks to strong-arming by their main competitor, the Saylor Brothers. They need to find Mr. Burnside's asteroid because the payout of $550,000 will save their business. When Bob and Queazy discover an appropriate asteroid, they land and survey the surface to check its dimensions and mineral composition. However, they are interrupted by a beautiful young woman who confirms the composition of the asteroid but demands they leave at once or else she will alert the Interplanetary Commission that they have broken the law. When Bob sees her dumbbell-shaped spaceship, he realizes she comes from wealth and becomes obstinate; he shares with her the importance of this asteroid to his business. While the woman acknowledges his situation, she says if she leaves the asteroid, she will face \"a fate worse than death!\" As they finish their conversation, the Saylor Brothers' ship arrives, and Bob informs the woman that they must stick together to stand against them. Bob argues with Wally and Billy Saylor and eventually he and Queazy attack the two brothers. In the ensuing fight, the Saylors use the woman's paralyzing spasticizer to disable the three rivals and leave them scattered and stranded to die in space. When Bob awakens, he realizes he is running out of air, but soon Queazy retrieves him in their ship with the woman's dumbbell ship in tow; the woman had saved Queazy and together they tracked down Bob. The woman reveals her name is Starre Lowenthal, and she is Andrew S. Burnside's granddaughter. She explains she had concocted a scheme to avoid having to marry her fiance, Mac, who was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of her grandfather's: She said she would marry Mac if they could hold a wedding atop an asteroid with very unique specifications. Her grandfather then commissioned Bob's company as well as the Saylor's to ensure such an asteroid would be discovered. And Starre came to the asteroid to ensure that if someone did find it, they wouldn't be able to take it back with them. Although Bob is in love with Starre, he still needs the money for his business, so he decides to pursue the Saylor Brothers and retrieve the asteroid after all; he assures Starre that they will deal with her marriage issue later. Making use of his ship's ability to accelerate and decelerate extremely fast, Bob attaches Starre's ship to theirs and uses it as a kind of yo-yo to threaten and disable the Saylor Brothers' ship. They relinquish the asteroid, and Bob, Queazy, and Starre win the day.",
        "Summary_3": "Bob Parker and Quentin Zuyler (Queazy) are co-pilots of a ship that has been on a mission for three weeks to locate a valuable asteroid. One of the richest men in the world, Andrew S. Burnside, of Philadelphia, has requested that Bob specifically source an asteroid for his backyard of an exact dimension and composition for a wedding on June 2nd. Having weddings on asteroids in backyards had become a fad among the richest people on Earth.\nWhen they land on the asteroid, they put on spacesuits and begin exploring and testing its composition. They\u2019re startled by a woman who is squatting on the asteroid and claiming she is protected by law to remain there. She is certain about not wanting the asteroid to move from its position, and even pulls a weapon (a spasticizer) on Bob to try to prove her point when he tries to plead with her that his livelihood depends on them taking the asteroid back to Earth. Just as Bob and Queazy were turning to leave the asteroid, the Saylor brothers landed on it.\nThe Saylor brothers were a rival operation to Bob and Queazy, and Bob says they are known for being rough to get their way. They landed on the asteroid with three other men, claimed they also had a direct order from Mr. Burnside for the asteroid, and began an attack on Bob and Queazy. Bob made a diversion with the woman\u2019s paralyzing weapon, Queazy threw Billy Saylor off the asteroid into space, and Wally Saylor shot the weapon out of Bob\u2019s hand. \nBob was unconscious after the fight and woke up spinning in outer space running out of oxygen. With his last breath he called for Queazy on the intercom and was swiftly rescued by both he and the woman and revived to life. The woman revealed herself to be Andrew S. Burnside's granddaughter,  Starre Lowenthal. She was squatting on the asteroid to try to stop its delivery to Earth. She told her grandfather that she would only marry the man he set her up with, Mac, if it was atop this exact asteroid - thinking that there was no way it was possible for it to be found, and if by small chance it was she would scare those people away.\n \nBob tells Starre they can still intercept the Saylor brothers\u2019 ship since they have to take a long slow orbit back to Earth while his ship can go direct because it\u2019s not towing an asteroid. Along the five day journey to Earth, Bob and Starre fall in love with each other, but Starre seems determined that she would have to keep her promise to marry Mac if the asteroid is delivered. They hook up Starre\u2019s dumbbell shaped spaceship that they are towing like a yo-yo and use it to bludgeon the Saylor brothers\u2019 ship, causing them to release the asteroid and jet away into outer space, leaving Bob, Queasy and Starre in possession.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Bob Parker and his partner Queazy are searching for an asteroid of exact proportions to meet a client\u2019s demand. This job is very important because their company, Interplanetary Hauling & Moving Co., is in dire straits and likely to go under without the significant payday this asteroid will bring: $550,000. The client who requested an asteroid this size wants it for a wedding in his backyard by 11:30 am on June 2; otherwise, the order is void. Parker started the \u201casteroid in your backyard\u201d promotion, but since then, other companies have been offering the same service. Most notably, competition from Saylor & Saylor is hurting his business. Parker and Queazy locate the perfect asteroid that meets the exact specifications of the request, only to find that someone else, a beautiful young woman, already has laid claim to it. She orders them to leave and threatens to report them to the Interplanetary Commission or to shoot them with her spasticizer. Parker explains why the asteroid is so important to them, and the girl explains that if they take it, she will meet a fate worse than death. Then suddenly, the Saylors\u2019 ship comes into view and lands. Billy and Wally Saylor alight along with three other men, threatening Parker. So Parker tells them that he has an ethergram from Mr. Burnsides ordering this specific asteroid, but Wally announces that they also have the order. Bob grabs the girl\u2019s spasticizer while Queazy grabs Billy Saylor and hurls him into space. But Wally shoots the spasticizer out of Bob\u2019s hand, and someone hits Bob hard and knocks him out.\n\tWhen Bob regains consciousness, he is almost out of oxygen. He calls out for Queazy with his last breath, and Queazy responds and brings the ship to pick him up. The girl had rescued Queazy. She introduces herself as Starre Lowenthal, Mr. Burnside\u2019s granddaughter. Her grandfather wants her to marry Mac andwouldn\u2019tt take no for an answer, so finally Starre told him she would marry Mac if he could find an asteroid with specific dimensions and containing the minerals she specified. Bob knows the way the Saylors will have to take the asteroid into Earth\u2019s orbit and knows they can catch up to them. He tells Starre they have to do that to say the business, but they will work out her problem, too. \n\tAfter five days, Bob is in love with Starre, and she knows it. He starts to tell her, but she stops him because of Mac and the bargain she has to live up to. Bob says he thinks her ship is the solution, and she says it\u2019s just a big yo-yo. As Bob thinks about this, he devises a way to use her ship as a yo-yo to attack the Saylors\u2019 ship. They catch up to the Saylors and attack them with Starre\u2019s ship until the Saylors release the asteroid and fly away.\n",
        "Article": "It was Queazy who got into his space-suit and did the welding job,fastening two huge supra-steel eyes onto the dumbbell-shaped ship'snarrow midsection. Into these eyes cables which trailed back totwo winches in the big ship's nose were inserted, welded fast, andreinforced.     The nose of the hauler was blunt, perfectly fitted for the job. BobParker practiced and experimented for three hours with this yo-yo ofcosmic dimensions, while Starre and Queazy stood over him bursting intostrange, delighted squeals of laughter whenever the yo-yo reached theend of its double cable and started rolling back up to the ship. Queazysnapped his fingers.     It'll work! His gray eyes showed satisfaction. Now, if only theSaylor brothers are where we calculated!     They weren't where Bob and Queazy had calculated, as they haddiscovered the next day. They had expected to pick up the asteroidon their mass-detectors a few hundred thousand miles outside of theMoon's orbit. But now they saw the giant ship attached like a leech tothe still bigger asteroid\u2014inside the Moon's orbit! A mere two hundredthousand miles from Earth!     We have to work fast, Bob stammered, sweating. He got withinnaked-eye distance of the Saylor brothers' ship. Below, Earth wasspread out, a huge crescent shape, part of the Eastern hemispherevaguely visible through impeding clouds and atmosphere. The enemy shipwas two miles distant, a black shadow occulting part of the brilliantsky. It was moving along a down-spiraling path toward Earth.     Queazy's big hand gripped his shoulder. Go to it, Bob!     Bob nodded grimly. He backed the hauler up about thirty miles, thensent it forward again, directly toward the Saylor brothers' ship at tenmiles per second. And resting on the blunt nose of the ship was theyo-yo.     There was little doubt the Saylors' saw their approach. But,scornfully, they made no attempt to evade. There was no possible harmthe oncoming ship could wreak. Or at least that was what they thought,for Bob brought the hauler's speed down to zero\u2014and Starre Lowenthal'slittle ship, possessing its own inertia, kept on moving!     It spun away from the hauler's blunt nose, paying out two rigidlengths of cable behind it as it unwound, hurled itself forward like afantastic spinning cannon ball.     It's going to hit!     The excited cry came from Starre. But Bob swore. The dumbbell shipreached the end of its cables, falling a bare twenty feet short ofcompleting its mission. It didn't stop spinning, but came winding backup the cable, at the same terrific speed with which it had left.   <doc-sep> Bob sweated, having only fractions of seconds in which to maneuverfor the yo-yo could strike a fatal blow at the hauler too. It wasticklish work completely to nullify the yo-yo's speed. Bob usedexactly the same method of catching the yo-yo on the blunt nose ofthe ship as a baseball player uses to catch a hard-driven ball inhis glove\u2014namely, by matching the ball's speed and direction almostexactly at the moment of impact. And now Bob's hours of practice paiddividends, for the yo-yo came to rest snugly, ready to be releasedagain.     All this had happened in such a short space of time that the Saylorbrothers must have had only a bare realization of what was going on.But by the time the yo-yo was flung at them again, this time withbetter calculations, they managed to put the firmly held asteroidbetween them and the deadly missile. But it was clumsy evasion, forthe asteroid was several times as massive as the ship which was towingit, and its inertia was great. And as soon as the little ship camespinning back to rest, Bob flung the hauler to a new vantage point andagain the yo-yo snapped out.     And this time\u2014collision! Bob yelled as he saw the stern section of theSaylor brothers' ship crumple like tissue paper crushed between thehand. The dumbbell-shaped ship, smaller, and therefore stauncher due tothe principle of the arch, wound up again, wobbling a little. It hadreceived a mere dent in its starboard half.     Starre was chortling with glee. Queazy whispered, Attaboy, Bob! Thistime we'll knock 'em out of the sky!     The yo-yo came to rest and at the same moment a gong rang excitedly.Bob knew what that meant. The Saylor brothers were trying to establishcommunication.     Queazy was across the room in two running strides. He threw in thetelaudio and almost immediately, Wally Saylor's big body built up inthe plate. Wally Saylor's face was quivering with wrath.     What do you damned fools think you're trying to do? he roared.You've crushed in our stern section. You've sliced away half of ourstern jets. Air is rushing out! You'll kill us!     Now, Bob drawled, you're getting the idea.     I'll inform the Interplanetary Commission! screamed Saylor.           If     you're alive, Bob snarled wrathfully. And you won't be unlessyou release the asteroid.     I'll see you in Hades first!     Hades, remarked Bob coldly, here you come!     He snapped the hauler into its mile-a-second speed again, stopped it atzero. And the yo-yo went on its lone, destructive sortie.     For a fraction of a second Wally Saylor exhibited the countenance of adoomed man. In the telaudio plate, he whirled, and diminished in sizewith a strangled yell.     The yo-yo struck again, but Bob Parker maneuvered its speed insuch a manner that it struck in the same place as before, but not asheavily, then rebounded and came spinning back with perfect, sparklingprecision. And even before it snugged itself into its berth, it wasapparent that the Saylor brothers had given up. Like a wounded terrier,their ship shook itself free of the asteroid, hung in black space fora second, then vanished with a flaming puff of released gravitons fromits still-intact jets.     The battle was won!   <doc-sep> Bob Parker was in love with Starre Lowenthal. He knew that after fivedays out, as the ship hurled itself at breakneck speed toward Earth;probably that distracting emotion was the real reason he couldn'tattach any significance to Starre's dumbbell-shaped ship, which trailedastern, attached by a long cable.     Starre apparently knew he was in love with her, too, for on the fifthday Bob was teaching her the mechanics of operating the hauler, and shegently lifted his hand from a finger-switch.     Even      I     know that isn't the control to the Holloway vacuum-feeder,Bob. That switch is for the\u2014ah\u2014the anathern tube, you told me. Right?     Right, he said unsteadily. Anyway, Starre, as I was saying, thisship operates according to the reverse Fitzgerald Contraction Formula.All moving bodies contract in the line of motion. What Hollowayand Hammond did was to reverse that universal law. They caused thecontraction first\u2014motion had to follow! The gravitonic field affectsevery atom in the ship with the same speed at the same time. We couldgo from zero speed to our top speed of two thousand miles a second justlike that!     He snapped his fingers. No acceleration effects. This type of ship,necessary in our business, can stop flat, back up, ease up, move inany direction, and the passengers wouldn't have any feeling of motionat\u2014Oh, hell! Bob groaned, the serious glory of her eyes making himshake. He took her hand. Starre, he said desperately, I've got totell you something\u2014     She jerked her hand away. No, she exclaimed in an almost frightenedvoice. You can't tell me. There's\u2014there's Mac, she finished,faltering. The asteroid\u2014     You      have     to marry him?     Her eyes filled with tears. I have to live up to the bargain.     And ruin your whole life, he ground out. Suddenly, he turned back tothe control board, quartered the vision plate. He pointed savagely tothe lower left quarter, which gave a rearward view of the dumbbell shiptrailing astern.     There's your ship, Starre. He jabbed his finger at it. I've got afeeling\u2014and I can't put the thought into concrete words\u2014that somehowthe whole solution of the problem of grabbing the asteroid back liesthere. But how?      How?          Starre's blue eyes followed the long cable back to where it wasattached around her ship's narrow midsection.     She shook her head helplessly. It just looks like a big yo-yo to me.     A yo-yo?     Yes, a yo-yo. That's all. She was belligerent.     A      yo-yo     ! Bob Parker yelled the word and almost hit the ceiling, hegot out of the chair so fast. Can you imagine it! A yo-yo!     He disappeared from the room. Queazy! he shouted.       Queazy, I've gotit!       "

        "Query": "\"In the story COSMIC YO-YO, what is the involvement of the Saylor brothers?\"",
        "Summary_1": "The Saylor brothers, Wally and Billy, are Bob Parker\u2019s enemies. Bob was the first person with the unique idea to sell asteroids to wealthy people on earth, and his business would have been very successful if the Saylor brothers did not poach his idea and begin stealing his clients. Bob worries about the Saylor brothers from the beginning of the story, and he acknowledges that they do not always play by the rules. If Wally and Billy can make a buck by inconveniencing or cheating someone else, they will do it. The brothers are not only intimidating in terms of their business prowess; they are also described as giant when compared to Bob. \n\nQueasy and Bob have a legitimate order from Mr. Burnside for the asteroid, and they have no idea that the Saylor brothers have received the same order. Yet, they still worry that somehow, someway, their enemies will hear about the potential to make half a million dollars and try to steal their opportunity out from under them. Within moments of setting eyes on their spaceship, Bob tells Starre that they have to fight the Saylor brothers together. He doesn\u2019t know her at all, and she actually just pulled a gun on him, but he so deeply mistrusts Wally and Billy that it\u2019s worth it to take a chance on Starre.\n\nOf course, Bob turns out to be right. The second the Saylor brothers get a chance to potentially kill Bob, Queazy, and Starre, they take it. Bob floats in space, unconscious, for several weeks before Starre eventually finds Queazy and Bob, and they give him oxygen and food. Bob is truly close to death before his friends save him in the knick of time, and the Saylor brothers would be perfectly fine with that outcome. \n\nWally and Billy give Bob all the motivation in the world to try and steal the asteroid back, and Bob is determined to catch up with his rivals and make it work somehow. When he comes up with his yo-yo idea using Starre\u2019s ship, he shows zero empathy for the Saylor brothers. During his attempts to retrieve the rock, he seriously damages the brothers\u2019 ship, and they have the gall to call him and attempt to make him feel guilty about their desperate state. Bob, however, cannot be swayed. He knows that he found the asteroid first and that the brothers purposefully cast him out into space to die. His determination saves the day when the Saylor brothers are forced to dispatch Mr. Burnside\u2019s asteroid. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Wally and Billy Saylor are boorish twin brothers who operate a company, Saylor & Saylor, that competes with The Interplanetary Hauling & Moving Company operated by Bob and Queazy. The Saylors have cashed in on Bob's \"asteroid in your back yard\" idea like many other companies on Earth, only they have been more successful. Thanks to their lack of business scruples, the Saylors have nearly put Bob and Queazy out of business. Because of this, Bob worries about them taking the asteroid that will net his company $550,000 if they catch wind of his arrangement. Unfortunately, the Saylors have also been hired by the same wealthy client that hired Bob and Queazy because the asteroid request was so unusual and specific, the client wanted to make sure it could be found in time for his granddaughter's wedding. Soon after Bob and Queazy meet the granddaughter, who is making temporary camp on the asteroid to avoid getting married, the Saylors arrive and paralyze the three of them in order to take the asteroid back to Earth and cash in for themselves. After they awaken and reunite, Bob, Queazy, and the granddaughter Starre, race after the Saylors and use Starre's ship as a yo-yo projectile. They damage the Saylors' ship and threaten to kill them so that they will release the asteroid. The Saylors threaten to call the Interplanetary Commission, but Bob is persistent, and he slams their ship again, causing them to give up the asteroid.",
        "Summary_3": "The Saylor brothers are the antagonists of the story. They have an interplanetary moving company in competition with Bob and Queazy, and are known to be violent in getting their way. \nBecause Mr. Burnside was so desperate to have his granddaughter\u2019s wedding go on, he put the order out to both companies for this exact asteroid, causing the Saylor brothers to come into conflict with Bob and Queazy (who were also trying to deliver it to Earth), and Starre (who was desperate for it to not be delivered to Earth since she didn\u2019t want to get married). The Saylor brothers and three other men violently force all of them off the asteroid and into outer space to die and hurry off to Earth with the asteroid, which is the climax of the story.\nUltimately, Bob, Queasy, and Starre get justice by retrieving the asteroid after they intercept the Saylor brothers and attack their ship using a yo-yo method with Starre\u2019s spaceship they are towing, forcing the Saylor brothers to retreat into outer space.\n",

But it was clumsy evasion, forthe asteroid was several times as massive as the ship which was towingit, and its inertia was great. And as soon as the little ship camespinning back to rest, Bob flung the hauler to a new vantage point andagain the yo-yo snapped out.     And this time\u2014collision! Bob yelled as he saw the stern section of theSaylor brothers' ship crumple like tissue paper crushed between thehand. The dumbbell-shaped ship, smaller, and therefore stauncher due tothe principle of the arch, wound up again, wobbling a little. It hadreceived a mere dent in its starboard half.     Starre was chortling with glee. Queazy whispered, Attaboy, Bob! Thistime we'll knock 'em out of the sky!     The yo-yo came to rest and at the same moment a gong rang excitedly.Bob knew what that meant. The Saylor brothers were trying to establishcommunication.     Queazy was across the room in two running strides. He threw in thetelaudio and almost immediately, Wally Saylor's big body built up inthe plate. Wally Saylor's face was quivering with wrath.     What do you damned fools think you're trying to do? he roared.You've crushed in our stern section. You've sliced away half of ourstern jets. Air is rushing out! You'll kill us!     Now, Bob drawled, you're getting the idea.     I'll inform the Interplanetary Commission! screamed Saylor.           If     you're alive, Bob snarled wrathfully. And you won't be unlessyou release the asteroid.     I'll see you in Hades first!     Hades, remarked Bob coldly, here you come!     He snapped the hauler into its mile-a-second speed again, stopped it atzero. And the yo-yo went on its lone, destructive sortie.     For a fraction of a second Wally Saylor exhibited the countenance of adoomed man. In the telaudio plate, he whirled, and diminished in sizewith a strangled yell.     The yo-yo struck again, but Bob Parker maneuvered its speed insuch a manner that it struck in the same place as before, but not asheavily, then rebounded and came spinning back with perfect, sparklingprecision. And even before it snugged itself into its berth, it wasapparent that the Saylor brothers had given up. Like a wounded terrier,their ship shook itself free of the asteroid, hung in black space fora second, then vanished with a flaming puff of released gravitons fromits still-intact jets.     The battle was won!   <doc-sep> Bob came slowly to his feet, and matched Queazy's slowly growing anger.     Say that again? he snapped. This is some kind of dirty trick you andyour grandfather cooked up?     No! she exclaimed. No. My grandfather didn't even know there was anasteroid like this. But I did, long before he ordered it from you\u2014orfrom the Saylor brothers. You see\u2014well, my granddad's about thestubbornest old hoot-owl in this universe! He's always had his way, andwhen people stand in his way, that's just a challenge to him. He's beenbadgering me for years to marry Mac, and so has Mac\u2014     Who's Mac? Queazy demanded.     My fianc\u00e9, I guess, she said helplessly. He's one of my granddad'sprot\u00e9g\u00e9s. Granddad's always financing some likely young man and givinghim a start in life. Mac has become pretty famous for his Mercurianwater-colors\u2014he's an artist. Well, I couldn't hold out any longer.If you knew my grandfather, you'd know how absolutely      impossible     itis to go against him when he's got his mind set! I was just a mass ofnerves. So I decided to trick him and I came out to the asteroid beltand picked out an asteroid that was shaped so a wedding could takeplace on it. I took the measurements and the composition, then I toldmy grandfather I'd marry Mac if the wedding was in the back yard on topof an asteroid with those measurements and made of iron ore, tungsten,and so forth. He agreed so fast he scared me, and just to make surethat if somebody      did     find the asteroid in time they wouldn't be ableto get it back to Earth, I came out here and decided to live here.Asteroids up to a certain size belong to whoever happens to be on them,by common law.... So I had everything figured out\u2014except, she addedbitterly, the Saylor brothers! I guess Granddad wanted to make surethe asteroid was delivered, so he gave the order to several companies.     Bob swore under his breath. He went reeling across to a port, and wasgratified to see his and Queazy's big interplanetary hauler floatingonly a few hundred feet away. He swung around, looked at Queazy.     How long were we floating around out there?     Three weeks, according to the chronometer. The Saylor boys gave us astiff shot.           Ouch!      Bob groaned. Then he looked at Starre Lowenthal withdetermination. Miss, pardon me if I say that this deal you and yourgranddad cooked up is plain screwy! With us on the butt end. But I'mgoing to put this to you plainly. We can catch up with the Saylorbrothers even if they are three weeks ahead of us. The Saylor ship andours both travel on the HH drive\u2014inertia-less. But the asteroid hasplenty of inertia, and so they'll have to haul it down to Earth by along, spiraling orbit. We can go direct and probably catch up with thema few hundred thousand miles this side of Earth. And we can have afling at getting the asteroid back!     Her eyes sparkled. You mean\u2014 she cried. Then her attractive facefell. Oh, she said.       Oh!     And when you get it back, you'll land it.     That's right, Bob said grimly. We're in business. For us, it's amatter of survival. If the by-product of delivering the asteroid isyour marriage\u2014sorry! But until we do get the asteroid back, we threecan work as a team if you're willing. We'll fight the other problem outlater. Okay?     She smiled tremulously. Okay, I guess.     Queazy looked from one to another of them. He waved his hand scornfullyat Bob. You're plain nuts, he complained. How do you propose to goabout convincing the Saylor brothers they ought to let us have theasteroid back? Remember, commercial ships aren't allowed to carrylong-range weapons. And we couldn't ram the Saylor brothers' ship\u2014notwithout damaging our own ship just as much. Go ahead and answer that.     Bob looked at Queazy dismally. The old balance-wheel, he groaned atStarre. He's always pulling me up short when I go off half-cocked. AllI know is, that maybe we'll get a good idea as we go along. In themeantime, Starre\u2014ahem\u2014none of us has eaten in three weeks...?     Starre got the idea. She smiled dazzlingly and vanished toward thegalley.  "

        "Query": "What is the nature of the relationship between Bob and Starre in the story of Cosmic Yo-Yo?",
        "Summary_1": "Bob Parker is taken with Starre Lowenthal from the moment she appears in front of him. Starre wears a spacesuit when Bob and Queazy land on her asteroid and begin conducting tests to see if it\u2019s a good fit for Mr. Burnside, and although Bob can\u2019t get a look at her entire appearance, he is immediately attracted to her blue eyes, beautiful brown hair, and full lips. The fact that Starre is curt and demanding does not change his innate attraction to her. Bob does not get offended by Starre\u2019s refusal to hold a real conversation with him; he just keeps trying. Even Starre\u2019s decision to pull out her spasticizer and aim it at the men doesn\u2019t truly deter Bob. He continues to try and convince her that his economic well-being depends on the asteroid. The only time he becomes annoyed with the beautiful girl is when he sets eyes on her perfect ship and assumes that she is already plenty wealthy. Still, he chooses not to attack nor namecall, he simply uses reason to convince her that the asteroid is more useful to him.\n\nMoments later, when the Saylor brothers show up at Starre\u2019s asteroid, Starre already has a good feeling about Bob and Queazy. That\u2019s why, when Wally and Billy attack the trio, it is Starre that uses her dumbbell-shaped ship to locate the men and save their lives. Bob and Queazy end up owing everything to the beautiful brunette. Without her, their corpses would be floating through space. \n\nThe first time that Bob sees Starre after she saves his life, he notices the paper flower in her hair and the pretty blue outfit she\u2019s wearing. He can\u2019t take his eyes off of her, and his feelings towards her do not change when she admits that she essentially set them up. She is Mr. Burnside\u2019s granddaughter, and she never intended to let anyone find the perfect asteroid and haul it back to earth. She set up a deal with her grandfather that she knew he couldn\u2019t follow through with. Starre does not want to marry Mac, the man that she\u2019s engaged to, and that\u2019s why she was living on the perfect asteroid that Mr. Burnside ordered from Bob and the Saylor brothers. \n\nAlthough Bob has every right to be angry with Starre, he completely falls in love with her on their mission to recollect the asteroid that the Saylor brothers stole from them. He tries to convince her not to marry Mac, but she acknowledges that she must hold up her end of the bargain with her grandfather. Unfortunately, Bob can\u2019t have it both ways. If he wants to save his company from going under, he needs the asteroid, and if he fulfills Mr. Burnside\u2019s order, Starre must marry Mac. \n",
        "Summary_2": "When Bob first meets Starre on the asteroid, he is struck by her physical beauty, but the two of them do not get along. Starre reveals that the asteroid's mineral composition is exactly what Bob had been looking for to fulfill his client's request. However, Starre orders Bob to leave and says he can come back in a month. Although Bob doesn't know this yet, Starre wants to stay there for a month in order to avoid having to get married to her grandfather's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Mac and send away anyone who might come and try to take the asteroid back to her grandfather. Starre and Bob mostly have a strained relationship until they are both attacked by the Saylor Brothers and left for dead; Starre proves she is more than the spoiled, rich girl Bob thinks she is when she uses her own ship to save Queazy and then Bob. As they track the Saylor Brothers, Bob slowly falls in love with Starre, who seems to have an interest in Bob, too; however, she feels compelled by her obligation to her grandfather to marry Mac. Although Bob is unhappy that she cannot reciprocate his feelings, he still devises a plan to take down the Saylors and promises Starre they will come up with a plan to help her avoid the marriage. Starre seems pleased by this and encourages Bob as he implements his plan of attack against the Saylor Brothers.",
        "Summary_3": "Starre Lowenthal is Andrew S. Burnside's granddaughter. She is the cause of her and Bob meeting, since she was the one who ordered this exact asteroid to be delivered to Earth before her wedding - not thinking it would ever actually happen.\nShe rescues both Bob and Queazy after the Saylor brothers attempt to kill all of them by paralyzing them and tossing them into outer space. Starre is crestfallen that she now has to marry Mac, who her grandfather has been pestering her for years to wed. She thought she had the perfect plan to get out of it, but it had all fallen apart when the Saylor brothers were also given the order for the asteroid by her eager grandfather wanting to see the marriage go through. \nDuring the five day journey back to Earth together to intercept the Saylor brothers, Starre and Bob fall in love with each other. Starre provides the idea to make a yo-yo out of her spaceship, and they work happily together with Queazy to get the work done. Bob and Starre are equally elated when the Saylor brothers release the asteroid, though it is unclear what the future for them together holds.\n",
        "Summary_4": "When Bob first sees Starre, he is struck by her beauty, but despite her plight, he is determined to take the asteroid to Earth and collect her grandfather\u2019s fee that he needs so badly. Initially, Starre is antagonistic to Bob and Queazy because she is staying on the asteroid to claim it and prevent anyone from taking it. If her grandfather gets hold of it, she will have to marry Mac, a fate she considers worse than death. After the Saylors\u2019 attack on all three of them, Starre and Queazy rescue Bob just as his oxygen is running out. They save his life, and it isn\u2019t long before Bob is in love with her. Starre realizes this, and just before Bob can profess his feelings, she stops him because she will have to keep her word and marry Mac if the asteroid is delivered on time. When Bob devises a way to use Starre\u2019s ship like a yo-yo to attack the Saylors\u2019 ship, he also tells Starre that they will work on a solution to her problem, too. It seems that Bob will try to collect Burnsides\u2019 payment for delivery of the asteroid but somehow prevent Starre from having to marry Mac. \n\n",
        "Article": "It was Queazy who got into his space-suit and did the welding job,fastening two huge supra-steel eyes onto the dumbbell-shaped ship'snarrow midsection. Into these eyes cables which trailed back totwo winches in the big ship's nose were inserted, welded fast, andreinforced.     The nose of the hauler was blunt, perfectly fitted for the job. BobParker practiced and experimented for three hours with this yo-yo ofcosmic dimensions, while Starre and Queazy stood over him bursting intostrange, delighted squeals of laughter whenever the yo-yo reached theend of its double cable and started rolling back up to the ship. Queazysnapped his fingers.     It'll work! His gray eyes showed satisfaction. Now, if only theSaylor brothers are where we calculated!     They weren't where Bob and Queazy had calculated, as they haddiscovered the next day. They had expected to pick up the asteroidon their mass-detectors a few hundred thousand miles outside of theMoon's orbit. But now they saw the giant ship attached like a leech tothe still bigger asteroid\u2014inside the Moon's orbit! A mere two hundredthousand miles from Earth!     We have to work fast, Bob stammered, sweating. He got withinnaked-eye distance of the Saylor brothers' ship. Below, Earth wasspread out, a huge crescent shape, part of the Eastern hemispherevaguely visible through impeding clouds and atmosphere. The enemy shipwas two miles distant, a black shadow occulting part of the brilliantsky. It was moving along a down-spiraling path toward Earth.     Queazy's big hand gripped his shoulder. Go to it, Bob!     Bob nodded grimly. He backed the hauler up about thirty miles, thensent it forward again, directly toward the Saylor brothers' ship at tenmiles per second. And resting on the blunt nose of the ship was theyo-yo.     There was little doubt the Saylors' saw their approach. But,scornfully, they made no attempt to evade. There was no possible harmthe oncoming ship could wreak. Or at least that was what they thought,for Bob brought the hauler's speed down to zero\u2014and Starre Lowenthal'slittle ship, possessing its own inertia, kept on moving!     It spun away from the hauler's blunt nose, paying out two rigidlengths of cable behind it as it unwound, hurled itself forward like afantastic spinning cannon ball.     It's going to hit!     The excited cry came from Starre. But Bob swore. The dumbbell shipreached the end of its cables, falling a bare twenty feet short ofcompleting its mission. It didn't stop spinning, but came winding backup the cable, at the same terrific speed with which it had left.   <doc-sep> Bob Parker was in love with Starre Lowenthal. He knew that after fivedays out, as the ship hurled itself at breakneck speed toward Earth;probably that distracting emotion was the real reason he couldn'tattach any significance to Starre's dumbbell-shaped ship, which trailedastern, attached by a long cable.     Starre apparently knew he was in love with her, too, for on the fifthday Bob was teaching her the mechanics of operating the hauler, and shegently lifted his hand from a finger-switch.     Even      I     know that isn't the control to the Holloway vacuum-feeder,Bob. That switch is for the\u2014ah\u2014the anathern tube, you told me. Right?     Right, he said unsteadily. Anyway, Starre, as I was saying, thisship operates according to the reverse Fitzgerald Contraction Formula.All moving bodies contract in the line of motion. What Hollowayand Hammond did was to reverse that universal law. They caused thecontraction first\u2014motion had to follow! The gravitonic field affectsevery atom in the ship with the same speed at the same time. We couldgo from zero speed to our top speed of two thousand miles a second justlike that!     He snapped his fingers. No acceleration effects. This type of ship,necessary in our business, can stop flat, back up, ease up, move inany direction, and the passengers wouldn't have any feeling of motionat\u2014Oh, hell! Bob groaned, the serious glory of her eyes making himshake. He took her hand. Starre, he said desperately, I've got totell you something\u2014     She jerked her hand away. No, she exclaimed in an almost frightenedvoice. You can't tell me. There's\u2014there's Mac, she finished,faltering. The asteroid\u2014     You      have     to marry him?     Her eyes filled with tears. I have to live up to the bargain.     And ruin your whole life, he ground out. Suddenly, he turned back tothe control board, quartered the vision plate. He pointed savagely tothe lower left quarter, which gave a rearward view of the dumbbell shiptrailing astern.     There's your ship, Starre. He jabbed his finger at it. I've got afeeling\u2014and I can't put the thought into concrete words\u2014that somehowthe whole solution of the problem of grabbing the asteroid back liesthere. But how?      How?          Starre's blue eyes followed the long cable back to where it wasattached around her ship's narrow midsection.     She shook her head helplessly. It just looks like a big yo-yo to me.     A yo-yo?     Yes, a yo-yo. That's all. She was belligerent.     A      yo-yo     ! Bob Parker yelled the word and almost hit the ceiling, hegot out of the chair so fast. Can you imagine it! A yo-yo!     He disappeared from the room. Queazy! he shouted.       Queazy, I've gotit!        <doc-sep> Bob sweated, having only fractions of seconds in which to maneuverfor the yo-yo could strike a fatal blow at the hauler too. It wasticklish work completely to nullify the yo-yo's speed. Bob usedexactly the same method of catching the yo-yo on the blunt nose ofthe ship as a baseball player uses to catch a hard-driven ball inhis glove\u2014namely, by matching the ball's speed and direction almostexactly at the moment of impact. And now Bob's hours of practice paiddividends, for the yo-yo came to rest snugly, ready to be releasedagain.     All this had happened in such a short space of time that the Saylorbrothers must have had only a bare realization of what was going on.But by the time the yo-yo was flung at them again, this time withbetter calculations, they managed to put the firmly held asteroidbetween them and the deadly missile.

        "Query": "What makes Bob and Queazy so invested in securing Mr. Burnside's asteroid in the mission described in COSMIC YO-YO?",
        "Summary_1": "Bob and Queazy are willing to risk their lives to try and get the asteroid back from Wally and Billy Saylor because their economic survival depends on it. Bob is the president of Interplanetary Hauling & Moving Co., and his rivals, the Saylor brothers, have put his business in serious jeopardy. Although his novel idea to sell asteroids to wealthy earthmen originally made him some cash, it wasn\u2019t long before other companies got wind of his genius idea and started offering the same service. If the Saylor brothers keep beating Bob and Queazy to the punch, the men will no longer be in business.\n\nWhen Starre demands that Bob and Queazy leave her asteroid since she is the common law owner, both men try to explain to her why they desperately need the rock. The potential to make $550,000 means everything to Bob because his failure to secure that capital means that he and Queazy will lose their business and slave away for the rest of their lives as glass factory workers. \n\n",
        "Summary_2": "Bob Parker created the idea of the \"asteroid in your back yard\", and since then it has become a fad sweeping Earth. As a result, a number of moving companies have emerged as competitors to Bob's Interplanetary Hauling & Moving Co., primarily Saylor & Saylor. The Saylor brothers engage in unscrupulous business practices and have crippled Bob's business to the point of desperation. Therefore, Bob and his business partner Queazy need to fulfill Mr. Burnside's extremely specific wedding-asteroid request for his granddaughter; successful completion of the order would net their company $550,000 and save them from financial ruin. ",
        "Summary_3": "This mission to secure Mr. Burnside\u2019s asteroid is so important to Bob and Queazy because it will pay them $5.00 per ton, which they estimate will net them $550,000. They look for it for three weeks before finding it, demonstrating how valuable this job is to them.\nSecuring the asteroid is also a point of pride for them, as they feel their business is threatened by the rival Saylor brothers, and the success of this mission would demonstrate their claim in the business of interplanetary deliveries.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Securing Mr. Burnside\u2019s asteroid is critical for Bob\u2019s business to survive. He is having financial difficulty due to stiff competition, particularly from the Saylor brothers. The $550,000 from Mr. Burnside will help prevent his company from going bankrupt and going out of business. Burnside\u2019s order for an asteroid in his back yard is quite specific: it must be 506 feet long, 98 feet at the base and tapering to 10 feet at the apex, 9-12 feet thick, a smooth plane on the top side and a rough plane underneath. It must also be composed of iron ore, tungsten, quartz crystals, and cinnabar. It has to be in Burnside\u2019s back yard before 11:30 am on June 2. The order is so specific that normally Bob and Queazy would not have accepted it, but since the business is about to fold, they are desperate and willing to try to fill it. When they find the asteroid in just three weeks, it seems they have had an incredible stroke of good luck, until the Saylor brothers show up to claim it, too. Filling the Burnsides order is a matter of life or death for Bob and Queazy\u2019s company, and they are prepared to do everything humanly possible to collect the asteroid and take to Earth.\n\n",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      Bob Parker, looking through the photo-amplifiers at the wedge-shapedasteroid, was plainly flabbergasted. Not in his wildest imaginings hadhe thought they would actually find what they were looking for.     Cut the drive! he yelled at Queazy. I've got it, right on the nose.Queazy, my boy, can you imagine it? We're in the dough. Not only that,we're rich! Come here!     Queazy discharged their tremendous inertia into the motive-tubes insuch a manner that the big, powerful ship was moving at the same rateas the asteroid below\u201447.05 miles per second. He came slogging backexcitedly, put his eyes to the eyepiece. He gasped, and his big bodyshook with joyful ejaculations.     She checks down to the last dimension, Bob chortled, working withslide-rule and logarithm tables. Now all we have to do is find out ifshe's made of tungsten, iron, quartz crystals, and cinnabar! But therecouldn't be two asteroids of that shape anywhere else in the Belt, sothis has to be it!     He jerked a badly crumpled ethergram from his pocket, smoothed it out,and thumbed his nose at the signature.     Whee! Mr. Andrew S. Burnside, you owe us five hundred and fiftythousand dollars!     Queazy straightened. A slow, likeable smile wreathed his tanned face.Better take it easy, he advised, until I land the ship and we usethe atomic whirl spectroscope to determine the composition of theasteroid.     Have it your way, Bob Parker sang, happily. He threw the ethergramto the winds and it fell gently to the deck-plates. While Queazy\u2014socalled because his full name was Quentin Zuyler\u2014dropped the shipstraight down to the smooth surface of the asteroid, and clamped ittight with magnetic grapples, Bob flung open the lazarette, broughtout two space-suits. Moments later, they were outside the ship, withstar-powdered infinity spread to all sides.     In the ship, the ethergram from Andrew S. Burnside, of Philadelphia,one of the richest men in the world, still lay on the deck-plates.

The enemy shipwas two miles distant, a black shadow occulting part of the brilliantsky. It was moving along a down-spiraling path toward Earth.     Queazy's big hand gripped his shoulder. Go to it, Bob!     Bob nodded grimly. He backed the hauler up about thirty miles, thensent it forward again, directly toward the Saylor brothers' ship at tenmiles per second. And resting on the blunt nose of the ship was theyo-yo.     There was little doubt the Saylors' saw their approach. But,scornfully, they made no attempt to evade. There was no possible harmthe oncoming ship could wreak. Or at least that was what they thought,for Bob brought the hauler's speed down to zero\u2014and Starre Lowenthal'slittle ship, possessing its own inertia, kept on moving!     It spun away from the hauler's blunt nose, paying out two rigidlengths of cable behind it as it unwound, hurled itself forward like afantastic spinning cannon ball.     It's going to hit!     The excited cry came from Starre. But Bob swore. The dumbbell shipreached the end of its cables, falling a bare twenty feet short ofcompleting its mission. It didn't stop spinning, but came winding backup the cable, at the same terrific speed with which it had left.   <doc-sep> Bob sweated, having only fractions of seconds in which to maneuverfor the yo-yo could strike a fatal blow at the hauler too. It wasticklish work completely to nullify the yo-yo's speed. Bob usedexactly the same method of catching the yo-yo on the blunt nose ofthe ship as a baseball player uses to catch a hard-driven ball inhis glove\u2014namely, by matching the ball's speed and direction almostexactly at the moment of impact. And now Bob's hours of practice paiddividends, for the yo-yo came to rest snugly, ready to be releasedagain.     All this had happened in such a short space of time that the Saylorbrothers must have had only a bare realization of what was going on.But by the time the yo-yo was flung at them again, this time withbetter calculations, they managed to put the firmly held asteroidbetween them and the deadly missile. But it was clumsy evasion, forthe asteroid was several times as massive as the ship which was towingit, and its inertia was great. And as soon as the little ship camespinning back to rest, Bob flung the hauler to a new vantage point andagain the yo-yo snapped out.     And this time\u2014collision! Bob yelled as he saw the stern section of theSaylor brothers' ship crumple like tissue paper crushed between thehand. The dumbbell-shaped ship, smaller, and therefore stauncher due tothe principle of the arch, wound up again, wobbling a little. It hadreceived a mere dent in its starboard half.     Starre was chortling with glee. Queazy whispered, Attaboy, Bob! Thistime we'll knock 'em out of the sky!     The yo-yo came to rest and at the same moment a gong rang excitedly.Bob knew what that meant. The Saylor brothers were trying to establishcommunication.     Queazy was across the room in two running strides. He threw in thetelaudio and almost immediately, Wally Saylor's big body built up inthe plate. Wally Saylor's face was quivering with wrath.     What do you damned fools think you're trying to do? he roared.You've crushed in our stern section. You've sliced away half of ourstern jets. Air is rushing out! You'll kill us!     Now, Bob drawled, you're getting the idea.     I'll inform the Interplanetary Commission! screamed Saylor.           If     you're alive, Bob snarled wrathfully. And you won't be unlessyou release the asteroid.     I'll see you in Hades first!     Hades, remarked Bob coldly, here you come!     He snapped the hauler into its mile-a-second speed again, stopped it atzero. And the yo-yo went on its lone, destructive sortie.     For a fraction of a second Wally Saylor exhibited the countenance of adoomed man. In the telaudio plate, he whirled, and diminished in sizewith a strangled yell.     The yo-yo struck again, but Bob Parker maneuvered its speed insuch a manner that it struck in the same place as before, but not asheavily, then rebounded and came spinning back with perfect, sparklingprecision. And even before it snugged itself into its berth, it wasapparent that the Saylor brothers had given up. Like a wounded terrier,their ship shook itself free of the asteroid, hung in black space fora second, then vanished with a flaming puff of released gravitons fromits still-intact jets.     The battle was won!  "

        "Query": "What is the near-death experience of Bob Parker in COSMIC YO-YO?",
        "Summary_1": "Bob Parker almost dies after the Saylor brothers find Starre\u2019s asteroid and decide that although Bob and Queazy landed on it first, they want to be the ones to fulfill Mr. Burnside\u2019s order. Bob tries to defend his turf with Starre\u2019s spasticizer, but Wally is able to shoot the gun out of his hands. Bob is unable to defend himself from the ginormous Saylor brothers after he loses Starre\u2019s weapon, and he is beaten in the stomach and thrown into space to float with little oxygen and zero sustenance. He remains isolated, drifting through space, for three weeks before his friend Queazy and Starre are able to locate him. He describes the sensation as \u201cbeing buried alive.\u201d At the time that he is found, he has only a few short days of oxygen left until he will choke to death. ",
        "Summary_2": "Soon after Bob and Queazy meet Starre Lowenthal on the asteroid, Wally and Billy Saylor arrive to claim the asteroid for themselves and deliver it to Mr. Burnside. When Bob realizes both companies have received orders from Mr. Burnside, he threatens to report the brothers to the Interplanetary Commission since he arrived at the asteroid first and the law dictates ownership goes to whoever arrived first. Then, Bob grabs Starre's paralyzing spasticizer and signals to Queazy, who quickly throws Billy Saylor into space. Wally shoots the spasticizer from Bob's hand, and Bob knocks Wally's gun away. At the same time, Bob feels a sudden crushing pain and hears Starre screaming before he blacks out. When Bob awakens later, he discovers he is alone in the vastness of space and running out of air. The Saylor brothers have taken the asteroid and left him there to die, separated from Queazy and Starre. He realizes he has only five pounds of air pressure left, and he had been shot by spastic rays. However, his state of suspended animation likely kept him alive long enough to be saved by Queazy and Starre because his body didn't require as much oxygen.",
        "Summary_3": "Bob Parker almost dies while fighting with the Saylor brothers on the asteroid that he was ordered to deliver by Mr. Burnside. The Saylor brothers are known for using rough force to get their way, and after Bob wakes up unconscious and running out of air (only five pound of pressure left) spinning alone in outer space, he concludes that he must have been given a dose of spastic rays that effected his muscles in an extreme way that caused him to go into suspended animation with very low oxygen demand. \nHe had been floating like that for three weeks before he regained consciousness at the last possible moment before he was going to die alone, and was then rescued by Queazy and Starre after calling on the intercom one last time. His narrow rescue gives him added purpose in retaliating against the Saylor brothers to retrieve the asteroid, which may ultimately win him his love, Starre.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Bob Parker almost dies after the face-to-face encounter with the Saylor brothers on the asteroid. When he grabs Starre\u2019s spasticizer to use against them, Wally shoots it out of his hand. Someone hits Bob so hard that he is knocked unconscious and off the asteroid so that he is floating in space. When he regains consciousness, he is down to 5 pounds of oxygen, and as this supply dwindles, he grows weaker, knowing that he is dying either of oxygen deprivation or starvation from being unconscious for so long. Just as his oxygen runs out, Bob curses the Saylor brothers and calls out to Queazy one last time--and Queazy responds. He and Starre locate Bob, and they provide him with oxygen. Queasy explains they would both be dead if not for Starre; she was knocked unconscious, too, but came to and made her way to her ship. She used the direction-finder on the telaudio to locate Queazy and pick him up. Then when they got Bob\u2019s signal, they found him, too. \n",
        "Article": "It was Queazy who got into his space-suit and did the welding job,fastening two huge supra-steel eyes onto the dumbbell-shaped ship'snarrow midsection. Into these eyes cables which trailed back totwo winches in the big ship's nose were inserted, welded fast, andreinforced.     The nose of the hauler was blunt, perfectly fitted for the job. BobParker practiced and experimented for three hours with this yo-yo ofcosmic dimensions, while Starre and Queazy stood over him bursting intostrange, delighted squeals of laughter whenever the yo-yo reached theend of its double cable and started rolling back up to the ship. Queazysnapped his fingers.     It'll work! His gray eyes showed satisfaction. Now, if only theSaylor brothers are where we calculated!     They weren't where Bob and Queazy had calculated, as they haddiscovered the next day. They had expected to pick up the asteroidon their mass-detectors a few hundred thousand miles outside of theMoon's orbit. But now they saw the giant ship attached like a leech tothe still bigger asteroid\u2014inside the Moon's orbit! A mere two hundredthousand miles from Earth!

He knew that after fivedays out, as the ship hurled itself at breakneck speed toward Earth;probably that distracting emotion was the real reason he couldn'tattach any significance to Starre's dumbbell-shaped ship, which trailedastern, attached by a long cable.     Starre apparently knew he was in love with her, too, for on the fifthday Bob was teaching her the mechanics of operating the hauler, and shegently lifted his hand from a finger-switch.     Even      I     know that isn't the control to the Holloway vacuum-feeder,Bob. That switch is for the\u2014ah\u2014the anathern tube, you told me. Right?     Right, he said unsteadily. Anyway, Starre, as I was saying, thisship operates according to the reverse Fitzgerald Contraction Formula.All moving bodies contract in the line of motion. What Hollowayand Hammond did was to reverse that universal law. They caused thecontraction first\u2014motion had to follow! The gravitonic field affectsevery atom in the ship with the same speed at the same time. We couldgo from zero speed to our top speed of two thousand miles a second justlike that!     He snapped his fingers. No acceleration effects. This type of ship,necessary in our business, can stop flat, back up, ease up, move inany direction, and the passengers wouldn't have any feeling of motionat\u2014Oh, hell! Bob groaned, the serious glory of her eyes making himshake. He took her hand. Starre, he said desperately, I've got totell you something\u2014     She jerked her hand away. No, she exclaimed in an almost frightenedvoice. You can't tell me. There's\u2014there's Mac, she finished,faltering. The asteroid\u2014     You      have     to marry him?     Her eyes filled with tears. I have to live up to the bargain.     And ruin your whole life, he ground out. Suddenly, he turned back tothe control board, quartered the vision plate. He pointed savagely tothe lower left quarter, which gave a rearward view of the dumbbell shiptrailing astern.     There's your ship, Starre. He jabbed his finger at it. I've got afeeling\u2014and I can't put the thought into concrete words\u2014that somehowthe whole solution of the problem of grabbing the asteroid back liesthere. But how?      How?          Starre's blue eyes followed the long cable back to where it wasattached around her ship's narrow midsection.     She shook her head helplessly. It just looks like a big yo-yo to me.     A yo-yo?     Yes, a yo-yo. That's all. She was belligerent.     A      yo-yo     ! Bob Parker yelled the word and almost hit the ceiling, hegot out of the chair so fast. Can you imagine it! A yo-yo!     He disappeared from the room. Queazy! he shouted.

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in Spacemen Die at Home?",
        "Summary_1": "After studying for six years, Ben sits at his U.S. Academy of Interplanetary Flight graduation. Next to Ben is Mickey, his best friend who also plans to go into deep space. Ben is an orphan, and he wonders if the only person he invited, Charlie Taggart, is there. Ben met Charlie, an accomplished spaceman, when he was a boy, and Charlie took him under his wing. When Ben connects with Charlie after the ceremony, he worries about his gaunt face and terrible cough. \n\nBen then meets Laura, Mickey\u2019s sister. There is an undeniable and instant connection between them. Charlie only has 24 hours to spend with Ben before he has to report back for duty, and although he wants to have some drinks with Ben alone, Laura invites them both over, and Ben can\u2019t help but say yes.\n\nMoments later, Dean Dawson reminds Ben about an offer to teach at the Academy. Mickey takes this opportunity to admit to Ben that he will be working as a Supervisor at White Sands Port. Ben is disappointed to hear that Mickey has chosen to live a boring life, but Mickey insists that he does not want to die in his 30s. \n\nAfter dinner at Mickey\u2019s house, Laura and Ben take a walk together. Laura asks about Charlie\u2019s life before he was a spaceman, but Ben doesn\u2019t have answers for her. He doesn\u2019t know anything about Charlie\u2019s past. Ben looks at Laura and realizes that she has feelings for him, too. When she suggests that a career in deep space may not be worth what Ben would be leaving behind, Ben finds himself at a crossroads. Should he live his dream  or should he settle down with the woman he loves and live an ordinary life?\n\nThe next morning, Charlie gives Ben an old tin with souvenirs inside, and then tells him to meet him at the Space Rat, a little cafe on Mars, when he gets there. Ben still hasn\u2019t chosen a career path and decides to stay with Mickey and Laura and their family until he does. He experiences forty days of happiness with his love, Laura, and forty nights of indecision about which career to choose. Ben asks Laura to marry him, but she says she can\u2019t unless he decides to stay on earth. \n\nThe next day, Ben receives a message informing him that Charlie has died from lung-rot, a disease he got in space. When Ben looks in Charlie\u2019s tin and finds useless trinkets, he decides  to take the teaching job so that he does not live a similarly meaningless life. However, hours later, he looks in the tin again and finds a wedding ring. Ben surmises that Charlie wanted to tell him to take the chance on space, and he believes it\u2019s the right decision to make. He can\u2019t live his life without knowing what the stars look like, even if that means he can\u2019t have Laura too. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Spacemen Die at Home is a story in the form of a letter written from Ben to Laura, explaining his decision to leave her behind on Earth. It all begins in June of 1965 in New Mexico when the first class of the U.S. Academy of Interplentary Flight is finally graduating after six years. These 25 students were trained to take on interplanetary flight and space exploration, so they can continue to discover the outer planets. Robert Chandler gave a speech detailing why these brave men were so important to modern society, as women were not allowed to become space explorers. Mickey and Ben, graduates and friends, sat next to each other during the ceremony. Mickey struggles to find his family in the crowd, and Ben reveals that he was orphaned after his parents died in a rocket crash. A spaceman named Charlie Taggart (Stardust Charlie) raised him instead. He was one of the oldest spacemen ever, having travelled for nearly 25 years, and was the Chief Jetman on the Lunar Lady. \nAfter the ceremony, Ben runs into Charlie and sees how much he\u2019s aged in just a year. He looks ill and drugged, but he still asks Ben to celebrate with him. Before Ben can respond, Mickey and his sister Laura came up to him. He is instantly attracted to her and feels a connection. Ben was supposed to spend the weekend with Mickey and his family, but now that Charlie\u2019s in town he feels conflicted. Both Ben and Charlie decide to join them, despite Charlie not being a family man. Dean Dawson, an academy professor, approaches Ben and reminds him of his job offer at the Academy. Ben turns him down laughing, until Mickey reveals that he is not going to space anymore. Instead, he\u2019ll be the Cargo Supervisor of White Sands Sport. After an awkward dinner together, Laura and Ben went stargazing and spoke of Charlie and the draw of space. Laura hints at loving Ben, but doesn\u2019t say it outright. Charlie left the next day, but left Ben some of his possessions. He knows he hasn\u2019t got much time in this universe, but he goes back to Mars anyways. \nWith several job options to choose from, Ben decides to stay at Mickey\u2019s house for the timebeing. He stays for 40 days and nights, spending much of his time with Laura. He asked Laura to marry him, but she says she\u2019d only marry him if he were a teacher, not a spaceman. Ben was faced with a serious conundrum. The next day he received word that Charlges Taggart died of lung-rot, and Ben broke down. Ben sifted through Charlie\u2019s possessions and decided to take on a the teaching gig for Dawson. However, after looking through the box again, he found a wedding ring. Seeing himself in Charlie, Ben decided to fly to the stone cafe on Mars called the Space Rat where Stardust Charlie said he\u2019d be waiting for him. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Nearly the entire story is a recollection of the narrator, Ben, as he writes a letter to his love, Laura, who he is leaving behind for his dreams of becoming a spaceman.\nIn June of 1995, Ben and Mickey are sitting together during their graduation ceremony from the first class of the U. S. Academy of Interplanetary Flight, looking at out at the audience for their guests. Mickey is cheerful and generally accepts the world with a smile. Ben\u2019s invited guest, Charlie Taggart, is a pioneering spaceman of 25 years who he thinks of as a parental figure since his parents died in a strato-jet crash when he was four. Ben and Mickey both spot their guests, and there is a contrasting moment between Ben\u2019s orphaned upbringing and Mickey\u2019s family.\nCharlie looks different from the other guests, with scars on his face, and a missing button on his suit - known for doing things his own way. Charlie is a veteran of the explorer Everson's first trip to the Moon, and he had spent his life in space. Mickey introduces Ben to his sister, Laura, after the ceremony. Since Mickey has invited Ben to spend the weekend with them, Laura goes a step further to also invite Charlie, which they both accept. Charlie leaves after one night, gifting Ben a tin box of \u201csouvenirs\u201d from his life, foreshadowing his imminent passing.\nAlthough Ben and Mickey both graduated from the school of interplanetary flight, they have both been offered terrestrial jobs. Ben was offered a job teaching Astrogation at the Academy by Dean Dawson. No doubt very prestigious, but Ben dreams of being the first to visit new planets with Mickey. Mickey awkwardly reveals he had a change of heart, citing that spacemen have short lives because of the demands and danger. Mickey was offered a Cargo Supervisor role at the White Sands Port that he accepted because he will \u201clive a lot longer\u201d there.\nBen is deeply uncertain about his future, accepting Mickey\u2019s offer to stay until he figures it out. During the forty days and forty nights he spends with them he falls in love with Laura and contemplates a family life on Earth with her - even proposing marriage to her - but his desire to be a spaceman remains a barrier to them being together. After Ben learns of Charlie\u2019s death (at \u201chome\u201d on Mars), he remembers the box Charlie gave him. At first he thinks it\u2019s pitiful that there are trinkets in place of the family Charlie might have had on Earth, and makes a decision to take the teaching job and remain on Earth in a safe life with Laura. \nProcessing the contents of the box further, seeing a wedding ring Charlie left for the marriage he couldn\u2019t have due to his life in space, Ben is inspired to again chase his dream in space. He leaves behind the wedding ring and a note (the story) for Laura to find in the morning when he is gone.\n",
        "Summary_4": "This story is a letter from Ben to Laura, and starts with Ben's retelling of his graduation day from the U.S. Academy of Interplanetary Flight, with inspiring quotes from the guest speaker about how important spacemen are to society. Ben and his friend Mickey looked around for the one person Ben had invited: Charlie Taggart, aka \"Spaceman Charlie\". They spotted him, and Ben was relieved; the three of them went out afterwards to celebrate along with Mickey's sister, Laura. Ben explained that he'd been offered a teaching job at The Academy but wanted to join an exploratory crew. After getting to the helicopter, Ben eventually met Laura and Charlie's parents--simple people who were happy to live on Earth and not be going anywhere any time soon. Charlie did his best to interact with these new people, even though he told some disturbing stories. Laura and Ben headed to the terrace to look for rockets and talked about Charlie; Laura had a lot of questions about his past. They shared a quiet moment, appreciating each other, before Laura made a comment about the desire to go to the stars might be a disappointment: if they weren't what they seemed, maybe they would never be enough. She asked Ben if he really wanted to give up everything he could have, making Ben sad. The next morning, Charlie returned to work and left a box of belongings with Ben; it was only then when Ben became worried about the coughing he'd noticed over the past day, and his glassy eyes and stiff movements. Before they could talk, Charlie was gone. Later, in Mickey's room, Ben reflected on how his childhood was different from that of other children, after his parents died in a rocket crash. It was after this that he realized he wasn't sure if he wanted to stay or to go, and agreed to stay with Mickey's family until he made a decision about what to do. He spent most of the time with Laura, and after forty days of this he proposed to her, prompting her to ask what he wanted to do for his job. She didn't want to marry someone who would be absent, or someone in such a dangerous profession, but would feel better if he stayed and worked as a teacher, because she loved him too.  It was the next day that Ben got the news that Charlie had died from lung-rot. Shocked, he looked through the box of belongings that Charlie had left him, and after seeing what little Charlie had left behind in terms of meaningful connections, he called The Academy to accept the teaching job. In the end, though, Ben recognized that he would never be happy without trying to explore the stars, so he tells Laura he will not be around when she wakes up because he has to see what's out there, and takes Laura's wedding ring and that of Charlie's wife with him, as mementos.

You on good terms with them?     Sure, I guess so. Course, they're pretty thick with Boge.     So?     Didn't I tell you? Boge was the bunch that tried to take us over herea dozen years back. They'd've made it too, if they hadn't had a lot ofbad luck. Their armor went in the drink, and without armor they're easygame.     Miss Furkle buzzed. I have your lists, she said shortly.     Bring them in, please.   <doc-sep> And now, Laura, it's nearly midnight. You're in your room, sleeping,and the house is silent.     It's hard to tell you, to make you understand, and that is why I amwriting this.     I looked through Charlie's box again, more carefully this time, readingthe old letters and studying the photographs. I believe now thatCharlie sensed my indecision, that he left these things so that theycould tell me what he could not express in words.     And among the things, Laura, I found a ring.     A wedding ring.     In that past he never talked about, there was a woman\u2014his wife.Charlie was young once, his eyes full of dreams, and he faced the samedecision that I am facing. Two paths were before him, but he tried totravel both. He later learned what we already know\u2014that there can beno compromise. And you know, too, which path he finally chose.     Do you know why he had to drug himself to watch me graduate? So hecould look at me, knowing that I would see the worlds he could neverlive to see. Charlie didn't leave just a few trinkets behind him. Heleft himself, Laura, for he showed me that a boy's dream can also be aman's dream.     He made his last trip to Luna when he knew he was going to die. Heavenknows how he escaped a checkup. Maybe the captain understood and waskind\u2014but that doesn't matter now.     Do you know      why     he wanted to reach Mars? Do you know why he didn'twant to die in the clean, cool air of Earth?     It was because he wanted to die nearer home. His home, Laura, was theUniverse, where the ship was his house, the crew his father, mother,brothers, the planets his children.     You say that the beauty of the other side of the mountain vanishesafter you reach it. But how can one ever be      sure     until the journey ismade? Could I or Charlie or the thousand before us bear to look upon astar and think,      I might have gone there; I could have been the first     ?     We said, too, that the life of a spaceman is lonely. Yet how could onebe lonely when men like Charlie roam the spaceways?     Charlie wanted me to himself that night after graduation. He wanted usto celebrate as spacemen should, for he knew that this would be hislast night on Earth. It might have seemed an ugly kind of celebrationto you, but he wanted it with all his heart, and we robbed him of it.     Because of these things, Laura, I will be gone in the morning. Explainthe best you can to Mickey and to your parents and Dean Dawson.     Right now I've got a date that I'm going to keep\u2014at a dingy stone cafeon Mars, the      Space Rat     , just off Chandler Field on the Grand Canal.     Stardust Charlie will be there; he'll go with me in memory to whateverpart of the Galaxy I may live to reach. And so will you, Laura.     I have two wedding rings with me\u2014his wife's ring and yours.    <doc-sep> I liked your folks, Laura. There was no star-hunger in them, of course.They were simple and solid and settled, like green growing things,deep-rooted, belonging to Earth. They were content with a home that wascool on this warm summer night, with a 'copter and a tri-dimensionalvideo, and a handsome automatic home that needed no servants orhousework.     Stardust Charlie was as comfortable as a Martian sand-monkey in ashower, but he tried courageously to be himself.     At the dinner table he stared glassily at nothing and grated, Only hitMars once, but I'll never forget the kid who called himself a medic.Skipper started coughing, kept it up for three days. Whoopin' cough,the medic says, not knowin' the air had chemicals that turned to acidin your lungs. I'd never been to Mars before, but I knew better'n that.Hell, I says, that ain't whoopin' cough, that's lung-rot.     That was when your father said he wasn't so hungry after all.     Afterward, you and I walked onto the terrace, into the moonlit night,to watch for crimson-tailed continental rockets that occasionallystreaked up from White Sands.     We gazed for a few seconds up into the dark sky, and then you said:Charlie is funny, isn't he? He's nice and I'm glad he's here, but he'ssort of funny.     He's an old-time spaceman. You didn't need much education in thosedays, just a lot of brawn and a quick mind. It took guts to be aspaceman then.     But he wasn't always a spaceman. Didn't he ever have a family?     I smiled and shook my head. If he had, he never mentioned it. Charliedoesn't like to be sentimental, at least not on the outside. As far asI know, his life began when he took off for the Moon with Everson.     You stared at me strangely, almost in a sacred kind of way. I knewsuddenly that you liked me, and my heart began to beat faster.     There was silence.     You were lovely, your soft hair like strands of gold, and there wereflecks of silver in your dark eyes. Somehow I was afraid. I had thefeeling that I shouldn't have come here.     You kept looking at me until I had to ask: What are you thinking,Laura?     You laughed, but it was a sad, fearful laugh. No, I shouldn't bethinking it. You'd hate me if I told you, and I wouldn't want that.     I could never hate you.     It\u2014it's about the stars, you said very softly. I understand why youwant to go to them. Mickey and I used to dream about them when we werekids. Of course I was a girl, so it was just a game to me. But once Idreamed of going to England. Oh, it was going to be so wonderful. Ilived for months, just thinking about it.     One summer we went. I had fun. I saw the old buildings and castles,and the spaceports and the Channel Tube. But after it was over, Irealized England wasn't so different from America. Places seem excitingbefore you get to them, and afterward they're not really.     I frowned. And you mean it might be the same with the stars? You thinkmaybe I haven't grown up yet?     Anxiety darkened your features. No, it'd be good to be a spaceman,to see the strange places and make history. But is it worth it? Is itworth the things you'd have to give up?     I didn't understand at first, and I wanted to ask, Give up      what     ?     Then I looked at you and the promise in your eyes, and I knew.     All through the years I'd been walking down a single, narrow path.     Government boarding school, the Academy, my eyes always upward and onthe stars.     Now I'd stumbled into a cross-roads, beholding a strange new path thatI'd never noticed before.       You can go into space     , I thought,      and try to do as much living inten years as normal men do in fifty. You can be like Everson, who diedin a Moon crash at the age of 36, or like a thousand others who lieburied in Martian sand and Venusian dust. Or, if you're lucky, likeCharlie\u2014a kind of human meteor streaking through space, eternallyalone, never finding a home.         Or there's the other path. To stay on this little prison of an Earthin cool, comfortable houses. To be one of the solid, rooted people witha wife and kids. To be one of the people who live long enough to growold, who awake to the song of birds instead of rocket grumblings, whofill their lungs with the clean rich air of Earth instead of poisonousdust.       I'm sorry, you said. I didn't mean to make you sad, Ben.     It's all right, I said, clenching my fists. You made sense\u2014a lot ofsense.  "

        "Query": "What do people think about astronauts?",
        "Summary_1": "Ben experiences a lot of anxiety at his graduation from the U.S. Academy of Interplanetary Flight because of the high expectations he perceives that the audience has of the 25 men who are graduating. The students have spent the last six years of their lives dedicating themselves to learning about minerals, metals, colonization, and space travel for the sake of helping the people on Earth. The class of 1995 is the first of its kind, and the family members and friends who attend the graduation understandably have very high hopes for the graduates. The graduation speaker is Robert Chandler, a spaceman who landed a rocket on Mars and created the first colony there. He has also traveled to Venus twice. For most laymen, accomplishing something as adventurous as landing on other planets is unthinkable, and the men graduating are the next in line to make such unthinkable journeys. \n\nBen looks out over the crowds of people and thinks to himself that these strangers are looking at him as if he\u2019s some sort of god. He knows that they expect the world from him and his fellow graduates, and he worries that he won\u2019t be able to deliver on such incredible promises. \n\n",
        "Summary_2": "Spacemen are highly valued and, in some ways, superior members of society. Only a very small group of people were selected to attend the U.S. Academy of Interplanetary Flight, which shows how selective and exclusive these members of society are. Although their work is valued and fawned over, those who work in space are often killed early on in their careers. The mortality rate is extremely high in this job and increases with every trip taken. With such a dangerous reputation, the family members of spacemen see the darker side of it: solitude, fear, and sadness. ",
        "Summary_3": "Ben reflects on the pressures of being a spaceman during graduation, that there is a lot expected from them; such as making \u201ca new kind of civilization and a better place out of Earth.\u201d \nAs Ben and Mickey talk about their futures, Mickey reveals he is no longer going to become a spaceman because their lives are short. Mickey reveals for the first time in the story the dangers of the job, the exposure to uncertainty and hazards, and the demands it places on a human body.\nAlthough it is a high pressure, dangerous job, being a spaceman is romanticized through Ben\u2019s childhood dream while he ultimately commits to see through at the end of the story. The allure of adventure in space and seeing the unknown for himself is a stronger draw than a safe life of certainty on Earth.\n",
        "Summary_4": "In the speech that Robert Chandler gave to the first graduating class of the U.S. Academy of Interplanetary Flight, he reminded the students that the six years of training would pay off for society, and that these spacemen would retrieve metals and minerals that the people of Earth needed, find new land, and inspire others, all of which were necessary things for the society. However, Ben and Mickey know it can be a dangerous profession: Mickey explains that on the more dangerous missions, where one is one of the first on a planet, you're lucky to live five to ten years. This is important because Laura has this knowledge when she talks to Ben about their possible future together. She knows that he could die, their children could be exposed to dangerous radiation, and he would likely always be looking for the next adventure instead of coming home to her. In general, the spacemen are appreciated for their services to the society but there is some understanding of the limitations on the types of meaningful personal connections they are able to make.",

What do you make of them? asked Stark.     Human, said Steiner. It may even be that they are a little more thanhuman. I don't understand that light that surrounds them. And they seemto be clothed, as it were, in dignity.     And very little else, said Father Briton, though that light trickdoes serve a purpose. But I'm not sure they'd pass in Philadelphia.     Talk to them again, said Stark. You're the linguist.     That isn't necessary here, Captain. Talk to them yourself.     Are there any other people here? Stark asked the man.     The two of us. Man and woman.     But are there any others?     How would there be any others? What other kind of people could therebe than man and woman?     But is there more than one man or woman?     How could there be more than one of anything?     The captain was a little puzzled by this, but he went on doggedly:Ha-Adamah, what do you think that we are? Are we not people?     You are not anything till I name you. But I will name you and thenyou can be. You are named Captain. He is named Priest. He is namedEngineer. He is named Flunky.     Thanks a lot, said Steiner.     But are we not people? persisted Captain Stark.     No. We are the people. There are no people but two. How could there beother people?     And the damnest thing about it, muttered Langweilig, is, how are yougoing to prove him wrong? But it does give you a small feeling.     Can we have something to eat? asked the Captain.     Pick from the trees, said Ha-Adamah, and then it may be that youwill want to sleep on the grass. Being not of human nature (which doesnot need sleep or rest), it may be that you require respite. But youare free to enjoy the garden and its fruits.     We will, said Captain Stark.     They wandered about the place, but they were uneasy. There were theanimals. The lion and lioness were enough to make one cautious, thoughthey offered no harm. The two bears had a puzzling look, as though theywanted either to frolic with you or to mangle you.     If there are only two people here, said Casper Craig, then it may bethat the rest of the world is not dangerous at all. It looked fertilewherever we scanned it, though not so fertile as this central bit. Andthose rocks would bear examining.     Flecked with gold, and possibly with something else, said Stark. Avery promising site.     And everything grows here, added Steiner. Those are Earth-fruits andI never saw finer. I've tasted the grapes and plums and pears.

If you're thinking what I'm afraid to think, said Gilbert, then itwill be the test at least: whether we're having a pleasant dream orwhether this is reality. Go ahead and eat one.     I won't be the first to eat one. You eat.     Ask him first. You ask him.     Ha-Adamah, is it allowed to eat the apples?     Certainly. Eat. It is the finest fruit in the garden.   <doc-sep> Ri swallowed. We couldn't make the people believe that.     No? Mia challenged. Couldn't we? Not today, but what about tomorrow?You'll see. Because I think the Army is getting ready to invade thealien system!     The people won't support them, Ri answered woodenly.           Think.     If he tells them to, they will. They trust him.     Ri looked around at the shadows.     That explains a lot of things, Mia said. I think the Army's beenpreparing for this for a long time. From the first, maybe. That's whyExtrone cut off our trade with the aliens. Partly to keep them fromlearning that he was getting ready to invade them, but more to keepthem from exposing      him     to the people. The aliens wouldn't be fooledlike we were, so easy.     No! Ri snapped. It was to keep the natural economic balance.     You know that's not right.     Ri lay down on his bed roll. Don't talk about it. It's not good totalk like this. I don't even want to listen.     When the invasion starts, he'll have to command      all     their loyalties.To keep them from revolt again. They'd be ready to believe us, then.He'll have a hard enough time without people running around trying totell the truth.     You're wrong. He's not like that. I know you're wrong.     Mia smiled twistedly. How many has he already killed? How can we evenguess?     Ri swallowed sickly.     Remember our guide? To keep our hunting territory a secret?     Ri shuddered. That's different. Don't you see? This is not at all likethat.   <doc-sep> But in the end, damn it, he could not hate these people. All they hadever wanted was peace, and even though they had never understood thatthe Universe is unknowable and that you must always have big shoulders,still they had always sought only for peace. If peace leads to noconflict at all and then decay, well, that was something that had to belearned. So he could not hate these people.     But he could not help them either. He turned from their eyes and wentinto the radio shack. It had begun to dawn on the women that they mightbe leaving without their husbands or sons, and he did not want to seethe fierce struggle that he was sure would take place. He sat alone andtried, for the last time, to call Bossio.     After a while, an old woman found him and offered him coffee. It wasa very decent thing to do, to think of him at a time like this, andhe was so suddenly grateful he could only nod. The woman said that hemust be cold in that thin army thing and that she had brought along amackinaw for him. She poured the coffee and left him alone.     They were thinking of him now, he knew, because they were thinking ofeveryone who had to stay. Throw the dog a bone. Dammit, don't be likethat, he told himself. He had not had anything to eat all day and thecoffee was warm and strong. He decided he might be of some help at theship.     It was stripped down now and they were loading. He was startled to seea great group of them standing in the snow, removing their clothes.Then he understood. The clothes of forty people would change theweight by enough to get a few more aboard. There was no fighting. Someof the women were almost hysterical and a few had refused to go andwere still in their cabins, but the process was orderly. Children wentautomatically, as did the youngest husbands and all the women. Theelders were shuffling around in the snow, waving their arms to keepthemselves warm. Some of them were laughing to keep their spirits up.     In the end, the ship took forty-six people.     Rossel was one of the ones that would not be going. Dylan saw himstanding by the airlock holding his wife in his arms, his face buriedin her soft brown hair. A sense of great sympathy, totally unexpected,rose up in Dylan, and a little of the lostness of thirty years wentslipping away. These were his people. It was a thing he had neverunderstood before, because he had never once been among men in greattrouble. He waited and watched, learning, trying to digest this whilethere was still time. Then the semi-naked colonists were inside andthe airlock closed. But when the ship tried to lift, there was a sharpburning smell\u2014she couldn't get off the ground.  "

He worries, however, that Charlie looks very ill. He becomes even more concerned when Charlie leaves a small tin for Ben to look through after he leaves.

        "Article": "Next morning the door chimes pealed, and you went to the door andbrought back the audiogram. It was addressed to me; I wondered whocould be sending me a message.     I pressed the stud on the little gray cylinder, and a rasping,automatic voice droned: Luna City, Luna, July 27, 1995. Regret toinform you of death of Charles Taggart, Chief Jetman....     Then there was a Latin name which was more polite than the wordlung-rot and the metallic phrase, This message brought to you bycourtesy of United Nations Earth-Luna Communication Corps.     I stood staring at the cylinder.     Charles Taggart was dead.     Charles Taggart was Charlie. Stardust Charlie.     My heart thudded crazily against my chest. It couldn't be! Not Charlie!The audiogram had lied!     I pressed the stud again. ... regret to inform you of death ofCharles ...     I hurled the cylinder at the wall. It thudded, fell, rolled. The brokenvoice droned on.     You ran to it, shut it off. I'm sorry, Ben, so terribly\u2014     Without answering, I walked into my room. I knew it was true now. Iremembered Charlie's coughing, his gaunt features, his drugged gaze.The metallic words had told the truth.     I sat for a long time on my bed, crying inside, but staring dry-eyed atCharlie's faded tin box.     Then, finally, I fingered his meager possessions\u2014a few wrinkledphotos, some letters, a small black statue of a forgotten Martian god,a gold service medal from the Moon Patrol.       This was what remained of Charlie after twenty-five years in space.It was a bitter bargain. A statue instead of a wife, yellowed lettersinstead of children, a medal instead of a home.       It'd be a great future     , I thought.      You'd dream of sitting in a dingystone dive on the Grand Canal with sand-wasps buzzing around smoky,stinking candles. A bottle of luchu juice and a couple of Martian girlswith dirty feet for company. And a sudden cough that would be the firstsign of lung-rot.       To hell with it!     I walked into your living room and called Dean Dawson on the visiphone.     I accepted that job teaching.   <doc-sep> And now, Laura, it's nearly midnight. You're in your room, sleeping,and the house is silent.     It's hard to tell you, to make you understand, and that is why I amwriting this.     I looked through Charlie's box again, more carefully this time, readingthe old letters and studying the photographs. I believe now thatCharlie sensed my indecision, that he left these things so that theycould tell me what he could not express in words.     And among the things, Laura, I found a ring.     A wedding ring.     In that past he never talked about, there was a woman\u2014his wife.Charlie was young once, his eyes full of dreams, and he faced the samedecision that I am facing. Two paths were before him, but he tried totravel both. He later learned what we already know\u2014that there can beno compromise. And you know, too, which path he finally chose.     Do you know why he had to drug himself to watch me graduate? So hecould look at me, knowing that I would see the worlds he could neverlive to see. Charlie didn't leave just a few trinkets behind him. Heleft himself, Laura, for he showed me that a boy's dream can also be aman's dream.     He made his last trip to Luna when he knew he was going to die. Heavenknows how he escaped a checkup. Maybe the captain understood and waskind\u2014but that doesn't matter now.     Do you know      why     he wanted to reach Mars? Do you know why he didn'twant to die in the clean, cool air of Earth?     It was because he wanted to die nearer home. His home, Laura, was theUniverse, where the ship was his house, the crew his father, mother,brothers, the planets his children.     You say that the beauty of the other side of the mountain vanishesafter you reach it. But how can one ever be      sure     until the journey ismade? Could I or Charlie or the thousand before us bear to look upon astar and think,      I might have gone there; I could have been the first     ?     We said, too, that the life of a spaceman is lonely. Yet how could onebe lonely when men like Charlie roam the spaceways?     Charlie wanted me to himself that night after graduation. He wanted usto celebrate as spacemen should, for he knew that this would be hislast night on Earth. It might have seemed an ugly kind of celebrationto you, but he wanted it with all his heart, and we robbed him of it.     Because of these things, Laura, I will be gone in the morning. Explainthe best you can to Mickey and to your parents and Dean Dawson.     Right now I've got a date that I'm going to keep\u2014at a dingy stone cafeon Mars, the      Space Rat     , just off Chandler Field on the Grand Canal.     Stardust Charlie will be there; he'll go with me in memory to whateverpart of the Galaxy I may live to reach. And so will you, Laura.     I have two wedding rings with me\u2014his wife's ring and yours.    <doc-sep> Mickey Cameron, sitting next to me, dug an elbow into my ribs. I don'tsee 'em, Ben, he whispered. Where do you suppose they are?     I blinked. Who?     My folks.     That was something I didn't have to worry about. My parents had died ina strato-jet crash when I was four, so I hadn't needed many of thoseYou are cordially invited cards. Just one, which I'd sent to CharlieTaggart.     Stardust Charlie, we called him, although I never knew why. He was aveteran of Everson's first trip to the Moon nearly twenty-five yearsago, and he was still at it. He was Chief Jetman now on the      LunarLady     , a commercial ore ship on a shuttle between Luna City and WhiteSands.     I remembered how, as a kid, I'd pestered him in the Long IslandSpaceport, tagging after him like a puppy, and how he'd grown to likeme until he became father, mother, and buddy all in one to me. And Iremembered, too, how his recommendation had finally made me a cadet.     My gaze wandered over the faces, but I couldn't find Charlie's. Itwasn't surprising. The      Lunar Lady     was in White Sands now, butliberties, as Charlie said, were as scarce as water on Mars.       It doesn't matter     , I told myself.     Then Mickey stiffened. I see 'em, Ben! There in the fifth row!     Usually Mickey was the same whether in a furnace-hot engine room or agarden party, smiling, accepting whatever the world offered. But now atenseness and an excitement had gripped even him. I was grateful thathe was beside me; we'd been a good team during those final months atthe Academy and I knew we'd be a good team in space. The Universe wasmighty big, but with two of us to face it together, it would be onlyhalf as big.     And then it seemed that all the proud faces were looking at us as if wewere gods. A shiver went through my body. Though it was daytime, I sawthe stars in my mind's vision, the great shining balls of silver, eachlike a voice crying out and pleading to be explored, to be touched bythe sons of Earth.       They expect a lot from us. They expect us to make a new kind ofcivilization and a better place out of Earth. They expect all this anda hell of a lot more. They think there's nothing we can't do.       I felt very small and very humble. I was scared. Damned scared.  "

        "Query": "How does Ben's upbringing impact his future in Spacemen Die at Home?",
        "Summary_1": "Ben becomes an orphan when he is just 4 years old. The first person he finds that he can trust and look up to is Charlie Taggart, who also happens to be a spaceman. From this point forward, Ben\u2019s life revolves around reaching his dream of going to the stars. When he sits in his best friend Mickey\u2019s childhood bedroom, he realizes that he never got to experience a \u201cnormal\u201d childhood, and this probably impacted his life\u2019s goals. The bedroom contains trophies, books, videos, and other treasures from typical childhoods. Ben sees that his life, filled with dorms, rules, and routines, completely lacked a warmth that he would have experienced if he had grown up with parents who loved him. All he had to rely on were his dreams for his future. He never got to experience the little moments of pleasure and togetherness that families have. Ben put all of his energy into becoming a spaceman because it would make him special, and it was something supremely important to work towards. He has no idea who he would be if his parents hadn\u2019t died. ",
        "Summary_2": "When Ben was a child, his parents were tragically killed in a rocket crash, leaving him orphaned and alone. Although the story doesn\u2019t reveal the exact circumstances or series of events, Ben eventually winds up in the hands of Charlie Taggert who looks after him as a father, mother, and brother. Charlie\u2019s devotion to space inspires a love for it in Ben and sets him on the path to interplanetary flight. Without Ben\u2019s parents dying, he may never have met Charlie or attended the U.S. Academy for Interplanetary Flight. \nAs well, his childhood prepared him for a life of solitude. He was not a family man by nature or by nurture, which made his ascent into space much easier. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Ben\u2019s parents both died in a strato-jet crash when he was four, leaving him with no mother and father. He realizes while he is an invited guest staying with Mickey and Laura at their parent\u2019s house after his graduation that they had a childhood different from his. Their childhood bedrooms and their upbringing was something that he all of a sudden felt he was lacking due to his experience growing up in dormitories with rules and regulations. He cites that his singular focus on his dream to be a spaceman didn\u2019t allow him to stop and notice the things that he felt he missed in his childhood.\nThis childhood of separation from family, and attaching himself to a pioneering lone-wolf spaceman (Charlie) after pestering him while he was a child in a spaceport, led Ben to romanticize and want a life of opportunity to be the first to see new planets. That dream, and the independence he had known since childhood ultimately led him to choose a life in space instead of settle into a family on Earth with Laura.\n",
        "Summary_4": "One major event in Ben's childhood changed his life in a large number of ways. His parents died in a rocket crash when he was young, which caused two immediate effects: Ben's lack of parental figures in his life, which spurred his interest in Charlie and causes his childhood to be irregular in other ways, and Ben's general interest in rockets. In this way, rockets have affected him at various stages in life: he would have lived a very different life if they didn't exist, because his parents would not have died, but he would not have had them to attach his big dreams to either, which means that maybe he would have been perfectly happy staying on Earth with Laura in another version of events. He had to clutch onto his dreams as he was growing up because everything he saw was structure. As he put it, it was a \"cold, automatic kind of life, the life of dormitories and routines and rules\". His dreams of going to the stars, then, were his way of escaping this structure. He would never have applied to the U.S. Academy of Interplanetary Flight otherwise. ",

Don't let a fool woman make a sucker out of you. Getout there on the      Odyssey     where you belong. We got a date on Mars,remember? At the      Space Rat     , just off Chandler Field on the GrandCanal.     That's what he'd say.     And yet I wanted you, Laura. I wanted to be with you, always.     Oh God, I moaned, what shall I do?   <doc-sep> The dead man was real. His name was Cobb. He was stout and flabby andabout forty and he hated spacemen.     His body was buried now\u2014probably in the silent gray wastes outsideLuna City. But he'd become a kind of invisible Siamese twin, as much apart of Ben as sight in his eyes.     Sometimes the image would be shuffling drunkenly beside him, its lipsspitting whiskey-slurred curses.     Again, its face would be a pop-eyed mask of surprise as Ben's fistthudded into its jaw. More often, the face would be frozen in thewhiteness of death. The large eyes would stare. Blood would tricklefrom a corner of the gaping mouth.     You can forget a living man. You can defeat him or submit to him orignore him, and the matter is over and done. You can't escape from amemory that has burned into your mind.     It had begun a week ago in Luna City. The flight from White Sands hadbeen successful. Ben, quietly and moderately, wanted to celebrate.He stopped alone in a rocketfront bar for a beer. The man named Cobbplopped his portly and unsteady posterior on the stool next to him.     Spacemen, he muttered, are getting like flies. Everywhere, all yousee's spacemen.     He was a neatly dressed civilian.     Ben smiled. If it weren't for spacemen, you wouldn't be here.     The name's Cobb. The man hiccoughed. Spacemen in their white monkeysuits. They think they're little tin gods. Betcha you think you're alittle tin god. He downed a shot of whiskey.     Ben stiffened. He was twenty-four and dressed in the white,crimson-braided uniform of the      Odyssey's     junior astrogation officer.He was three months out of the Academy at White Sands and the shininguniform was like a key to all the mysteries of the Universe.     He'd sought long for that key.   <doc-sep> He sank into the softness of his bed. As he turned over on his side,his gaze fell upon an object on a bureau in a far corner of the room.     He sat straight up, his chest heaving.     The object was a tri-dimensional photo of a rock-faced man in amerchant spaceman's uniform. He was a giant of a man with a neatlytrimmed      red beard     !     Ben stared at the photo for a long time. At length, he slipped intorestless sleep. Images of faces and echoes of words spun through hisbrain.     The dead man returned to him. Bloodied lips cursed at him. Glassy eyesaccused him. Somewhere were two lost children crying in the night.     And towering above him was a red-bearded man whose great hands reacheddown and beckoned to him. Ben crawled through the night on hands andknees, his legs numb and useless. The crying of the children was achilling wail in his ears.     His head rose and turned to the red-bearded man. His pleading voicescreamed out to him in a thick, harsh cackle. Yet even as he screamed,the giant disappeared, to be replaced by white-booted feet stompingrelentlessly toward him.     He awoke still screaming....     A night without darkness passed. Ben lay waiting for Maggie's return, aquestion already formed in his mind.     She came and at once he asked, Who is the man with the red beard?     She smiled. I was right then when I gave you that thumbnail biog. You      were     looking for him, weren't you?     Who is he?     She sat on the chair beside him.     My husband, she said softly.     He began to understand. And your husband needs an astrogator? That'swhy you saved me?     We need all the good men we can get.     Where is he?     She cocked her head in mock suspicion. Somewhere between Mercury andPluto. He's building a new base for us\u2014and a home for me. When hisship returns, I'll be going to him.     Why aren't you with him now?     He said unexplored space is no place for a woman. So I've beenstudying criminal reports and photos from the Interplanetary Bureau ofInvestigation and trying to find recruits like yourself. You know howwe operate?     He told her the tales he'd heard.  "

        "Query": "How does the dynamic between Ben and Laura evolve throughout the story of Spacemen Die at Home?",
        "Summary_1": "When Ben meets Laura, Mickey\u2019s sister, at his spaceman graduation, he feels an instant connection with her. He enjoys talking to her and wants to learn everything there is to know about her. Although he\u2019s happy to see Charlie Taggart, the closest thing he has to a family member, he chooses spending time with Laura and her family over spending time with Charlie alone. He can\u2019t help feeling drawn to her. \n\nAt first, Ben is completely oblivious to the feelings that Laura has for him, but after a walk under the stars together, he sees that she also sees a future with him. He has never before considered living on earth, getting married, owning a house, and settling for a \u201cboring\u201d life, but after she suggests that visiting the stars might just be like her trip to England, he wonders if she\u2019s right. Maybe he has hyped up space travel so much and it will end up being a disappointment. Maybe Mickey is onto something, and sacrificing a normal life on earth where living to old age is expected is not a choice he should give up so easily. Ben desperately wants to be with Laura. He loves her just as much as he loves the stars. \n\nHe spends forty incredible days with the woman of his dreams, but in the end, it\u2019s not enough to convince him to give up his lifelong dream of being a spaceman. Sure, he\u2019s uncomfortable with the amount of pressure that\u2019s put on him, and he recognizes that he will be risking his life every single day, but he can see that Charlie does not regret giving up the quiet homelife for the incredible adventures that await in space. Ben wants to be the first man to visit a planet or find a helpful mineral or create a useful colony, and his love for Laura cannot change his dreams.\n",
        "Summary_2": "At first, Ben is infatuated with Laura and the dark flecks in her eyes. They grow closer and closer together as Ben\u2019s stay in their house continues on. Between stargazing, conversing, swimming, and dancing, Ben and Laura quickly fell in love. When he asks her to marry him, however, things start to change. She says that she will marry Ben the teacher, but not Ben the spaceman. She does not want to be resigned to a life of solitude, fear, and separation. Ben is forced to make a choice then: Laura or his dreams of being an explorer. Although at first he decides to stay with Laura and become a teacher, he quickly changes his mind. In some ways, he has already married space and is as devoted to it as he was to Laura. He says in the end that he will always carry Laura and Charlie with him wherever he goes, though they may not be there with him physically. Although there was the potential for marriage, it seems that it was not meant to be. ",
        "Summary_3": "Ben and Laura\u2019s relationship moves quickly from the time they meet at Ben\u2019s graduation until he decides to become a spaceman (about forty days later).\nBen meets Laura at his graduation ceremony as part of the first class of the US Academy of Interplanetary Flight. Laura is the sister of his fellow spaceman, Mickey, whom he has become close with during training. Laura learns about Ben before she meets him from the stories told to her by her brother Mickey. When they have Ben and Charlie to their parents house for the weekend, Ben and Laura spend an evening after dinner watching for crimson-tailed continental rockets taking off from White Sands port. It was then that Ben knew Laura liked him.\nMickey invites Ben to stay with them until he decides what to take as his next opportunity - a berth on the Odyssey spaceship with the potential to go to Pluto or a safe job teaching astrogation at the academy. He stays forty days and forty nights. During this time, he falls in love with Laura and proposes to her.\nTheir relationship changes when Laura questions what a life would be like married to Ben as a spaceman. She has fears about bearing children with a spaceman since there was an example of one family having a \u201cmonster\u201d child after the father was exposed to radiation in space. She is worried about not seeing her husband for months or years at a time. Ben is torn between the woman he loves and the life he has been dreaming of since childhood to become a spaceman.\nUltimately Ben decides to be a spaceman and leaves Laura the wedding ring in Charlie\u2019s tin box (that was from Charlie\u2019s broken marriage after choosing life in space) as a token of his affection, and of the bittersweetness of having to leave behind a potentially happy life for his love of space. Perhaps Ben one day hopes to return and have Laura still waiting to marry him.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Laura is the sister of Ben's friend Mickey, whom he met at their graduation from The Academy. She invited Ben and Charlie to celebrate with her and Mickey after the ceremony, and gives away the fact that Mickey is no longer planning on signing up to be on a rocket with Ben, and wants a safer job. Ben realizes later that night that he and Laura have feelings for each other, so this is motivation for him to stay with Mickey's family while he sorts out what he wants to do. The two spend forty days together before Ben proposes to Laura, who has been trying to figure out what Ben wants for the entirety of their relationship. This is the entirety of their relationship as of the time of the story, starting with their realization of an attraction and an interest in each other and ending in a proposal (that was presumably accepted) and then a breaking-off of the relationship. They both want to be with one another, and Ben wants to get married no matter what, but Laura knows that he cannot live as a spaceman and as a caring and attentive husband to her, so he must choose. In this sense, Laura's outlook is very steady for their entire relationship, as she asked Ben on the first night they met if he really wanted to become a spaceman if it meant giving up everything he could have. A lot changes in the last day or so of Ben's stay with the family, as he receives news that Charlie passed away. It looking through Charlie's belongings that he recognizes that he can't have the space life and the meaningful personal connections he might want (at least of the sort he had with Laura at the time), which makes him come to a snap realization that he should accept the teaching job and stay on Earth. However, his eventually falls to his gut which tells him he would never be happy if he never tried to see the stars, and that his relationship with Laura has to end. Without Charlie's stories and belongings, Ben may not have realized that he would not be able to have the best of both worlds at the same time.\n",

It's hard to tell you, to make you understand, and that is why I amwriting this.     I looked through Charlie's box again, more carefully this time, readingthe old letters and studying the photographs. I believe now thatCharlie sensed my indecision, that he left these things so that theycould tell me what he could not express in words.     And among the things, Laura, I found a ring.     A wedding ring.     In that past he never talked about, there was a woman\u2014his wife.Charlie was young once, his eyes full of dreams, and he faced the samedecision that I am facing. Two paths were before him, but he tried totravel both. He later learned what we already know\u2014that there can beno compromise. And you know, too, which path he finally chose.     Do you know why he had to drug himself to watch me graduate? So hecould look at me, knowing that I would see the worlds he could neverlive to see. Charlie didn't leave just a few trinkets behind him. Heleft himself, Laura, for he showed me that a boy's dream can also be aman's dream.     He made his last trip to Luna when he knew he was going to die. Heavenknows how he escaped a checkup. Maybe the captain understood and waskind\u2014but that doesn't matter now.     Do you know      why     he wanted to reach Mars? Do you know why he didn'twant to die in the clean, cool air of Earth?     It was because he wanted to die nearer home. His home, Laura, was theUniverse, where the ship was his house, the crew his father, mother,brothers, the planets his children.     You say that the beauty of the other side of the mountain vanishesafter you reach it. But how can one ever be      sure     until the journey ismade? Could I or Charlie or the thousand before us bear to look upon astar and think,      I might have gone there; I could have been the first     ?     We said, too, that the life of a spaceman is lonely. Yet how could onebe lonely when men like Charlie roam the spaceways?     Charlie wanted me to himself that night after graduation. He wanted usto celebrate as spacemen should, for he knew that this would be hislast night on Earth. It might have seemed an ugly kind of celebrationto you, but he wanted it with all his heart, and we robbed him of it.     Because of these things, Laura, I will be gone in the morning. Explainthe best you can to Mickey and to your parents and Dean Dawson.     Right now I've got a date that I'm going to keep\u2014at a dingy stone cafeon Mars, the      Space Rat     , just off Chandler Field on the Grand Canal.     Stardust Charlie will be there; he'll go with me in memory to whateverpart of the Galaxy I may live to reach. And so will you, Laura.     I have two wedding rings with me\u2014his wife's ring and yours.    <doc-sep> I liked your folks, Laura. There was no star-hunger in them, of course.They were simple and solid and settled, like green growing things,deep-rooted, belonging to Earth. They were content with a home that wascool on this warm summer night, with a 'copter and a tri-dimensionalvideo, and a handsome automatic home that needed no servants orhousework.     Stardust Charlie was as comfortable as a Martian sand-monkey in ashower, but he tried courageously to be himself.     At the dinner table he stared glassily at nothing and grated, Only hitMars once, but I'll never forget the kid who called himself a medic.Skipper started coughing, kept it up for three days. Whoopin' cough,the medic says, not knowin' the air had chemicals that turned to acidin your lungs. I'd never been to Mars before, but I knew better'n that.Hell, I says, that ain't whoopin' cough, that's lung-rot.     That was when your father said he wasn't so hungry after all.     Afterward, you and I walked onto the terrace, into the moonlit night,to watch for crimson-tailed continental rockets that occasionallystreaked up from White Sands.     We gazed for a few seconds up into the dark sky, and then you said:Charlie is funny, isn't he? He's nice and I'm glad he's here, but he'ssort of funny.     He's an old-time spaceman. You didn't need much education in thosedays, just a lot of brawn and a quick mind. It took guts to be aspaceman then.     But he wasn't always a spaceman. Didn't he ever have a family?     I smiled and shook my head. If he had, he never mentioned it. Charliedoesn't like to be sentimental, at least not on the outside. As far asI know, his life began when he took off for the Moon with Everson.     You stared at me strangely, almost in a sacred kind of way. I knewsuddenly that you liked me, and my heart began to beat faster.     There was silence.     You were lovely, your soft hair like strands of gold, and there wereflecks of silver in your dark eyes. Somehow I was afraid. I had thefeeling that I shouldn't have come here.     You kept looking at me until I had to ask: What are you thinking,Laura?     You laughed, but it was a sad, fearful laugh. No, I shouldn't bethinking it. You'd hate me if I told you, and I wouldn't want that.     I could never hate you.     It\u2014it's about the stars, you said very softly. I understand why youwant to go to them. Mickey and I used to dream about them when we werekids. Of course I was a girl, so it was just a game to me. But once Idreamed of going to England. Oh, it was going to be so wonderful. Ilived for months, just thinking about it.     One summer we went. I had fun. I saw the old buildings and castles,and the spaceports and the Channel Tube. But after it was over, Irealized England wasn't so different from America. Places seem excitingbefore you get to them, and afterward they're not really.     I frowned. And you mean it might be the same with the stars? You thinkmaybe I haven't grown up yet?     Anxiety darkened your features. No, it'd be good to be a spaceman,to see the strange places and make history. But is it worth it? Is itworth the things you'd have to give up?     I didn't understand at first, and I wanted to ask, Give up      what     ?     Then I looked at you and the promise in your eyes, and I knew.     All through the years I'd been walking down a single, narrow path.     Government boarding school, the Academy, my eyes always upward and onthe stars.     Now I'd stumbled into a cross-roads, beholding a strange new path thatI'd never noticed before.       You can go into space     , I thought,      and try to do as much living inten years as normal men do in fifty. You can be like Everson, who diedin a Moon crash at the age of 36, or like a thousand others who lieburied in Martian sand and Venusian dust. Or, if you're lucky, likeCharlie\u2014a kind of human meteor streaking through space, eternallyalone, never finding a home.         Or there's the other path. To stay on this little prison of an Earthin cool, comfortable houses. To be one of the solid, rooted people witha wife and kids. To be one of the people who live long enough to growold, who awake to the song of birds instead of rocket grumblings, whofill their lungs with the clean rich air of Earth instead of poisonousdust.       I'm sorry, you said. I didn't mean to make you sad, Ben.     It's all right, I said, clenching my fists. You made sense\u2014a lot ofsense.  "

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in Birds of a Feather?",
        "Summary_1": "Sometime after the year 2903, the narrator of the story, Mr. Corrigan, is having a recruiting day on the planet of Ghryne, which he privately calls MacTavish IV. Mr. Corrigan owns a popular zoo on Earth called the Corrigan Institute - the only place where humans can see other species of the universe. He recruits alien life forms to exhibit at the zoo, and relatively quickly signs eleven new specimens onto his current 690 that are under contract at the institute on earth. This is a viable business because the World Congress declared Earth off-bounds to aliens in 2903, and the only way aliens can now go to Earth is as exhibits in this zoo.\n\nAliens make great sacrifices to come interview with Mr. Corrigan, as it seems he offers them a good deal. Those under contract are required to remain on exhibit for less than one-third of each day and get paid $50 Galactic a week, with expenses and transportation included. \n\nHe interviews many different creatures through the day, with some being noteworthy and some not as much, being ushered away quickly by Mr. Corrigan\u2019s assistant Stebbins. \n\nA Stortulian who claims his wife ran away to the Corrigan Institute, leaving him alone and unable to remarry due to his customs, pleads with Corrigan to let him go to Earth or at the very least to send her back. Mr. Corrigan is slightly frazzled by the story, but ultimately asks the Stortulian to leave, feeling sad and that he may commit suicide upon leaving and losing hope for his wife to return.\nVallo Heraal, Freeman of Kaller IV, was another notable interview. He stormed in and demanded to be signed to contract - and Mr. Corrigan preferred to make his own decisions. Herald felt insulted that the only four Kallerians at the institute were from the Clan Verdrokh, with no representation at all from his Clan Gursdrinn. Corrigan insisted he was unable to take another Kallerian, and apologized for insulting Clan Gursdrinn. This was enough to de-escalate physical violence, but Heraal was not pleased, and had to be escorted out of the room by Auchinleck and Ludlow who were summoned when Corrigan pushed a panic button under his desk.\nIn a surprise twist from what Corrigan had expected - the Stortulian to kill himself, and for Heraal to try to kill him - the opposite happens. Heraal storms in and stabs himself with his own sword, killing him instantly. The Stortulian returns and attempts to murder Mr. Corrigan, who is narrowly saved by being tackled by Gorb. The Ghrynian cops attempt to place a $100,000 fine on Corrigan for causing the death of a being (Heraal, who killed himself after being refused a contract). Gorb offers to get Corrigan out of the situation for $5000 and a contract to the institute, which is accepted.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Mr. Corrigan, of the Corrigan Institute of Morphological Science, is visiting MacTavish IV (Ghryne) in the Caledonia Cluster for a few days to hold interviews for new specimens to be featured in his zoo. All life forms, aside from Terra, were banned from ever visiting Earth since 2903, so the only way to get in is to be viewed for science, hence the zoo. The Institute has 690 specimens currently, encompassing 298 life-forms. He brings his men with him, Auchinleck, Stebbins, and Ludlow, to help calm the masses. His first applicant of the day walks in: a round creature with five eyed-arms and two legs. He introduces himself as Lawrence R. Fitzgerald of Regulus II, showing himself to be a Terraphile. Corrigan signs him on for half the normal pay and sends him on his way. A urisinoid from Aldebaran IX is next, but Corrigan has no need for another one. He signs a creature from Donovan\u2019s Planet, since they are such crowd-pleasers, and nine more. He also turns down at least 87 other life-forms, only of which, a Vegan, he feels remorse about. \nHis last specimen before lunch seems to be an Earthman pulling a con. He calls himself Ildwar Gorb and claims he\u2019s from Wazzenaxx XIII. Corrigan doesn\u2019t believe his tale and sends him out, though Gorb promises he\u2019ll change his mind before long. \nAfter lunch, trouble starts to arise. A Kallerian comes in and demands a place in his zoo, even though they already have four. Vallo Heraal of Clan Gursdrinn feels Corrigan has insulted his clan by only hiring members of Clan Verdrokh. Corrigan tries to calm him, but nothing can assuage his anger. He presses his trouble button, and his men come in and take Heraal away. \nA small alien runs into the room, sneaking past Stebbins, and begs to be brought to Earth so he can reunite with his soulmate, a previously hired Stortulian. She ran away from him when she got the opportunity to live on Earth, and, per Stortulian customs, the Stortulian was not allowed to remarry. \nCorrigan turns him down and continues on with his day until Gorb arrives again. He snuck past his men and offers himself as staff. Corrigan says no, but just then the Kallerian comes crashing in and commits hara-kiri, killing himself in front of the crowd. The police enter and claim Corrigan was the cause of his death since he had just filed a complaint against him. He can either be arrested or fined $100K. Next, the Stortulian walks back in and claims there is no reason to keep living. Unlike the Kallerian, he attempts to murder Corrigan by shooting his gun. However, Corrigan is shoved out of the way by Gorb. The Stortulian is arrested, and his actions are explained by Gorb. \nCorrigan decides to call his lawyer, but Gorb offers him a deal he can\u2019t refuse. Five thousand dollars as well as a contract, and he\u2019ll get Corrigan out of trouble. Corrigan agrees. \n",
        "Summary_3": "J.F. Corrigan is the proprietor of the Corrigan Institute of Morphological Science, a glorified Terran zoo that offers spectators a glimpse at several hundred species of non-terrestrial life forms from all over the galaxy. Corrigan prides himself on actually employing his exhibits rather than hunting them down. Because Earth had closed its borders in the 29th century to non-terrestrial visitors, getting a job at Corrigan's zoo is a popular way for non-terrestrials to visit the planet and make a decent living at the same time. Corrigan offers good pay, short hours, and cover transportation costs and other expenses. Although he is generous, he is also thrifty and not above conning the public in the name of advancing his business. Corrigan arrives at the planet Ghryne to interview potential new non-terrestrials for his exhibition assisted by his employees Stebbins, Auchinleck, and Ludlow. He interviews dozens of non-terrestrials from planets all over the galaxy, including Mr. Lawrence R. Fitzgerald, a self-described Terraphile from Regulus II who wants to go to Earth so badly he is willing to work for less pay. Next, Corrigan meets Ildwar Gorb, a non-terrestrial from Wazzenazz XIII who looks remarkably like a human and claims to communicate through telepathic projection. Because of this similarity, Corrigan suspects him of actually being an Earthman attempting to con him for a free ride back to Earth. He dismisses Gorb, who implores him to reconsider and promises to return. After Gorb leaves, a Kallerian named Vallo Heraal enters and demands Corrigan hire him immediately or he will cause trouble. Wary of the Kallerian's size and threats, Corrigan fingers the meshgun trigger hidden under his desk in case he needs to protect himself. After Auchinleck and Ludlow escort Heraal out of the room, a small Stortulian enters Corrigan's office and tells him he doesn't want to work for him necessarily, but he is seeking passage to Earth so he can be reunited with his wife, who is currently under Corrigan's employ at the Institute.  When Corrigan refuses, the Stortulian leaves, and Corrigan process several dozen more applicants. When Gorb reenters and offers to replace Stebbins due to his incompetent handling of the non-terrestrials waiting in line, Corrigan threatens to have him thrown out. At that moment, Heraal returns, brandishing a large sword, which he uses to kill himself in front of everyone. As Corrigan processes this turn of events, the Ghrynian police enter and charge Corrigan with Heraal's death which includes a $100,000 Galactic fine. Next, the Stortulian reenters and attempts to shoot Corrigan, who is saved by Gorb. Gorb offers to solve Corrigan's legal liability for the death of Heraal in exchange for $5,000 Galactic and a contract with the Corrigan Institute. Corrigan agrees to the arrangement, so long as Gorb upholds his end of the bargain first.",
        "Summary_4": "J. F. Corrigan of Earth\u2019s Corrigan Institute of Morphological Science is on the planet MacTavish IV (aka Ghryne by its natives) to recruit alien life forms as specimens for display in what is effectively a zoo. This is the only way aliens can visit Earth because in 2903 the World Congress declared Earth off-limits for non-terrestrials. Throughout the day, Corrigan interviews many colorful, interesting alien life forms, ultimately hiring about two dozen. His goal is to have a collection of at least one member of 500 different races and currently has 298. He rejects some applicants simply because he already has specimens of their type. One applicant, Gorb, looks and sounds like a human but claims to be from a plant named Wazzenazz XIII. Corrigan is convinced he is just a human and sends him on his way, but Gorb says he will be back to give Corrigan another chance. \nLater in the day, Corrigan has two troublesome interviews, the first with a distraught Kallerian named Vallo Heraal who wants to be hired because four other Kallerians have been hired from a different clan than his, and he feels his clan has been insulted. Corrigan apologizes for having unintentionally insulted Heraal\u2019s clan but explains that he doesn\u2019t need any more Kallerians now; he offers to give preference to Heraal\u2019s clan when there is a vacancy. Unappeased, Heraal warns Corrigan that he will be sorry, and Corrigan sends for members of his team to escort him out. Next, a squirrely-looking Stortulian slips in, exclaiming that he must speak with Corrigan. The Stortulian explains that he is there because his wife is on Earth in Corrigan\u2019s display. She left him because she wanted to go to Earth, and now he is lonely but forbidden by his customs to remarry. He doesn\u2019t want to be hired but just wants passage to Earth to persuade his wife to return home. Corrigan patiently tells the Stortulian he can\u2019t take him because it would be illegal. The Stortullian accepts defeat, saying he has no hope at all, and Corrigan has the distinct impression that the fellow is going to commit suicide. \nAt the end of the day, Gorb returns, asking Corrigan to hire him to work with his company. Heraal crashes in and tells Corrigan he has contacted the authorities and accused him of causing the death of a life-form before he kills himself. The police arrive to arrest Corrigan, but the Stortulian returns, again claiming his life isn\u2019t worth living and fires a shot at Corrigan who is saved by the swift action of Gorb who pushes him out of the way.\n",

Pigeons fly as a rule in formation and turn simultaneously, so thattheir wings all catch the sunlight at the same time.

He stood there shaking his head from side to side,stroking its feathers.     My speculations about this peculiar aerial traffic accident wereinterrupted by loud voices in the hallway. Since our building isusually very well behaved, I was astonished to hear what sounded likean incipient free-for-all, and among the angry voices I recognized thatof my neighbor, Nat, a very quiet guy who works on a newspaper and hasnever, to my knowledge, given wild parties, particularly in the lateafternoon.     You can't say a thing like that to me! I heard him shout. I tell youI got that deck this afternoon and they weren't opened till we startedto play!     Several other loud voices started at the same time.     Nobody gets five straight-flushes in a row!     Yeah, and only when you were dealer!     The tone of the argument was beginning to get ugly, and I opened thedoor to offer Nat help if he needed it. There were four men confrontinghim, evidently torn between the desire to make an angry exit and theimpulse to stay and beat him up. His face was furiously red and helooked stunned.

By some curious chance, they allwanted the same place in the sky to turn in, and several collided andfell.     The man was as surprised as I and went to one of the dazed birds andpicked it up. He stood there shaking his head from side to side,stroking its feathers.     My speculations about this peculiar aerial traffic accident wereinterrupted by loud voices in the hallway. Since our building isusually very well behaved, I was astonished to hear what sounded likean incipient free-for-all, and among the angry voices I recognized thatof my neighbor, Nat, a very quiet guy who works on a newspaper and hasnever, to my knowledge, given wild parties, particularly in the lateafternoon.     You can't say a thing like that to me! I heard him shout. I tell youI got that deck this afternoon and they weren't opened till we startedto play!     Several other loud voices started at the same time.     Nobody gets five straight-flushes in a row!     Yeah, and only when you were dealer!     The tone of the argument was beginning to get ugly, and I opened thedoor to offer Nat help if he needed it. There were four men confrontinghim, evidently torn between the desire to make an angry exit and theimpulse to stay and beat him up. His face was furiously red and helooked stunned.     Here! he said, holding out a deck of cards, For Pete's sake, look at'em yourselves if you think they're marked!     The nearest man struck them up from his hand. Okay, Houdini! Sothey're not marked! All I know is five straight....     His voice trailed away. He and the others stared at the scattered cardson the floor. About half were face down, as might be expected, and therest face up\u2014all red.  "

        "Query": "What is the fate of Gorb in the story Birds of a Feather?",
        "Summary_1": "Ildwar Gorb is a human-looking alien of the planet Wazzenazz XIII in the Crab Nebula. He claims to have never been within \u201ca dozen parsecs of Earth,\u201d but to look so human-like due to an evolutionary fluke. As he is interviewing with Mr. Corrigan, he says he is not actually speaking, but is a telepathic that communicates in symbols that are translated into the colloquial speech of the person he is interacting with.\nHe appeals to Mr. Corrigan to be exhibited as a specimen, but when Corrigan in unconvinced Gorb isn\u2019t just a regular human trying to fool him, he also tries to appeal to him to hire him as a member of his human staff. This is also a no, since Mr. Corrigan would be breaking the law to do so if he was an alien.\nGorb throws himself at Mr. Corrigan to tackle him and save his life from a murder attempt by the Stortulian. This gesture buys him enough goodwill for Corrigan to accept his offer to get him out of the trouble with the Ghrynian cops. He will do the job for $5000 and a contract to the Corrigan Institute - ultimately getting him what he wanted in the first place.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Gorb is a tall, thin humanoid or man with blue eyes and sandy hair. Despite being well-dressed and clean, Mr. Corrigan still claims he was shabby-looking. He introduces himself as Ildwar Gorb and claims he\u2019s from the planet Wazzenazz XIII. Mr. Corrigan immediately believes he is simply an Earthman who ran out of money and is trying to find passage home. However, Gorb continues on, claiming Wazzenazz XIII is home to a race of people similar to that of Earth, and that he doesn\u2019t speak English, he\u2019s in fact telepathic. He asks to be a specimen in Corrigan\u2019s zoo, but he refuses and sends him away. \nLater in the story, Gorb arrives again, having sneaked back his guard, and asks to join his staff if he can\u2019t be a specimen. Corrigan admits Stebbins is lack-luster, but still turns him down. After the Kallerian kills himself and Mr. Corrigan is charged guilty, Gorb bides his time and waits for his moment to step in. When the Stortulian arrives and attempts to murder Mr. Corrigan, Gorb saves his life by pushing him out of the way of the blast. Gorb explains the difference between Kallerian and Stortulian cultures to a wide-eyed Mr. Corrigan and once again offers his services. He claims he can get Mr. Corrigan out of the legal mess for only a $5,000 fee and a contract to be a specimen in his zoo. Mr. Corrigan hesitantly agrees. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Ildwar Gorb is a non-terrestrial from the planet Wazzenazz XIII, a small planet in the Crab Nebula. He is tall and thin with pale blue eyes, dirty-blond hair, and he strongly resembles an Earthman; he even speaks in Terran accents and has human-like teeth. When he first meets Corrigan, he is clean and well-dressed, but Corrigan notes he looks a bit shabby. Although he has never been anywhere close to Earth, he tells Corrigan his race is identical to the human race and speaks through telepathic projection, and he is looking for a job with Corrigan's zoo, which he calls a \"circus.\" Corrigan is attracted to his glib personality, but he denies him a job because he believes he is an Earthman attempting to con him for a free trip back to Earth. When Gorb leaves, he implores Corrigan to reconsider and tells him he will be back. After several dozen interviews pass, Gorb returns and asks if Corrigan will give him Stebbins' job considering his incompetence in handling bothersome aliens throughout the day. When Corrigan again refuses, Gorb stays in his office as Heraal kills himself in front of them, the Ghrynian policemen enter and charge Corrigan with his death, and the Stortulian comes back and tries to shoot Corrigan. However, Gorb tackles Corrigan to the floor to prevent him from being shot. He predicted the Stortulian's action as he is familiar with their species, and he offers to help Corrigan out of his liability for the death of Heraal in exchange for $5,000 Galactic and a contract with the Institute. ",
        "Summary_4": "Gorb is a human who wants to return to Earth but seemingly can\u2019t afford to do so. He knows how to take advantage of situations, so he tries three approaches to get Corrigan to hire him and take him to Earth. First, he poses as an alien species from a planet called Wazzenazz XIII in the Crab Nebula. Gord is tall and slender with blue eyes and dirty blond hair. He is neat and clean, but his appearance is somewhat shabby, suggesting he might be down on his luck. He claims his name is Ildwar Gorb and that he represents the only humanlike race in the galaxy beyond Earth. He tries to con Corrigan, explaining his humanlike appearance as an evolutionary fluke and his English as telepathic symbols that Corrigan translates into English. Corrigan sees through the ruse, though, and refuses to hire Gorb. Gorb leaves Corrigan\u2019s office saying he\u2019ll give Corrigan another chance.\n\tThat afternoon, Gorb returns to Corrigan\u2019s office, this time setting aside his alien story and presenting himself as a human applying for a place on Corrigan\u2019s staff. He points out that he is familiar with alien life-forms, having lived in the outworlds for half of his life. Gorb says that he would have been able to stop the aliens who unexpectedly entered Corrigan\u2019s office and suggests Corrigan fire Stebbins and hire him in his place. \n\tGorb is present when Heraal returns and commits suicide in Corrigan\u2019s office, and when the police arrive telling Corrigan that they are arresting him for contributing to the untimely death of an intelligent life-form, he hears the police pronounce Corrigan\u2019s penalty of either two years in prison or a fine of $100,000 Galactic. When the Stortulian arrives and tries to shoot Corrigan, Gorb anticipates his action and tackles Corrigan, knocking him to the floor, so that the Stortulian\u2019s shot misses. Afterward, Gorb demonstrates his knowledge of alien life when he explains that Stortulians despise suicide, and when a Stortulian believes someone has caused him trouble, he kills the person who caused the trouble. Gorb also tells Corrigan that he can help him get out of his situation for only $5,000 Galactic and a specimen contract. Corrigan decides that Gorb might be able to help him better than the Terran Consulate, so he accepts Gorb\u2019s offer contingent on Gorb\u2019s success of getting him out of his arrest and fine.\n",
        "Article": "I began to chuckle\u2014more of a tension-relieving snicker than afull-bodied laugh.     Funny, I said.     What is? asked the self-styled Wazzenazzian.     These aliens. Big blustery Heraal came in with murder in his eye andkilled      himself     , and the pint-sized Stortulian who looked so meek andpathetic damn near blew my head off. I shuddered. Thanks for thetackle job.     Don't mention it, Gorb said.     I glared at the Ghrynian police. Well? What are you waiting for? Takethat murderous little beast out of here! Or isn't murder against thelocal laws?     The Stortulian will be duly punished, replied the leader of theGhrynian cops calmly. But there is the matter of the dead Kallerianand the fine of\u2014     \u2014one hundred thousand dollars. I know. I groaned and turned toStebbins. Get the Terran Consulate on the phone, Stebbins. Have themsend down a legal adviser. Find out if there's any way we can get outof this mess with our skins intact.     Right, Chief. Stebbins moved toward the visiphone.     Gorb stepped forward and put a hand on his chest.     Hold it, the Wazzenazzian said crisply. The Consulate can't helpyou. I can.     You? I said.     I can get you out of this cheap.           How     cheap?     Gorb grinned rakishly. Five thousand in cash plus a contract as aspecimen with your outfit. In advance, of course. That's a heck of alot better than forking over a hundred grand, isn't it?     I eyed Gorb uncertainly. The Terran Consulate people probably wouldn'tbe much help; they tried to keep out of local squabbles unless theywere really serious, and I knew from past experiences that no officialsever worried much about the state of my pocketbook. On the other hand,giving this slyster a contract might be a risky proposition.     Tell you what, I said finally. You've got yourself a deal\u2014but ona contingency basis. Get me out of this and you'll have five grand andthe contract. Otherwise, nothing.     Gorb shrugged. What have I to lose?   <doc-sep> I don't mind conning the public from time to time, but I draw the lineat getting bilked myself. Look, friend, I'm busy, and I'm not knownfor my sense of humor.

He slammed the door and I let my grim expression relax into a smile.This was the best con switch yet\u2014an Earthman posing as an alien to geta job!     But I wasn't buying it, even if I could appreciate his clevernessintellectually. There's no such place as Wazzenazz XIII and there'sonly one human race in the Galaxy\u2014on Earth. I was going to need somereal good reason before I gave a down-and-out grifter a free tickethome.     I didn't know it then, but before the day was out, I would have thatreason. And, with it, plenty of trouble on my hands.   <doc-sep> About fifty more applicants were processed without a hitch. Then lifestarted to get complicated again.     Nine of the fifty were okay. The rest were unacceptable for one reasonor another, and they took the bad news quietly enough. The haul for theday so far was close to two dozen new life-forms under contract.     I had just about begun to forget about the incidents of the Kallerian'soutraged pride and the Stortulian's flighty wife when the door openedand the Earthman who called himself Ildwar Gorb of Wazzenazz XIIIstepped in.     How did      you     get in here? I demanded.     Your man happened to be looking the wrong way, he said cheerily.Change your mind about me yet?     Get out before I have you thrown out.     Gorb shrugged. I figured you hadn't changed your mind, so I've changedmy pitch a bit. If you won't believe I'm from Wazzenazz XIII, suppose Itell you that I      am     Earthborn, and that I'm looking for a job on yourstaff.     I don't care      what     your story is! Get out or\u2014     \u2014you'll have me thrown out. Okay, okay. Just give me half a second.Corrigan, you're no fool, and neither am I\u2014but that fellow of yoursoutside      is     . He doesn't know how to handle alien beings. How manytimes today has a life-form come in here unexpectedly?     I scowled at him. Too damn many.     You see? He's incompetent. Suppose you fire him, take me on instead.I've been living in the outworlds half my life; I know all there is toknow about alien life-forms. You can use me, Corrigan.     I took a deep breath and glanced all around the paneled ceiling ofthe office before I spoke. Listen, Gorb, or whatever your name is,I've had a hard day. There's been a Kallerian in here who just aboutthreatened murder, and there's been a Stortulian in here who's aboutto commit suicide because of me. I have a conscience and it's troublingme. But get this: I just want to finish off my recruiting, pack up andgo home to Earth. I don't want you hanging around here bothering me.I'm not looking to hire new staff members, and if you switch back toclaiming you're an unknown life-form from Wazzenazz XIII, the answer isthat I'm not looking for any of      those     either. Now will you scram or\u2014     The office door crashed open at that point and Heraal, the Kallerian,came thundering in. He was dressed from head to toe in glitteringmetalfoil, and instead of his ceremonial blaster, he was wieldinga sword the length of a human being. Stebbins and Auchinleck camedragging helplessly along in his wake, hanging desperately to his belt.     Sorry, Chief, Stebbins gasped. I tried to keep him out, but\u2014     Heraal, who had planted himself in front of my desk, drowned him outwith a roar. Earthman, you have mortally insulted the Clan Gursdrinn!  "

        "Query": "What can you tell me about the personality of Mr. Corrigan, the character in Birds of a Feather?",
        "Summary_1": "Mr. Corrigan was an impoverished carnival man in the Betelgeuse system prior to the year 2903, when the World Congress made it illegal for aliens to travel to the planet Earth. He seized a business opportunity to open Corrigan\u2019s Institute and collect aliens as scientific specimens, charging humans money to see them on Earth. This turned out to be a very lucrative business, and the zoo was very popular.\n\nMr. Corrigan tries to be fair to those he is interviewing, but is having an exceptionally hard day that is straining his patience. He does not allow himself to be swayed or pushed around by the sad stories (the Stortulian) or the demands (Heraal) of those in the interviews. He is resolved in his assumptions, and is truly shocked when the outcome of who would commit suicide and who would attempt to kill him is revealed.\n\n",
        "Summary_2": "Mr. Corrigan is an Earthman and the presumed founder of the Corrigan Institute of Morphological Science. He travels between planets in order to find rare specimens and bring them back to Earth to showcase in his zoo. He is a businessman at heart and does not feel much or any remorse when turning desperate aliens down. He is also a conman and easily scams Mr. Fitzgerald out of half of his pay after seeing how eager he was to experience Earth. Mr. Corrigan is always looking for the easy way out, but he\u2019s still aware of the dangers he faces. He keeps an array of weapons hidden beneath his desk in case of a violent specimen as well as a distress button if things were to go south. ",
        "Summary_3": "Mr. J.F. Corrigan is the proprietor of Corrigan's Institute of Morphological Science, a Terran zoo exhibiting non-terrestrial beings from around the universe. Starting out as an impoverished carnival man working in the Betelgeuse system, Corrigan had taken advantage of the isolationism of the late 29th century to establish his zoo and become a successful businessman. Corrigan claims to not want to exploit the non-terrestrials he employs as displays in his zoo, but he also doesn't want to pay them top dollar for their services. He prides himself on not hunting non-terrestrial and instead prefers to attract them by offering good pay, short hours, expenses, and transportation costs; in addition, he calls himself a \"man of principles\" and advertises about the thrill of show business and romance of life on Earth. Because Corrigan is willing to con the public--he calls himself \"a straightforward double-dealer\"--he believes he understands a con when he sees one, which is why he initially rejects Gorb's interview for a job. Corrigan is used to dealing with species from all over the galaxy, and he is prepared for trouble, so he has a meshgun trigger concealed below his desk and never allows himself to be bullied. In case he needs back up, he also employs Stebbins, who manages the line of non-terrestrials for Corrigan to interview, as well as Auchinleck and Ludlow. One of Corrigan's driving principles in dealing with non-terrestrials is to never make a business decision based upon sentiment as demonstrated by his dealings with the Stortulian. However, this interaction shows that he does feel empathy for those affected by his decisions.",
        "Summary_4": "J.F. Corrigan is a businessman and owner of the Corrigan Institute of Morphological Science. An astute businessman who also manipulates and uses others, he has built a lucrative \u201cinstitute\u201d that is really just a zoo that exhibits odd-looking aliens. Before his current position, Corrigan was a lowly carnival man in the Betelgeuse system. After the World Congress ruled Terra off-limits for aliens in 2903, Corrigan concocted his business plan. His goal is to display representatives of 500 extraterrestrial species. Corrigan can \u201cread\u201d his interviewees and take advantage of them for his own benefit. For example, when he realizes how eager Mr. Fitzgerald is to see Earth, he hires him for half of what he usually pays, knowing that Fitzgerald\u2019s eagerness will prevent him from realizing the offer takes advantage of him. \n\tThroughout the day of interviews, Corrigan assesses the applicants in terms of their value to him. While he doesn\u2019t mind taking advantage of them, he doesn\u2019t go so far as to cheat them. He is a bit of a con-man himself, hiring Mr. Fitz for half his going rate and placating Heraal with a less-than-heartfelt apology and promise to give members of his clan preference the next time they need to hire a Kallerian. Yet he won\u2019t do anything that blatantly breaks the law such as transporting a Stortulian to Earth when the alien isn\u2019t one of his hirees. He has a limited conscience; when he fears that the Stortulian will commit suicide, he feels bad about it, but he also doesn\u2019t do anything to prevent it. His pragmatism and business acumen override his emotions, preventing him from caving to the creature\u2019s requests, even if it means the creature will commit suicide. Corrigan is also sharp enough to spot a con; he recognizes Gorb for what he is: an Earthman using any means possible to obtain a paid trip to Earth. When Gorb comes across as glib and appealing despite his preposterous story, Corrigan recognizes the man\u2019s similarity to himself. Corrigan acknowledges that he is a double-dealer yets describes himself as a man of principles. Because he is a con man, he is cynical of others. Corrigan is also a manipulator who says what others want to hear (such as calling the planet Ghryne by its native name) because he knows this is a way to win their trust.\n\tCorrigan likes to think of himself as a man who has principles, but some of those principles are the ones that ensure good business decisions rather than the values regarding what is right or wrong. He also thinks of himself as a man with a conscience who doesn\u2019t exploit beings, but that is exactly what he does. He believes that because he pays his employees and they are volunteering to be placed on exhibit, he isn\u2019t exploiting them.\n\n",

It was our first day of recruiting on the planet, and the alienlife-forms had lined up for hundreds of feet back from my rentedoffice. As I came down the block from the hotel, I could hear and seeand smell them with ease.     My three staff men, Auchinleck, Stebbins and Ludlow, walked shieldwisein front of me. I peered between them to size the crop up. The alienscame in every shape and form, in all colors and textures\u2014and all ofthem eager for a Corrigan contract. The Galaxy is full of bizarrebeings, but there's barely a species anywhere that can resist the oldexhibitionist urge.     Send them in one at a time, I told Stebbins. I ducked into theoffice, took my place back of the desk and waited for the procession tobegin.     The name of the planet was MacTavish IV (if you went by the officialTerran listing) or Ghryne (if you called it by what its people wereaccustomed to calling it). I thought of it privately as MacTavish IVand referred to it publicly as Ghryne. I believe in keeping the localshappy wherever I go.

Auchinleck said unctuously, The firstapplicant is ready to see you, sir.     Send him, her or it in.     The door opened and a timid-looking life-form advanced toward me onnervous little legs. He was a globular creature about the size of abig basketball, yellowish-green, with two spindly double-kneed legs andfive double-elbowed arms, the latter spaced regularly around his body.There was a lidless eye at the top of his head and five lidded ones,one above each arm. Plus a big, gaping, toothless mouth.       His voice was a surprisingly resounding basso. You are Mr. Corrigan?     That's right. I reached for a data blank.

Let me have that again, please?     Certainly. My name is Lawrence R. Fitzgerald. The 'R' stands forRaymond.     Of course, that's not the name you were born with.     The being closed his eyes and toddled around in a 360-degree rotation,remaining in place. On his world, that gesture is the equivalent ofan apologetic smile. My Regulan name no longer matters.

There is a waiting room outside the office, and applicants are buzzed in by Corrigan\u2019s assistant.\n\nOn this planet, there is a strong desire for aliens to want to go on exhibit on Earth. Mr. Corrigan profits from having them on display, and is willing to go through long and stressful interview days to hand select his specimens. His desire is to have at least 500 different alien races in his collection.\n\nThere is frequent reference to the location of the Corrigan Institute on Earth, though it is never visited in the story.

        "Summary_2": "Birds of a Feather by Robert Silverberg takes place on what is commonly called Ghryne, or it\u2019s more formal name MacTavish IV. This planet is in the Caledonia cluster and currently the home of Mr. Corrigan\u2019s interviews. The Caledonia cluster is one of the many crossroads of interstellar travel, so it features many specimens from a variety of planets. The story mostly takes place in Mr. Corrigan\u2019s office, featuring a desk and a few chairs for his specimens to sit in. He hides weapons beneath his desk in case of a scary situation, as well as a distress button. ",
        "Summary_3": "The story takes place in the 30th century primarily on Ghryne, whose official Terran name is MacTavish IV, a planet in the Caledonia Cluster, which includes other planets such as Aldebaran IX, Regulus II, Donovan's Planet, Stortul XII, and more. Ghryne is in the heart of the Caledonia Cluster, where the interstellar crossroads meet, and Mr. Corrigan holds his interviews here for his Corrigan Institute from Thirdday to Fifthday of Tenthmonth. Having been declared off-limits for non-terrestrial beings by the World Congress in 2903, Earth is now an exclusive place to be, which heightens the appeal and romance of working and visiting there. The Corrigan Institute of Morphological Science is a Terran zoo that exhibits non-terrestrial beings from all over the universe. With 690 specimens representing 298 different intelligent life-forms, the ultimate goal of the zoo is to present at least one member of at least 500 different races.

        "Summary_4": "The story takes place sometime in the early 30th century as Corrigan\u2019s ad announces this recruiting trip is his last in the Caledonia Cluster until 2937. Days and months are named by their sequence in the week or year, hence, Thirdday, Fifthday, and Tenmonth. In 2903, the World Congress ruled that aliens were forbidden on Earth unless they were there as a specimen of a scientific collection. This exception is what allows Corrigan to conduct his lucrative business. Most of the story is set In the rented Corrigan office on the planet MacTavis (IV), or Ghryne according to its residents. All of the action takes place on this planet, although there are a few references to Earth. MacTavis (IV) is an ideal planet for Corrgan\u2019s interviews since this planet is at the interstellar crossroads, making it easily accessible for aliens from across the Caledonia Cluster to respond to Corrigan\u2019s ad for alien species to be transported to Earth for display. The planet has the features of a civilization, including city districts organized into blocks, office buildings, and hotels. There is a police department that quickly responds to emergencies and has set penalties for infractions against the law. Ghryne uses the Galactic monetary system. Corrigan\u2019s office has a modern executive set-up where he works in an inner office while his assistants manage his appointments. He has a button he can push to alert his team that they need to escort someone away from his office. Corrigan also has a meshgun mounted under his desk that he can fire in the event of an emergency.  \n",

It was our first day of recruiting on the planet, and the alienlife-forms had lined up for hundreds of feet back from my rentedoffice. As I came down the block from the hotel, I could hear and seeand smell them with ease.     My three staff men, Auchinleck, Stebbins and Ludlow, walked shieldwisein front of me. I peered between them to size the crop up. The alienscame in every shape and form, in all colors and textures\u2014and all ofthem eager for a Corrigan contract. The Galaxy is full of bizarrebeings, but there's barely a species anywhere that can resist the oldexhibitionist urge.     Send them in one at a time, I told Stebbins. I ducked into theoffice, took my place back of the desk and waited for the procession tobegin.     The name of the planet was MacTavish IV (if you went by the officialTerran listing) or Ghryne (if you called it by what its people wereaccustomed to calling it). I thought of it privately as MacTavish IVand referred to it publicly as Ghryne. I believe in keeping the localshappy wherever I go.     Through the front window of the office, I could see our big gay tridimsign plastered to a facing wall: WANTED\u2014EXTRATERRESTRIALS!

F.Corrigan will hold interviews in person on Ghryne from Thirdday toFifthday of Tenmonth. His last visit to the Caledonia Cluster until2937, so don't miss your chance! Hurry! A life of wonder and richescan be yours!     <doc-sep> There, I thought to myself, is that one chance in a million we hearabout, and picked up the pencil. I turned back to my novel and dranksome of the highball in hopes of inspiration and surcease from themuggy heat, but nothing came. I went back and read the whole chapterto try to get a forward momentum, but came to a dead stop at the lastsentence.     Damn the heat, damn the pencil, damn Madison Avenue and advertising.My drink was gone and I went back to the kitchen and read Molly'snotes again to see if they would be like a letter from her. I noticedone that I had missed, pinned to the door of the dumbwaiter: Garbagepicked up at 6:30 AM so the idea is to Put it Here the Night Before. Ilove you. What can you do when the girl loves you?     I made another drink and went and stared out of the living room windowat the roof opposite. The Sun was out again and a man with a stick wasexercising his flock of pigeons. They wheeled in a circle, hoping to beallowed to perch, but were not allowed to.     Pigeons fly as a rule in formation and turn simultaneously, so thattheir wings all catch the sunlight at the same time. I was thinkingabout this decorative fact when I saw that as they were making a turn,they seemed to bunch up together. By some curious chance, they allwanted the same place in the sky to turn in, and several collided andfell.     The man was as surprised as I and went to one of the dazed birds andpicked it up. He stood there shaking his head from side to side,stroking its feathers.     My speculations about this peculiar aerial traffic accident wereinterrupted by loud voices in the hallway. Since our building isusually very well behaved, I was astonished to hear what sounded likean incipient free-for-all, and among the angry voices I recognized thatof my neighbor, Nat, a very quiet guy who works on a newspaper and hasnever, to my knowledge, given wild parties, particularly in the lateafternoon.     You can't say a thing like that to me! I heard him shout. I tell youI got that deck this afternoon and they weren't opened till we startedto play!     Several other loud voices started at the same time.     Nobody gets five straight-flushes in a row!     Yeah, and only when you were dealer!     The tone of the argument was beginning to get ugly, and I opened thedoor to offer Nat help if he needed it. There were four men confrontinghim, evidently torn between the desire to make an angry exit and theimpulse to stay and beat him up. His face was furiously red and helooked stunned.     Here! he said, holding out a deck of cards, For Pete's sake, look at'em yourselves if you think they're marked!     The nearest man struck them up from his hand. Okay, Houdini! Sothey're not marked! All I know is five straight....     His voice trailed away. He and the others stared at the scattered cardson the floor. About half were face down, as might be expected, and therest face up\u2014all red.   <doc-sep> The leader of the three, a hawk-faced man with a heavy beard,unlimbered his rifle. He fingered it, frowning ferociously.     Have no fear, Retief said, smiling graciously. He who comes as aguest enjoys perfect safety.     A smooth-faced member of the threesome barked an oath and leveled hisrifle at Retief.     Youth is the steed of folly, Retief said. Take care that thebeardless one does not disgrace his house.     The leader whirled on the youth and snarled an order. He lowered therifle, muttering. Blackbeard turned back to Retief.     Begone, interlopers, he said. You disturb the goats.     Provision is not taken to the houses of the generous, Retief said.May the creatures dine well ere they move on.     Hah! The goats of the Aga Kaga graze on the lands of the Aga Kaga.The leader edged his horse close, eyed Retief fiercely. We welcome nointruders on our lands.     To praise a man for what he does not possess is to make him appearfoolish, Retief said. These are the lands of the Boyars. But enoughof these pleasantries. We seek audience with your ruler.     You may address me as 'Exalted One', the leader said. Now dismountfrom that steed of Shaitan.     It is written, if you need anything from a dog, call him 'sir',Retief said. I must decline to impute canine ancestry to a guest. Nowyou may conduct us to your headquarters.     Enough of your insolence! The bearded man cocked his rifle. I couldblow your heads off!     The hen has feathers, but it does not fly, Retief said. We haveasked for escort. A slave must be beaten with a stick; for a free man,a hint is enough.     You mock me, pale one. I warn you\u2014     Only love makes me weep, Retief said. I laugh at hatred.     Get out of the car!     Retief puffed at his cigar, eyeing the Aga Kagan cheerfully. The youthin the rear moved forward, teeth bared.     Never give in to the fool, lest he say, 'He fears me,' Retief said.     I cannot restrain my men in the face of your insults, the bearded AgaKagan roared. These hens of mine have feathers\u2014and talons as well!     When God would destroy an ant, he gives him wings, Retief said.Distress in misfortune is another misfortune.     The bearded man's face grew purple.     Retief dribbled the ash from his cigar over the side of the car.     Now I think we'd better be getting on, he said briskly. I've enjoyedour chat, but we do have business to attend to.     The bearded leader laughed shortly. Does the condemned man beg for theaxe? he enquired rhetorically. You shall visit the Aga Kaga, then.Move on! And make no attempt to escape, else my gun will speak you abrief farewell.     The horsemen glowered, then, at a word from the leader, took positionsaround the car. Georges started the vehicle forward, following theleading rider. Retief leaned back and let out a long sigh.     That was close, he said. I was about out of proverbs.     You sound as though you'd brought off a coup, Georges said. From theexpression on the whiskery one's face, we're in for trouble. What washe saying?     Just a routine exchange of bluffs, Retief said. Now when we getthere, remember to make your flattery sound like insults and yourinsults sound like flattery, and you'll be all right.     These birds are armed. And they don't like strangers, Georges said.Maybe I should have boned up on their habits before I joined thisexpedition.     Just stick to the plan, Retief said. And remember: a handful of luckis better than a camel-load of learning.  "

A boy catches him and brings him to a table that is close in the shadows after passing through a narrow aisle and a white-uniformed officer. Sitting at the table, Ben tells himself that he needs to find the man with red beard. He wants to escape from the images of a dead man. Later we learn that Ben murdered this man. Ben was celebrating in a bar when Cobb, a man in the bar insulted him. While Ben tries to reason with him, he expressed his dissatisfaction about spacemen. Ben has always wanted to be spacemen. He moved down three stools but the drunk man won\u2019t stop. Thus he tried to leave. But he continued and called him a sucker. Getting furious, Ben hits the man.

She saves him because he is an astrogator and a good man. ",
        "Summary_3": "Spaceman Ben Curtis walks into the Blast Inn, a dive bar in the Venusian Hoover City. He is approached by a young Martian boy, who brings him to a table where a Martian orchestra plays aside them. In the bar, Ben is anxious and paranoid, particularly upon noticing a few Hoover City police officers. While he sits, Ben is unable to shake the image of a dead man next to him, who is a man named Cobb. Prior to Ben's arrival to Venus, he had stepped into a bar in Luna City, where an intoxicated Cobb was rambling about spacemen and how he despises them. Out of rage and personal offense, Ben punched Cobb in the chin, who died on impact after falling. Ben immediately fled to Venus in search of a red-bearded giant, the leader of a renegade space crew, who was his only hope in survival and job security after the murder. Still seated at the table, the Martian boy continues prodding Ben, who gives him a coin to shoo him off. He soon notices the space policemen from before closing in on him, raising weapons, and he attempts to escape the bar but is shot. Becoming unconscious, Ben hears the voice of a woman, who leads him out of the exit and helps him escape. He then awakes, unable to see clearly, but being cared for and fed. After nine days, he is able to see the woman clearly, who introduces herself as Maggie, and she tells him that they are no longer in Hoover City. She then discloses all the information she has on Ben, including his desire to find the red-bearded man. Ben asks her if Cobb had a wife and kids, which she confirms. As Ben scans the room, he notices a photo of the red-bearded man, and he slips into sleep, where he is again haunted by visions of Cobb. Ben asks Maggie how she knows the man, and she reveals that he is her husband, and that they saved Ben because they were in need of an astrogator. Maggie tells him about the renegade crew, and how they plan on relocating to an asteroid to avoid the authorities. Ben is overwhelmed and fearful of the prospect, but Maggie encourages him to get rest, and he reflects on his future and his duty.",
        "Summary_4": "The story begins with Ben Curtis, an officer of the Space Corps and astrogator, leaving the Blast Inn on Venus. When he gets to the Venusian gin mill, a Martian kid tries to sell him various things to pique his interest. Ben indicates that he is not interested in any of the offers and the kid eventually leads him to a table that is partially hidden. The location of his table is intentional because he does not want to be seen. Ben becomes deep in thought at the table, intent on finding a man described as having a red beard. \n\nWhile at the table, he also thinks about the events that transpired over the last week when he arrived in Luna City from White Sands. Ben had gone to a bar to celebrate his arrival to Luna City when Cobb drunkenly accosted him. Cobb purposefully tried to anger Ben and eventually was successful in doing so after a particularly poignant threat. In a quick and anger-filled response, Ben struck Cobb causing Cobb to crack his head against the edge of the bar and die. Ben flew to Venus in response to the incident, which explains how he currently arrived in a Venusian bar. \n\nHis thoughts are interrupted when he notices policemen entering the bar. The police quickly find Ben and begin to use deadly neuro-pistols. He begins to run and is eventually hit by one of the blasts from the neuro-pistols. As he realizes he is losing consciousness, an unknown pair of hands guided him towards a different exit. Ben passes out from the blast and wakes up in a room. For 9+ days, he goes in and out of sleep in this room while he recovers from his injuries. Maggie, the woman who helped him escape, is the one helping him recover from his injuries. She knows a lot of information about him and his background. \n\nWhile still recovering, Ben notices that on one side of the bed, there is a picture on a bureau in the far corner of the room that shows a portrait of a red-bearded man. He gets really excited at this new revelation. He asks Maggie about the red-bearded man and she confesses that he is her husband and then explains what he does and why she brought Ben with her. Jacob\u2019s group needs an astrogator and want Ben to join them. While Maggie shows that she would be confused if Ben chose not to join the group, she seems to truly be concerned with his recovery. \n\nWhen Maggie leaves the room, Ben reflects on words found in a book from his childhood that talk about the morals of a Space Officer. He acknowledges how very few are able to get the job in the SpaceCorps. The story ends with implications that Ben will choose his moral values and choose not to join Jacob\u2019s group. \n",

Ben Curtis eased his pale, gaunt body through the open doorway of theBlast Inn, the dead man following silently behind him.     His fear-borne gaze traveled into the dimly illumined Venusian ginmill. The place was like an evil caldron steaming with a brew whoseingredients had been culled from the back corners of three planets.     Most of the big room lay obscured behind a shimmering veil of tobaccosmoke and the sweet, heavy fumes of Martian Devil's Egg. Here andthere, Ben saw moving figures. He could not tell if they were Earthmen,Martians or Venusians.     Someone tugged at his greasy coat. He jumped, thinking absurdly that itwas the dead man's hand.           Coma esta, senor?      a small voice piped.       Speken die Deutsch?Desirez-vous d'amour? Da? Nyet?          Ben looked down.     The speaker was an eager-eyed Martian boy of about ten. He was likea red-skinned marionette with pipestem arms and legs, clad in a tornskivvy shirt and faded blue dungarees.     I'm American, Ben muttered.     Ah,      buena     ! I speak English      tres     fine,      senor     . I have Martianfriend, she      tres     pretty and      tres     fat. She weigh almost eightypounds,      monsieur     . I take you to her,      si     ?     Ben shook his head.   <doc-sep> What is it you wish? he barked. I understood in my discussions withthe other ... ah ... civilian there'd be no further need for theseirritating conferences.     I've just learned you're placing more students abroad, Mr. Gulver. Howmany this time?     Two thousand.     And where will they be going?     Croanie. It's all in the application form I've handed in. Your job isto provide transportation.     Will there be any other students embarking this season?     Why ... perhaps. That's Boge's business. Gulver looked at Retief withpursed lips. As a matter of fact, we had in mind dispatching anothertwo thousand to Featherweight.     Another under-populated world\u2014and in the same cluster, I believe,Retief said. Your people must be unusually interested in that regionof space.     If that's all you wanted to know, I'll be on my way. I have matters ofimportance to see to.     After Gulver left, Retief called Miss Furkle in. I'd like to have abreak-out of all the student movements that have been planned under thepresent program, he said. And see if you can get a summary of whatMEDDLE has been shipping lately.     Miss Furkle compressed her lips. If Mr. Magnan were here, I'm surehe wouldn't dream of interfering in the work of other departments.I ... overheard your conversation with the gentleman from the CroanieLegation\u2014     The lists, Miss Furkle.     I'm not accustomed, Miss Furkle said, to intruding in mattersoutside our interest cluster.     That's worse than listening in on phone conversations, eh? But nevermind. I need the information, Miss Furkle.     Loyalty to my Chief\u2014     Loyalty to your pay-check should send you scuttling for the materialI've asked for, Retief said. I'm taking full responsibility. Nowscat.     The buzzer sounded. Retief flipped a key. MUDDLE, Retief speaking....     Arapoulous's brown face appeared on the desk screen.     How-do, Retief. Okay if I come up?     Sure, Hank. I want to talk to you.     In the office, Arapoulous took a chair. Sorry if I'm rushing you,Retief, he said. But have you got anything for me?     Retief waved at the wine bottles. What do you know about Croanie?     Croanie? Not much of a place. Mostly ocean. All right if you likefish, I guess. We import our seafood from there. Nice prawns in monsoontime. Over a foot long.     You on good terms with them?     Sure, I guess so. Course, they're pretty thick with Boge.     So?     Didn't I tell you? Boge was the bunch that tried to take us over herea dozen years back. They'd've made it too, if they hadn't had a lot ofbad luck. Their armor went in the drink, and without armor they're easygame.     Miss Furkle buzzed. I have your lists, she said shortly.     Bring them in, please.   <doc-sep> Ben stiffened. And that's why you want me for an astrogator.     Maggie rose, her eyes wistful. If you want to come\u2014and if you getwell. She looked at him strangely.     Suppose\u2014 He fought to find the right words. Suppose I got well anddecided not to join Jacob. What would happen to me? Would you let mego?     Her thin face was criss-crossed by emotion\u2014alarm, then bewilderment,then fear. I don't know. That would be up to Jacob.     He lay biting his lip, staring at the photo of Jacob. She touched hishand and it seemed that sadness now dominated the flurry of emotionthat had coursed through her.     The only thing that matters, really, she murmured, is your walkingagain. We'll try this afternoon. Okay?     Okay, he said.     When she left, his eyes were still turned toward Jacob's photo.     He was like two people, he thought.     Half of him was an officer of the Space Corps. Perhaps one singlestarry-eyed boy out of ten thousand was lucky enough to reach that goal.     He remembered a little picture book his mother had given him when shewas alive. Under the bright pictures of spacemen were the captions:     A Space Officer Is Honest A Space Officer Is Loyal. A SpaceOfficer Is Dutiful.     Honesty, loyalty, duty. Trite words, but without those concepts,mankind would never have broken away from the planet that held itprisoner for half a million years.     Without them, Everson, after three failures and a hundred men dead,would never have landed on the Moon twenty-seven years ago.  "

Most of the big room lay obscured behind a shimmering veil of tobaccosmoke and the sweet, heavy fumes of Martian Devil's Egg. Here andthere, Ben saw moving figures. He could not tell if they were Earthmen,Martians or Venusians.     Someone tugged at his greasy coat. He jumped, thinking absurdly that itwas the dead man's hand.           Coma esta, senor?      a small voice piped.       Speken die Deutsch?Desirez-vous d'amour? Da? Nyet?          Ben looked down.     The speaker was an eager-eyed Martian boy of about ten. He was likea red-skinned marionette with pipestem arms and legs, clad in a tornskivvy shirt and faded blue dungarees.     I'm American, Ben muttered.     Ah,      buena     ! I speak English      tres     fine,      senor     . I have Martianfriend, she      tres     pretty and      tres     fat. She weigh almost eightypounds,      monsieur     . I take you to her,      si     ?     Ben shook his head.   <doc-sep> Ben stiffened. And that's why you want me for an astrogator.     Maggie rose, her eyes wistful. If you want to come\u2014and if you getwell. She looked at him strangely.     Suppose\u2014 He fought to find the right words. Suppose I got well anddecided not to join Jacob. What would happen to me? Would you let mego?     Her thin face was criss-crossed by emotion\u2014alarm, then bewilderment,then fear. I don't know. That would be up to Jacob.     He lay biting his lip, staring at the photo of Jacob. She touched hishand and it seemed that sadness now dominated the flurry of emotionthat had coursed through her.     The only thing that matters, really, she murmured, is your walkingagain. We'll try this afternoon. Okay?     Okay, he said.     When she left, his eyes were still turned toward Jacob's photo.     He was like two people, he thought.     Half of him was an officer of the Space Corps. Perhaps one singlestarry-eyed boy out of ten thousand was lucky enough to reach that goal.     He remembered a little picture book his mother had given him when shewas alive. Under the bright pictures of spacemen were the captions:     A Space Officer Is Honest A Space Officer Is Loyal. A SpaceOfficer Is Dutiful.     Honesty, loyalty, duty. Trite words, but without those concepts,mankind would never have broken away from the planet that held itprisoner for half a million years.     Without them, Everson, after three failures and a hundred men dead,would never have landed on the Moon twenty-seven years ago.   <doc-sep> She nodded. There are quite a few of us now\u2014about a thousand\u2014and adozen ships. Our base used to be here on Venus, down toward the Pole.The dome we're in now was designed and built by us a few years agoafter we got pushed off Mars. We lost a few men in the construction,but with almost every advance in space, someone dies.     Venus is getting too civilized. We're moving out and this dome is onlya temporary base when we have cases like yours. The new base\u2014I mightas well tell you it's going to be an asteroid. I won't say which one.     Don't get the idea that we're outlaws. Sure, about half our group iswanted by the Bureau, but we make honest livings. We're just peoplelike yourself and Jacob.     Jacob? Your husband?     She laughed. Makes you think of a Biblical character, doesn't it?Jacob's anything but that. And just plain 'Jake' reminds one of agrizzled old uranium prospector and he isn't like that, either.     She lit a cigarette. Anyway, the wanted ones stay out beyond thefrontiers. Jacob and those like him can never return to Earth\u2014not evento Hoover City\u2014except dead. The others are physical or psycho rejectswho couldn't get clearance if they went back to Earth. They knownothing but rocketing and won't give up. They bring in our ships tofrontier ports like Hoover City to unload cargo and take on supplies.     Don't the authorities object?     Not very strongly. The I. B. I. has too many problems right here tosearch the whole System for a few two-bit crooks. Besides, we carrycargoes of almost pure uranium and tungsten and all the stuff that'sscarce on Earth and Mars and Venus. Nobody really cares whether itcomes from the asteroids or Hades. If we want to risk our lives miningit, that's our business.     She pursed her lips. But if they guessed how strong we are or that wehave friends planted in the I. B. I.\u2014well, things might be different.There probably would be a crackdown.     Ben scowled. What happens if there      is     a crackdown? And what will youdo when Space Corps ships officially reach the asteroids? They can'tignore you then.     Then we move on. We dream up new gimmicks for our crates and take themto Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto. In time, maybe, we'll bepushed out of the System itself. Maybe it won't be the white-suitedboys who'll make that first hop to the stars. It      could     be us, youknow\u2014if we live long enough. But that Asteroid Belt is murder.

Right now the man is exploring new parts of space and is building a new base. The team is huge and the base has moved from Venus towards the Pole for a while, planning to move to an asteroid later. Half the team are wanted but their livings are still honest. The man is banned from Earth and brings cargo to the frontiers and the authorities close their eyes. They want to go further than the System itself and need a good astrogator like Ben out there.",
        "Summary_2": "The red-bearded man is named Jacob. He is said to run an operation of renegade spacemen. They have supposedly hit the asteroids while no legal ships has made pass Mars. He is currently exploring between Mercury and Pluto because he wants to build a new base for them. His operation was based on Venus, but because the place is getting to civilized, they need to move to a new home on an asteroid.

        "Summary_3": "We know that the red-bearded man is named Jacob, and he is the leader of a renegade space crew, made up of misfits and rejects. The space crew transports cargoes of minerals to and from planets, and they advance to another location time after time to avoid authorities catching up with them. After Venus, the next planned location is on the Asteroid belt, which requires advanced navigation and astrogation, which is why Jacob seeks Ben Curtis for help.",
        "Summary_4": "We know that Maggie is the wife of the red-bearded man Jacob. Jacob is the leader of a group of about a thousand. They own about a dozen ships. They have changed their bases many times depending on threatening circumstances. If they see trouble, they move on to the next place. The previous base was near the Pole on Venus. Venus was the base after the group was exiled from Mars. Venus is now no longer able to be the group\u2019s home because it is becoming more and more civilized. So, the group has decided that the new base is going to be on an asteroid. The operation of Jacob and his group is mining. They mine almost pure uranium and tungsten, materials that are scarce on both Earth and Mars. They then sell the materials. ",

He graduated from an academy as an astrogation major and was a great student. After one month he signed aboard the ship called Odyssey. The bar fight occurred when he was celebrating his successful flight and he was proud of his uniform yet considering it a key for everything - the idea he had for a long time before. ",
        "Summary_2": "Ben is orphaned at four because his parents are killed in a strato-jet crash. At the age of five, he watched the night sky for the Moon rockets. He obtaind his first telescope at the age of 10. He had many astronomy and rocketry books. At the age of 16, he spent every weekend at the Long Island Spaceport. He attended the Boys Town until 19 years old. Then he graduated from the Academy at White Sands in June. He majors in Astrogation and was the second highest in his class. Then he was accepted as junior astrogation officer for the Odyssey. He was celebrating for his flight from Roswell to Luna City when he murdered Cobb in the bar. ",

        "Summary_4": "Both of Ben\u2019s parents died in a strato-jet cash when he was very young. After their death when he was about five years old, he would regularly watch the night sky hoping to see Moon rockets. He acquired his first telescope at the age of ten. By fourteen, Ben had a large collection of astronomy and rocketry books that could fill a shed. When he was 16, he would often hike from the Catskills to Long Island Spaceport. The trips to Long Island Spaceport would inspire him to apply to the U.S. Academy for the Conquest of Space.

They bring in our ships tofrontier ports like Hoover City to unload cargo and take on supplies.     Don't the authorities object?     Not very strongly. The I. B. I. has too many problems right here tosearch the whole System for a few two-bit crooks. Besides, we carrycargoes of almost pure uranium and tungsten and all the stuff that'sscarce on Earth and Mars and Venus. Nobody really cares whether itcomes from the asteroids or Hades. If we want to risk our lives miningit, that's our business.     She pursed her lips. But if they guessed how strong we are or that wehave friends planted in the I. B. I.\u2014well, things might be different.There probably would be a crackdown.     Ben scowled. What happens if there      is     a crackdown? And what will youdo when Space Corps ships officially reach the asteroids? They can'tignore you then.     Then we move on. We dream up new gimmicks for our crates and take themto Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto. In time, maybe, we'll bepushed out of the System itself. Maybe it won't be the white-suitedboys who'll make that first hop to the stars. It      could     be us, youknow\u2014if we live long enough. But that Asteroid Belt is murder. Youcan't follow the text-book rules of astrogation out there. You make upyour own.  "

        "Summary_1": "The story begins as Johnny Tolliver argues with Jeffers, the manager of Ganymedan branch of Koslow Spaceways, about how he doesn\u2019t want to be involved with whatever he is doing. This makes Jeffers angry, knowing that he cannot fire Tolliver, he decides to make Tolliver\u2019s job extremely boring. Thus, for the next few days, he simply hang around the garage, with nothing to do. Then on Friday, he gets assigned to take the creeper outside. He picks Betty up, where he told her about the dangers of Ganymede such as the volcanic puffballs and the mountain slides, he explains his high pay for driving unarmored tractor by mentioning that if he survives the six month, he will retire. However, Tolliver understand that this is completely a lie. After they go to see Jeffers, Betty states that she will not work with them, and them fires Jeffers. Jeffers order his men to lock Betty and Tolliver up. After Tolliver wakes up, they decided to escape. Betty told Tolliver about how she was able to figure out that there\u2019s something wrong \u2013 his extremely high paycheck. After crawling through the hole by bending plastic, they finds spacesuits in the storeroom. Finally, they are able to escape by taking off on an economy orbit for Earth. After contacting with Space Patrol, Tolliver finds it odd when he says \u201cMiss Koslow.\u201d Questioning Betty, she admits that she works for a private investigating firm. Then, in the end, Tolliver is going to cut the fuel flow to see if Betty will suspect anything, since they are just orbiting Ganymede. ",
        "Summary_2": "Johnny Tolliver meets with his superior, Jeffers. Jeffers is the manager of the Ganymedan branch of Koslow Spaceways. Tolliver is very unhappy with Jeffers and is roughly expressing his frustration to him. Their conversation does not end well and Jeffers is clear that he will retaliate against Tolliver\u2019s demands. Tolliver leaves the room grunting about how Jeffers and his men can steal the Great Red Spot off of Jupiter at their own risk. \n\nOver the next few days, Tolliver grows frustrated that he is not being assigned anything. One day, he does get an assignment. He is meant to pick up a home office relative coming in from the Javelin. Tolliver picks up a woman named Betty and transports her. Very early on he appears not to like her and decides to scare her and make it seem that there is danger at every corner. They arrive at their destination and Tolliver leads Betty to Jeffers office. Tolliver barges into Jeffers office, with Betty in tow, to purposefully upset Jeffers. Jeffers is angered at Tolliver\u2019s arrival, but excitedly greets Betty. However, his warm greeting is not returned by Betty. Betty quickly accuses him of wrongdoings and wants him to leave his position. At first he is too stunned to speak. He quickly recovers and orders some men to lock both Tolliver and Betty in a room. Tolliver tries to fight against one of the guards meant to imprison him. His success does not last long and he finds himself in an empty office next to the warehouse building. Tolliver quickly begins to plot their escape. Betty decides to join him in escaping the room. \n\nThey are able to leave the room and go through the warehouse where they find spacesuits to wear. Making their way outside of the warehouse, Tolliver uses the knife that came with the spacesuit to slash a section out of the dome. They step through the section and walk normally to not attract attention to themselves. Tolliver suggests they go find her ship to make a call to the emergency number that Betty was given. In their process, they escape the dome and into the almost vacuum air of Ganymede\u2019s surface and run to Betty\u2019s ship. As they get closer to Betty\u2019s ship, Tolliver notices a tractor headed towards them. They hurry onto the ship. Tolliver quickly readies the ship for takeoff to Betty\u2019s surprise. Betty grabs a memo from her pocket inside the spacesuit to give Tolliver the number to call. Once the call is connected, Betty requests assistance to arrest Jeffers and co-conspirators. Tolliver becomes suspicious during her call with Space Patrol and she eventually tells him that she is not actually Koslow\u2019s daughter. Eventually, the ship takes off. \n\nTolliver tells Betty that he is taking them back to Earth but the journey will take 6 months. However, thinking to himself, Tolliver wonders when Betty will catch on that they will just be orbiting Ganymede and not the path she thinks. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Johnny Tolliver is a space pilot from Earth to Jupiter and all the way round who works to get enough money for an engineering degree. His superior, Jeffers, tries to get him involved in the sneaky deals of stealing some cargo meant to be transported to Earth. Tolliver refuses as he wants to return clean and as fast as possible to Earth. Jeffers can't fire him and Tolliver feels safe. For the next few days Johnny has nothing to do as he is made to drive a tractor and doesn't have any assignments. Then he gets word he will be assigned to drive a tractor with some home-office relative, who has a lot of bags as a cargo, which is a simple waste of fuel. The relative is a young girl named Betty who tries to behave like a spacer, like all those relatives do, though they only spend a couple months in space doing nothing. Betty wants to learn traffic routing and she doesn't see Johnny's drive from the city to the spaceport on Ganymede as a mission. That scorn makes the man mad and he tells that the trips are dangerous and many men had died on those drives. Tolliver makes up those lies to scare the girl and diminish her arrogance and scorn, and to impress her in some way, he also shows his significant payment. Then, Tolliver leads subdued Betty to Jeffers, who treats her with utmost respect and sweetness remembering who her father is. The girl though takes a threatening tone claiming she will be in charge of her father's company one day and that she has learned what's going wrong on Ganymede, so Jeffers is as good as fired. Jeffers then calls three men in to lock Betty and Tolliver up. Jeffers believes Tolliver has told everything to Betty and she learns from Johnny that he was asked to join the smuggling gang. Tolliver manages to heat and open the door, Betty follows and they approach a storeroom for spacesuits. The two put them on and pretend to be inspecting domes, they get into a low gravity field to reach the ship she arrived in. Tolliver confesses in exaggerating the dangers on the way, then they get into the ship and to the control room, and Johnny plans to take off while Betty was simply going to use her connection on radio or TV. Tolliver and Betty take off and the phone number she has turns out to be Space Patrol. Johnny realizes throughout the dialogue that the person on the other end was waiting for the girl's report to know who to arrest. Betty turns out to be Koslow's daughter but a private investigator. The ship Tolliver and Betty are on is orbiting Ganymede, but the former convinces the girl they are on a long way to Earth. ",
        "Summary_4": "Johnny Tolliver is a space pilot, working for the Ganymedan branch at Koslow Spaceways. He sits in the office of his supervisor, Jeffers, who has invited him to take part in a scheme where he steals parts of ships' cargoes in order to make profit. Tolliver is skeptical and uncomfortable with this operation, and he refuses. Though Jeffers cannot fire him, because he is on contract, he takes Tolliver off his assigned orbit. The next day, Tolliver finds that instead of being assigned a ship, he has the mundane job of driving a tractor from domes to the spaceport. The job drags on for the next three days when Tolliver is informed that he has the job of escorting a home-office relative to the city. The relative is a young girl named Betty, whom Tolliver immediately perceives as naive and arrogant. To entertain himself on the drive, Tolliver makes up stories about the dangers of Ganymede and his job as a daredevil tractor driver, showing Betty his paycheck. They arrive into the city, and Tolliver leads Betty to Jeffers' office at her request. Jeffers greets Betty, addressing her as Miss Koslow, indicating that she is the daughter of the boss of Koslow Spaceways, to which Tolliver is surprised and secretly regrets the embellished stories he told her. Betty immediately orders Jeffers to be fired out of suspicions of mismanagement. Jeffers, sure that Betty had found out about his side scheme, locks up Tolliver and Betty in an empty office room. Tolliver manages to escape by using fire to bend the plastic door, and Betty insists on joining him. The two find spare spacesuits and get into disguise while they make their way to a spaceship. Tolliver cuts a slit into the dome over the establishment and they squeeze through, running to the spaceport. As they reach the ship, Tolliver notices a tractor headed their way, and he rushes Betty inside. Tolliver quickly launches the ship into orbit despite Betty's protests. Betty then phones Space Patrol, given access by her father, and informs the officer to arrest Jeffers and that the ship they are on has been sent on a six-month orbit. When Betty signs off, it is revealed to Tolliver that she is not actually Koslow's daughter, but a private investigator impersonating her in order to get information on who was stealing from the company. Tolliver informs Betty that they will be on the ship for a while, not telling her that they would be orbiting Ganymede the entire time.",
        "Article": "Tolliver began to have his doubts the next day; which was Tuesdayby the arbitrary calender constructed to match Ganymede's week-longjourney around Jupiter.     His contract guaranteed a pilot's rating, but someone had neglected tospecify the type of craft to be piloted.     On the bulletin board, Tolliver's name stood out beside the numberof one of the airtight tractors used between the dome city and thespaceport, or for hauling cross-country to one of the mining domes.     He soon found that there was nothing for him to do but hang around thegarage in case a spaceship should land. The few runs to other domesseemed to be assigned to drivers with larger vehicles.     The following day was just as boring, and the next more so. He sworewhen he found the assignment unchanged by Friday. Even the reflectionthat it was payday was small consolation.     Hey, Johnny! said a voice at his shoulder. The word is that they'refinally gonna trust you to take that creeper outside.     Tolliver turned to see Red Higgins, a regular driver.     What do you mean?     They say some home-office relative is coming in on the      Javelin     .     What's wrong with that? asked Tolliver. Outside of the way they keephanding out soft jobs to nephews, I mean.     Aah, these young punks just come out for a few months so they can goback to Earth making noises like spacemen. Sometimes there's no reasonbut them for sending a ship back with a crew instead of in an economyorbit. Wait till you see the baggage you'll have to load!     Later in the day-period, Tolliver recalled this warning. Under aportable, double-chambered plastic dome blown up outside the ship'sairlock, a crewman helped him load two trunks and a collection of bagsinto the tractor. He was struggling to suppress a feeling of outrage atthe waste of fuel involved when the home-office relative emerged.     She was about five feet four and moved as if she walked lightly evenin stronger gravity than Ganymede's. Her trim coiffure was a shade tooblonde which served to set off both the blue of her eyes and the capapparently won from one of the pilots. She wore gray slacks and a heavysweater, like a spacer.     Sorry to keep you waiting, she said, sliding into the seat besideTolliver. By the way, just call me Betty.     Sure, agreed Tolliver thinking,      Ohmigod! Trying already to be justone of the gang, instead of Lady Betty! Is her old man the treasurer,or does he just know where bodies are buried?       They were making dates, said the girl. Were they ribbing me, or isit true that none of the four of them goes back with the ship?     It's true enough, Tolliver assured her. We need people out here, andit costs a lot to make the trip. They found they could send back loadedships by 'automatic' flight\u2014that is, a long, slow, economical orbitand automatic signalling equipment. Then they're boarded approachingEarth's orbit and landed by pilots who don't have to waste their timemaking the entire trip.   <doc-sep> For one thing, though the officer seemed well acquainted with Betty, henever addressed her by the name of Koslow. For another, he accepted therequest as if he had been hanging in orbit merely until learning who togo down after.       They really sent her out to nail someone     , Tolliver realized.      Ofcourse, she stumbled onto Jeffers by plain dumb luck. But she had anidea of what to look for. How do I get into these things? She mighthave got me killed!       We do have one trouble, he heard Betty saying. This tractor driver,Tolliver, saved my neck by making the ship take off somehow, but hesays it's set for a six-month orbit, or economy flight. Whatever theycall it. I don't think he has any idea where we're headed.     Tolliver pulled her back, holding her in mid-air by the slack of hersweater.     Actually, I have a fine idea, he informed the officer coldly. Ihappen to be a qualified space pilot. Everything here is under control.If Miss Koslow thinks you should arrest Jeffers, you can call us lateron this channel.     Miss Koslow? repeated the spacer. Did she tell you\u2014well, no matter!If you'll be okay, we'll attend to the other affair immediately.     He signed off promptly. The pilot faced Betty, who looked more offendedthan reassured at discovering his status.     This 'Miss Koslow' business, he said suspiciously. He sounded funnyabout that.     The girl grinned.     Relax, Tolliver, she told him. Did you really believe Daddy wouldsend his own little girl way out here to Ganymede to look for whoeverwas gypping him?     You ... you...?     Sure. The name's Betty Hanlon. I work for a private investigatingfirm. If old Koslow had a son to impersonate\u2014     I'd be stuck for six months in this orbit with some brash young man,Tolliver finished for her. I guess it's better this way, he saidmeditatively a moment later.     Oh, come      on     ! Can't they get us back? How can you tell where we'regoing?     I know enough to check takeoff time. It was practically due anyhow, sowe'll float into the vicinity of Earth at about the right time to bepicked up.     He went on to explain something of the tremendous cost in fuelnecessary to make more than minor corrections to their course. Eventhough the Patrol ship could easily catch the slow freighter, bringingalong enough fuel to head back would be something else again.     We'll just have to ride it out, he said sympathetically. The ship isprovisioned according to law, and you were probably going back anyhow.     I didn't expect to so soon.     Yeah, you were pretty lucky. They'll think you're a marvel to crackthe case in about three hours on Ganymede.     Great! muttered Betty. What a lucky girl I am!     Yes, admitted Tolliver, there      are     problems. If you like, we mightget the captain of that Patrol ship to legalize the situation by TV.     I can see you're used to sweeping girls off their feet, she commentedsourly.     The main problem is whether you can cook.     Betty frowned at him.     I'm pretty good with a pistol, she offered, or going over crookedbooks. But cook? Sorry.     Well, one of us had better learn, and I'll have other things to do.     I'll think about it, promised the girl, staring thoughtfully at thedeck.     Tolliver anchored himself in a seat and grinned as he thought about ittoo.       After a while     , he promised himself,      I'll explain how I cut the fuelflow and see if she's detective enough to suspect that we're justorbiting Ganymede!     <doc-sep>    TOLLIVER'S ORBIT     was slow\u2014but it wasn't boring. And     it would get you there\u2014as long as     you weren't going anywhere anyhow!     By H. B.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      Johnny Tolliver scowled across the desk at his superior. His blackthatch was ruffled, as if he had been rubbed the wrong way.     I didn't ask you to cut out your own graft, did I? he demanded.Just don't try to sucker me in on the deal. I know you're operatingsomething sneaky all through the colony, but it's not for me.     The big moon-face of Jeffers, manager of the Ganymedan branch ofKoslow Spaceways, glowered back at him. Its reddish tinge brightenedthe office noticeably, for such of Ganymede's surface as could be seenthrough the transparent dome outside the office window was cold, dimand rugged. The glowing semi-disk of Jupiter was more than half amillion miles distant.     Try not to be simple\u2014for once! growled Jeffers. A little percentagehere and there on the cargoes never shows by the time figures get backto Earth. The big jets in the home office don't care. They count it onthe estimates.     You asked any of them lately? Tolliver prodded.     Now,      listen     ! Maybe they live soft back on Earth since the minesand the Jovian satellite colonies grew; but they were out here in thebeginning, most of them.      They     know what it's like. D'ya think theydon't expect us to make what we can on the side?     Tolliver rammed his fists into the side pockets of his loose blueuniform jacket. He shook his head, grinning resignedly.     You just don't listen to      me     , he complained. You know I took thispiloting job just to scrape up money for an advanced engineering degreeback on Earth. I only want to finish my year\u2014not get into something Ican't quit.     Jeffers fidgeted in his chair, causing it to creak under the bulk ofhis body. It had been built for Ganymede, but not for Jeffers.     Aw, it's not like that, the manager muttered. You can ease outwhenever your contract's up. Think we'd bend a good orbit on youraccount?     Tolliver stared at him silently, but the other had difficulty meetinghis eye.     All right, then! Jeffers snapped after a long moment. If you want itthat way, either you get in line with us or you're through right now!     You can't fire me, retorted the pilot pityingly. I came out hereon a contract. Five hundred credits a week base pay, five hundred forhazardous duty. How else can you get pilots out to Jupiter?     Okay I can't fire you legally\u2014as long as you report for work,grumbled Jeffers, by now a shade more ruddy. We'll see how long youkeep reporting. Because you're off the Callisto run as of now! Sit inyour quarters and see if the company calls      that     hazardous duty!     Doesn't matter, answered Tolliver, grinning amiably. The hazardouspart is just being on the same moon as you for the next six months.     He winked and walked out, deliberately leaving the door open behind himso as to enjoy the incoherent bellowing that followed him.       Looks like a little vacation     , he thought, unperturbed.      He'll comearound. I just want to get back to Earth with a clean rep. Let Jeffersand his gang steal the Great Red Spot off Jupiter if they like! It'stheir risk.    "

She is five feet four, and her hair was a shade too blonde; she has blue eyes and is wearing gray slacks with a heavy sweater. She comes to Ganymedan to learn about traffic routing as well as business management of local branches. Betty is shocked by the exaggerated description that Tolliver gives on the tractor about how dangerous Ganymedan is. Once she arrives in the office, she fires Jeffers stating that she knows that he has been doing. Making Jeffers very angry, he locks her along with Tolliver into the empty office. There, Betty follows Tolliver to escape to the control room. Once she is told that they will take off, she refuses. But, in order to escape, Tolliver takes off the ship into an economy orbit for Earth anyway. Betty finally makes the microphone call to Space Patrol, telling them to capture Jeffers. From the way that the other side of the phone reacted to Tolliver calling Betty Miss Koslow, Tolliver realizes that something\u2019s off. Then Betty tells him that she actually works for a private investigating firm, and her name is Betty Hanlon. Betty ",

During the tractor ride back to the dome from her ship, Tolliver attempts to scare her and makes the area sound incredibly dangerous. During their ride, Betty tells Tolliver why she has been sent to this branch. Betty states that her dad wants her to learn the traffic routing and the business management within a local branch of Koslow Spaceways. When they arrive at the air lock, scared from Tolliver\u2019s stories, she asks Tolliver to guide her to manager\u2019s office. Once she reaches Jeffers office, she immediately accuses him of being crooked and wants him gone from his position. One of her first hints came from when she saw Tolliver\u2019s paycheck and its value. She explains to Jeffers that she may look innocent but she is smart and details how she has evidence that he is doing his job improperly. \n\nJeffers responds and orders both Tolliver and Betty to be locked up. They end up in an empty office near a warehouse building. When Tolliver begins to plan his escape from the room, Betty insists on joining Tolliver much to his dismay. They exit on Ganymede\u2019s surface where Betty proves to have trouble running on the ice in a low gravity environment. After successfully grabbing spacesuits to wear and escaping the warehouse, Betty tells Tolliver that she can get significant help from an emergency number she was given by her father. She just needs to find a TV to make the call. They exit the dome and run across the ice to make it towards Betty\u2019s ship. On the ship, Tolliver learns that the woman\u2019s name is actually Betty Hanlon and not the daughter of Koslow. \n\nEventually, Tolliver guides the ship through take off and explains to Betty that they will be on a long orbit path of 6 months. Betty is upset about the return to Earth and the length of the journey. She admits to Tolliver that she is better handling a pistol than being able to cook. \n",

I guess it's better this way, he saidmeditatively a moment later.     Oh, come      on     ! Can't they get us back? How can you tell where we'regoing?     I know enough to check takeoff time. It was practically due anyhow, sowe'll float into the vicinity of Earth at about the right time to bepicked up.     He went on to explain something of the tremendous cost in fuelnecessary to make more than minor corrections to their course. Eventhough the Patrol ship could easily catch the slow freighter, bringingalong enough fuel to head back would be something else again.     We'll just have to ride it out, he said sympathetically. The ship isprovisioned according to law, and you were probably going back anyhow.     I didn't expect to so soon.     Yeah, you were pretty lucky. They'll think you're a marvel to crackthe case in about three hours on Ganymede.     Great! muttered Betty. What a lucky girl I am!     Yes, admitted Tolliver, there      are     problems. If you like, we mightget the captain of that Patrol ship to legalize the situation by TV.     I can see you're used to sweeping girls off their feet, she commentedsourly.     The main problem is whether you can cook.     Betty frowned at him.     I'm pretty good with a pistol, she offered, or going over crookedbooks. But cook? Sorry.     Well, one of us had better learn, and I'll have other things to do.     I'll think about it, promised the girl, staring thoughtfully at thedeck.     Tolliver anchored himself in a seat and grinned as he thought about ittoo.       After a while     , he promised himself,      I'll explain how I cut the fuelflow and see if she's detective enough to suspect that we're justorbiting Ganymede!     <doc-sep> It was a long mile, even at the pace human muscles could achieve onGanymede. They took one short rest, during which Tolliver was forcedto explain away the dangers of slides and volcanic puffballs. Headmitted to having exaggerated slightly. In the end, they reached thespaceship.     There seemed to be no one about. The landing dome had been collapsedand stored, and the ship's airlock port was closed.     That's all right, Tolliver told the girl. We can get in with notrouble.     It was when he looked about to make sure that they were unobserved thathe caught a glimpse of motion back toward the city. He peered at thespot through the dim light. After a moment, he definitely recognizedthe outline of a tractor breasting a rise in the ground and tiltingdownward again.     In fact, we      have     to get in to stay out of trouble, he said to Betty.     He located the switch-cover in the hull, opened it and activated themechanism that swung open the airlock and extended the ladder.     It took him considerable scrambling to boost the girl up the ladder andinside, but he managed. They passed through the airlock, fretting atthe time required to seal, pump air and open the inner hatch; and thenTolliver led the way up another ladder to the control room. It was aclumsy trip in their spacesuits, but he wanted to save time.       In the control room, he shoved the girl into an acceleration seat,glanced at the gauges and showed her how to open her helmet.     Leave the suit on, he ordered, getting in the first word while shewas still shaking her head. It will help a little on the takeoff.     Takeoff! shrilled Betty. What do you think you're going to do? Ijust want to use the radio or TV!     That tractor will get here in a minute or two. They might cut yourconversation kind of short. Now shut up and let me look over thesedials!     He ran a practiced eye over the board, reading the condition of theship. It pleased him. Everything was ready for a takeoff into aneconomy orbit for Earth. He busied himself making a few adjustments,doing his best to ignore the protests from his partner in crime. Hewarned her the trip might be long.     I told you not to come, he said at last. Now sit back!     He sat down and pushed a button to start the igniting process.     In a moment, he could feel the rumble of the rockets through the deck,and then it was out of his hands for several minutes.     That wasn't so bad, Betty admitted some time later. Did you go inthe right direction?     Who knows? retorted Tolliver. There wasn't time to check      everything     . We'll worry about that after we make your call.     Oh! Betty looked helpless. It's in my pocket.     Tolliver sighed. In their weightless state, it was no easy task to pryher out of the spacesuit. He thought of inquiring if she needed anyfurther help, but reminded himself that this was the boss's daughter.When Betty produced a memo giving frequency and call sign, he set aboutmaking contact.     It took only a few minutes, as if the channel had been monitoredexpectantly, and the man who flickered into life on the screen wore auniform.     Space Patrol? whispered Tolliver incredulously.     That's right, said Betty. Uh ... Daddy made arrangements for me.     Tolliver held her in front of the screen so she would not float outof range of the scanner and microphone. As she spoke, he staredexasperatedly at a bulkhead, marveling at the influence of a man whocould arrange for a cruiser to escort his daughter to Ganymede andwondering what was behind it all.     When he heard Betty requesting assistance in arresting Jeffers andreporting the manager as the head of a ring of crooks, he began tosuspect. He also noticed certain peculiarities about the remarks of thePatrolman.  "

        "Summary_1": "Jeffers is the manager of the Ganymedan branch of Koslow Spaceways. He is operating something sneaky all through the colony. When he tries to make Tolliver join him, he refuses. But Jeffers cannot legally fire him, thus he decides to make him do some very boring works as a driver of airtight tractor, which is used between the dome city and the spaceport. Then after learning that Betty knows about what he is doing and wants to fire him, he is very shocked. He orders three men to lock Betty and Tolliver up. Later, Jeffers and his partners goes to the headquarters building, plotting their next moves. Tolliver assumes that Jeffers has already warned the garage and airlocks about the two, so that they cannot escape. Finally, when Betty reaches Space Patrol through the microphone, she told them to arrest Jeffers. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story begins with Tolliver expressing his discontent in a meeting with Jeffers. Jeffers at first tries to appease Tolliver and then changes his attitude. He threatens Tolliver multiple times in an attempt to subdue his anger. \n\nLater on, Tolliver barges into Jeffers office in an attempt to annoy Jeffers. He is successful in doing so. Once Jeffers notices Betty, his attitude changes and he greets her warmly and with excitement. However, very quickly Betty shows her disdain towards Jeffers. He is uncertain as to why she is upset with him and appears to blame Tolliver. After Betty details her accusations, Jeffers is quick to defend himself and even quicker to anger and go into action. He orders people to lock both Tolliver and Betty up. \n\nIt is implied that Betty called a group that will come in and arrest Jeffers for his actions and remove him from his post. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The story starts with Jeffers trying to persuade Johnny to join his gang in stealing and reselling a part of the valuable cargo. He threatens Johnny as the least refuses to. The further refusal makes Jeffers put Johnny to some boring job such as driving tractors with relative of home-office. Later, Jeffers meets Betty, a daughter of a very influential man. He treats her sweetly until she accuses him of his crimes. Then he calls for his men to lock up the girl and Tolliver in order to give him time to think. Jeffers plots the next moves and orders to watch out for the prisoners. After a while, Betty calls Space Patrol to request arresting Jeffers. ",

Tolliver refuses to join, and Jeffers then lays Tolliver off his space pilot assignment, and instead places him to drive tractors. A few days later, Jeffers is met by Tolliver and Betty in his office. Jeffers happily greets Betty as Miss Koslow, but Betty instead threatens to have Jeffers fired. Afraid of being found out, Jeffers captures the two and keeps them in an office. However, they soon escape and Jeffers is ordered to be arrested.",

I know you're operatingsomething sneaky all through the colony, but it's not for me.     The big moon-face of Jeffers, manager of the Ganymedan branch ofKoslow Spaceways, glowered back at him. Its reddish tinge brightenedthe office noticeably, for such of Ganymede's surface as could be seenthrough the transparent dome outside the office window was cold, dimand rugged. The glowing semi-disk of Jupiter was more than half amillion miles distant.     Try not to be simple\u2014for once! growled Jeffers. A little percentagehere and there on the cargoes never shows by the time figures get backto Earth. The big jets in the home office don't care. They count it onthe estimates.     You asked any of them lately? Tolliver prodded.     Now,      listen     ! Maybe they live soft back on Earth since the minesand the Jovian satellite colonies grew; but they were out here in thebeginning, most of them.      They     know what it's like. D'ya think theydon't expect us to make what we can on the side?     Tolliver rammed his fists into the side pockets of his loose blueuniform jacket. He shook his head, grinning resignedly.     You just don't listen to      me     , he complained. You know I took thispiloting job just to scrape up money for an advanced engineering degreeback on Earth. I only want to finish my year\u2014not get into something Ican't quit.     Jeffers fidgeted in his chair, causing it to creak under the bulk ofhis body. It had been built for Ganymede, but not for Jeffers.     Aw, it's not like that, the manager muttered. You can ease outwhenever your contract's up. Think we'd bend a good orbit on youraccount?     Tolliver stared at him silently, but the other had difficulty meetinghis eye.     All right, then! Jeffers snapped after a long moment. If you want itthat way, either you get in line with us or you're through right now!     You can't fire me, retorted the pilot pityingly. I came out hereon a contract. Five hundred credits a week base pay, five hundred forhazardous duty. How else can you get pilots out to Jupiter?     Okay I can't fire you legally\u2014as long as you report for work,grumbled Jeffers, by now a shade more ruddy. We'll see how long youkeep reporting. Because you're off the Callisto run as of now! Sit inyour quarters and see if the company calls      that     hazardous duty!     Doesn't matter, answered Tolliver, grinning amiably. The hazardouspart is just being on the same moon as you for the next six months.     He winked and walked out, deliberately leaving the door open behind himso as to enjoy the incoherent bellowing that followed him.       Looks like a little vacation     , he thought, unperturbed.      He'll comearound. I just want to get back to Earth with a clean rep. Let Jeffersand his gang steal the Great Red Spot off Jupiter if they like! It'stheir risk.     <doc-sep> For one thing, though the officer seemed well acquainted with Betty, henever addressed her by the name of Koslow. For another, he accepted therequest as if he had been hanging in orbit merely until learning who togo down after.       They really sent her out to nail someone     , Tolliver realized.      Ofcourse, she stumbled onto Jeffers by plain dumb luck. But she had anidea of what to look for. How do I get into these things? She mighthave got me killed!       We do have one trouble, he heard Betty saying. This tractor driver,Tolliver, saved my neck by making the ship take off somehow, but hesays it's set for a six-month orbit, or economy flight. Whatever theycall it. I don't think he has any idea where we're headed.     Tolliver pulled her back, holding her in mid-air by the slack of hersweater.     Actually, I have a fine idea, he informed the officer coldly. Ihappen to be a qualified space pilot. Everything here is under control.If Miss Koslow thinks you should arrest Jeffers, you can call us lateron this channel.     Miss Koslow? repeated the spacer. Did she tell you\u2014well, no matter!If you'll be okay, we'll attend to the other affair immediately.     He signed off promptly. The pilot faced Betty, who looked more offendedthan reassured at discovering his status.     This 'Miss Koslow' business, he said suspiciously. He sounded funnyabout that.     The girl grinned.     Relax, Tolliver, she told him. Did you really believe Daddy wouldsend his own little girl way out here to Ganymede to look for whoeverwas gypping him?     You ... you...?     Sure. The name's Betty Hanlon. I work for a private investigatingfirm. If old Koslow had a son to impersonate\u2014     I'd be stuck for six months in this orbit with some brash young man,Tolliver finished for her.

Jeffers, he announced, this is ... just call her Betty.     The manager's jowled features twisted into an expression of welcome asjovial as that of a hungry crocodile.     Miss Koslow! he beamed, like a politician the day before the voting.It certainly is an honor to have you on Ganymede with us! That's all,Tolliver, you can go. Yes, indeed! Mr. Koslow\u2014the president, that is:your father\u2014sent a message about you. I repeat, it will be an honor toshow you the ropes. Did you want something else, Tolliver?     Never mind him, Mr. Jeffers, snapped the girl, in a tone new toTolliver. We won't be working together, I'm afraid. You've already hadenough rope.     Jeffers seemed to stagger standing still behind his desk. His looselips twitched uncertainly, and he looked questioningly to Tolliver. Thepilot stared at Betty, trying to recall pictures he had seen of theelder Koslow. He was also trying to remember some of the lies he hadtold en route from the spaceport.     Wh-wh-what do you mean, Miss Koslow? Jeffers stammered.     He darted a suspicious glare at Tolliver.     Mr. Jeffers, said the girl, I may look like just another spoiledlittle blonde, but the best part of this company will be mine someday.I was not allowed to reach twenty-two without learning something aboutholding on to it.     Tolliver blinked. He had taken her for three or four years older.Jeffers now ignored him, intent upon the girl.     Daddy gave me the title of tenth vice-president mostly as a joke, whenhe told me to find out what was wrong with operations on Ganymede.I have      some     authority, though. And you look like the source of thetrouble to me.     You can't prove anything, declared Jeffers hoarsely.     Oh, can't I? I've already seen certain evidence, and the rest won'tbe hard to find. Where are your books, Mr. Jeffers? You're as good asfired!     The manager dropped heavily to his chair. He stared unbelievingly atBetty, and Tolliver thought he muttered something about just landed.After a moment, the big man came out of his daze enough to stab anintercom button with his finger. He growled at someone on the other endto come in without a countdown.     Tolliver, hardly thinking about it, expected the someone to bea secretary, but it turned out to be three members of Jeffers'headquarters staff. He recognized one as Rawlins, a warehouse chief,and guessed that the other two might be his assistants. They were largeenough.     No stupid questions! Jeffers ordered. Lock these two up while Ithink!     Tolliver started for the door immediately, but was blocked off.     Where should we lock\u2014? the fellow paused to ask.     Tolliver brought up a snappy uppercut to the man's chin, feeling thatit was a poor time to engage Jeffers in fruitless debate.     In the gravity of Ganymede, the man was knocked off balance as much ashe was hurt, and sprawled on the floor.     I      told     you no questions! bawled Jeffers.     The fallen hero, upon arising, had to content himself with grabbingBetty. The others were swarming over Tolliver. Jeffers came around hisdesk to assist.  "

        "Summary_1": "Firstly, Tolliver takes Betty towards Jeffers\u2019 office on a tractor since it can go through the frozen surface of Ganymede. Then later, when Betty and Tolliver were put in the empty office, Tolliver uses a lighter to light up the mess of discarded records so that the plastic can be bent. Later, inside the storage room, Tolliver finds some spacesuits for the two to wear. Then finally, when they gets to the control room, they gets onto the acceleration seat. Using the ship, the two fly into the economy orbit for Earth in order to escape. In the end, Betty uses the scanner and microphone to make a call to the Space Patrol so that they will arrest Jeffers. ",
        "Summary_2": "Tolliver is a pilot, but while at the Ganymede branch he drives a tractor. One of the equipment used during the story is the automatic flight. An automatic flight allows loaded ships to take a slow and economical orbit using automatic signaling equipment towards Earth. As the loaded ship gets closer to Earth, it is boarded by pilots that land the ship. Another piece of equipment mentioned are spacesuits. The spacesuits involve valves and seals and microphones for people to communicate with each other in the spacesuits. The communication is activated by a switch under the chin on the helmet of the spacesuit. They also come with a heavy knife. ",
        "Summary_3": "Various types of transportation are used throughout the story - tractors to travel on Ganymede between the city and the spaceport, spaceships requiring a lot of fuel and economy orbits which require less fuel but take much longer to get to the place. In a storeroom there are plenty spacesuits, some of which need replacement. Knives are standard suit equipment. Spaceships are equipped with airlocks, ladders and switch-cover. In the control room there is an acceleration seat, a button to set off, a radio and TV, with a screen to see the other side of the call. ",
        "Summary_4": "Tolliver is first assigned to use an airtight tractor to transport to and from the spaceport. This tractor is like a regular one, but built specifically to trek across Ganymede with its gravity. When Tolliver and Betty are locked into Jeffers' office, he uses a lighter and paper to bend the plastic of the door. Then, he uses a knife to cut through the plastic of the dome. Finally, Tolliver and Betty board a ship, where the orbit is automatically preset in order to preserve fuel. The ship, which Tolliver knows how to operate, is airlocked. Betty uses a transmitter to contact Space Patrol.",
        "Article": "Tolliver began to have his doubts the next day; which was Tuesdayby the arbitrary calender constructed to match Ganymede's week-longjourney around Jupiter.     His contract guaranteed a pilot's rating, but someone had neglected tospecify the type of craft to be piloted.     On the bulletin board, Tolliver's name stood out beside the numberof one of the airtight tractors used between the dome city and thespaceport, or for hauling cross-country to one of the mining domes.     He soon found that there was nothing for him to do but hang around thegarage in case a spaceship should land. The few runs to other domesseemed to be assigned to drivers with larger vehicles.     The following day was just as boring, and the next more so. He sworewhen he found the assignment unchanged by Friday. Even the reflectionthat it was payday was small consolation.     Hey, Johnny! said a voice at his shoulder. The word is that they'refinally gonna trust you to take that creeper outside.     Tolliver turned to see Red Higgins, a regular driver.     What do you mean?     They say some home-office relative is coming in on the      Javelin     .     What's wrong with that? asked Tolliver. Outside of the way they keephanding out soft jobs to nephews, I mean.     Aah, these young punks just come out for a few months so they can goback to Earth making noises like spacemen. Sometimes there's no reasonbut them for sending a ship back with a crew instead of in an economyorbit. Wait till you see the baggage you'll have to load!     Later in the day-period, Tolliver recalled this warning. Under aportable, double-chambered plastic dome blown up outside the ship'sairlock, a crewman helped him load two trunks and a collection of bagsinto the tractor. He was struggling to suppress a feeling of outrage atthe waste of fuel involved when the home-office relative emerged.     She was about five feet four and moved as if she walked lightly evenin stronger gravity than Ganymede's. Her trim coiffure was a shade tooblonde which served to set off both the blue of her eyes and the capapparently won from one of the pilots. She wore gray slacks and a heavysweater, like a spacer.     Sorry to keep you waiting, she said, sliding into the seat besideTolliver. By the way, just call me Betty.     Sure, agreed Tolliver thinking,      Ohmigod! Trying already to be justone of the gang, instead of Lady Betty! Is her old man the treasurer,or does he just know where bodies are buried?       They were making dates, said the girl. Were they ribbing me, or isit true that none of the four of them goes back with the ship?     It's true enough, Tolliver assured her. We need people out here, andit costs a lot to make the trip. They found they could send back loadedships by 'automatic' flight\u2014that is, a long, slow, economical orbitand automatic signalling equipment. Then they're boarded approachingEarth's orbit and landed by pilots who don't have to waste their timemaking the entire trip.   <doc-sep> For one thing, though the officer seemed well acquainted with Betty, henever addressed her by the name of Koslow.

Maybe they live soft back on Earth since the minesand the Jovian satellite colonies grew; but they were out here in thebeginning, most of them.      They     know what it's like. D'ya think theydon't expect us to make what we can on the side?     Tolliver rammed his fists into the side pockets of his loose blueuniform jacket. He shook his head, grinning resignedly.     You just don't listen to      me     , he complained. You know I took thispiloting job just to scrape up money for an advanced engineering degreeback on Earth. I only want to finish my year\u2014not get into something Ican't quit.     Jeffers fidgeted in his chair, causing it to creak under the bulk ofhis body. It had been built for Ganymede, but not for Jeffers.     Aw, it's not like that, the manager muttered. You can ease outwhenever your contract's up. Think we'd bend a good orbit on youraccount?     Tolliver stared at him silently, but the other had difficulty meetinghis eye.     All right, then! Jeffers snapped after a long moment. If you want itthat way, either you get in line with us or you're through right now!     You can't fire me, retorted the pilot pityingly. I came out hereon a contract. Five hundred credits a week base pay, five hundred forhazardous duty. How else can you get pilots out to Jupiter?     Okay I can't fire you legally\u2014as long as you report for work,grumbled Jeffers, by now a shade more ruddy. We'll see how long youkeep reporting. Because you're off the Callisto run as of now! Sit inyour quarters and see if the company calls      that     hazardous duty!     Doesn't matter, answered Tolliver, grinning amiably. The hazardouspart is just being on the same moon as you for the next six months.     He winked and walked out, deliberately leaving the door open behind himso as to enjoy the incoherent bellowing that followed him.       Looks like a little vacation     , he thought, unperturbed.      He'll comearound. I just want to get back to Earth with a clean rep. Let Jeffersand his gang steal the Great Red Spot off Jupiter if they like! It'stheir risk.    "

        "Query": "What is the backdrop of TOLLIVER'S ORBIT?",
        "Summary_1": "First, the story starts inside Jeffers\u2019 office where the two argues. From the office window, the transparent domes of Ganymede\u2019s can be seen. There is also a chair and a door which is the exit from the room. Then at the empty office next to the warehouse building, Tolliver wakes up. There is an old table and half a dozen plastic crates in the empty office. The plastic crates contain a mess of discarded records. There is also a doorway. The doorway is plastic and can be bended when applied heat. Outside of the room, there\u2019s a storeroom, which has spacesuits inside them. Many of the spacesuits are unpacked while some are standing ready for emergencies. The control room has an acceleration seat. There is a board that has the condition of the ship. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story begins with Johnny Tolliver and Jeffers in Jeffers office at the Ganymedan branch of Koslow Spaceways. The office was encapsulated in a transparent dome. Jupiter was more than half a million miles away from the surface of Ganymede. The story begins on a Monday, according to the calendar to match the week long journey it took to go around Jupiter. When Tolliver does get an assignment, it is to take the tractor to bring a home office relative to the airlock at their destination. He does so and brings Betty, the home office relative, to Jeffers office. \n\nAfter Jeffers orders them locked up, they find themselves in an office next to the warehouse building. Tolliver begins to plan their escape and is successfully in getting the door open. Tolliver and Betty walk through to the end of the adjoining warehouse building and find spacesuits in a storeroom for them to wear. After putting on their spacesuits, they leave the warehouse. Tolliver and Betty cut through different layers of the dome and make their way on to the Ganymedan surface. As they get onto the Ganymedan surface, they run across the ice towards Betty\u2019s ship. They climb a ladder and go through an airlock to board the ship and then head to the control room. Tolliver guides the ship to take off and tells Betty that they will be spending 6 months there. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The story opens with Johnny sitting at the desk with his superior on Ganymede. Then Johnny walks out living the door open. Next day he comes to the bulletin board to see his tasks. In a couple of days he is ordered to drive a home-office relative. He loads trunks and bags into his tractor and drives a girl from her dome. He maneuvers out of it and heads toward the city domes. The gravity is light all around. The two walk again into Jeffers' office. Then they find themselves on the floor of an empty locked office in a warehouse building. There is only a table and some plastic crates. When they escape, the two head to a storeroom for spacesuits. Through a rear door they go out, cross an open lane between buildings and reach the main dome. They squeeze inside where there is air pressure and low gravity, so it's extremely hard to run there. They open a spaceship airlock and get in through a ladder.  In the control room there is an acceleration seat, a button to set off, a radio and TV, with a screen to see the other side of the call. The ship sets off to the orbit of Ganymede. ",
        "Summary_4": "The story takes place on Ganymede, a moon of Jupiter. The climate of the moon is cold and vast, with very low gravity. The beginning of the story takes place in Jeffers' office. Tolliver gets the job of driving a tractor to and from Ganymede's spaceport, where different parts of the moon are covered by transparent domes. Later in the story, Tolliver and Betty are trapped in an empty office room with only a table, crates, and papers. They escape and run on the surface of Ganymede into a spaceship.",
        "Article": "Tolliver began to have his doubts the next day; which was Tuesdayby the arbitrary calender constructed to match Ganymede's week-longjourney around Jupiter.     His contract guaranteed a pilot's rating, but someone had neglected tospecify the type of craft to be piloted.     On the bulletin board, Tolliver's name stood out beside the numberof one of the airtight tractors used between the dome city and thespaceport, or for hauling cross-country to one of the mining domes.     He soon found that there was nothing for him to do but hang around thegarage in case a spaceship should land. The few runs to other domesseemed to be assigned to drivers with larger vehicles.     The following day was just as boring, and the next more so. He sworewhen he found the assignment unchanged by Friday. Even the reflectionthat it was payday was small consolation.     Hey, Johnny! said a voice at his shoulder. The word is that they'refinally gonna trust you to take that creeper outside.     Tolliver turned to see Red Higgins, a regular driver.     What do you mean?     They say some home-office relative is coming in on the      Javelin     .     What's wrong with that? asked Tolliver. Outside of the way they keephanding out soft jobs to nephews, I mean.     Aah, these young punks just come out for a few months so they can goback to Earth making noises like spacemen. Sometimes there's no reasonbut them for sending a ship back with a crew instead of in an economyorbit. Wait till you see the baggage you'll have to load!     Later in the day-period, Tolliver recalled this warning. Under aportable, double-chambered plastic dome blown up outside the ship'sairlock, a crewman helped him load two trunks and a collection of bagsinto the tractor. He was struggling to suppress a feeling of outrage atthe waste of fuel involved when the home-office relative emerged.     She was about five feet four and moved as if she walked lightly evenin stronger gravity than Ganymede's. Her trim coiffure was a shade tooblonde which served to set off both the blue of her eyes and the capapparently won from one of the pilots. She wore gray slacks and a heavysweater, like a spacer.     Sorry to keep you waiting, she said, sliding into the seat besideTolliver. By the way, just call me Betty.     Sure, agreed Tolliver thinking,      Ohmigod! Trying already to be justone of the gang, instead of Lady Betty! Is her old man the treasurer,or does he just know where bodies are buried?       They were making dates, said the girl. Were they ribbing me, or isit true that none of the four of them goes back with the ship?     It's true enough, Tolliver assured her. We need people out here, andit costs a lot to make the trip. They found they could send back loadedships by 'automatic' flight\u2014that is, a long, slow, economical orbitand automatic signalling equipment. Then they're boarded approachingEarth's orbit and landed by pilots who don't have to waste their timemaking the entire trip.   <doc-sep> For one thing, though the officer seemed well acquainted with Betty, henever addressed her by the name of Koslow. For another, he accepted therequest as if he had been hanging in orbit merely until learning who togo down after.       They really sent her out to nail someone     , Tolliver realized.      Ofcourse, she stumbled onto Jeffers by plain dumb luck. But she had anidea of what to look for. How do I get into these things? She mighthave got me killed!       We do have one trouble, he heard Betty saying. This tractor driver,Tolliver, saved my neck by making the ship take off somehow, but hesays it's set for a six-month orbit, or economy flight. Whatever theycall it. I don't think he has any idea where we're headed.     Tolliver pulled her back, holding her in mid-air by the slack of hersweater.     Actually, I have a fine idea, he informed the officer coldly. Ihappen to be a qualified space pilot. Everything here is under control.If Miss Koslow thinks you should arrest Jeffers, you can call us lateron this channel.     Miss Koslow? repeated the spacer. Did she tell you\u2014well, no matter!If you'll be okay, we'll attend to the other affair immediately.     He signed off promptly. The pilot faced Betty, who looked more offendedthan reassured at discovering his status.     This 'Miss Koslow' business, he said suspiciously. He sounded funnyabout that.     The girl grinned.     Relax, Tolliver, she told him. Did you really believe Daddy wouldsend his own little girl way out here to Ganymede to look for whoeverwas gypping him?     You ... you...?     Sure. The name's Betty Hanlon. I work for a private investigatingfirm. If old Koslow had a son to impersonate\u2014     I'd be stuck for six months in this orbit with some brash young man,Tolliver finished for her. I guess it's better this way, he saidmeditatively a moment later.     Oh, come      on     ! Can't they get us back? How can you tell where we'regoing?     I know enough to check takeoff time. It was practically due anyhow, sowe'll float into the vicinity of Earth at about the right time to bepicked up.     He went on to explain something of the tremendous cost in fuelnecessary to make more than minor corrections to their course. Eventhough the Patrol ship could easily catch the slow freighter, bringingalong enough fuel to head back would be something else again.     We'll just have to ride it out, he said sympathetically. The ship isprovisioned according to law, and you were probably going back anyhow.     I didn't expect to so soon.     Yeah, you were pretty lucky. They'll think you're a marvel to crackthe case in about three hours on Ganymede.     Great! muttered Betty. What a lucky girl I am!     Yes, admitted Tolliver, there      are     problems. If you like, we mightget the captain of that Patrol ship to legalize the situation by TV.     I can see you're used to sweeping girls off their feet, she commentedsourly.     The main problem is whether you can cook.     Betty frowned at him.     I'm pretty good with a pistol, she offered, or going over crookedbooks. But cook? Sorry.     Well, one of us had better learn, and I'll have other things to do.     I'll think about it, promised the girl, staring thoughtfully at thedeck.     Tolliver anchored himself in a seat and grinned as he thought about ittoo.       After a while     , he promised himself,      I'll explain how I cut the fuelflow and see if she's detective enough to suspect that we're justorbiting Ganymede!     <doc-sep>    TOLLIVER'S ORBIT     was slow\u2014but it wasn't boring. And     it would get you there\u2014as long as     you weren't going anywhere anyhow!     By H. B.

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in PICK A CRIME?",
        "Summary_1": "Joe is at a bar and hands a girl $50 to complete a task for him without telling her what it is yet. He makes small talk to the girl telling her that he is trying to get drunk but he can\u2019t because his drinks are watered down by the CPA robot bartenders. Joe informs the girl that he is assigned a DCT (Dangerous Criminal Tendencies) designation on his CPA ID card. Joe leads the girl to an alley to move his plan into motion. His plan is for her to say that he attempted to rape her because attempted rape is a crime under CPA rules. The girl states that she does not want to go along with that plan because she will lose her rank in the Women\u2019s Self-Defense Association, which is a branch of the CPA. Joe still persists and tries to make her scream. The girl in turn successfully defends herself against him and causes his head to strike the hard concrete floor. He loses consciousness of her actions. \n\nJoe wakes up in the police commissioner\u2019s office. Joe\u2019s plan does not work because the CPA had microphones monitoring the alley so they already know that the plan was not real. Joe then proceeds to confess to a conspiracy when presented with the evidence the CPA has gathered. As a result of these actions, Joe\u2019s new designation on his CPA ID card has the words \u2018Dangerous Criminal Tendencies\u2019 in all caps and in a large, red font printed on his card. It also added that he was a DCT First Class owner. Hendricks lectures Joe about his new designation, but Joe does not care to hear him. The commissioner tries to convince Joe to leave New York or to use the free psychology service. \n\nHendricks explains that he cannot think of a way to help Joe without committing a crime himself. In an unexpected move, Hendricks offers Joe a seemingly available victim and their address. Joe memorizes the available information and goes to the address to commit a crime. Joe enters the apartment and takes a watch. He then shouts outside a window that there is a thief. Joe proceeds to run down to the street and is caught by a police helicopter and handcuffed. \n\nJoe eventually wakes up after months of treatment in a hospital and is picked up by Hendricks. He goes through the large crowd waiting to meet him upon exiting the hospital and has an uneasy feeling about the interactions. He is confused by the reaction of the crowd. Hendrick says that it was a fake apartment that Joe went to and is one that the police use for special cases like his when a person refuses to find a solution. Joe becomes upset because he realizes that he has become a prisoner in his own body because of the treatment from the CPA and he has great contempt for the results. \n",
        "Summary_2": "A girl goes up to Joe Harper's table in a tavern and says that Hank said that Joe wanted to see her. He gives her fifty dollars and tells her that he wants her to do a quick job for him. Joe has been trying to get drunk all afternoon because he will get free room and board for a month from the AAA. The girl wonders why he doesn't just get a job but hands her his CPA ID card. She sees that he has Dangerous Criminal Tendencies, which she then realizes why. The CPA does not punish criminals and focuses more on preventing crime. Therefore, criminals who get convicted are sent to hospitals where all criminal tendencies are removed from the mind by psychologists, shock treatments, encephalographic devices, and many other devices. However, these criminals are also hailed as heroes once they have left the treatment program. The girl agrees to his plan, and they go to the alley. He rips her clothes off and tells her to accuse him of rape. However, she cannot agree to the plan because she is a sergeant of the Women's Self-Defense Association (WSDA). He doesn't want to hear it but, she sends him flying through the air. Commissioner Hendricks speaks to him when he wakes up at the police commissioner's office, and Joe confesses to conspiracy. The crime has been prevented, but his new ID card now has DCT written in even larger red font. This signifies him as a DCT First Class, which means that many other amateur cops will begin to watch him in hopes that he will commit a crime. He further taunts Joe and says that all sorts of people on the street will ask about him and that his life is over because he is a freak. When Joe says that he is broke, Hendricks offers to loan him some money. Although both want to see Joe convicted, Hendricks cannot directly help him because it is either a Violation of Civil Rights or will cause him to commit a crime. However, as soon as Hendricks leaves to get water, Jon flips through Hendricks' book and finds somebody to rob. He goes to John Gralewski's apartment to steal a watch and is arrested promptly by the police. The story then goes to Hendricks telling Jon to wake up and that his treatment is now over. Jon says that he does not feel like a hero, while Hendricks tells him that they only admire him because he will never commit another crime again. When they get inside the car, Hendricks tells Jon that he will have the job he has always wanted now, but the treatment has written a set of laws in his mind that prevents him from committing crimes. Joe now realizes how lousy this system is and wants out of it, but it is too late. He demands to get out of the car and realizes he has become a prisoner with himself. ",
        "Summary_3": "A relatively beautiful girl sits down at Joe's table in the bar and gets paid for some future job. Joe tells her he is trying to get drunk, but the robot-bartender keeps watering his drink as being drunk is illegal. The plan is to join AAA and to live there for free for a month, but there are clever robots in every bar in New York. The girl suggests finding a job and learns that Joe had Dangerous Criminal Tendencies (DCT), which is visible in his ID card. Joe wants the girl to help him commit a crime which is almost impossible as CPA prevents every crime by various means. Those few who succeed are not punished but given treatment in hospitals after which they become perfect employees wanted by every company. Joe and the girl go out into the alley and the man asks her to scream to make everything look like an attempted rape. Nevertheless, the girl refuses as she was taught self-defense and is a sergeant, a rank she doesn't want to lose. When Joe tries anyway, the girl beats him down and police comes soon. They had a hidden microphone nearby and don't believe in the attempted rape story. Conspiracy is not considered a crime and Joe's ID has a larger DCT inscription now - a first class one. This means more cops will watch him as a hobby, as well as neighbors and other people. Hendricks, the police officer, suggests Joe gets the free treatment and then shows a small book with the contacts of nor properly protected people, listed in order to fix that blind spots. After leaving the book on the table, the officer goest to the nest room to get some water, and leaves Joe with the opportunity. Soon, Joe visits one of the listed apartments, an old building with an unreported new room. Joe steals a watch from there and screams for help, then runs and gets caught. After a while, Joe wakes up from a nightmare and sees Hendricks, who announces the end of treatment. The treatment lasted for months and made Joe feel more relaxed but nothing more. A huge crowd is waiting outside to cheer the ex-criminal for his newly gained honesty and inability to commit crime. A woman in the crowd blesses Joe for not committing a murder, which confuses him, as ex-murderers are even more cheered. Then Hendricks explains that he didn't do Joe a favor but such help in crimes is to prevent huger damages from those who refuse free treatment and want to be Exes, as they see those as heroes. Turns out an Ex has to work harder than other people and they still want to commit crime but the laws sound in their heads and prevent it causing pain. CPA is everywhere. ",
        "Summary_4": "The story begins with Joe paying a girl fifty dollars, asking her to do a job for him. He does not describe what the job is, but mentions that it will only takes a few minutes. Joe tries to get drunk, but is unsuccessful because the CPA robots prevent anyone from getting too drunk. Then we learn that the CPA is a system that prevents crimes from occurring. It has been very successful. Only a few hundred of crimes has occurred in the past year. Those that did commit a crime are considered heroes, and they are not punished because they outsmarted the system. Instead, they will be put in a CPA hospital for treatments. Afterward, they will be provided with some of the most paid jobs. Joe and the girl goes into the alleyway where he attempts to rape her. She tells him that he cannot do this. But he continues because he wants to get the treatment for a nice job. But because the girl refuses to corporate, she hits him and he drops to the ground. He wakes up in the police commissioner\u2019s office where his conspiracy is revealed through a hidden speaker in the alley. His CPA card is changed to a First Class DCT. After Commissioner Hendricks explains the troubles he will have as a First Class, Hendricks reveals the address to an unprotected property. Then Joe decides to rob the place. After stealing a watch, he purposely let himself get caught. When he wakes up again, his treatment at the CPA hospital is over. As he gets ready to go home, Hendricks tells him about the truth of the treatment: he simply cannot break any rules because his brain does not let him. ",

I want to talk to you.     In the office, Arapoulous took a chair. Sorry if I'm rushing you,Retief, he said. But have you got anything for me?     Retief waved at the wine bottles. What do you know about Croanie?     Croanie? Not much of a place. Mostly ocean. All right if you likefish, I guess. We import our seafood from there. Nice prawns in monsoontime. Over a foot long.     You on good terms with them?     Sure, I guess so. Course, they're pretty thick with Boge.     So?     Didn't I tell you? Boge was the bunch that tried to take us over herea dozen years back. They'd've made it too, if they hadn't had a lot ofbad luck. Their armor went in the drink, and without armor they're easygame.     Miss Furkle buzzed. I have your lists, she said shortly.

Joe waved the money away. Listen, why don't you do me a favor? Whydon't you frame me? If I'm such a nuisance, pin a crime on me\u2014anycrime.     Can't do it. Convicting a man of a crime he didn't commit is aviolation of Civil Rights and a crime in itself.     Umm.     Why don't you take the free psycho treatment? A man doesn't      have     tobe a DCT. With the free treatment, psychologists can remove all yourcriminal tendencies and\u2014     Go to those      head-shrinkers     ?     Hendricks shrugged again. Have it your way.     Joe laughed. If your damned CPA is so all-powerful, why can't you      make     me go?     Violation of Civil Rights.     Damn it, there must be some way you can help me! We both want the samething. We both want to see me convicted of a crime.     How can I help you without committing a crime myself? Hendrickswalked to his desk, opened a drawer and removed a small black book.See this? It contains names and addresses of all the people in NewYork who aren't properly protected. Every week we find people whoaren't protected properly\u2014blind spots in our protection devices. Assoon as we find them, we take steps to install anti-robbery devices,but this is a big city and sometimes it takes days to get the work done.     In the meantime, any one of these people could be robbed. But what canI do? I can't hold this book in front of your nose and say, 'Here, Joe,pick a name and go out and rob him.' He laughed nervously.

Almost running to the desk, Joe opened the book, selected a name andaddress and memorized it:      John Gralewski, Apt. 204, 2141 Orange St.       When Hendricks came back, Joe said, Thanks.     Huh? Thanks for what? I didn't do anything.   <doc-sep> Hendricks rose from behind the desk, walked leisurely to where Joe wasslouched in a chair. Give me your CPA ID.     Joe handed him the card with trembling fingers. He felt as if the worldhad collapsed beneath him. Conspiracy to commit a crime wasn't a crime.Anyone could conspire. And if the conspirators were prevented fromcommitting a crime, then that meant the CPA had functioned properlyonce again. That meant the CPA had once again      prevented     crime, andthe CPA didn't punish crimes or attempted crimes, and it didn't attemptto prevent crimes      by     punishment. If it did, that would be a violationof the New Civil Rights.     Hendricks crossed the room, deposited the card in a slot and punched abutton. The machine hummed and a new card appeared.

        "Query": "What is the function of the CPA?",
        "Summary_1": "The CPA is meant to prevent crime and not punish crime. It stands for Crime Prevention Association. The CPA organization has made crime nearly impossible through various methods of surveillance and intelligence gathering. The crime was not punished by the CPA but addressed by sending the person to a hospital for expensive treatment to correct and remove the deviance from the person\u2019s mind. A CPA ID card is required to be carried by everyone and when asked, a person has to present the ID card. Being drunk is illegal according to the rules of the CPA. ",
        "Summary_2": "The Crime Prevention Association is an organization that stops crime. Instead of capturing criminals, the goal of the Association is to prevent the crime from ever happening. They implement thousands of crime-prevention methods and devices. There are many amateur cops who constantly follow criminals around in hopes of catching them in the act so that they may be hailed a hero and given a promotion. Hendricks even explains that the kids have junior CPA clubs, where they record the criminals in little cardboard boxes. They will also follow the criminals around until they die. There are millions of microphones hidden by the CPA everywhere, and any threatening messages are sent to the CPA Brain. The CPA Brain is a monster electronic calculator that can alert police helicopters of any threatening messages, and there are also many hidden TVs and metal detectors. For Arson, heat detectors exist too, and chemical poisoning has made it impossible for people to get poisoned. There are shock treatments, encephalographic devices, a form of prefrontal lobotomy, and a dozen other treatments to reform criminals. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The CPA is Crime Prevention Organization. It fights crime by all means and reduces its rates to a very small level. They put microphones and detectors everywhere to hear the conspiracies. They place robots as bartenders to control the level of alcohol in visitors to prevent them being drunk. They make all the women learn self-defense. The organization's made crime almost impossible and they do not punish for it, but prevent. All who tried to commit a crime are given free treatment. The CPA hospitals treat those few criminals for free and make them unable to commit any further crime. CPA seems to be everywhere, those who tell about the crime are highly rewarded. Neon signs, TV, radio and other means constantly remind people that crime is filth. ",
        "Summary_4": "The CPA, Crime Prevention Association, is a system that detects different kinds of crimes and prevents them from happening. Thousands of robots and devices make crimes impossible. The association will not punish any crime, instead, the criminal will be send to a CPA hospital for some treatments that will result in getting the best jobs. The CPA also hands out ID cards that states one\u2019s tendency to commit crimes. The CPA has robot bartenders that can detect the drunkenness of a person and prevent anyone from actually getting drunk. There is WSDA teaching judo and jujitsu to women. There are spy cameras and speakers in each alley and street watching every person all the time to prevent all kinds of crimes. The CPA Brain will catch sentences that indicate crimes and watch them more carefully. There are heat-detectors, gun and knife detector, chemical detectors, etc. The CPA brainwashes people, making them believe that crimes are filthy. The treatment will make the criminal\u2019s brain catch every attempt that he or she tries to commit a crime and prevents it from happening. ",

She followed him up the dark alley until he turned suddenly and rippedher blouse and skirt.     He surprised her completely, but when she recovered, she backed away,her body poised like a wrestler's. What's the big idea?     Scream, Joe said. Scream as loud as you can, and when the cops gethere, tell 'em I tried to rape you.     The plan was perfect, he told himself. Attempted rape was one of thefew things that was a crime merely because a man attempted it. A crimebecause it theoretically inflicted psychological injury upon theintended victim\u2014and because millions of women voters had voted it acrime. On the other hand, attempted murder, robbery, kidnapping, etc.,were not crimes. They weren't crimes because the DCT didn't completethe act, and if he didn't complete the act, that meant simply that theCPA had once again functioned properly.     The girl shook her head vigorously. Sorry, buddy. Can't help you thatway. Why didn't you tell me what you wanted?     What's the matter? Joe complained. I'm not asking you to do anythingwrong.     You stupid jerk. What do you think this is\u2014the Middle Ages? Don't youknow almost every woman knows how to defend herself? I'm a sergeant inthe WSDA!     Joe groaned. The WSDA\u2014Women's Self-Defense Association\u2014a branch ofthe CPA. The WSDA gave free instruction in judo and jujitsu, evendeveloped new techniques of wrestling and instructed only women inthose new techniques.     The girl was still shaking her head. Can't do it, buddy. I'd lose myrank if you were convicted of\u2014     Do I have to      make     you scream? Joe inquired tiredly and advancedtoward the girl.     \u2014and that rank carries a lot of weight. Hey!      Stop it!          Joe discovered to his dismay that the girl was telling the truth whenshe said she was a sergeant in the WSDA. He felt her hands on his body,and in the time it takes to blink twice, he was flying through the air.       The alley's concrete floor was hard\u2014it had always been hard, but hebecame acutely aware of its lack of resiliency when his head struck it.There was a wonderful moment while the world was filled with beautifulstars and streaks of lightning through which he heard distant policesirens. But the wonderful moment didn't last long and darkness closedin on him.   <doc-sep> When Joe reached the street, he hurried toward the nearest subway. As achild, he had been frightened of the dark. As a man, he wasn't afraidof the dark itself, but the darkened city always made him feel illat ease. The uneasiness was, more than anything else, caused by hisown imagination. He hated the CPA and at night he couldn't shrug thefeeling that the CPA lurked in every shadow, watching him, waiting forhim to make a mistake.     Imagination or not, the CPA was almost everywhere a person went.Twenty-four hours a day, millions of microphones hidden in taverns,alleys, restaurants, subways and every other place imaginable waitedfor someone to say the wrong thing. Everything the microphones pickedup was routed to the CPA Brain, a monster electronic calculator.     If the words Let's see a movie were received in the Brain, theywere discarded. But if the words Let's roll this guy were received,the message was traced and a police helicopter would be at the scenein two minutes. And scattered all over the city were not only hiddenmicrophones, but hidden television cameras that relayed visual messagesto the Brain, and hidden machines that could detect a knife or a gun insomeone's pocket at forty yards.     Every place of business from the largest bank to the smallest grocerystore was absolutely impenetrable. No one had even tried to rob a placeof business for years.     Arson was next to impossible because of the heat-detectors\u2014devicesplaced in every building that could detect, radarlike, any intensity ofheat above that caused by a cigarette lighter. Chemical research hadmade poisoning someone an impossibility. There were no drugs containingpoison, and while an ant-poison might kill ants, no concentrated amountof it would kill a human.     The FBI had always been a powerful organization, but under thesupervision of the CPA, it was a scientific colossus and to thinkof kidnapping someone or to contemplate the use of narcotics waspointless. A counterfeiter's career was always short-lived: every placeof business and millions of individuals had small counterfeit-detectorsthat could spot a fake and report it directly to the Brain.     And the percentage of crimes had dwindled even more with the appearanceof the robot police officers. Many a criminal in the past had gambledthat he could outshoot a pursuing policeman. But the robots weredifferent: they weren't flesh and blood. Bullets bounced off them andtheir aim was infallible.  "

        "Query": "What is the reason behind Joe's decision to employ the girl in PICK A CRIME?",
        "Summary_1": "Joe hires the girl because he wants to commit a crime and be caught by the CPA. He reasons that if he commits a crime and is caught he will be treated and then labelled as an \u201cEx\u201d criminal. This designation would allow him to get whatever job he desired, an actual good job. An \u201cEx\u201d criminal is treated as a type of hero because they are viewed as cured and incapable of ever committing a crime again, thus they are the most trustworthy person in society. Joe hires the girl to use her to pretend that he tried to rape her. ",
        "Summary_2": "Joe hires the girl because he wants her to help him commit a crime. He believes that by falsely accusing him of rape, he will be convicted as a criminal sooner and be hailed as a hero. He desperately does not want the DCT title on his ID card anymore because it will not give him any sort of career advancement. He believes that committing a crime and having himself reformed will lead to others seeing him as a hero. This will also open more pathways career-wise as reformed criminals are generally seen as more responsible and trustworthy. ",
        "Summary_3": "Joe has Dangerous Criminal Tendencies which is stated in his ID card. Because of that he can not get any normal job except a garbage man or something like that. He plans to commit a real crime to receive treatment and become an ex-criminal. Being an Ex means being honest and clean, which provides multiple job opportunities and people consider Exes heroes as not many can succeed in committing crimes. The least is because the CPA, Crime Prevention Association, has managed to control almost everything and prevent almost every crime. Joe pays the girl to play a rape victim and to scream for help, so that he gets arrested. The girl though is a sergeant who is capable of self-defense, so she can't be possibly raped. The police hear his plan through a microphone and make him a first-class DCT instead. ",
        "Summary_4": "Joe wants to be caught with a crime so that he can have the treatment at the CPA hospital. He hires the girl because he wants to commit the crime of attempting to rape her. He desires the treatment because he is currently a DCT Second Level. With this identity, he cannot find any good jobs due to the high level of criminal tendency. Instead, only jobs such as street-cleaning, ditch-digger are open to him. But he wants a satisfying job with a great salary. Thus, he has to receive the treatment because everyone who has received the treatment does not commit crimes. They get the good jobs. ",
        "Article": "The car passed one of the CPA playgrounds. Boys and girls of all ageswere laughing, squealing with joy as they played games designed by CPApsychologists to relieve tension. And\u2014despite the treatment, Joeshuddered when he saw the psychologists standing to one side, quietlywatching the children. The whole world was filled with CPA employeesand volunteer workers. Everywhere you went, it was there, quietlywatching you and analyzing you, and if you showed criminal tendencies,it watched you even more closely and analyzed you even more deeplyuntil it took you apart and put you back together again the way itwanted you to be.     Being an Ex, you'll get the kind of job you always wanted, Hendrickscontinued. You'll get a good-paying job, but you'll work for it.You'll work eight hours a day, work harder than you've ever workedbefore in your life, because every time you start to loaf, a voice inyour head is going to say,      Work! Work!     Exes always get good jobsbecause employers know they're good workers.     But during these next few days, you'll discover what being an Exis like. You see, Joe, the treatment can't possibly take all thecriminal tendencies out of a man. So the treatment does the next bestthing\u2014you'll find a set of laws written in your mind. You might      want     to break one now and then, but you won't be able. I'll give you anillustration....     Joe's face reddened as Hendricks proceeded to call him a series ofnames. He wanted to smash the fat, grinning face, but the muscles inhis arm froze before it moved it an inch.     And worse than that, a brief pain ripped through his skull. A pain sointense that, had it lasted a second longer, he would have screamed inagony. And above the pain, a voice whispered in his head,      Unlawful tostrike someone except in self-defense     .     He opened his mouth to tell Hendricks exactly what he thought of him,the CPA, the whole world. But the words stayed in his throat, the painreturned, and the mental voice whispered,      Unlawful to curse     .     He had never heard how the treatment prevented an Ex from committing acrime. And now that he knew, it didn't seem fair. He decided to tellthe whole story to the newspapers as soon as he could. And as soon asthat decision formed in his mind, his body froze, the pain returned andthe voice,      Unlawful to divulge CPA procedure     .     See what I mean? Hendricks asked. A century ago, you would have beenlocked in a prison and taxpayers' money would have supported you untilthe day you died. With the CPA system, you're returned to society, auseful citizen, unable to commit the smallest crime. And you've got abig hand in your dirty little mind that's going to slap it every timeyou get the wrong kind of thought. It'll keep slapping you until youlearn. It might take weeks, months or years, but you'll learn sooneror later to not even think about doing anything wrong.   <doc-sep> Hendricks reached into a pocket, withdrew several bills and extendedthem. I'll loan you some money. You can sign an IOU and pay me back alittle at a time.     Joe waved the money away. Listen, why don't you do me a favor? Whydon't you frame me? If I'm such a nuisance, pin a crime on me\u2014anycrime.     Can't do it. Convicting a man of a crime he didn't commit is aviolation of Civil Rights and a crime in itself.     Umm.     Why don't you take the free psycho treatment? A man doesn't      have     tobe a DCT. With the free treatment, psychologists can remove all yourcriminal tendencies and\u2014     Go to those      head-shrinkers     ?     Hendricks shrugged again. Have it your way.     Joe laughed. If your damned CPA is so all-powerful, why can't you      make     me go?     Violation of Civil Rights.     Damn it, there must be some way you can help me! We both want the samething. We both want to see me convicted of a crime.     How can I help you without committing a crime myself? Hendrickswalked to his desk, opened a drawer and removed a small black book.See this? It contains names and addresses of all the people in NewYork who aren't properly protected. Every week we find people whoaren't protected properly\u2014blind spots in our protection devices. Assoon as we find them, we take steps to install anti-robbery devices,but this is a big city and sometimes it takes days to get the work done.     In the meantime, any one of these people could be robbed. But what canI do? I can't hold this book in front of your nose and say, 'Here, Joe,pick a name and go out and rob him.' He laughed nervously. If I didthat, I'd be committing a crime myself!     He placed the book on the desk top, took a handkerchief from a pocketagain and wiped sweat from his face. Excuse me a minute. I'm dying ofthirst. There's a water cooler in the next room.     Joe stared at the door to the adjoining office as it closed behind thebig man.

        "Summary_1": "DCT affects a lot of a person\u2019s social life and work abilities. To inquire about a job opening, a person has to show their ID. Establishments are not likely to hire a person with a DCT designation unless it is for a garbage truck job, a street-cleaner positioner, or other less desirable work options. They do not leave a person in a socially favorable view as people judge those with DCT designation poorly. \n\nA DCT First Class designation means that the person\u2019s case will be made public. People are interested in crime because it is a complete rarity in current society. The commissioner says that people will follow him wherever he goes and just watches him because they want to be the first one to call for the police when he commits a crime.

The First Class DCT holders have \u201cDANGEROUS CRIMINAL TENDENCIES\u201d written on their ID cards in red and even larger text. Being a First Class DCT means that their case histories will be turned over to newspapers, other amateur cops, and even children.

DCTs out of curiosity and spy on them as committing a crime is rare. DCTs, especially first class ones, are therefore never alone.

If a man was smart enough to killsomeone, for instance, he wasn't sent to prison to be punished; hewasn't punished at all. Instead, he was sent to a hospital where allcriminal tendencies were removed from his mind by psychologists, shocktreatments, encephalographic devices, a form of prefrontal lobotomy anda dozen other methods. An expensive operation, but since there were fewcriminals\u2014only ten in New York during the past year\u2014any city couldafford the CPA hospitals.     The CPA system was, actually, cheaper than previous methods becauseit did away with the damage caused by countless crimes; did away withprisons and their guards, large police forces, squad cars and weapons.     And, ironically, a man who      did     commit a crime was a sort of hero. Hewas a hero to the millions of men and women who had suppressed impulsesto kill someone, beat their mates, get drunk, or kick a dog. Not only ahero, but because of the CPA Treatment, he was\u2014when he left one of theCPA hospitals\u2014a thoroughly honest and hard-working individual ... aman who could be trusted with any responsibility, any amount of money.And therefore, an EX (a convicted criminal who received the treatmentwas commonly called an Ex because he was in the strictest sense of theword an Ex-criminal) ... an Ex was always offered the best jobs.     Well, the girl said. I'm honored. Really. But I got a date at ten.Let's get it over with. You said it'd only take a few minutes.     Okay. Let's go.   <doc-sep> At first glance Theodor thought the Deep Space Bar was empty. Then hesaw a figure hunched monkeylike on the last stool, almost lost in theblue shadows, while behind the bar, her crystal dress blending with thetiers of sparkling glasses, stood a grave-eyed young girl who couldhardly have been fifteen.     The TV was saying, ... in addition, a number of mysteriousdisappearances of high-rating individuals have been reported. Theseare thought to be cases of misunderstanding, illusory apprehension,and impulse traveling\u2014a result of the unusual stresses of the time.Finally, a few suggestible individuals in various parts of the globe,especially the Indian Peninsula, have declared themselves to be 'gods'and in some way responsible for current events.     It is thought\u2014     The girl switched off the TV and took Theodor's order, explainingcasually, Joe wanted to go to a Kometevskyite meeting, so I took overfor him. When she had prepared Theodor's highball, she announced,I'll have a drink with you gentlemen, and squeezed herself a glass ofpomegranate juice.     The monkeylike figure muttered, Scotch-and-soda, then turned towardEdmund and asked, And what is your reaction to all this, sir?   <doc-sep> Joe squirmed in the chair. He'd been lectured by Hendricks before andit was always an unpleasant experience. The huge man was like a talkingmachine once he got started, a machine that couldn't be stopped.     And the kids are the worst, Hendricks continued. They have JuniorCPA clubs. They keep records of hoodlums like you in little cardboardboxes. They'll stare at you on the street and stare at you throughrestaurant windows while you're eating meals. They'll follow you inpublic rest rooms and watch you out of the corners of their eyeswhile they wash their little hands, and almost every day when you lookback, you'll see a dozen freckle-faced little boys following you half ablock behind, giggling and gaping at you. They'll follow you until theday you die, because you're a freak!     Joe couldn't stand the breath in his face any longer. He rose and pacedthe floor.     And it doesn't end      there     , Joe. It goes on and on. You'll be theobject of every do-gooder and parlor psychologist. Strangers will stopyou on the street and say, 'I'd like to help you, friend.' Then they'llask you queer questions like, 'Did your father reject you when you werea child?' 'Do you like girls?' 'How does it feel to be a DCT FirstClass?' And then there'll be the strangers who hate DCTs. They'll stopyou on the street and insult you, call you names, spit on you and\u2014     Okay, goddam it!      Stop it!          Hendricks stopped, wiped the sweat from his face with a handkerchiefand lit a cigarette.     I'm doing you a favor, Joe. I'm trying to explain something you're toodumb to realize by yourself. We've taught everyone to hate crime andcriminals ... to      hate     them as nothing has ever been hated before.Today a criminal is a freak, an alien. Your life will be a living hellif you don't leave New York. You should go to some small town wherethere aren't many people, or be a hermit, or go to Iceland or\u2014     Joe eyed the huge man suspiciously.       Favor     , did you say? The day youdo      me     a favor\u2014     Hendricks shrugged his shoulders negligently. Not entirely a favor. Iwant to get rid of you. Usually I come up here and sit around and readbooks. But guys like you are a nuisance and take up my time.     I couldn't leave if I wanted to, Joe said. I'm flat broke. Thanks toyour CPA system, a DCT can't get a decent job.  "

        "Query": "What is the location where PICK A CRIME takes place?",
        "Summary_1": "This story takes place in New York City. It begins in a bar with Joe drinking and attempting to get drunk on watered-down alcohol. A girl comes up to him to talk about what he is hiring her to do. The two leave the bar and go down a hall into an alleyway where Joe tries to enact his plan of fake committing a crime. When Joe wakes up after losing consciousness, he is in the police commissioner\u2019s office. When Joe leaves the commissioner\u2019s office, he goes to the subway and heads to John Gralewski\u2019s apartment on Orange St. The apartment has a new wall that is clean compared to other walls caked with dirt and stains. He notices that the building is old with wide hallways. After Joe is caught by the police, he is taken to the hospital for his treatment that lasts months. When Joe wakes up, he sees that there is a crowd of people outside of the hospital waiting to meet him. Joe leaves the hospital in a car with Hendricks but becomes so upset that he eventually exits the car and stands on the sidewalk where he comes to his realization of his imprisonment in his own body. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story is set in New York in the United States. The girl and Jon initially meet in a tavern with tables, and there are robot CPA bartenders serving drinks. Then, Jon and her go to a dark alleyway, where he attempts to get her to frame him for rape. When he wakes up in the police commissioner\u2019s office, the place is devoid of any furniture except for a desk and chairs. The walls are lined with television screens, electronic calculators, and many other machines that are a part of New York\u2019s mechanical police force. There is also a slot for old ID cards to be accepted and print new ones. In the next room, there is also a water cooler. Jon goes through the subway briefly, and the darkened city makes him feel ill because it means that the CPA could be hiding anywhere. There are huge atomic power plants scattered around the country to control the advanced system and supply endless electricity for only four dollars a year. When he reaches apartment 204 at 2141 Orange Street, there is a dimly-lit hallway and new walls. The building is old, and the owner had constructed a wall across the hall. Although it is supposed to be wired with CPA burglarproof devices, the owner has not paid for it. There is also a cubbyhole, but the room itself is barely large enough for a bed, chair, and bureau. The place has old underwear and magazines in the bureau; however, there is a watch buried underneath the pile. At the hospital, there is a large window to look out of. There is a large crowd below the hospital steps; many ask for Joe\u2019s autograph, give him gifts, or take photos. The car that rides is robot-chauffeured, and they later pass by a CPA playground. There are girls and boys playing while CPA psychologists stand on the side. Later, the car drops him off at a sidewalk and goes back into the sea of traffic. \n",

There are hidden microphones and police come soon. Joe is taken to the police commissioner's office - a large room almost unfurnished with a huge amount of machines along the walls. Wen the officer leaves to the next room, Joe takes a look at the small book with names and addresses and goes out. He goes to the subway through the dark city which makes him uneasy. Then he reaches apartment 204 at 2141 Orange street in New York. The building is old and dim but the apartment room is new. The place is small, just enough for a bed, chair and bureau. There is nothing to steal except underwear and old magazines, but Joe finds a watch soon. He runs out and is caught by police, who handcuff him in a helicopter. A couple months later Joe wakes up in a hospital after the end of his treatment. A huge crowd is waiting outside, and it takes a long while to get through it.

        "Article": "Hendricks reached into a pocket, withdrew several bills and extendedthem. I'll loan you some money. You can sign an IOU and pay me back alittle at a time.     Joe waved the money away. Listen, why don't you do me a favor? Whydon't you frame me? If I'm such a nuisance, pin a crime on me\u2014anycrime.     Can't do it. Convicting a man of a crime he didn't commit is aviolation of Civil Rights and a crime in itself.     Umm.     Why don't you take the free psycho treatment? A man doesn't      have     tobe a DCT. With the free treatment, psychologists can remove all yourcriminal tendencies and\u2014     Go to those      head-shrinkers     ?     Hendricks shrugged again. Have it your way.     Joe laughed. If your damned CPA is so all-powerful, why can't you      make     me go?     Violation of Civil Rights.     Damn it, there must be some way you can help me! We both want the samething. We both want to see me convicted of a crime.     How can I help you without committing a crime myself? Hendrickswalked to his desk, opened a drawer and removed a small black book.See this? It contains names and addresses of all the people in NewYork who aren't properly protected. Every week we find people whoaren't protected properly\u2014blind spots in our protection devices. Assoon as we find them, we take steps to install anti-robbery devices,but this is a big city and sometimes it takes days to get the work done.     In the meantime, any one of these people could be robbed. But what canI do? I can't hold this book in front of your nose and say, 'Here, Joe,pick a name and go out and rob him.' He laughed nervously. If I didthat, I'd be committing a crime myself!     He placed the book on the desk top, took a handkerchief from a pocketagain and wiped sweat from his face. Excuse me a minute. I'm dying ofthirst. There's a water cooler in the next room.     Joe stared at the door to the adjoining office as it closed behind thebig man. Hendricks was\u2014unbelievably\u2014offering him a victim, offeringhim a crime!     Almost running to the desk, Joe opened the book, selected a name andaddress and memorized it:      John Gralewski, Apt. 204, 2141 Orange St.       When Hendricks came back, Joe said, Thanks.     Huh? Thanks for what? I didn't do anything.   <doc-sep> I listened to all this in silence. But, I said when she had finished,how did Park manage to have that image created and why did the minelaborers walk out into the Baldric when they contracted the fever?     Grannie Annie frowned. I'm not sure I can answer the first of thosequestions, she replied. You must remember Antlers Park has been onthis moon five years and during that time he must have acquaintedhimself with many of its secrets. Probably he learned long ago justwhat to do to make a cockatoo create a mental image.     As for the men going out into the Baldric, that was more of Park'sdiabolical work. In the walls of the barracks besides those lensbuttons were also miniature electro-hypnotic plates, with the mastercontrolling unit located in that valley. Park knew that when the minerswere in a drugged condition from the effects of the fever they wouldbe susceptible to the machine's lure.... And now, Billy-boy, are youcoming with me?     Coming with you? I repeated. Where?     The old lady lit a cigarette. Pluto maybe, she said. There's a penalcolony there, you know, and that ought to tie in nicely with a newcrime story. I can see it now ... prison break, stolen rocket ship,fugitives lurking in the interplanetary lanes....     Grannie, I laughed. You're incorrigible!    <doc-sep> It was like a fantastic dream come true. Only the dream wasn'tfantastic any more. With the huge atomic power plants scattered acrossthe country and supplying endless electrical power at ridiculouslylow prices, no endeavor that required power was fantastic. The powerrequired to operate the CPA devices cost each taxpayer an average offour dollars a year, and the invention, development and manufacture ofthe devices had cost even less.     And the CPA had attacked crime through society itself, striking atthe individual. In every city there were neon signs that blinkedsubliminally with the statement, CRIME IS FILTH. Listening to a radioor watching television, if a person heard station identification, heinvariably heard or saw just below perception the words CRIME IS FILTH.If he went for a walk or a ride, he saw the endless subliminal postersdeclaring CRIME IS FILTH, and if he read a magazine or newspaper healways found, in those little dead spaces where an editor couldn't fitanything else, the below-perception words CRIME IS FILTH.     It was monotonous and, after a while, a person looked at the words andheard them without thinking about them. And they were imprinted on hissubconscious over and over, year after year, until he knew that crimewas the same as filth and that criminals were filthy things.     Except men like Joe Harper. No system is perfect. Along with thousandsof other DCTs, Joe refused to believe it, and when he reached apartment204 at 2141 Orange Street, he felt as if he'd inherited a gold mine.     The hall was dimly lit, but when he stood before the door numbered 204,he could see that the wall on either side of it was      new     . That is,instead of being covered with dust, dirt and stains as the other wallswere, it was clean. The building was an old one, the hall was wide, andthe owner had obviously constructed a wall across the hall, creatinganother room. If the owner had reported the new room as required bylaw, it would have been wired with CPA burglarproof devices, butevidently he didn't want to pay for installation.     When Joe entered the cubbyhole, he had to stand to one side in order toclose the door behind him. The place was barely large enough for thebed, chair and bureau; it was a place where a man could fall down atnight and sleep, but where no normal man could live day after day.     Fearing that someone might detect him before he actually committed thecrime, Joe hurried to the bureau and searched it.  "

        "Summary_1": "Councillor Magnan dispatches Retief on a mission to deliver information to Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds, notifying them that the aliens, the Soettis, are planning to attack them and to deliver a battle plan and the instructions for converting their anti-acceleration field into a powerful weapon to defend themselves. As a precaution, Retief checks out a needler to take with him. At the airport, he is told that the flight to Jorgensen\u2019s World is fully booked and that he should try again in a couple of weeks; by then, the alien invasion will be over. Under pressure, the clerk tells Retief that the ship is booked for a VIP, and all tourist reservations are canceled. Retief goes to the gate for the flight and punches the ticket taker, forcing his way onto the airship. \n\tRetief makes his way to a room full of expensive luggage and is discovered by Mr. Tony, the man who has claimed the room. When Mr. Tony\u2019s henchmen try to force Retief out of the room, he hefts a large trunk at them and then tosses all the luggage into the hallway. Next, the Captain appears and tries to throw Retief off the ship, but Retief claims the right of the passage under Section Three, Paragraph One of the Uniform Code. The henchmen and the Captain give up for now.\n\tAt dinner, the wait staff ignore Retief, but the chef, Chip, provides him with an excellent meal. Chip dislikes the Captain and Mr. Tony, but he knows they won\u2019t replace him because of his excellent culinary skills. Chip befriends Retief and explains the situation to him. He doesn\u2019t know exactly what the Captain and Mr. Tony are up to, but they make frequent trips to Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds and cut off all tourist travel to the planet. They travel to Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds every few weeks but never pick up any cargo. They allow the Soettis, the aliens who are planning an attack on the Worlds, to board the ships and inspect them because the Soettis are in control of the travel lanes to the planet.\n\tWhen Skaw, a Soetti, demands Retief\u2019s travel papers, Retief attacks him and kills him. The Captain is terrified that the Soettis will kill all of them, and Retief urges him to show some backbone. Retief knows the Soettis won\u2019t make a big deal of the death because they don\u2019t want to draw attention to themselves on the eve of their launch against the Worlds. \n\tLater, Chip informs Retief that the Captain has ordered a change of course to skip Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds and travel on to Alabaster. Retief must reach the Jorgensen\u2019s population ASAP with news of the impending alien attack, so he goes to the Captain\u2019s cabin, catching him off guard, and makes him change the orders for the crew, keeping the ship on track to the Worlds. To prevent the Captain from changing the order, Retief stays with him in his cabin and uses the threat of his needler as a deterrent.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Councillor Magnan assigns Retief on a mission to Jorgensen's Worlds to warn and prepare them for an attack by the Soetti, an alien species characterized by their long legs, turnip-shaped torsos, snapper arms, and aggressive infiltration of Terrestrial space. Since Jorgensen's Worlds are underdeveloped technologically, Magnan wants Retief to help the Jorgies convert their anti-acceleration field into a powerful weapon for their defense. Retief has four weeks to complete his mission. Magnan has booked him a space flight as far as Aldo Cerise, and he warns Retief prior to departure to look out for the Soetti, who are patrolling the customs areas into Jorgensen's Worlds. Retief brings a gun with him in case he encounters trouble. When he arrives to check in to his flight, the clerk informs him that his flight is full, and he has no chance of boarding. Retief finds out the gate number and goes there, knocking out a guard in order to make his way onto the ship. When Retief locates his cabin, he discovers a tall man named Mr. Tony and his henchman, a short, thick-necked man named Marbles are already there. Mr. Tony orders his henchman to remove Retief, but Retief throws his luggage out into the corridor and closes the door. A few minutes later, Marbles returns with the ship's captain and orders Retief to leave the ship. Again, Retief refuses, and the captain's henchmen avoid escalation having seen Retief's previous aggression with Mr. Tony's luggage. At dinner later, the waiters refuse to serve Retief, and he sees the Captain dining with Mr. Tony and his henchmen. Retief meets the ship's chef Chip, who serves him food. Meanwhile, four of Mr. Tony's henchmen come to Retief's table to find out why he wants to go to Jorgensen's Worlds. When Marbles pulls a knife, Chef Chip offers Retief a knife of his own, but he simply punches Marbles in the face, knocking him out. Another thug pulls a gun on Retief, but the Captain defuses the situation, thinking about his career. After everyone leaves, Chip informs Retief that the Captain has a shady business arrangement with Mr. Tony wherein he ferries unknown cargo instead of tourists to Jorgensen's World with frequent visits from the Soetti. Before the conversation has ended, the Captain arrives with a Soetti named Skaw, who wants to question Retief. When Retief refuses to show Skaw his papers, Skaw moves in for the attack, and Retief breaks his slender leg. Skaw flops about the floor until he dies. Horrified, the Captain worries the other Soetti will react violently, but Retief orders him to show them the body of Skaw and some guns, predicting they will retreat. Later, Chip informs Retief that Mr. Tony is deeply upset about Skaw's death, considering they were close business partners; he also tells him the captain has ordered a course-change to bypass Jorgensen's Worlds and head straight to Alabaster.

The Soetti will attack the Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds in less than four weeks and are already patrolling the trade lanes into them, making Retief\u2019s entry sketchy even while hiding his Corps credentials. Magnan gives him a ticket departing in four hours to the Aldo Cerise to start Retief\u2019s trip. However, Retief has to punch out an attendant to actually get on this ship because his ticket has been voided by \u201cVIPs\u201d booking the train up to capacity and bumping him off. Retief goes to his originally assigned cabin, but it is already full of expensive luggage. Two men tell him it\u2019s Mr.Tony\u2019s room and that he needs to leave. The Captain shows up and tries to tell Retief to leave as well, but Retief cites the Uniform Code law that protects confirmed space on interplanetary vessels. \nRetief meets the chef, Chip, in the dining car as he watches the red-haired Captain eat with a table of men, including Mr. Tony. One of the \u201cthugs\u201d dining with the Captain dips a cigar into Retief\u2019s coffee while walking past, and Retief throws the coffee on him and punches him in the chin. Mr. Tony calls on one of his men, Marbles, to take out Retief and he attacks. Chip offers Retief a knife, but he doesn\u2019t take it. The Captain urges them to stop fighting saying he has his \u201ccharter to consider\u201d.\nChip brings Retief a meal in his cabin, and tells him that the Captain and Mr. Tony are in a crooked business arrangement and haven\u2019t let any tourists into Jorgensen's World in 6-8 months. They only make quick stops and never pick up any cargo. The passengers currently aboard are headed to Alabaster. The Soetti board the vessel, and one of them, Skaw, appears at Retief\u2019s cabin with the Captain and demands his papers. Skaw threatens Retief with snapping claws, but Retief refuses and breaks his leg, which leaks green fluid and kills Skaw. \nThe Soetti don\u2019t retaliate when Skaw\u2019s body is returned to them, but the thugs and Mr. Tony are very angry with the Captain, and force him to pass by Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds and go straight to Alabaster. Retief goes to the Captain\u2019s quarters and tries to get him to return to the original course. The Captain initially refuses, but Retief slams his fingers in a drawer and the Captain obliges.

        "Query": "What is the importance of the Soettis in THE FROZEN PLANET?",
        "Summary_1": "The Soettis are involved in some kind of illegal activity with the Captain and Mr. Tony. The Soettis, nicknamed Sweaties, by humans who dislike them, are an alien species who have been moving deep into the sector where the Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds are located. The Soettis are unattractive creatures with skinny legs like a lobster\u2019s and a big chest shaped somewhat like a turnip. They have rubbery heads, and you can see their pulse beating when they get upset. They have tiny arms with toothed pincers at the ends and threaten humans with them. These pincers are incredibly strong and can cut through steel. \nIt has been learned that they are planning to seize Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds by force, a move of open aggression against Terrestrial territory that cannot be overlooked. The headquarters where Retief works has obtained the Soetti War Plan from a defector of Terrestrials who have actually been providing advice to the Soettis, so the plan is for Retief to travel personally to Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds to provide them with this information and also with the schematics that will enable them to convert their anti-acceleration field into a powerful weapon to protect the planets. Reaching the Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds will be challenging because the Soettis are on patrol in the trade lanes where the airships travel to the Worlds. The Soettis look down on Terrestrials and try to assert themselves over them. The Soettis can speak English, so they can communicate with the Terrestrials.\nThe Captain is afraid of the Soettis and worries that when Retief harms Skaw, the Soetties will kill all of the humans. Retief intends for Skaw to go back and tell the other Soettis that they can no longer enter the Terrestrials\u2019 airships and search them. When Skaw dies, the Captain is certain they are done for, but Retief tells him to bluff and show guns when they return the body, and the Soettis will back down. Surprisingly, the Soettis don\u2019t say anything about Skaw\u2019s death, but Mr. Tony is furious. Retief thinks it is good to know that the Soettis are easy to kill.\n",
        "Summary_2": "The Soetti are a hostile alien species that have been infiltrating Terrestrial space. Councillor Magnan and his associates have uncovered their plot to seize Jorgensen's Worlds and assign Retief to travel to the underdeveloped planets to help prepare a defense.  The Soetti are tall creatures with skinny legs, big chests, and round, bulbous torsos. Their heads look rubbery and pulse when they are angry. Soettis have two small arms with pincers for hands that are sharp enough to cut through steel. Magnan warns Retief to be on the lookout for Soettis when he boards his flight for Jorgensen's Worlds, since they tend to patrol the customs areas. They also seem to have some kind of business arrangement with the Captain of the ship that ferries to Jorgensen's World and Mr. Tony, a space thug who employs a number of strong men like Marbles to rough up passengers to Jorgensen's Worlds who might get too curious. Chip informs Retief that the Soetti frequently board the ship, although he is not clear as to their purpose. A Soetti named Skaw confronts Retief and asks to see his papers. When Retief refuses the request, Skaw moves in to attack him. Retief discovers a Soetti weakness when he breaks Skaw's slender leg, spilling greenish blood, and ultimately killing Skaw. Retief demonstrates to the Captain how this can be used as leverage against the hostile aliens.",
        "Summary_3": "Soettis are an alien race of lobster-like crustaceans with skinny legs, big chests and rubbery heads that show their beating pulse. They patrol the trade lanes into the Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds and one of them, Skaw, boards the merchant vessel that Retief is riding on, acting as if he is a Customs Patrol officer. Skaw is tall with tiny hoof-like feet, and a loose mantle that flaps around knobby knees. He wears a metal helmet. Retief easily breaks the joint of one of Skaw\u2019s legs which then leaks green fluid and kills Skaw.\nThey are significant to the story because they are the enemies that Retief is being sent on a Corps mission to clear from the Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds where they are mounting a hostile takeover of Terrestrial space. After Retief discovers how easy they are to kill, he knows he can exploit this weakness to succeed on his mission to reclaim Jorgensen's Worlds for Terrestrials.\n",
        "Summary_4": "The Soettis are an aggressive species that is attempting to seize Jorgensen's Worlds by force. They are much more technologically advanced than the Jorgensen's Worlds, especially when it comes to weaponry. The Soetti look different than the other characters in the story, with skinny legs like lobsters, and big chests that look like turnips. They have hoof-like feet as well. In Retief's quest to defend Jorgensen's Worlds, he finds that they have some kind of shady dealings with Mr. Tony aboard the transport ship from Aldo Cerise.",

Magnan tapped the folder before him.     I have here, he said solemnly, information which will change thatpicture completely. He leaned back and blinked at Retief.   <doc-sep> All right, Mr. Councillor, Retief said. I'll play along; what's inthe folder?     Magnan spread his fingers, folded one down.     First, he said. The Soetti War Plan\u2014in detail. We were fortunateenough to make contact with a defector from a party of renegadeTerrestrials who've been advising the Soetti. He folded anotherfinger. Next, a battle plan for the Jorgensen's people, worked out bythe Theory group. He wrestled a third finger down. Lastly; an UtterTop Secret schematic for conversion of a standard anti-accelerationfield into a potent weapon\u2014a development our systems people have beenholding in reserve for just such a situation.     Is that all? Retief said. You've still got two fingers sticking up.     Magnan looked at the fingers and put them away.     This is no occasion for flippancy, Retief. In the wrong hands, thisinformation could be catastrophic. You'll memorize it before you leavethis building.     I'll carry it, sealed, Retief said. That way nobody can sweat it outof me.     Magnan started to shake his head.     Well, he said. If it's trapped for destruction, I suppose\u2014     I've heard of these Jorgensen's Worlds, Retief said. I remember anagent, a big blond fellow, very quick on the uptake. A wizard withcards and dice. Never played for money, though.     Umm, Magnan said. Don't make the error of personalizing thissituation, Retief. Overall policy calls for a defense of thesebackwater worlds. Otherwise the Corps would allow history to follow itsnatural course, as always.     When does this attack happen?     Less than four weeks.     That doesn't leave me much time.     I have your itinerary here. Your accommodations are clear as far asAldo Cerise. You'll have to rely on your ingenuity to get you the restof the way.     That's a pretty rough trip, Mr. Councillor. Suppose I don't make it?     Magnan looked sour. Someone at a policy-making level has chosen to putall our eggs in one basket, Retief. I hope their confidence in you isnot misplaced.     This antiac conversion; how long does it take?     A skilled electronics crew can do the job in a matter of minutes. TheJorgensens can handle it very nicely; every other man is a mechanic ofsome sort.     Retief opened the envelope Magnan handed him and looked at the ticketsinside.     Less than four hours to departure time, he said. I'd better notstart any long books.     You'd better waste no time getting over to Indoctrination, Magnansaid.     Retief stood up. If I hurry, maybe I can catch the cartoon.     The allusion escapes me, Magnan said coldly. And one last word. TheSoetti are patrolling the trade lanes into Jorgensen's Worlds; don'tget yourself interned.     I'll tell you what, Retief said soberly. In a pinch, I'll mentionyour name.     You'll be traveling with Class X credentials, Magnan snapped. Theremust be nothing to connect you with the Corps.     They'll never guess, Retief said. I'll pose as a gentleman.     You'd better be getting started, Magnan said, shuffling papers.     You're right, Retief said. If I work at it, I might manage asnootful by takeoff. He went to the door. No objection to my checkingout a needler, is there?     Magnan looked up. I suppose not. What do you want with it?     Just a feeling I've got.     Please yourself.     Some day, Retief said, I may take you up on that.      II     Retief put down the heavy travel-battered suitcase and leaned on thecounter, studying the schedules chalked on the board under the legendALDO CERISE\u2014INTERPLANETARY. A thin clerk in a faded sequined blouseand a plastic snakeskin cummerbund groomed his fingernails, watchingRetief from the corner of his eye.     Retief glanced at him.     The clerk nipped off a ragged corner with rabbitlike front teeth andspat it on the floor.     Was there something? he said.     Two twenty-eight, due out today for the Jorgensen group, Retief said.Is it on schedule?     The clerk sampled the inside of his right cheek, eyed Retief. Filledup. Try again in a couple of weeks.     What time does it leave?     I don't think\u2014     Let's stick to facts, Retief said. Don't try to think. What time isit due out?     The clerk smiled pityingly. It's my lunch hour, he said. I'll beopen in an hour. He held up a thumb nail, frowned at it.     If I have to come around this counter, Retief said, I'll feed thatthumb to you the hard way.     The clerk looked up and opened his mouth. Then he caught Retief's eye,closed his mouth and swallowed.     Like it says there, he said, jerking a thumb at the board. Lifts inan hour. But you won't be on it, he added.     Retief looked at him.     Some ... ah ... VIP's required accommodation, he said. He hookeda finger inside the sequined collar. All tourist reservations werecanceled. You'll have to try to get space on the Four-Planet Line shipnext\u2014     Which gate? Retief said.     For ... ah...?     For the two twenty-eight for Jorgensen's Worlds, Retief said.     Well, the clerk said. Gate 19, he added quickly. But\u2014     Retief picked up his suitcase and walked away toward the glare signreading      To Gates 16-30     .     Another smart alec, the clerk said behind him.   <doc-sep> The alien clicked both pincers with a sharp report, and in the sameinstant Retief half-turned to the left, leaned away from the alienand drove his right foot against the slender leg above the bulbousknee-joint. Skaw screeched and floundered, greenish fluid spatteringfrom the burst joint.     I told you he was brittle, Retief said. Next time you invite piratesaboard, don't bother to call.     Jesus, what did you do! They'll kill us! the captain gasped, staringat the figure flopping on the floor.     Cart poor old Skaw back to his boat, Retief said. Tell him to passthe word. No more illegal entry and search of Terrestrial vessels inTerrestrial space.     Hey, Chip said. He's quit kicking.     The captain bent over Skaw, gingerly rolled him over. He leaned closeand sniffed.     He's dead. The captain stared at Retief. We're all dead men, hesaid. These Soetti got no mercy.     They won't need it. Tell 'em to sheer off; their fun is over.     They got no more emotions than a blue crab\u2014     You bluff easily, Captain. Show a few guns as you hand the body back.We know their secret now.     What secret? I\u2014     Don't be no dumber than you got to, Cap'n, Chip said. Sweaties dieeasy; that's the secret.     Maybe you got a point, the captain said, looking at Retief. All theygot's a three-man scout. It could work.     He went out, came back with two crewmen. They hauled the dead aliengingerly into the hall.     Maybe I can run a bluff on the Soetti, the captain said, looking backfrom the door. But I'll be back to see you later.     You don't scare us, Cap'n, Chip said. Him and Mr. Tony and all hisgoons. You hit 'em where they live, that time. They're pals o' theseSweaties. Runnin' some kind o' crooked racket.     You'd better take the captain's advice, Chip. There's no point in yourgetting involved in my problems.     They'd of killed you before now, Mister, if they had any guts. That'swhere we got it over these monkeys. They got no guts.     They act scared, Chip. Scared men are killers.     They don't scare me none. Chip picked up the tray. I'll scout arounda little and see what's goin' on. If the Sweaties figure to do anythingabout that Skaw feller they'll have to move fast; they won't trynothin' close to port.     Don't worry, Chip. I have reason to be pretty sure they won't doanything to attract a lot of attention in this sector just now.     Chip looked at Retief. You ain't no tourist, Mister. I know that much.You didn't come out here for fun, did you?     That, Retief said, would be a hard one to answer.      IV     Retief awoke at a tap on his door.     It's me, Mister. Chip.     Come on in.     The chef entered the room, locking the door.     You shoulda had that door locked. He stood by the door, listening,then turned to Retief.     You want to get to Jorgensen's perty bad, don't you, Mister?     That's right, Chip.     Mr. Tony give the captain a real hard time about old Skaw. TheSweaties didn't say nothin'. Didn't even act surprised, just took theremains and pushed off. But Mr. Tony and that other crook they callMarbles, they was fit to be tied. Took the cap'n in his cabin andtalked loud at him fer half a hour. Then the cap'n come out and givesome orders to the Mate.     Retief sat up and reached for a cigar.     Mr. Tony and Skaw were pals, eh?     He hated Skaw's guts. But with him it was business. Mister, you got agun?     A 2mm needler. Why?     The orders cap'n give was to change course fer Alabaster. We'reby-passin' Jorgensen's Worlds. We'll feel the course change any minute.     Retief lit the cigar, reached under the mattress and took out ashort-barreled pistol. He dropped it in his pocket, looked at Chip.     Maybe it was a good thought, at that. Which way to the Captain'scabin?  "

        "Query": "What is the importance of Jorgensen's Worlds as described in THE FROZEN PLANET?",
        "Summary_1": "Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds are a group of four planets, or actually two double planets, and are located close to an unimportant star known as DRI-G 33987. These planets are freezing cold and are undeveloped and mostly populated with farmers and traders. They have a small amount of industry, just enough to support their merchant fleet. However, the governing body in this sector of space has received word that an alien race, the Soetti, has plans to seize Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds. The governing body isn\u2019t going to sit by and let the aliens take over Terrestrial-occupied territory. Retief is on a mission to deliver information to Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds that will enable them to defend themselves from the alien attack, providing them with the Soettis War Plan, a battle plan for the planets, and the schematics that will enable them, in a matter of minutes, to convert their anti-acceleration fields into a powerful weapon. Reaching Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds will be challenging because the Soetti are patroling the trade lanes to the planet. Their successful defense against the Soetti hinges on Retief\u2019s reaching the planets in time for them to make the conversions before the aliens' attack.",
        "Summary_2": "Jorgensen's Worlds consist of four cold planets: Two double planets that hover near a star called DRI-G 33987. The people who live on Jorgensen's Worlds are called \"Jorgies\" and most of them live on Svea because it is the least-frozen among the four planetes. Technologically underdeveloped, Jorgensen's Worlds make their industries in farming and trading and have nothing in the way of defense against hostile attack. The Soetti plan to seize Jorgensen's Worlds as part of their efforts to continue infiltrating Terrestrial space; this plan was revealed to Councillor Magnan and his associates by a defector from a group of Terrestrials who had been working with the Soetti. Councillor Magnan sends Retief on the four-day trip to help them convert their anti-acceleration field into a powerful weapon that may be used to defend themselves against the Soetti. Tourism to Jorgensen's Wolrds has recently come to a stand-still, but a ship piloted by the Captain and occupied by Mr. Tony, his henchmen, and the attendant Soetti ferries frequently to the planets carrying a mystery cargoload. The Captain wants to avoid stopping at Jorgensen's Worlds when he realizes Retief is slowly uncovering the plot, so he orders a course-change to Alabaster. But Retief stops him.",
        "Summary_3": "There are four planets in Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds. Two sets of double planets that are close to star DRI-G 33987. Chip, the chef on the merchant vessel that Retief is riding, describes that one of them is as cold as hell and the other three are colder. Most of the population lives on the warmest of the planets, Svea. Jorgensen's Worlds are technologically undeveloped, populated by mostly farmers or traders, with industry playing only a minor economic role that barely supports the Merchant Fleet to make runs to them. They are significant because they are within Terrestrial space and an alien race, the Soetti, are trying to claim them by hostile takeover which Retief is sent by the Corps to stop. The Jorgensen's Worlds have essentially no ability to defend themselves since they don't have an armed force, so they can only be saved by the Corps.",
        "Summary_4": "Jorgensen's Worlds is the name used for four planets grouped around a star named DRI-G 33987. These worlds are colder than most other planets, with Svea being the least cold. Jorgensen's Worlds are inhabited by farmers and traders. They are technologically underdeveloped, especially when it comes to weapons and defense. Many of the inhabitants of Jorgensen's Worlds are mechanics. Jorgensen's Worlds are significant because they are the target of the Soetti, who hope to take the worlds by force. This is in open opposition to the organization for which Retief works, and he is given the mission of delivering advanced weaponry and knowledge to the people of Jorgensen's Worlds in order to protect it.",

I'll beopen in an hour. He held up a thumb nail, frowned at it.     If I have to come around this counter, Retief said, I'll feed thatthumb to you the hard way.     The clerk looked up and opened his mouth. Then he caught Retief's eye,closed his mouth and swallowed.     Like it says there, he said, jerking a thumb at the board. Lifts inan hour. But you won't be on it, he added.     Retief looked at him.     Some ... ah ... VIP's required accommodation, he said. He hookeda finger inside the sequined collar. All tourist reservations werecanceled. You'll have to try to get space on the Four-Planet Line shipnext\u2014     Which gate? Retief said.     For ... ah...?     For the two twenty-eight for Jorgensen's Worlds, Retief said.     Well, the clerk said. Gate 19, he added quickly. But\u2014     Retief picked up his suitcase and walked away toward the glare signreading      To Gates 16-30     .     Another smart alec, the clerk said behind him.  "

        "Query": "What is the importance of Chip in THE FROZEN PLANET?",
        "Summary_1": "Chip is the chef on the airship that is traveling to Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds. His role as chef enables him to have contact with the Captain, crew, and passengers, which makes him extremely valuable to Retief. In addition, he likes Retief since he stands up to Mr. Tony and the Captain, neither of whom Chip can stand. When the serving staff ignore Retief, Chip serves Retief and later continues serving him meals in his room. When Retief is threatened by one of Mr. Tony\u2019s goons wielding a knife, Chip passes a knife from the kitchen to Retief to defend himself. Most importantly, Chip shares his wealth of knowledge with Retief and assists him. Chip informs Retief that Mr. Tony and the Captain are involved in some kind of crooked business deal with each other, adding that there haven\u2019t been any tourist to Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds for the last six to eight months. He also tells Retief about the Soettis boarding the ship and searching it. At the end of the story when Retief is holding the Captain in his cabin to prevent him from changing the orders and bypassing Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds, Chip keeps an eye on what is going on with the rest of the passengers to report back to Retief. Without Chip\u2019s help, Retief might not have been as successful in thwarting the Captain and Mr. Tony\u2019s plan to bypass Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Chip is the chef on the ship that ferries passengers and cargo to planet clusters like Jorgensen's Worlds and even further into Terrestrial space to planets like Alabaster. Friendly and helpful to Retief, Chip speaks to him through a panel in the wall that he slides open and closed whenever he is ready to serve food or dish out some useful information. Chip cannot stand the Soetti, whom he calls \"Sweaties\", because of their condescension and harassment. He also doesn't like the Captain of the ship, Mr. Tony, or any of his henchmen. When the waiters in the dining area ignore Retief, Chip whips him up a thirty-two-ounce Delmonico with mushrooms and garlic butter as well as some coffee with brandy and baked Alaska. When Marbles threatens retief with a knife, Chip offers Retief a french knife through his sliding panel in order to defend himself. Later, Chip helps Retief again by providing him information about Mr. Tony's business relationship with Skaw and the Captain's order to change course for Alabaster. While Retief holds the Captain at gunpoint to prevent him from following through on that order, Chip keeps watch in the corridor. ",
        "Summary_3": "Chip is the chef on the Merchant Vessel that Retief has boarded to travel to Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds to prepare them for the Soetti attack. Chip is significant because he is the guide of the story, giving Retief key information to make decisions, such as that the Captain is engaged in crooked business with Mr. Tony and the thugs, and that vessel is changing course unexpectedly to pass by the Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds which would jeopardize Retief\u2019s mission entirely. Chip is friendly to Retief from their first meeting and supportive of his mission since he does not trust the Soetti and he thinks they look at men like worms. Chip takes liberties to deliver food to Retief in his room, which allows them to have private conversations about the Captain and Mr.Tony, and will support Retief with coffee during the 18 hours he has to stay awake to watch the Captain and ensure he stays on course to Jorgensen's Worlds.",
        "Summary_4": "Chip is the ship's cook and happens to be the best cook in the Merchant Service. Chip doesn't care for the captain of the ship or the Soetti, who he derisively calls the \"Sweaties.\" Chip is considerably older than Retief but he sympathizes with the younger man when the waiters of the ship refuse to wait on him and he feeds Retief. Chip feeds Retief then goes so far as to assist him in fighting the Soetti that comes on board named Skaw. It is through Chip that Retief finds out the situation on the ship and uncovers that Mr. Tony is working with the Soetti.",
        "Article": "II     The stunning injustice of that accusation came close to costing ChipWarren his life. For a split second he stood motionless in the doorway,gaping lips forming denial. Words which were never to be uttered, forsuddenly a raw-boned miner wrenched a Moeller from its holster, leveledand fired.     The hot tongue of death licked hungrily at the young spaceman's cheek,scorched air crackled in his eardrums. Now was no time to squanderin vain argument. Chip ducked, spun, and hurled himself through thedoorway. There still remained one hope. That he might catch the realmurderer, and in that way clear himself....     But the door led to a small, deserted vestibule, and it to an alleywaybehind Xu'ul's Solarest. Viewing that maze of byways and passages, Chipknew his hope was futile. There remained but one thing to do. Get outof here. But quick!     It was no hard task. The labyrinth swallowed him as it had engulfed thescarred killer; in a few minutes even the footsteps of his pursuerscould no longer be heard. And Chip worked his cautious way back to thespaceport, and to the bin wherein was cradled the      Chickadee     .     Syd Palmer looked up in surprise as Chip let himself in theelectro-lock. The chubby engineer gasped, Salvation, look what the catdrug in! His high-flying Nibs! What's the matter, Chip? Night-life toomuch for you?     Never mind that now! panted Chip. Is this tin can ready to roll?Warm the hypos. We're lifting gravs\u2014     Palmer said anxiously, Now, wait a minute! The men haven't quitefinished plating the hull, Chip!     Can't help that! We've got important business. In a very fewminutes\u2014      Ahh!     There he goes now! Chip had gone to the      perilens     themoment he entered the ship; now he saw in its reflector that which hehad expected. The gushing orange spume of a spaceship roaring from itscradle. Hurry, Syd!     There were a lot of things Syd Palmer wanted to ask. He wanted to know      who     went      where     ; he was bursting with curiosity about the importantbusiness which had brought his pal back from town in such a rush; hiskeen eye also had detected a needle-gun burn on Chip's coat-sleeve. Buthe was too good a companion to waste time now on such trivia.     O.Q., he snapped. It's your pigeon!     And he disappeared. They heard his voice calling to the workmen, thescuff of equipment being disengaged from the      Chickadee's     hull, thethin, high whine of warming hypatomics. Salvation looked at Warrenquizzically.     It smells, he ventured gently, like trouble.     It is trouble, Chip told him. Plenty trouble!     In that case\u2014 said the old man mildly\u2014I guess I'd better get therotor stripped for action. He stepped to the gunnery turret, droppedthe fore-irons and stripped their weapon for action. 'Be ye men ofpeace,' he intoned, 'but gird firmly thy loins for righteous battle!'Thus saith the Lord God which is Jehovah. Selah!     Then came Syd's cry from the depths of the hyporoom.     All set, Chip! Lift gravs!     Warren's finger found a stud. And with a gusty roar the      Chickadee     rocketed into space on a pillar of flame.   <doc-sep> III     From a billion miles away, from a bourne unguessable thousands oflight-years distant, came the faint, far whisper of a voice. Nearer andnearer it came, and ever faster, till it throbbed upon Chip's eardrumswith booming savagery.     \u2014coming to, now. Good! We'll soon find out\u2014     Chip opened his eyes, too dazed, at first, to understand the situationin which he found himself. Gone was the familiar control-turret of the      Chickadee     , gone the bulger into which he had so hastily clambered. Helay on the parched, rocky soil of a\u2014a something. A planetoid, perhaps.And he was surrounded by a motley crew of strangers: scum of all theplanets that circle the Sun....     Then recollection flooded back upon him, sudden and complete. Thechase ... the call of the fateful Lorelei ... the crash! New strength,born of anger, surged through him. He lifted his head.     My\u2014my companions? he demanded weakly.     The leader of those who encircled him, a mighty hulk of a man, massiveof shoulder and thigh, black-haired, with an unshaven blue jaw,raven-bright eyes and a jutting, aquiline nose like the beak of a hawk,loosed a satisfied grunt.     Ah! Back to normal, eh, sailor? Damn near time!     Climbing to his feet sent a swift wave of giddiness through Chip\u2014buthe managed it. He fought down the vertigo which threatened to overwhelmhim, and confronted the big man boldly.     What, he stormed, is the meaning of this?     The giant stared at him for a moment, his jaw slack. Then hisraven-bright eyes glittered; he slapped a trunklike thigh and guffawedin boisterous mirth.     Hear that? he roared to his companions. Quite a guy, ain't he?'What's the meanin' o' this?' he asks! Game little fightin' cock, hey?Then he sobered abruptly, and a grim light replaced the amusement inhis eyes. Here was not a man to be trifled with, Chip realized. Histone assumed a biting edge. The meanin' is, my bucko, he answeredmirthlessly, that you've run afoul o' your last reef. Unless you havea sane head on your shoulders, and you're willing to talk fast andstraight!     Talk?     Don't stall. We've already unloaded your bins. We found it. And a nicehaul, too. Thanks for lettin' us know it was on the way. The burly onechuckled coarsely. We'd have took it, anyway, but you helped mattersout by comin' to us.     Johnny Haldane had been right, then. Chip remembered his friend'sominous warning. \u2014if your message was intercepted, you may haveplayed into the hands of\u2014 He said slowly, Then you      are     theLorelei's men?     The who? Never mind that, bucko, just talk. That ekalastron\u2014where didit come from?     And it occurred to Warren suddenly that although the big man      did     holdthe whip hand, he was still not in possession of the most importantsecret of all! While the location of the ekalastron mine remained asecret, a deadlock existed.     And if I won't tell\u2014? he countered shrewdly.     Why, then, sailor\u2014 The pirate leader's hamlike fists tightened, anda cold light glinted in his eyes\u2014why, then I guess maybe I'll have tobeat it out o' you!   <doc-sep>    THE FROZEN PLANET     By Keith Laumer     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Worlds of If Science Fiction, September 1961.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      It is rather unusual, Magnan said, to assign an officer of your rankto courier duty, but this is an unusual mission.     Retief sat relaxed and said nothing. Just before the silence grewawkward, Magnan went on.     There are four planets in the group, he said. Two double planets,all rather close to an unimportant star listed as DRI-G 33987. They'recalled Jorgensen's Worlds, and in themselves are of no importancewhatever. However, they lie deep in the sector into which the Soettihave been penetrating.     Now\u2014 Magnan leaned forward and lowered his voice\u2014we have learnedthat the Soetti plan a bold step forward. Since they've met noopposition so far in their infiltration of Terrestrial space, theyintend to seize Jorgensen's Worlds by force.     Magnan leaned back, waiting for Retief's reaction. Retief drewcarefully on his cigar and looked at Magnan. Magnan frowned.     This is open aggression, Retief, he said, in case I haven't mademyself clear. Aggression on Terrestrial-occupied territory by an alienspecies. Obviously, we can't allow it.     Magnan drew a large folder from his desk.     A show of resistance at this point is necessary. Unfortunately,Jorgensen's Worlds are technologically undeveloped areas. They'refarmers or traders. Their industry is limited to a minor role intheir economy\u2014enough to support the merchant fleet, no more. The warpotential, by conventional standards, is nil.     Magnan tapped the folder before him.     I have here, he said solemnly, information which will change thatpicture completely. He leaned back and blinked at Retief.  "

        "Query": "What kind of connection exists between Captain and Mr. Tony in THE FROZEN PLANET?",
        "Summary_1": "Mr. Tony is a tall, florid man with expensive clothes and a massive paunch. He is also used to getting his way. The Captain and Mr. Tony are involved in an illegal deal with the Soettis, so the two men are business associates, although they don\u2019t much like each other. Together, they have cut off all tourism to Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds for the past six to eight months; the airlines won\u2019t provide any bookings for passengers; however, the Captain\u2019s airship has at least a dozen empty rooms. Mr. Tony has several henchmen working for him who do his \u201cdirty business\u201d of roughhandling anyone who interferes with Mr. Tony\u2019s business. Whatever their business is, it involves frequent trips to Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds without taking any cargo there. Mr. Tony seems to hold power over the Captain.\n\tThe Captain is a thin, leathery-skinned man who wears white ducks, a blue turtleneck, and a peaked cap that he tilts rakishly over one eye. He isn\u2019t a very strong person or leader. He tries to get Mr. Tony\u2019s men to throw Retief off the ship, but they refuse to do so when Retief warns them not to try and when they realize he is the person who picked up Mr. Tony\u2019s trunk and threw it. The Captain has ordered Retief to get off the ship but backs down when the men refuse to touch Retief. He apparently tells the wait staff in the restaurant to refuse service to Retief because they all ignore him. And when the Captain warns Mr. Tony\u2019s henchmen not to shoot Retief on his airship because it could threaten his charter, one of them talks back and tells him he won\u2019t need it for long. Retief has the distinct impression that Mr. Tony has something on the Captain that forces the Captain to cooperate with him and places him at a lower level than Mr. Tony.  \n",
        "Summary_2": "The Captain and Mr. Tony are friends, which Retief discovers when he sees them dining together and occasionally glancing over at his table as the waiters ignore him. Chip fills him in on their close business association, which includes an arrangement to ferry some unknown cargo to Jorgensen's Worlds. Mr. Tony is a VIP guest on the Captain's ship and takes Retief's room, but Retief kicks him out, which draws the ire of Mr. Tony and his henchmen. It appears that Mr. Tony is a thug whose men work as guards of whatever cargo is being transported to Jorgensen's Worlds. The Captain and Mr. Tony are also working with the Soetti, who visit the ship during each flight, according to Chip. Although the exact details of their plot are never revealed, Retief assumes it has something to do with the Soetti's overall plan to seize Jorgensen's Worlds in their overall infiltration of Terrestrial space. Although the Captain and Mr. Tony are friendly, the Captain is concerned about his charter, and he draws the line when Mr. Tony's men come for Retief with a gun. He calls off his henchman and leaves.",
        "Summary_3": "The Captain is operating a Merchant Vessel transiting between Earth and distant worlds to deliver and retrieve passengers and cargo. However, he has fallen into crooked business with Mr. Tony, who is a violent ring leader closely connected with the Soettis who are trying to violently take control of the Terrestrial space of Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds. For the last 6-8 months they have not delivered any tourists to Jorgensen's Worlds, and never pick up any cargo, which is highly suspicious. \nMr. Tony deals closely with the Soettis, and is very upset when the Soetti Skaw is killed and the body has to be returned to them. Skaw boards the Merchant Vessel to check Retief\u2019s papers even though he has no authority, and Retief kills him by breaking his leg joint which leaks green fluid. Mr. Tony and one of his \u201cthugs\u201d, Marbles, yell at the Captain for half an hour in his cabin after this incident and force him to change course to not stop at Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds, demonstrating that Mr. Tony has control over the Captain in their relationship.\n",
        "Summary_4": "The captain has given up control of the ship to Mr. Tony and has basically become one of his underlings. This is most evident when the captain attempts to throw Retief out of Mr. Tony's room and when he attempts to reroute the ship to Alabaster when Retief beats up Mr. Tony's goons. Chip says that the captain has a crooked business agreement with Mr. Tony, but it becomes clear later in the story that the business agreement is really controlled by the Soetti. The captain says he has no control over Skaw, the Soetti that comes aboard the ship, and becomes very nervous when Retief kills Skaw. ",
        "Article": "Five minutes passed before the door rattled and burst open.     Retief looked up. A gaunt leathery-skinned man wearing white ducks, ablue turtleneck sweater and a peaked cap tilted raffishly over one eyestared at Retief.     Is this the joker? he grated.     The thick-necked man edged past him, looked at Retief and snorted,That's him, sure.     I'm captain of this vessel, the first man said. You've got twominutes to haul your freight out of here, buster.     When you can spare the time from your other duties, Retief said,take a look at Section Three, Paragraph One, of the Uniform Code.That spells out the law on confirmed space on vessels engaged ininterplanetary commerce.     A space lawyer. The captain turned. Throw him out, boys.     Two big men edged into the cabin, looking at Retief.     Go on, pitch him out, the captain snapped.     Retief put his cigar in an ashtray, and swung his feet off the bunk.     Don't try it, he said softly.     One of the two wiped his nose on a sleeve, spat on his right palm, andstepped forward, then hesitated.     Hey, he said. This the guy tossed the trunk off the wall?     That's him, the thick-necked man called. Spilled Mr. Tony'spossessions right on the deck.     Deal me out, the bouncer said. He can stay put as long as he wantsto. I signed on to move cargo. Let's go, Moe.     You'd better be getting back to the bridge, Captain, Retief said.We're due to lift in twenty minutes.     The thick-necked man and the Captain both shouted at once. TheCaptain's voice prevailed.     \u2014twenty minutes ... uniform Code ... gonna do?     Close the door as you leave, Retief said.     The thick-necked man paused at the door. We'll see you when you comeout.      III     Four waiters passed Retief's table without stopping. A fifth leanedagainst the wall nearby, a menu under his arm.     At a table across the room, the Captain, now wearing a dress uniformand with his thin red hair neatly parted, sat with a table of malepassengers. He talked loudly and laughed frequently, casting occasionalglances Retief's way.     A panel opened in the wall behind Retief's chair. Bright blue eyespeered out from under a white chef's cap.     Givin' you the cold shoulder, heh, Mister?     Looks like it, old-timer, Retief said. Maybe I'd better go join theskipper. His party seems to be having all the fun.     Feller has to be mighty careless who he eats with to set over there.     I see your point.     You set right where you're at, Mister. I'll rustle you up a plate.     Five minutes later, Retief cut into a thirty-two ounce Delmonico backedup with mushrooms and garlic butter.     I'm Chip, the chef said. I don't like the Cap'n. You can tell him Isaid so. Don't like his friends, either. Don't like them dern Sweaties,look at a man like he was a worm.     You've got the right idea on frying a steak, Chip. And you've got theright idea on the Soetti, too, Retief said. He poured red wine into aglass. Here's to you.     Dern right, Chip said. Dunno who ever thought up broiling 'em.Steaks, that is. I got a Baked Alaska coming up in here for dessert.You like brandy in yer coffee?     Chip, you're a genius.     Like to see a feller eat, Chip said. I gotta go now. If you needanything, holler.     Retief ate slowly. Time always dragged on shipboard. Four days toJorgensen's Worlds. Then, if Magnan's information was correct,there would be four days to prepare for the Soetti attack. It was atemptation to scan the tapes built into the handle of his suitcase. Itwould be good to know what Jorgensen's Worlds would be up against.     Retief finished the steak, and the chef passed out the baked Alaska andcoffee. Most of the other passengers had left the dining room. Mr. Tonyand his retainers still sat at the Captain's table.     As Retief watched, four men arose from the table and sauntered acrossthe room. The first in line, a stony-faced thug with a broken ear, tooka cigar from his mouth as he reached the table. He dipped the lightedend in Retief's coffee, looked at it, and dropped it on the tablecloth.     The others came up, Mr. Tony trailing.     You must want to get to Jorgensen's pretty bad, the thug said in agrating voice. What's your game, hick?     Retief looked at the coffee cup, picked it up.     I don't think I want my coffee, he said. He looked at the thug. Youdrink it.     The thug squinted at Retief. A wise hick, he began.     With a flick of the wrist, Retief tossed the coffee into the thug'sface, then stood and slammed a straight right to the chin. The thugwent down.     Retief looked at Mr. Tony, still standing open-mouthed.     You can take your playmates away now, Tony, he said. And don'tbother to come around yourself. You're not funny enough.     Mr. Tony found his voice.     Take him, Marbles! he growled.     The thick-necked man slipped a hand inside his tunic and brought out along-bladed knife. He licked his lips and moved in.     Retief heard the panel open beside him.     Here you go, Mister, Chip said. Retief darted a glance; a well-honedfrench knife lay on the sill.     Thanks, Chip, Retief said. I won't need it for these punks.     Thick-neck lunged and Retief hit him square in the face, knocking himunder the table. The other man stepped back, fumbling a power pistolfrom his shoulder holster.     Aim that at me, and I'll kill you, Retief said.     Go on, burn him! Mr. Tony shouted. Behind him, the captain appeared,white-faced.     Put that away, you! he yelled. What kind of\u2014     Shut up, Mr. Tony said. Put it away, Hoany. We'll fix this bumlater.     Not on this vessel, you won't, the captain said shakily. I got mycharter to consider.     Ram your charter, Hoany said harshly. You won't be needing it long.     Button your floppy mouth, damn you! Mr. Tony snapped. He looked atthe man on the floor. Get Marbles out of here. I ought to dump theslob.     He turned and walked away. The captain signaled and two waiters cameup. Retief watched as they carted the casualty from the dining room.     The panel opened.     I usta be about your size, when I was your age, Chip said. Youhandled them pansies right. I wouldn't give 'em the time o' day.     How about a fresh cup of coffee, Chip? Retief said.     Sure, Mister. Anything else?     I'll think of something, Retief said. This is shaping up into one ofthose long days.   <doc-sep> The alien clicked both pincers with a sharp report, and in the sameinstant Retief half-turned to the left, leaned away from the alienand drove his right foot against the slender leg above the bulbousknee-joint. Skaw screeched and floundered, greenish fluid spatteringfrom the burst joint.     I told you he was brittle, Retief said. Next time you invite piratesaboard, don't bother to call.     Jesus, what did you do! They'll kill us! the captain gasped, staringat the figure flopping on the floor.     Cart poor old Skaw back to his boat, Retief said. Tell him to passthe word. No more illegal entry and search of Terrestrial vessels inTerrestrial space.     Hey, Chip said. He's quit kicking.     The captain bent over Skaw, gingerly rolled him over. He leaned closeand sniffed.     He's dead. The captain stared at Retief. We're all dead men, hesaid. These Soetti got no mercy.     They won't need it. Tell 'em to sheer off; their fun is over.     They got no more emotions than a blue crab\u2014     You bluff easily, Captain. Show a few guns as you hand the body back.We know their secret now.     What secret? I\u2014     Don't be no dumber than you got to, Cap'n, Chip said. Sweaties dieeasy; that's the secret.     Maybe you got a point, the captain said, looking at Retief. All theygot's a three-man scout. It could work.     He went out, came back with two crewmen. They hauled the dead aliengingerly into the hall.     Maybe I can run a bluff on the Soetti, the captain said, looking backfrom the door. But I'll be back to see you later.     You don't scare us, Cap'n, Chip said. Him and Mr. Tony and all hisgoons. You hit 'em where they live, that time. They're pals o' theseSweaties. Runnin' some kind o' crooked racket.     You'd better take the captain's advice, Chip. There's no point in yourgetting involved in my problems.     They'd of killed you before now, Mister, if they had any guts. That'swhere we got it over these monkeys. They got no guts.     They act scared, Chip. Scared men are killers.     They don't scare me none. Chip picked up the tray. I'll scout arounda little and see what's goin' on. If the Sweaties figure to do anythingabout that Skaw feller they'll have to move fast; they won't trynothin' close to port.     Don't worry, Chip. I have reason to be pretty sure they won't doanything to attract a lot of attention in this sector just now.     Chip looked at Retief. You ain't no tourist, Mister. I know that much.You didn't come out here for fun, did you?     That, Retief said, would be a hard one to answer.      IV     Retief awoke at a tap on his door.     It's me, Mister. Chip.     Come on in.     The chef entered the room, locking the door.     You shoulda had that door locked. He stood by the door, listening,then turned to Retief.     You want to get to Jorgensen's perty bad, don't you, Mister?     That's right, Chip.     Mr. Tony give the captain a real hard time about old Skaw. TheSweaties didn't say nothin'. Didn't even act surprised, just took theremains and pushed off. But Mr. Tony and that other crook they callMarbles, they was fit to be tied. Took the cap'n in his cabin andtalked loud at him fer half a hour. Then the cap'n come out and givesome orders to the Mate.     Retief sat up and reached for a cigar.     Mr. Tony and Skaw were pals, eh?     He hated Skaw's guts. But with him it was business. Mister, you got agun?     A 2mm needler. Why?     The orders cap'n give was to change course fer Alabaster. We'reby-passin' Jorgensen's Worlds. We'll feel the course change any minute.     Retief lit the cigar, reached under the mattress and took out ashort-barreled pistol. He dropped it in his pocket, looked at Chip.     Maybe it was a good thought, at that. Which way to the Captain'scabin?   <doc-sep> Nagurski brought out a pipe. He would have a pipe, I decided.     No, not always. I was like you at first. Fresh from the cosmic energytest lab, suspicious of everything, trying to tell the old hands whatto do. But I learned that they are pretty smart boys; they know whatthey are doing. You can rely on them absolutely.     I leaned forward, elbows on knees. Let me tell      you     a thing,Nagurski. Your trust of these damn-fool spacemen is why you are nolonger a captain. You can't trust anything out here in space, much lesshuman nature. Even I know that much!     He was pained. If you don't trust the men, they won't trust you, Gav.     They don't have to trust me. All they have to do is      obey     me or, byJupiter, get frozen stiff and thawed out just in time for court-marshalback home. Listen, I continued earnestly, these men aren't going tothink of me\u2014of      us     , the officers, as their leaders. As far as thecrew is concerned, Ordinary Spaceman Quade is the best man on thisship.     He      is     a good man, Nagurski said. You mustn't be jealous of hisstatus.     The dog growled. He must have sensed what I almost did to Nagurski.     Never mind that for now, I said wearily. What was your idea forgetting our exploration parties through this transphasia?     There's only one idea for that, said Quade, ducking his long headand stepping through the connecting hatch. With the Captain'spermission....     Go ahead, Quade, tell him, Nagurski invited.     There's only one way to wade through transphasia with anyreliability, Quade told me. You keep some kind of physical contactwith the spaceship. Parties are strung out on guide line, like we were,but the cable has to be run back and made fast to the hull.     How far can we run it back?     Quade shrugged. Miles.     How many?     We have three miles of cable. As long as you can feel, taste, see,smell or hear that rope anchoring you to home, you aren't lost.     Three miles isn't good enough. We don't have enough fuel to changesites that often. You can't use the drive in a gravitational field, youknow.     What else can we do, Captain? Nagurski asked puzzledly.     You've said that the spaceship is our only protection fromtransphasia. Is that it?     Quade gave a curt nod.     Then, I told them, we will have to start tearing apart this ship.  "

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in THE MADMAN FROM EARTH?",
        "Summary_1": "Following the departure of Consul Whaffle, Retief has taken over as Consul for the Terrestrial States with the Terrestrial Consulate General on the planet Groac. His administrative assistant, Miss Yolanda Meuhl, wants him to attend Groacian cultural events, but Retief is more interested in addressing the nine-year-old mystery of the disappearance of a Terrestrial cruiser, the ISV Terrific--an event which was followed by a coup d'etat enacted by the current Groacian government. Much to Miss Meuhl's dismay, Retief shirks his cultural duties and makes his way to the Foreign Office Archives, whereupon he is promptly barred from entering by a pale-featured Archivist speaking in the throat-bladder vibrations of the native Groacians. Because of the Archivist's insistence that \"outworlders\" cannot access the archives, Retief begins walking back to the Consulate and stops at a bar for a drink. At the, a drunken Groacian approaches Retief and threatens to cage him and put him on display as a freak. The bartender orders the drunken Groacian out of the bar, and Retief follows him, ultimately beating him up for information. When Retief returns to the Consulate, Miss Meuhl informs him that two angry Groaci await him in his office. One is Fith, an employee of the Terrestrial Desk at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the other is Shluh, a representative of the Internal Police. They are there to investigate reports that Retief has assaulted a Groacian national--an accusation Retief ignores in order to launch into his own accusations that the Groaci were engaged in a cover-up of the whereabouts of the ISV Terrific. Miss Meuhl continually interjects, expresses horror at Retief's claims, and apologizes to the Groacians on behalf of the Terrestrial Consulate. Despite the persistent denials of the Groacians, Retief continues his accusations, suggesting the coup d'etat was an effort to silence government officials with knowledge of the truth of what happened to the cruiser and its crew. Then he reveals what he discovered from the drunken Groacian: The crew of the ISV Terrific had been caged and paraded through the streets of Groac and then neglected until they died. Fith and Shluh finally admit the truth and offer to show Retief the hidden cruiser in order to show their contrition. When Retief sees the ship, he once again accuses the Groacians of attempting to mislead him, saying that this is a lifeboat, and he demands to see the actual ship. Fith has had enough and threatens to arrest Retief, who yields and goes back to the Consulate. There, Miss Meuhl is at her wits end. Retief orders her to barricade herself inside the office while he goes to the Foreign Ministry to gather more evidence. When he returns, Miss Meuhl informs him she has reported him to Regional Headquarters, and Retief learns he has been relieved of his post. Soon after, the Groacians appoint Miss Meuhl to his position, and Fith and Shluh enter to arrest him.",
        "Summary_2": "Consul Whaffle left the Terrestrial Consul three months prior, leaving Retief in charge. Retief is sick of the constant cultural events and lack of real progress, so he\u2019s beginning to suspect the Groaci are hiding something. He turns down the latest invitation, offending his Administrative Assistant Miss Meuhl. She is horrified at his choices and at his questioning the Groaci\u2019s motives. Retief wants to learn more about the Terrestrial cruiser, Terrific ISV, that crashed on Groac nine years ago. Miss Meuhl disapproves and believes the Groacian side of the story, but Retief is not convinced. He is turned down at the Archies, as he is an outsider. He leaves and decides to visit a bar and try the local drink. There, Retief is refused by the bartender as well, claiming his stomach can\u2019t handle their drink. A drunk Groacian in the background whispers about putting Retief in a cage where he belongs. He follows the drunk after he gets thrown out and violently interrogates him.\nWhen Retief returns to his office, Miss Meuhl announces that there are two Groaci waiting for him. Fith and Shluh, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Internal Police respectively, have heard about the assaults on a Groacian. Retief asks Miss Meuhl to record their conversation. Retief admits to his questioning, but not before doing some of his own. He prods the two Groaci about the Terrific ISV cruiser and soon reveals that the drunk told him about the zoo-like parade of Terrestrials. Fith admits to the parade and tells them that the Terrestrials died afterward due to insufficient nutrition. The Groaci hid their blunder and lied to the Terrestrials about what truly happened. Retief asks them to take him to the cruiser, which they do. After they explore a little, Fith and Shluh ask him to keep his mouth shut. Retief refuses and says that this ship was the lifeboat, not the cruiser itself. Four armed Groaci surround Retief, but he talks his way out of the situation. \nHe returns to the Consulate and tells Miss Meuhl everything, warning her to prepare for the present crisis. She is still upset and defends the Groaci. He tells her to lock herself in the Consulate and wait for his return. If something were to happen, she is to send the recording and all his evidence to Regional Headquarters. He leaves to break into the Foreign Ministry. When he returns, he asks Miss Meuhl to fire up the sender, which she\u2019d already done. She had reported him to the Regional Headquarters and all his misactions. Counsellor Pardy pops up on the screen and attempts to relieve Retief of his duties, but he quickly shuts it off. Retief says he found the missing cruiser but is interrupted by the local communicator. A Groacian promotes Miss Meuhl to Consul, and she lets in the so-called peace squad. They surround Retief, armed, and Miss Meuhl waives Retief\u2019s diplomatic immunity. Shluh orders his men to take Retief. \n",
        "Summary_3": "At the Terrestrial Consulate General on the planet Groac, Retief has taken over for Consul Whaffle who left three months prior. Administrative Assistant Miss Yolanda Meuhl used to serve Consul Whaffle, and is not pleased with how Retief is handling things. Retief dictates a response declining a prestigious invitation to a Groacian event to Miss Meuhl, and she warns he will offend them. This is not Retief\u2019s only controversy. He also questions the coup d'etat of the present government and the disappearance of the Terrestrial cruiser, ISV Terrific, nine years ago, which are considered topics to be avoided by Miss Meuhl. Retief is denied entry into the Foreign Office Archives to investigate, and steps into a local bar. A drunkard Groacian calls Retief a freak and then is escorted out by two other customers. Retief follows the drunk out to the street and pins him down to the ground to have a \u201clong talk\u201d.\nBack in Retief\u2019s consulate office, two angry Groacian officials, Fith, of the Terrestrial Desk, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Shluh, of the Internal Police, accuse Retief of beating the drunkard. Retief has Miss Meuhl officially record the conversation and pivots to ask what happened to the Terrestrial cruiser, ISV Terrific, that disappeared nine years ago. Fith is offended and calls for Retief to be fired. Retief presses on to ask why the government fell after the visit of a Terrestrial investigation task force after the incident. He notices the Groacians are covering something up - not letting Terrestrials have social contacts outside the diplomatic circle and never speaking of a parade of six Terrestrials hauled through the streets after the vessel disappeared. Fith admits that six Terrans were captured and they fell ill and died because the Groacians didn\u2019t know what to feed them. Fith admits the ship descended intact East of the city, and that they didn\u2019t realize they had done something terrible until the Terran warships came. So they covered their mistake, purging their guilty leaders, concealing what happened, and offering Terrans diplomatic relations.  Fith and Shluh take Retief to see the ship in a cavern, however, it is not the real ISV Terrific. The Terrific was a twenty thousand ton ship, and this one is only a small lifeboat. Fith becomes furious. Shluh and four constables escort Retief back to the city and ban him from leaving or questioning Groacian government matters. \nRetief decides to find what happened to the real Terrific before they destroy all the Archives\u2019 paperwork. He instructs Miss Meuhl to lock herself in the consulate office. She reports Retief to Regional Headquarters. When Retief returns, he wants to send his findings to Regional Headquarters, but when they reconnect, Counsellor Pardy, DSO-1, Deputy Under-secretary for the region fires Retief. Miss Meuhl answers a call from the Groacians who accredit her as the new Terrestrial Consul to Groac (Retief\u2019s role). She lets armed Groacian\u2019s into the consulate and waives diplomatic immunity for Retief. A total betrayal that shocks Retief.",
        "Summary_4": "Consul Retief for the Terrestrial States is serving on the Groac planet, having replaced the previous consul, Mr. Whaffle, three months ago. His Administrative Assistant, Miss Meuhl, tries to tell him how to do his job, indicating what he can and cannot do. She is defensive of the Groacians, calling them sensitive, cultured, innocent, and gentle yet unsophisticated. She professes deep shame at the way they were treated by the investigators. She has been working in the consulate for four years and considers herself much more knowledgeable than Retief. There was a Terrestrial ship, the ISV Terrific, that went missing in their sector nine years ago, and while the Terrestrials held an investigation and questioned the Groacians, they did not get satisfactory answers. Retief is trying to get those answers.\nTo determine what happened, Retief first tries the Archives and local museum, but Terrestrials are denied entry here. From there, he makes his way to a bar. While the bartender refuses him service, a drunken Groacian calls out for a cage to put Retief in, referring to him as a zoo animal or a freak. When the bartender has the drunk taken out of the bar, Retief follows and beats him to get more information. Later, two government men, Fith from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Shluh from the Internal Police, show up at the consulate to question Retief about the beating. He turns their questioning into his own interrogation about the missing ship from nine years ago and the reason for the change in their government right after the investigators left Groac. Retief confronts them with his knowledge that the Terrestrials were put in cages and paraded through the streets and demands to know what happened to them. Fith admits this happened and claims the humans grew ill and died since the Groacians didn\u2019t really know how to keep them alive.\nFith also relates that the government was changed after the inquiry to get rid of the leaders who were involved. To try to cover and make up for their mistakes, they then reached out to the Terrestrials to establish a diplomatic relationship. When Retief asks to see the ship, Fith and Shluh show him a ship hidden in a cavern, but Retief realizes it isn\u2019t the ISV. He confronts the men about this, and they end their cooperation with him. Fith warns Retief to stay close to the consulate.\nKnowing that he has little time left, that night Retief breaks into the Foreign Ministry to find evidence and answers to his questions; he is sure they will destroy this information soon. When he returns to the consulate, Miss Meuhl has filed a report against him with the Regional Headquarters, having him relieved of duty and making her acting Consul. Fith and Shluh show up to question Retief about the break-in, and he claims diplomatic immunity, but Miss Meuhl waives his immunity.  \n",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]       Every lonely man tries to make friends.     Manet just didn't know when to stop!      William Manet was alone.     In the beginning, he had seen many advantages to being alone. It wouldgive him an unprecedented opportunity to once and for all correlateloneliness to the point of madness, to see how long it would take himto start slavering and clawing the pin-ups from the magazines, to beginteaching himself classes in philosophy consisting of interminablelectures to a bored and captive audience of one.     He would be able to measure the qualities of peace and decide whetherit was really better than war, he would be able to get as fat and asdirty as he liked, he would be able to live more like an animal andthink more like a god than any man for generations.     But after a shorter time than he expected, it all got to be a tearingbore. Even the waiting to go crazy part of it.     Not that he was going to have any great long wait of it. He was alreadytalking to himself, making verbal notes for his lectures, and he hadcut out a picture of Annie Oakley from an old book. He tacked it up andwinked at it whenever he passed that way.     Lately she was winking back at him.     Loneliness was a physical weight on his skull. It peeled the flesh fromhis arms and legs and sandpapered his self-pity to a fine sensitivity.     No one on Earth was as lonely as William Manet, and even William Manetcould only be this lonely on Mars.     Manet was Atmosphere Seeder Station 131-47's own human.     All Manet had to do was sit in the beating aluminum heart in the middleof the chalk desert and stare out, chin cupped in hands, at the flat,flat pavement of dirty talcum, at the stars gleaming as hard in theblack sky as a starlet's capped teeth ... stars two of which were moonsand one of which was Earth. He had to do nothing else. The wholegimcrack was cybernetically controlled, entirely automatic. No one wasneeded here\u2014no human being, at least.     The Workers' Union was a pretty small pressure group, but it didn'ttake much to pressure the Assembly. Featherbedding had been carefullyspecified, including an Overseer for each of the Seeders to honeycombMars, to prepare its atmosphere for colonization.     They didn't give tests to find well-balanced, well-integrated peoplefor the job. Well-balanced, well-integrated men weren't going toisolate themselves in a useless job. They got, instead, William Manetand his fellows.     The Overseers were to stay as long as the job required. Passenger fareto Mars was about one billion dollars. They weren't providing commuterservice for night shifts. They weren't providing accommodationsfor couples when the law specified only one occupant. They weren'tproviding fuel (at fifty million dollars a gallon) for visits betweenthe various Overseers. They weren't very providential.     But it was two hundred thousand a year in salary, and it offeredwonderful opportunities.     It gave William Manet an opportunity to think he saw a spaceship makinga tailfirst landing on the table of the desert, its tail burning asbright as envy.  "

        "Query": "Can you tell me where the story of THE MADMAN FROM EARTH takes place?",
        "Summary_1": "The story takes place on the planet Groac, which is populated by the native Groaci. The Groaci is a skinny, pale species with a throat-bladder that vibrates when speaking with a glottal dialect in an unusual syntax. They are a sensitive race, according to Miss Meuhl, and they hide their heads and hurry along at any sign of trouble. Consul Retief has an office in the Terrestrial Consulate General and attends cultural events such as light-concerts, chamber music, and folk-art festivals. Retief suggests that these events are mere distractions from more underhanded business happening on the planet, which explains why visas are handed out for only a few terrestrial businessmen, traveling to outlying districts is forbidden, and social contacts must be limited to the diplomatic circle. Groac also has a moon that foreigners cannot visit. In addition to the Consulate General, other important government agencies exist including the Foreign Office Archives, the Ministry of Culture of the Groacian Autonomy, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Internal Police (called \"peace-keepers\"). Close to the Consulate General is the bar where Retief goes, seeking a cold drink and information. The bartender stands in the bar-pit and dispenses a Groacian beverage he insists is poisonous to foreigners due to its lead content. Retief brandishes a thick gold piece to act as a filter. Later, Fith and Shluh lead Retief to a crevasse nine miles from the supposed landing point of the ISV Terrific. Due to the large veins of high-grade iron ore, Terrestrial investigators had been unable to detect the cruiser's presence, which had been disguised by a roof of heavy timbers. Retief enters the cruiser via a narrow companionway and sees dust all over the deck, stanchions, instrument panels, sheared bolts, and scraps of wire and paper strewn about the control compartment. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story takes place on the planet Groac inhabited by the Groaci. Previously undiscovered by humans, the Groaci had their first contact with an alien species just nine years prior to the story beginning. The Groaci use ground cars to travel, though they may be considered flimsy. With a cool temperature and clean air, Groac isn\u2019t a terrible place to live. There are mountainous caverns in the terrain as well, and one serves as the hiding spot for the lost Terrific ISV. Retief visits several places and buildings on Groac, including the Consul, their Ministry of Affairs, and a bar, showing their culture does not differ entirely from Terrestrials. The Groaci are often called simple people, however. They have several cultural events, such as folk festivals, chamber choirs, and light concerts. ",
        "Summary_3": "The Madman From Earth is set on the planet of Groac, where the Terrans have had a Terrestrial Consulate General for less than nine years. The consulate contains offices for the Ministry of Culture of the Groacian Autonomy staff like Retief and Miss Meuhl as well as their living quarters. Relations between the Terrans and the Groacians have been peaceful, but there are some subjects that are off limits to discuss with the Groacians, such as the disappearance of a Terran ship, ISV Terrific, nine years ago. Retief is the new Consul, and is planning on digging into this controversial topic directly with the Groacians, creating a very tense atmosphere.\nIn the city, there are windowless stucco facades on the buildings lining the street, and  the Groacians avoid the Terrans as they pass. There are high-wheeled ground cars and the environment has clean and cool air. Retief enters a Groacian bar that serves clay pots of an alcoholic drink that could harm humans from a pit in the center of the room. When Retief is escorted out of the city by Fith and Shluh, they take him to a natural crevasse with thick veins of high-grade iron ore in the rock that they claim the vessel, ISV Terrific, was lowered into and then it was covered with a roof to avoid detection. The land around the city is dusty like a desert, and Terrans are generally forbidden from traveling through these areas or visiting Groac\u2019s satellite, which is part of their cover-up of what happened to the ISV Terrific.",
        "Summary_4": "The story takes place on the planet inhabited by the Groacians, specifically in the Terrestrial Consulate, a bar, and a cavern. The Consul for the Terrestrial States has been open on the planet for almost nine years, opening not long after the ISV Terrific B7 New Terra Terrestrial cruiser went missing in the sector. The Consul is in a building protected by a safelock and communicates with the Regional Headquarters via a video communication system. The Consul has a needle gun for protection and keeps food and water on hand; it has quarters in the building for the staff as well.\n\tGroac is civilized and orderly. The Groacians have an Archives and museum for their local history, but it is off-limits to Terrestrials. Buildings have deeply carved, windowless stucco facades lining the streets, and Groacs travel by flimsy, high-wheeled ground cars. The air on the planet is clean and cool. Carvings over the doorways of buildings indicate the businesses housed within; one such business is a bar. The bar features a bar pit at the center of the room, and drinks are served in clay pots. They have culture, too, with light concerts, chamber music, and folk-art festivals. There is a Foreign Office that handles foreign matters and maintains files regarding its dealings.\n\tThe Groaci, however, have a deep dislike of Terrestrials. They avoid them on the streets, refuse service, and drunkenly slur insults at them. The Groaci government was overhauled after an investigation of a missing cruiser; after this, the Terrestrial consul was established. \n\tRetief is taken to a cavern to see the ISV Terrific, but it turns out not to be the real ISV Terrific. The Groaci authorities claim they hauled it there, nine miles from where it landed, placing it in a natural crevasse and roofing it over with high-grade iron ore. The ship has curving flanks and a space-burned hull. The instrument panels are empty, bolts have been sheared, scraps of paper and wire are lying around. Cutting torches have been used to remove the heavy shielding.\n",

To this end,dear lady, I feel it my duty to warn you against my brother. A word tothe wise....           N'est-ce pas?      Orison said. Well, Buster, here's a word to thefoolish. Get lost.     Kraft Gerding bowed and flashed his gelid smile. Until we meet again?     I'll hold my breath, Orison promised. The elevator is just behindyou. Push a button, will you? And      bon voyage     .     Kraft Gerding called the elevator, marched aboard, favored Orison witha cold, quick bow, then disappeared into the mysterious heights abovefifth floor.     First the unspeakable Auga Vingt, then the obnoxious Kraft Gerding.Surely, Orison thought, recovering the      Wall Street Journal     from herwastebasket and smoothing it, no one would convert a major Midwesternbank into a lunatic asylum. How else, though, could the behaviorof the Earmuffs be explained? Could madmen run a bank? Why not, shethought. History is rich in examples of madmen running nations, banksand all. She began again to read the paper into the microphone. If shefinished early enough, she might get a chance to prowl those Off-Limitsupper floors.     Half an hour further into the paper, Orison jumped, startled by thesudden buzz of her telephone. She picked it up.       Wanji e-Kal, Datto.Dink ger-Dink d'summa.          Orison scribbled down this intelligence in bemused Gregg beforereplying, I'm a local girl. Try me in English.     Oh. Hi, Miss McCall, the voice said. Guess I goofed. I'm in kindaclutch. This is Wanji. I got a kite for Mr. Dink Gerding. If you seehim, tell him the escudo green is pale. Got that, doll?     Yes, Mr. Wanji. I'll tell Mr. Gerding. Orison clicked the phone down.What now, Mata Hari? she asked herself. What was the curious languageMr. Wanji had used? She'd have to report the message to Washington bytonight's pillow, and let the polyglots of Treasury Intelligence puzzleit out. Meanwhile, she thought, scooting her chair back from her desk,she had a vague excuse to prowl the upper floors. The Earmuffs couldonly fire her.     Orison folded the paper and put it in the Out basket. Someone wouldbe here in a moment with something new to read. She'd best get going.The elevator? No. The operators had surely been instructed to keep heroff the upstairs floors.     But the building had a stairway.      III     The door on the sixth floor was locked. Orison went on up the stairs toseven. The glass of the door there was painted black on the inside, andthe landing was cellar-dark. Orison closed her eyes for a moment. Therewas a curious sound. The buzzing of a million bees, barely within thefringes of her hearing. Somehow, a very pleasant sound.     She opened her eyes and tried the knob. The door opened.     Orison was blinded by the lights, brilliant as noonday sun. The roomextended through the entire seventh floor, its windows boarded shut,its ceiling a mass of fluorescent lamps. Set about the floor weregalvanized steel tanks, rectangular and a little bigger than bathtubs.Orison counted the rows of tanks. Twelve rows, nine tiers. One hundredand eight tanks. She walked closer. The tubs were laced together bystrands of angel-hair, delicate white lattices scintillating withpink. She walked to the nearest of the tubs and looked in. It was halffull of a greenish fluid, seething with tiny pink bubbles. For a momentOrison thought she saw Benjamin Franklin winking up at her from theliquid. Then she screamed.       The pink bubbles, the tiny flesh-colored flecks glinting light fromthe spun-sugar bridges between the tanks, were spiders. Millionsupon millions of spiders, each the size of a mustard-seed; crawling,leaping, swinging, spinning webs, seething in the hundred tanks. Orisonput her hands over her ears and screamed again, backing toward thestairway door.     Into a pair of arms.     I had hoped you'd be happy here, Miss McCall, Kraft Gerding said.Orison struggled to release herself. She broke free only to haveher wrists seized by two Earmuffs that had appeared with the elderGerding. It seems that our Pandora doesn't care for spiders, hesaid. Really, Miss McCall, our little pets are quite harmless. Werewe to toss you into one of these tanks.... Orison struggled againsther two      sumo     -sized captors, whose combined weights exceeded hers bysome quarter-ton, without doing more than lifting her feet from thefloor. ... your flesh would be unharmed, though they spun and dartedall around you. Our Microfabridae are petrovorous, Miss McCall. Ofcourse, once they discovered your teeth, and through them a skeleton ofcalcium, a delicacy they find most toothsome, you'd be filleted withinminutes.     Elder Compassion wouldn't like your harming the girl, Sire, one ofthe earmuffed      sumo     -wrestlers protested.     Elder Compassion has no rank, Kraft Gerding said. Miss McCall, youmust tell me what you were doing here, or I'll toss you to the spiders.     Dink ... Dink! Orison shouted.     My beloved younger brother is otherwise engaged than in the rescue ofdamsels in distress, Kraft said. Someone, after all, has to mind thebank.     I came to bring a message to Dink, Orison said. Let me go, youacromegalic apes!     The message? Kraft Gerding demanded.     Something about escudo green. Put me down!   <doc-sep> Bam, Bam, Bam, the blood pounded in his ears. Like repeated blows of ahammer they shook his booming head. No longer was Torp above him. Hewas in the corner of the laboratory, a crumpled blood-smeared heap ofbruised flesh and bone. He was unfettered and the blood was caked uponhis skull and in his matted hair. Torp must have thought he had killedhim with those savage blows upon the head.     Even Torp, thought Thig ruefully, gave way to the primitive rage of hisancestors at times; but to that very bit of unconscious atavism he nowowed his life. A cool-headed robot of an Orthan would have efficientlyused the blaster to destroy any possibility of remaining life in hisunconscious body.     Thig rolled slowly over so that his eye found the door into the controlroom. Torp would be coming back again to dispose of their bodiesthrough the refuse lock. Already the body of Kam was gone. He wonderedwhy he had been left until last. Perhaps Torp wished to take culturesof his blood and tissues to determine whether a disease was responsiblefor his sudden madness.     The cases of fragile instruments were just above his head. Associationof memories brought him the flash of the heavy blaster in its rackbeneath them. His hand went up and felt the welcome hardness of theweapon. He tugged it free.     In a moment he was on his knees crawling across the plates of the decktoward the door. Halfway across the floor he collapsed on his face,the metal of the gun making a harsh clang. He heard the feet of Torpscuffle out of silence and a choked cry in the man's throat squalledout into a senseless whinny.     Thig raised himself up on a quivering elbow and slid the black lengthof the blaster in front of him. His eyes sought the doorway and staredfull into the glaring vacant orbs of his commander. Torp leaned therewatching him, his breath gurgling brokenly through his deep-bittenlips. The clawing marks of nails, fingernails, furrowed his face andchest. He was a madman!     The deadly attack of Thig; his own violent avenging of Kam's death, andnow the apparent return of the man he had killed come to life had allserved to jolt his rigidly trained brain from its accustomed groove.The shock had been too much for the established thought-processes ofthe Orthan.     So Thig shot him where he stood, mercifully, before that vacant madstare set him, too, to gibbering and shrieking. Then he stepped overthe skeleton-thing that had been Torp, using the new strength thatvictory had given him to drive him along.     He had saved a world's civilization from extinction! The thoughtsobered him; yet, somehow, he was pleased that he had done so. Afterall, it had been the Earthwoman and the children he had been thinkingof while he battled Kam, a selfish desire to protect them all.     He went to the desk where Torp had been writing in the ship's log andread the last few nervously scrawled lines:       Planet 72-P-3 unfit for colonization. Some pernicious disease thatstrikes at the brain centers and causes violent insanity is existentthere. Thig, just returned from a survey of the planet, went mad anddestroyed Kam. In turn I was forced to slay him. But it is not ended.Already I feel the insidious virus of....       And there his writing ended abruptly.     Thig nodded. That would do it. He set the automatic pilot for theplanet Ortha. Unless a rogue asteroid or a comet crossed the ship'spath she would return safely to Ortha with that mute warning of dangeron 72-P-3. The body of Torp would help to confirm his final message.     Then Thig crossed the cabin to the auxiliary life boat there, one ofa half-dozen space ships in miniature nested within the great ship'shull, and cut free from the mother vessel.     He flipped the drive lever, felt the thrumming of the rockets drivinghim from the parent ship. The sensation of free flight against his newbody was strangely exhilerating and heady. It was the newest of theemotions he had experienced on Earth since that day, so many monthsbefore, when he had felt the warmness of Ellen's lips tight against his.        Thig flipped the drive lever, felt the thrumming of therockets driving him from the parent ship.        He swung about to the port, watched the flaming drive-rockets of thegreat exploratory ship hurl it toward far-away Ortha, and there was noregret in his mind that he was not returning to the planet of his firstexistence.     He thought of the dull greys and blacks of his planet, of themonotonous routine of existence that had once been his\u2014and his heartthrilled to the memories of the starry nights and perfect exciting dayshe had spent on his three month trip over Earth.     He made a brief salute to the existence he had known, turned with atiny sigh, and his fingers made brief adjustments in the controls. Therocket-thrum deepened, and the thin whistle of tenuous air clutchingthe ship echoed through the hull-plates.     He thought of many things in those few moments. He watched theroundness of Earth flatten out, then take on the cup-like illusionthat all planets had for an incoming ship. He reduced the drive of hisrockets to a mere whisper, striving to control the impatience thatcrowded his mind.     He shivered suddenly, remembering his utter callousness the first timehe had sent a space ship whipping down toward the hills and valleysbelow. And there was a sickness within him when he fully realized that,despite his acquired memory and traits, he was an alien from outerspace.     He fingered the tiny scars that had completely obliterated the slightdifferences in his appearance from an Earthman's, and his fingerstrembled a bit, as he bent and stared through the vision port. He saida brief prayer in his heart to a God whose presence he now felt verydeeply. There were tears in the depths of his eyes, then, and memorieswere hot, bitter pains.  "

        "Summary_1": "Fith is a Groacian who works with the Terrestrial Desk at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. His associate, Shluh, is the police chief of the Internal Police. While both are Groacians, they speak to Retief in a lisping Terran and wear heavy eye-shields and elaborately-decorated crest ornaments indicating their rank. Fith does most of the talking as he attempts to convince Retief to cease his inquiries into the ISV Terrific, and Shluh is there primarily as a tool with which to threaten Retief. When the two Groacians first meet Retief, they accuse him of attacking a Groacian national, which Retief admits to, but he quickly reveals what the national confessed to him about the fate of ISV Terrific's crew. Although Miss Meuhl is sympathetic to the supposed sensitive nature of the Groaci, Retief distrusts them wholly, and when Fith and Shluh eventually confess to hiding the ISV Terrific, he further distrusts their sincerity of contrition and accuses them of showing him a lifeboat instead of the missing cruiser. This accusation infuriates Fith, who threatens to have Shluh's attending officers arrest Retief on the spot. Later, following Retief's break-in at the Foreign Ministry, Fith appoints Miss Meuh as Consul for the Terrestrial States and orders Shluh to arrest Retief.",
        "Summary_2": "Fith, of the Terrestrial Desk, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Shluh, Internal Police, show their rank through their ornamental uniforms and sturdy eye-shields. Fith and Shluh meet Retief after he has been accused of assaulting a Groacian civilian, which he readily admits to. Fith and Shluh accompany Retief on his journey of discovering the mystery of the ISV Terrific crash and human discovery on Groac. Although at first they try and hide what happened, Retief soon learns the truth about those Terrestrials. Fith reveals that all six of the Terrestrials used in the parade died due to malnourishment and the Groaci\u2019s unfamiliarity with the needs of humans. Although Fith and Shluh help Retief in some ways, they also greatly hinder the process by attempting to keep this all under wraps. The story ends with Fith and Shluh along with many other Groaci police officers barging into the Consul\u2019s office armed and ready to arrest Retief. ",
        "Summary_3": "Fith is from the Terrestrial Desk of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the planet Groac, and Shluh is an official of their Internal Police. They are first introduced when they show up to Retief's Terrestrial Consulate office on Groac to question him about a report of a drunkard who was beaten on the street. Fith\u2019s role is largely to protect the interests of the planet Groac, who Retief is threatening with his offensive investigations into the disappearance of the ISV Terrific, which Groacians claim the Terrans falsely accuse them of capturing nine years ago. Although Fith admits to the cover up of the vessel, it appears he is concealing a much larger secret that Retief uncovers when he notices they are showing him only a small lifeboat from ISV Terrific and claiming that they know nothing further. Then, Fith and Shuhl become forceful and violent with Retief when he presses about the heavy cruising ship - the real ISV Terrific - that the small lifeboat came from. \nShluh commands the Internal Police, and enforces the wishes of Fith faithfully throughout the story. This is seen when Shluh and four of his constables apprehend Retief at the cavern and forcefully escort him back to the city, and again when they enter the Terran consulate armed to take Retief into custody.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Fith works at the Terrestrial Desk of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Shluh is the chief of the Internal Police. These authorities first deny Retief\u2019s claims, then give him some information hoping to satisfy him, but ultimately turn against him and try to block his further investigation into the events nine years ago. When we first see them, the two men question Retief about his beating of the drunk Groacian from the bar, but Retief counters by asking them questions about the ISV Terrific. Retief reveals that the drunken man told him certain information, and Fith indicates he will ask for Retief\u2019s recall and claims he would do more if Retief didn\u2019t have diplomatic immunity. While Retief tells them what he knows and then inquires how the people from the ISV Terrific died, proffering several suggestions, Fith becomes so worked up that he begins answering the questions. He admits the humans died from illness but claims the Groacians tried to keep them alive but didn\u2019t know how. He also asserts that the Groacians were unaware of the severity of their actions until the investigation was held. They were afraid to tell what had happened and hid the ship. When the investigators left, they replaced their government and opened diplomatic relations with the Terrestrials. To persuade Retief of their sincerity, Fith offers to show Retief the ship and takes him to a ship hidden in a cavern. However, Retief recognizes that the ship they show him is not the ISV Terrific and confronts Fith with this fact, leading Shluh to have his four armed constables surround Retief. Fith then warns Retief not to go far from the consulate and to drop his inquiries about the government. At the end of the story, the two men come to the consulate to remove Retief for questioning and respond to Miss Meuhl as Consul now. ",
        "Article": "Save the protests, Fith. You have some explaining to do. And I don'tthink your story will be good enough.     It is for you to explain! This person who was beaten\u2014     Not beaten. Just rapped a few times to loosen his memory.     Then you admit\u2014     It worked, too. He remembered lots of things, once he put his mind toit.     Fith rose; Shluh followed suit.     I shall ask for your immediate recall, Mr. Consul. Were it not foryour diplomatic immunity, I should do more\u2014     Why did the government fall, Fith? It was just after the task forcepaid its visit, and before the arrival of the first Terrestrialdiplomatic mission.     This is an internal matter! Fith cried, in his faint Groacian voice.The new regime has shown itself most amiable to you Terrestrials. Ithas outdone itself\u2014     \u2014to keep the Terrestrial consul and his staff in the dark, Retiefsaid. And the same goes for the few terrestrial businessmen you'vevisaed. This continual round of culture; no social contacts outside thediplomatic circle; no travel permits to visit out-lying districts, oryour satellite\u2014     Enough! Fith's mandibles quivered in distress. I can talk no more ofthis matter\u2014     You'll talk to me, or there'll be a task force here in five days to dothe talking, Retief said.     You can't! Miss Meuhl gasped.     Retief turned a steady look on Miss Meuhl. She closed her mouth. TheGroaci sat down.     Answer me this one, Retief said, looking at Shluh. A few yearsback\u2014about nine, I think\u2014there was a little parade held here. Somecurious looking creatures were captured. After being securely caged,they were exhibited to the gentle Groaci public. Hauled through thestreets. Very educational, no doubt. A highly cultural show.     Funny thing about these animals. They wore clothes. They seemed tocommunicate with each other. Altogether it was a very amusing exhibit.     Tell me, Shluh, what happened to those six Terrestrials after theparade was over?   <doc-sep> Retief rose, went to the communicator, assisted Miss Meuhl aside.     Listen carefully, Fith, he said. Your bluff has been called. Youdon't come in and we don't come out. Your camouflage worked for nineyears, but it's all over now. I suggest you keep your heads and resistthe temptation to make matters worse than they are.     Miss Meuhl, Fith said, a peace squad waits outside your consulate.It is clear you are in the hands of a dangerous lunatic. As always, theGroaci wish only friendship with the Terrestrials, but\u2014     Don't bother, Retief said. You know what was in those files I lookedover this morning.     Retief turned at a sound behind him. Miss Meuhl was at the door,reaching for the safe-lock release....     Don't! Retief jumped\u2014too late.     The door burst inward. A crowd of crested Groaci pressed into the room,pushed Miss Meuhl back, aimed scatter guns at Retief. Police ChiefShluh pushed forward.     Attempt no violence, Terrestrial, he said. I cannot promise torestrain my men.     You're violating Terrestrial territory, Shluh, Retief said steadily.I suggest you move back out the same way you came in.     I invited them here, Miss Meuhl spoke up. They are here at myexpress wish.     Are they? Are you sure you meant to go this far, Miss Meuhl? A squadof armed Groaci in the consulate?     You are the consul, Miss Yolanda Meuhl, Shluh said. Would it not bebest if we removed this deranged person to a place of safety?     You're making a serious mistake, Shluh, Retief said.     Yes, Miss Meuhl said. You're quite right, Mr. Shluh. Please escortMr. Retief to his quarters in this building\u2014     I don't advise you to violate my diplomatic immunity, Fith, Retiefsaid.     As chief of mission, Miss Meuhl said quickly, I hereby waiveimmunity in the case of Mr. Retief.     Shluh produced a hand recorder. Kindly repeat your statement, Madam,officially, he said. I wish no question to arise later.     Don't be a fool, woman, Retief said. Don't you see what you'reletting yourself in for? This would be a hell of a good time for you tofigure out whose side you're on.     I'm on the side of common decency!     You've been taken in. These people are concealing\u2014     You think all women are fools, don't you, Mr. Retief? She turned tothe police chief and spoke into the microphone he held up.     That's an illegal waiver, Retief said. I'm consul here, whateverrumors you've heard. This thing's coming out into the open, whateveryou do. Don't add violation of the Consulate to the list of Groacianatrocities.     Take the man, Shluh said.   <doc-sep> Fith made a choked noise and spoke rapidly to Shluh in Groacian. Shluhretracted his eyes, shrank down in his chair. Miss Meuhl opened hermouth, closed it and blinked rapidly.     How did they die? Retief snapped. Did you murder them, cut theirthroats, shoot them or bury them alive? What amusing end did you figureout for them? Research, maybe? Cut them open to see what made themyell....     No! Fith gasped. I must correct this terrible false impression atonce.     False impression, hell, Retief said. They were Terrans! A simplenarco-interrogation would get that out of any Groacian who saw theparade.     Yes, Fith said weakly. It is true, they were Terrestrials. But therewas no killing.     They're alive?     Alas, no. They ... died.     Miss Meuhl yelped faintly.     I see, Retief said. They died.     We tried to keep them alive, of course. But we did not know whatfoods\u2014     Didn't take the trouble to find out, either, did you?     They fell ill, Fith said. One by one....     We'll deal with that question later, Retief said. Right now, I wantmore information. Where did you get them? Where did you hide the ship?What happened to the rest of the crew? Did they 'fall ill' before thebig parade?     There were no more! Absolutely, I assure you!     Killed in the crash landing?     No crash landing. The ship descended intact, east of the city. The ...Terrestrials ... were unharmed. Naturally, we feared them. They werestrange to us. We had never before seen such beings.     Stepped off the ship with guns blazing, did they?     Guns? No, no guns\u2014     They raised their hands, didn't they? Asked for help. You helped them;helped them to death.     How could we know? Fith moaned.     How could you know a flotilla would show up in a few months lookingfor them, you mean? That was a shock, wasn't it? I'll bet you had abrisk time of it hiding the ship, and shutting everybody up. A closecall, eh?     We were afraid, Shluh said. We are a simple people. We feared thestrange creatures from the alien craft. We did not kill them, but wefelt it was as well they ... did not survive. Then, when the warshipscame, we realized our error. But we feared to speak. We purged ourguilty leaders, concealed what had happened, and ... offered ourfriendship. We invited the opening of diplomatic relations. We madea blunder, it is true, a great blunder. But we have tried to makeamends....     Where is the ship?     The ship?     What did you do with it? It was too big to just walk off and forget.Where is it?     The two Groacians exchanged looks.     We wish to show our contrition, Fith said. We will show you theship.     Miss Meuhl, Retief said. If I don't come back in a reasonable lengthof time, transmit that recording to Regional Headquarters, sealed. Hestood, looked at the Groaci.     Let's go, he said.  "

        "Query": "What role does the ISV Terrific play in THE MADMAN FROM EARTH?",
        "Summary_1": "The ISV Terrific, full name ISV Terrific B7 New Terra, was a Terrestrial cruiser gone missing nine years prior to the events of the story. The vessel landed on Groac and its crew was captured and paraded through the streets by the Groaci. The crew died of mysterious causes and the vessel was hidden in a cavern and undetectable by investigators thanks to large veins of high-grade iron ore under the planet's surface. After a Terrestrial investigation failed to uncover the cruiser, a Groacian coup d'etat replaced the government in the time before the establishment of the Terrestrial Consulate General. Fith and Shluh deny any wrongdoing related to the deaths of the crewmembers when Retief confronts them about the situation, insisting that the crew died because the Groaci were ignorant about the Terran diet. They do, however, admit that they hid the cruiser. When they lead Retief to the ship, he observes its state of disrepair: A thick layer of dust covers the deck, stanchions, acceleration couches, instrument panels, sheared bolts, and scraps of wire and paper strewn about the control compartment. Then, Retief accuses them of attempting to continue their deception by showing him a lifeboat instead of the actual cruiser. This enrages Fith. The disappearance of the ISV Terrific, the coup d'etat that followed, and the subsequent incompetent Terrestrial investigation had led Retief to conduct the investigation in the first place and ultimately reveal that the Groacians are trying to hide something more sinister.",
        "Summary_2": "The ISV Terrific is a Terrestrial spaceship that crashed on Groac nine years before the story begins. It is significant because it marks the first Terrestrial contact with the Groaci, in fact, the first alien contact at all. The crew of the ISV Terrific were captured and paraded through the streets like animals in a zoo. They all later died due to malnourishment and dehydration, or so the Groaci claim. The ISV Terrific is significant because it acts as the catalyst for much of the conflict in this story, as Retief sets down a path to discover the truth and reveal what was long ago covered up. ",
        "Summary_3": "The ISV Terrific was a heavy, interplanetary cruising vessel, weighing about twenty thousand tons, that was mysteriously lost on the planet Groac nine years ago. When the Terrans questioned the Grocians about their vessel, the Groacians covered up the fact that the ship did land on their planet to the east of the city and there were humans that all died after falling ill because the Groacians did not understand what to feed them. \nThe ISV Terrific is significant in the story because it is Retief\u2019s singular focus to solve its disappearance. Retief is highly suspicious of why his fellow colleagues at the consulate are afraid to investigate the incident any further.  The Groacians treat the incident as an embarrassment, as if the Terrans had wrongly accused them. But Retief is intent on getting to the bottom of it. At first, he is able to get some information from Fith, who admits to covering up the ship and the death of the humans that fell ill. When Retief arrives at the cavern that the Groacians have hidden the ship in, he uncovers a further mystery. The ship they show him is only a hundred-ton lifeboat of the ISV Terrific, marked 'IVS Terrific B7 New Terra\u2019 on the bow. The real ISV Terrific is somewhere else.\nRetief does not give up on his quest, despite the threats of the Groacian officials, and pushes on into the night by breaking into the Archives to obtain the records from nine years ago to find out where the ISV Terrific is.\n",
        "Summary_4": "The ISV Terrific is the reason for Retief\u2019s appointment as Consul on Groac. The ship was a Terrestrial cruiser that went missing nine years ago in the Groaci sector of the galaxy. Consul Retief is trying to track down the ship and discover what happened to the passengers. He suspects that the ship crashed on the Groaci\u2019s planet and that the Groaci killed the people on it. He is on a mission to answer these questions. He first asks Miss Meuhl what she knows about it. She refuses to discuss it, siding with the Groacis and defending them as a very sensitive race and stating she is ashamed of how they were treated when the investigation was conducted. Retief tries to enter the Archives and local museum to search for information but is denied entry. \nBut he stumbles on a clue in a bar when a drunken Groaci points at him and says they need to find a proper cage for him; Retief follows the drunk out of the bar and learns that the Groaci captured the passengers and caged, paraded, and exhibited them. Fith and Shluh admit that these Terrestrials died but that the Groaci tried to keep them alive but didn\u2019t know what foods they ate. They fell ill one by one and died. The Groaci claim that they didn\u2019t realize the significance of the humans until the warships came to investigate, and then the Groaci were afraid to say anything. Afterward, they got rid of their government, replaced it with a new one, hid the ship, and invited diplomatic relations with the Terrestrials. Fith and Shluh also reveal that the ship didn\u2019t crash but landed intact and claim that the ship is hidden in a cavern now and offer to show it to Retief. However, Retief recognizes that the ship they show him is not the ISV Terrific  but is, instead, a lifeboat. To get to the bottom of the mystery, Retief breaks into the Foreign Ministry during the night and finds answers to his questions, but before he can transmit the information that he has learned, Miss Meuhl notifies the Regional Headquarters of his actions, having him removed as consul, and allows the Groaci into the consulate to take Retief into custody.\nThus, the ISV Terrific is the basis for interplanetary hostilities, the opening of a diplomatic channel between the Groacians and the Terrestrials, the overthrow of the Groaci government, and an unsolved mystery that could reopen hostilities when the truth of the matter is revealed.\n",

What does he mean, we have never existed?We're here, aren't we? What\u2014     Shut up! Raymond snapped. He turned on Martin. You don't seemsurprised.     The old man grinned. I'm not. I figured it all out years ago.     At first, he had wondered what he should do. Would it be better tothrow them into a futile panic by telling them or to do nothing? Hehad decided on the latter; that was the role they had assigned him\u2014towatch and wait and keep out of things\u2014and that was the role he wouldplay.     You knew all the time and you didn't tell us! Raymond spluttered.After we'd been so good to you, making a gentleman out of you insteadof a criminal.... That's right, he snarled, a criminal! An alcoholic,a thief, a derelict! How do you like that?     Sounds like a rich, full life, Martin said wistfully.     What an exciting existence they must have done him out of! But then, hecouldn't help thinking, he\u2014he and Conrad together, of course\u2014had donethem out of      any     kind of existence. It wasn't his responsibility,though; he had done nothing but let matters take whatever course wasdestined for them. If only he could be sure that it was the bettercourse, perhaps he wouldn't feel that nagging sense of guilt insidehim. Strange\u2014where, in his hermetic life, could he possibly havedeveloped such a queer thing as a conscience?     Then we've wasted all this time, Ninian sobbed, all this energy, allthis money, for nothing!     But you were nothing to begin with, Martin told them. And then,after a pause, he added, I only wish I could be sure there had beensome purpose to this.     He didn't know whether it was approaching death that dimmed his sight,or whether the frightened crowd that pressed around him was growingshadowy.     I wish I could feel that some good had been done in letting you bewiped out of existence, he went on voicing his thoughts. But I knowthat the same thing that happened to your worlds and my world willhappen all over again. To other people, in other times, but again. It'sbound to happen. There isn't any hope for humanity.     One man couldn't really change the course of human history, he toldhimself. Two men, that was\u2014one real, one a shadow.     Conrad came close to the old man's bed. He was almost transparent.     No, he said, there is hope. They didn't know the time transmitterworks two ways. I used it for going into the past only once\u2014just thisonce. But I've gone into the future with it many times. And\u2014 hepressed Martin's hand\u2014believe me, what I did\u2014what      we     did, you andI\u2014serves a purpose. It will change things for the better. Everythingis going to be all right.   <doc-sep> Retief turned. A tall Groacian vibrated his mandibles in a gestureof contempt. From his bluish throat coloration, it was apparent thecreature was drunk.     To choke in your upper sac, the bartender hissed, extending his eyestoward the drunk. To keep silent, litter-mate of drones.     To swallow your own poison, dispenser of vileness, the drunkwhispered. To find a proper cage for this zoo-piece. He waveredtoward Retief. To show this one in the streets, like all freaks.     Seen a lot of freaks like me, have you? Retief asked, interestedly.     To speak intelligibly, malodorous outworlder, the drunk said. Thebarkeep whispered something, and two customers came up to the drunk,took his arms and helped him to the door.     To get a cage! the drunk shrilled. To keep the animals in their ownstinking place.     I've changed my mind, Retief said to the bartender. To be gratefulas hell, but to have to hurry off now. He followed the drunk out thedoor. The other Groaci released him, hurried back inside. Retief lookedat the weaving alien.     To begone, freak, the Groacian whispered.     To be pals, Retief said. To be kind to dumb animals.     To have you hauled away to a stockyard, ill-odored foreign livestock.     To not be angry, fragrant native, Retief said. To permit me to chumwith you.     To flee before I take a cane to you!     To have a drink together\u2014     To not endure such insolence! The Groacian advanced toward Retief.Retief backed away.     To hold hands, Retief said. To be palsy-walsy\u2014     The Groacian reached for him, missed. A passer-by stepped around him,head down, scuttled away. Retief backed into the opening to a narrowcrossway and offered further verbal familiarities to the drunken local,who followed, furious. Retief backed, rounded a corner into a narrowalley-like passage, deserted, silent ... except for the followingGroacian.     Retief stepped around him, seized his collar and yanked. The Groacianfell on his back. Retief stood over him. The downed native half-rose;Retief put a foot against his chest and pushed.     To not be going anywhere for a few minutes, Retief said. To stayright here and have a nice long talk.      II     There you are! Miss Meuhl said, eyeing Retief over her lenses. Thereare two gentlemen waiting to see you. Groacian gentlemen.     Government men, I imagine. Word travels fast. Retief pulled off hiscape. This saves me the trouble of paying another call at the ForeignMinistry.     What have you been doing? They seem very upset, I don't mind tellingyou.     I'm sure you don't. Come along. And bring an official recorder.     Two Groaci wearing heavy eye-shields and elaborate crest ornamentsindicative of rank rose as Retief entered the room. Neither offered acourteous snap of the mandibles, Retief noted. They were mad, all right.     I am Fith, of the Terrestrial Desk, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr.Consul, the taller Groacian said, in lisping Terran. May I presentShluh, of the Internal Police?     Sit down, gentlemen, Retief said. They resumed their seats. MissMeuhl hovered nervously, then sat on the edge of a comfortless chair.     Oh, it's such a pleasure\u2014 she began.     Never mind that, Retief said. These gentlemen didn't come here tosip tea today.     So true, Fith said. Frankly, I have had a most disturbing report,Mr. Consul. I shall ask Shluh to recount it. He nodded to the policechief.     One hour ago, The Groacian said, a Groacian national was broughtto hospital suffering from serious contusions. Questioning of thisindividual revealed that he had been set upon and beaten by aforeigner. A Terrestrial, to be precise. Investigation by my departmentindicates that the description of the culprit closely matches that ofthe Terrestrial Consul.     Miss Meuhl gasped audibly.     Have you ever heard, Retief said, looking steadily at Fith, of aTerrestrial cruiser, the      ISV Terrific     , which dropped from sight inthis sector nine years ago?     Really! Miss Meuhl exclaimed, rising. I wash my hands\u2014     Just keep that recorder going, Retief snapped.     I'll not be a party\u2014     You'll do as you're told, Miss Meuhl, Retief said quietly. I'mtelling you to make an official sealed record of this conversation.     Miss Meuhl sat down.     Fith puffed out his throat indignantly. You reopen an old wound,Mr. Consul. It reminds us of certain illegal treatment at Terrestrialhands\u2014     Hogwash, Retief said. That tune went over with my predecessors, butit hits a sour note with me.     All our efforts, Miss Meuhl said, to live down that terribleepisode! And you\u2014     Terrible? I understand that a Terrestrial task force stood off Groacand sent a delegation down to ask questions. They got some funnyanswers, and stayed on to dig around a little. After a week they left.Somewhat annoying to the Groaci, maybe\u2014at the most. If they wereinnocent.     IF!

        "Query": "What is the involvement of Miss Meuhl in THE MADMAN FROM EARTH?",
        "Summary_1": "Miss Yolanda Meuhl is the Administrative Assistant of The Consul for the Terrestrial States Retief, the replacement for Consul Whaffle who left the post three months prior. Miss Meuhl wears glasses, uses a dictyper, and takes her position at the Consulate extremely seriously. She faithfully executes her duties as an administrative assistant without question, which leads her to develop a blind trust in authority as well as the Groaci race, according to Retief.  Miss Meuhl considers the Groaci to be a sensitive race and defends them against Retief's constant accusations of misconduct. She threatens to report Retief to the Regional Headquarters when he continues to act against the guidelines set forth by the Corps. Her commitment to diplomatic relations ensures that she takes the side of the Groaci in nearly every matter; she even excuses when Fith and Shluh admit to hiding the Terrestrial cruiser. When Retief orders Miss Meuhl to lock herself inside the office while he goes to break into the Foreign Ministry, Miss Meuhl calls the Regional Headquarters and makes a full report of his actions. When he returns, Counsellor Pardy calls and relieves Retief of his post. Then, a Groacian official calls and appoints Miss Meuhl to the post vacated by Retief, which she accepts. She then allows the Groacian officials to enter the office in order to arrest Retief.",
        "Summary_2": "Miss Meuhl is Retief\u2019s secretary and administrative assistant at the Groac Embassy for Terrestrials. She is used to serving the former consul, Whaffle, who was happy to go along with all the cultural ploys and let her do much of the writing. Retief, however, takes things into his own hands and immediately starts investigating a covered-up crime. Miss Meuhl does not approve of his actions and argues with Retief throughout the entire story. In the end, Miss Meuhl essentially betrays his trust and allows the Groaci to take Retief away, making her the new Consul. She would rather side with them to keep the peace than discover the truth, a trait that Retief abhorred. ",
        "Summary_3": "Miss Yolanda Meuhl, DAO-9 is the Administrative Assistant to the Terran diplomat within the Ministry of Culture of the Groacian Autonomy, stationed at the Terrestrial Consulate General of the planet Groac. She used to serve Consul Whaffle, who was replaced with Consul Retief three months ago. She is not happy about assisting Retief, who she feels is deeply unfit to be a diplomat. She objects to nearly everything that Retief does during the course of the story, and only obliges when the task might gain her some information she can use against Retief in the future. Such as when she obliges to record the conversation Retief has with Fith and Shuhl when they question him about the drunkard he beat up. Or when she accepts locking herself in their consulate office when Retief goes to investigate the whereabouts of the vessel Terrific against the will of the Groacian officials, so that she can transmit a report to get Retief dismissed to their Regional Headquarters. After she turns against Retief, she is assigned his position as Consul by the Regional Headquarters and plays the role of a villain when she immediately betrays Retief by waiving his diplomatic protections before the Groacian authorities.",
        "Summary_4": "Miss Meuhl is the Administrative Assistant to the Consul for the Terrestrial States on Groac. She has held that position for over four years and believes she knows better than Consul Retief, who has only been there three months, what he should do and say. She frequently references the previous Consul as an example of what Retief should do and how he should act. When Retief brings up questions about the replacement of the government and the Groacis\u2019 role in the missing ISV Terrific, Miss Meuhl sides with the Groaci, stating that they are a very sensitive, cultured, gentle race and were treated very poorly during the inquiry that followed the disappearance of the ship. When Fith and Shluh arrive to question Retief about his role in beating a Groaci, she is appalled. She refuses to be a party to his conversation with the authorities until Retief forces her because he needs her to record the discussion. When Retief leaves with the authorities to see the ship, he trusts Miss Meuhl to transmit the recording to the Regional Headquarters if he doesn\u2019t return in a reasonable amount of time. When Retief later continues his investigation under cover of night, he warns Miss Meuhl she is in danger and not to leave the consulate; he also warns her not to trust the Groaci. While he is gone, Miss Meuhl reports his activities to the Regional Headquarters, having him dismissed from his post and replaced by Miss Meuhl. When Groaci authorities arrive to question Retief, they already know that Miss Meuhl is in charge. She unlocks the safelock so that they can enter, and she revokes Retief\u2019s diplomatic immunity and has them remove Retief from the office area. Miss Meuhl thwarts Retief every step of the way as he tries to learn the truth about the people who were on the ISV Terrific and ultimately gains his consulate post for herself.\n",

Consul Whaffle was an extremely busy man, Miss Meuhl said stiffly.He had complete confidence in me.     Since I'm cutting out the culture from now on, Retief said, I won'tbe so busy.     Well! Miss Meuhl said. May I ask where you'll be if something comesup?     I'm going over to the Foreign Office Archives.     Miss Meuhl blinked behind thick lenses. Whatever for?     Retief looked thoughtfully at Miss Meuhl. You've been here on Groacfor four years, Miss Meuhl. What was behind the coup d'etat that putthe present government in power?     I'm sure I haven't pried into\u2014     What about that Terrestrial cruiser? The one that disappeared out thisway about ten years back?     Mr. Retief, those are just the sort of questions we      avoid     with theGroaci. I certainly hope you're not thinking of openly intruding\u2014     Why?     The Groaci are a very sensitive race. They don't welcome outworldersraking up things. They've been gracious enough to let us live downthe fact that Terrestrials subjected them to deep humiliation on oneoccasion.     You mean when they came looking for the cruiser?     I, for one, am ashamed of the high-handed tactics that were employed,grilling these innocent people as though they were criminals. We trynever to reopen that wound, Mr. Retief.     They never found the cruiser, did they?     Certainly not on Groac.     Retief nodded. Thanks, Miss Meuhl, he said. I'll be back beforeyou close the office.

Why, what is the meaning\u2014     If I'd listened any longer, I might have heard something I couldn'tignore. I can't afford that, at this moment. Listen, Miss Meuhl,Retief went on earnestly, I've found the missing cruiser.     You heard him relieve you!     I heard him say he was      going     to, Miss Meuhl. But until I've heardand acknowledged a verbal order, it has no force. If I'm wrong, he'llget my resignation. If I'm right, that suspension would be embarrassingall around.     You're defying lawful authority! I'm in charge here now. Miss Meuhlstepped to the local communicator.     I'm going to report this terrible thing to the Groaci at once, andoffer my profound\u2014     Don't touch that screen, Retief said. You go sit in that cornerwhere I can keep an eye on you. I'm going to make a sealed tape fortransmission to Headquarters, along with a call for an armed taskforce. Then we'll settle down to wait.     Retief ignored Miss Meuhl's fury as he spoke into the recorder.     The local communicator chimed. Miss Meuhl jumped up, staring at it.     Go ahead, Retief said. Answer it.     A Groacian official appeared on the screen.     Yolanda Meuhl, he said without preamble, for the Foreign Minister ofthe Groacian Autonomy, I herewith accredit you as Terrestrial Consulto Groac, in accordance with the advices transmitted to my governmentdirect from the Terrestrial Headquarters. As consul, you are requestedto make available for questioning Mr. J.

        "Query": "What is the storyline of THE FIVE HELLS OF ORION?",
        "Summary_1": "Herrell McCray is a navigator on the Starship Jodrell Bank heading for the colonies circling Betelgeuse Nine when he is inexplicably abducted from his ship. He finds himself staring around a dark, silent room full of indeterminate objects. He believes he hears a faint voice in the distance, and suddenly a pinkish light illuminates his path of vision. He sees many familiar objects including a spacesuit, a child's rocking chair, a girl's bathing suit, and more; he wonders how he got there and why such objects are there with him. Three of the room's walls are made of a hard, organic compound, and from grates comprising the fourth wall pours a pungent air. As McCray's confidence returns, he wonders what happened to the Starship Jodrell Bank and begins to wonder if he is dead. When he remembers spacesuits come with radios, he tries contacting the ship to no avail and realizes he must be many lightyears away. Then, with sudden horror, he realizes that he cannot see his own body, and the room goes dark again. Outside the room, an alien named \"Hatcher\" runs a probe team tasked with observing McCray and running experiments on him in order to develop an understanding of the human species. Their \"probes\" are mandibles that can attach and detach from their round, jelly-like bodies and run errands and conduct scientific research. Hatcher makes his way to the supervising council of all probes to report the team's findings that McCray displayed \"paranormal powers\" when using his radio to establish contact with his ship. The council urges Hatcher to continue his studies with haste because a member of The Central Masses probe team has been captured by the Old Ones, an ancient species hostile to Hatcher's people. His team must put McCray through a series of tests in order to help them potentially discover a way to defend themselves against the Old Ones. As Hatcher considers the best way to establish communication with McCray without causing him harm, his assistant alerts him to the presence of a female human on the viewing console. Hatcher orders the assistant to bring her in as they may need another human in case McCray dies. Hours after his initial transmission was sent to the ship, McCray receives a response from the ship. He dispatches another transmission and begins to notice the room getting hotter as the air grows more toxic. Hatcher has started the survival portion of the test. McCray uses an ax to break his way out of the room and enters another dark room full of desks he assumes are some kind of workspaces for his captors. Suddenly, he hears a woman's voice crying out for the Jodrell Bank and makes his way toward her. Hatcher and his assistant discuss whether to abandon McCray and focus on the female since she appears to be more susceptible to communication, but they ultimately decide against it. McCray eventually finds the woman through a series of doors and hallways.",
        "Summary_2": "Herrell McCray is the navigator on Starship Jodrell Bank on a long haul flight from Earth to the colonies of Betelgeuse Nine. During a routine course check, he suddenly teleports into a dark and scary room filled with a strange melange of objects - from a spacesuit to a woman\u2019s bathing suit. Some he recognizes from his early life, like a childhood rocking chair. He calls for help on the ultrawave radio of the spacesuit, but there is no answer, telling him he is a long way from anything since the range of the radio is hundreds of light-years. McCray is being observed from another room by an alien Probe Team led by Hatcher. They are watching McCray\u2019s every action with fascination. They think he has paranormal powers when he operates the radio and they detect electromagnetic vibrations that are modified by his voice. Hatcher rushes to tell a councillor from the supervising council of all the alien probes about the discovery and he is ordered to establish contact with McCray immediately because they need allies in the race of Old Ones (their word for humans). Hatcher defends going at a slow pace since they have frightened McCray so deeply already, but the concillor does not budge since there has been an incident of one of their staff on the Central Masses probe team getting captured by their human subject. Hatcher\u2019s people are capturing humans from Jodrell Bank because they detected it near their territory and were almost completely destroyed when they last encountered humans. They are now desperate to find ways to fight or escape them.\nBack in McCray\u2019s observation room, he hears a faint voice responding from his ship via the spacesuit radio. This gives him hope, but also panic because he calculates that he must be more than five hundred light-years away from his ship for such a long lag. He radios back, but knows there will be no response for several more hours. The room suddenly gets very hot and a chlorine-like gas is being pumped in that burns his lungs. He quickly puts on the spacesuit which will keep him cool and filter the air, then picks up an axe and breaks out of the room into a hallway. He finds the parts of an antique bullet gun on a bench outside, and then hears a woman scream out to Jodrell Bank for help on his radio.\nThe heat and chlorine gas are a survival test, and McCray passes. McCray uses his radio to locate the woman. He notices that there is a new door where there was not one before. Hatcher has engineered this so that McCray will find the woman and they can study them communicating with each other. Hatcher thinks this is a step toward successful contact with humans. McCray finds the woman face down on the floor. She wears coveralls and he believes she may be Chinese. McCray wonders if she has asphyxiated by breathing the air in the room.\n",
        "Summary_3": "An unnamed alien race has abducted the navigator, Herrell McCray, from a ship to use him to help save their race. They plan to test his intelligence and then communicate with him, making him an ally to perhaps work as an intermediary between their race and the Old Ones. They call the human race the Old Ones, and many years ago, they had an encounter with them that left the aliens fleeing for their survival and ending up having to abandon their populated planet. The problem now is that the humans are sending out mapping parties that are getting dangerously close to where the aliens live now. The probe team observing McCray is led by Hatcher; his team observes everything McCray does and reports significant findings to the supervising council overall probe teams.\n\tAnother one of their probe teams has lost a member of their team to the Old Ones, and now the aliens are worried about what the Old Ones will learn and what they will do. For this reason, they are having to step up the pace of their work with McCray, even though Hatcher is worried about somehow harming him. They have tried working with other humans in the past, but they have all died during the stages of their tests.\n\tThe probe team acquires another test subject, a female, who begins calling out for help. McCray hears her and begins making his way to her. She is unconscious when he finds her, and he suspects that it is from breathing the air in the building. The aliens have not communicated with her either, yet, but believe they are beginning to establish the start of communication. They believe McCray and the female will communicate with each other, which might help them establish communication with McCray.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Herrel McCray, the navigator on the Jodrell Bank, wakes up to find himself in a dark room. He stumbles around for a bit before a pink glow lights up parts of the room. He sifts through the items on the floor, objects from Earth mostly, and looks at the metal walls. One of the three walls is made up of an organic plastic compound, but the rest are impenetrable. He sees a spacesuit and uses its microphone to emit a distress signal to Jodrell Bank. He hears nothing in response, meaning he must be hundreds of light-years away from them. Suddenly, the light goes out, but not before he realized he couldn\u2019t see his reflection in the spacesuit. As he freaks out, the reader is introduced to Hatcher, the lead alien probe of the team observing Herrel. He and his probe team believe that Hatcher has paranormal powers because he differs so greatly from their blob-like race. Hatcher reports back to the supervising council and informs them of the Earthman\u2019s doings, specifically his ability to speak through his throat. They order him to establish communication quickly, since the Central Masses Team just sent out the message that one of their probes is missing, presumably killed by their test subject. Hatcher thinks they\u2019re moving too fast since their previous subjects didn\u2019t survive. He goes to the eating room, removes his previous day\u2019s digested food from his slit, and puts in new vegetation. His assistant sends him an image telepathically of another human, this time a woman, that they had just captured. Hatcher informs his team they must move into Stage Two. Herrell hears a click, feels the room get warmer, and smells something unpleasant. He turns on the light in the spacesuit and is relieved to see his body. Jodrell Bank calls him back, so he sends in a long message explaining his situation. He hears nothing back. He climbs into the spacesuit, realizing the air is toxic, and lets the spacesuit provide fresh air. He grabs an ax off the floor and uses it to break out of the poisonous room. Once out, he tries to open a cupboard in the new area but is unable to. He sees a pistol that had been taken apart before. Jodrell Bank calls back in, but this time a woman responds, calling for help. McCray communicates with her and tracks her using her descriptions. He runs around the compound, trying to find her, and eventually goes through a door that was previously unopened. He finally finds her, unconscious on the floor. ",

Whatever it was, he had no businessin it; for five minutes before he had been spaceborne, on the Long Jumpfrom Earth to the thriving colonies circling Betelgeuse Nine. McCraywas ship's navigator, plotting course corrections\u2014not that there wereany, ever; but the reason there were none was that the check-sightingswere made every hour of the long flight. He had read off the azimuthangles from the computer sights, automatically locked on their beaconstars, and found them correct; then out of long habit confirmed thelocking mechanism visually. It was only a personal quaintness; he haddone it a thousand times. And while he was looking at Betelgeuse, Rigeland Saiph ... it happened.     The room was totally dark, and it seemed to be furnished with acollection of hard, sharp, sticky and knobby objects of various shapesand a number of inconvenient sizes. McCray tripped over somethingthat rocked under his feet and fell against something that clatteredhollowly. He picked himself up, braced against something that smelleddangerously of halogen compounds, and scratched his shoulder, rightthrough his space-tunic, against something that vibrated as he touchedit.     McCray had no idea where he was, and no way to find out.     Not only was he in darkness, but in utter silence as well. No. Notquite utter silence.     Somewhere, just at the threshold of his senses, there was somethinglike a voice. He could not quite hear it, but it was there. He sat asstill as he could, listening; it remained elusive.     Probably it was only an illusion.     But the room itself was hard fact. McCray swore violently and out loud.     It was crazy and impossible. There simply was no way for him to getfrom a warm, bright navigator's cubicle on      Starship Jodrell Bank     tothis damned, dark, dismal hole of a place where everything was out tohurt him and nothing explained what was going on. He cried aloud inexasperation: If I could only      see     !     He tripped and fell against something that was soft, slimy and, likebaker's dough, not at all resilient.     A flickering halo of pinkish light appeared. He sat up, startled. Hewas looking at something that resembled a suit of medieval armor.   <doc-sep> A dropshaft deposited him on a walkway. The crowd, a rainbow of men inpajamas and robes, women in Neo-Sino dresses and goldleaf hats, swepthim against the rail. For a moment, squashed to the wire, he stared ahundred feet down at the river of automobiles.      Phobos!     he thoughtwildly.      If the barrier gives, I'll be sliced in two by a dorsal finbefore I hit the pavement!       The August twilight wrapped him in heat and stickiness. He could seeneither stars nor even moon through the city's blaze. The forest ofmulti-colored towers, cataracting half a mile skyward across moreacreage than his eyes reached, was impressive and all that, but\u2014heused to stroll out in the rock garden behind his cottage and smoke apipe in company with Orion. On summer evenings, that is, when thetemperature wasn't too far below zero.       Why did they tap me for this job?     he asked himself in a surge ofhomesickness.      What the hell is the Martian Embassy here for?       He, Peter Matheny, was no more than a peaceful professor ofsociodynamics at Devil's Kettle University. Of course, he had advisedhis government before now\u2014in fact, the Red Ankh Society had been hisidea\u2014but still he was at ease only with his books and his chess andhis mineral collection, a faculty poker party on Tenthday night and anoccasional trip to Swindletown\u2014       My God     , thought Matheny,      here I am, one solitary outlander in thegreatest commercial empire the human race has ever seen, and I'msupposed to find my planet a con man!       He began walking, disconsolately, at random. His lizardskin shirt andblack culottes drew glances, but derisive ones: their cut was fortyyears out of date. He should find himself a hotel, he thought drearily,but he wasn't tired; the spaceport would pneumo his baggage to himwhenever he did check in. The few Martians who had been to Earth hadgone into ecstasies over the automation which put any service you couldname on a twenty-four-hour basis. But it would be a long time beforeMars had such machines. If ever.     The city roared at him.     He fumbled after his pipe.      Of course     , he told himself,      that's whythe Embassy can't act. I may find it advisable to go outside the law.Please, sir, where can I contact the underworld?       He wished gambling were legal on Earth. The Constitution of the MartianRepublic forbade sumptuary and moral legislation; quite apart from therambunctious individualism which that document formulated, the articlewas a practical necessity. Life was bleak enough on the deserts,without being denied the pleasure of trying to bottom-deal some friendwho was happily trying to mark the cards. Matheny would have found afew spins of roulette soothing: it was always an intellectual challengeto work out the system by which the management operated a wheel. Butmore, he would have been among people he understood.     The frightful thing about the Earthman was the way he seemed toexist only in organized masses. A gypsy snake oil peddler, ploddinghis syrtosaur wagon across Martian sands, just didn't have a prayeragainst, say, the Grant, Harding & Adams Public Relations Agency.   <doc-sep> The weeks that followed were like a blur in Willard's mind. Though theship was utterly incapable of motion, the chance meteor that damagedit had spared the convertors and assimilators. Through constant careand attention the frail balance that meant life or death could be kept.The substance of waste and refuse was torn down and rebuilt as preciousfood and air. It was even possible to create more than was needed.     When this was done, Willard immediately regretted it. For it would bethen that the days and the weeks would roll by endlessly. Sometimeshe thought he would go mad when, sitting at the useless controlboard, which was his habit, he would stare for hours and hours inthe direction of the Sun where he knew the Earth would be. A greatloneliness would then seize upon him and an agony that no man had everknown would tear at his heart. He would then turn away, full of despairand hopeless pain.     Two years after Dobbin's death a strange thing happened. Willard wassitting at his accustomed place facing the unmoving vista of the stars.A chance glance at Orion's belt froze him still. A star had flickered!Distinctly, as if a light veil had been placed over it and then lifted,it dimmed and turned bright again. What strange phenomena was this? Hewatched and then another star faded momentarily in the exact fashion.And then a third! And a fourth! And a fifth!     Willard's heart gave a leap and the lethargy of two years vanishedinstantly. Here, at last, was something to do. It might be only a fewminutes before he would understand what it was, but those few minuteswould help while away the maddening long hours. Perhaps it was a massof fine meteorites or a pocket of gas that did not disperse, or even amoving warp of space-light. Whatever it was, it was a phenomena worthinvestigating and Willard seized upon it as a dying man seizes upon thelast flashing seconds of life.     Willard traced its course by the flickering stars and gradually plottedits semi-circular course. It was not from the solar system but,instead, headed toward it. A rapid check-up on his calculations causedhis heart to beat in ever quickening excitement. Whatever it was, itwould reach the      Mary Lou     .     Again he looked out the port. Unquestionably the faint mass was nearinghis ship. It was round in shape and almost invisible. The stars,though dimmed, could still be seen through it. There was somethingabout its form that reminded him of an old-fashioned rocket ship. Itresembled one of those that had done pioneer service in the lanes fortyyears ago or more. Resembled one? It was one! Unquestionably, thoughhalf-invisible and like a piece of glass immersed in water, it was arocket ship.     But the instruments on the control board could not lie. The presence ofany material body within a hundred thousand miles would be revealed.But the needle on the gauge did not quiver. Nothing indicated thepresence of a ship. But the evidence of his eyes was incontestable.     Or was it? Doubt gripped him. Did the loneliness of all these yearsin space twist his mind till he was imagining the appearance of faintghost-like rocket ships?     The thought shot through his mind like a thunder bolt. Ghost Ship!Was this the thing that Dobbin had seen before he died? But that wasimpossible. Ghost Ships existed nowhere but in legends and tall talestold by men drunk with the liquors of Mars.     There is no ship there. There is no ship there, Willard told himselfover and over again as he looked at the vague outline of the ship, nowmotionless a few hundred miles away.     Deep within him a faint voice cried,       It's come\u2014for me!      but Willardstilled it. This was no fantasy. There was a scientific reason for it.There must be! Or should there be? Throughout all Earth history therehad been Ghost Ships sailing the Seven Seas\u2014ships doomed to roamforever because their crew broke some unbreakable law. If this was truefor the ships of the seas, why not for the ships of empty space?     He looked again at the strange ship. It was motionless. At least it wasnot nearing him. Willard could see nothing but its vague outline. Amoment later he could discern a faint motion. It was turning! The GhostShip was turning back! Unconsciously Willard reached out with his handas if to hold it back, for when it was gone he would be alone again.     But the Ghost Ship went on. Its outline became smaller and smaller,fainter and fainter.     Trembling, Willard turned away from the window as he saw the rocketrecede and vanish into the emptiness of space. Once more the dreadedloneliness of the stars descended upon him.  "

        "Query": "What is the location where the events of THE FIVE HELLS OF ORION take place?",
        "Summary_1": "The story begins sometime during the Starship Jodrell Bank's Long Jump from Earth to the colonies surrounding Betegeuses Nine as it passes by Betelgeuse, Rigel, and Saiph. The rest of the action takes place in an unknown area of space within a \"great buried structure\" that is a massive labyrinth of dark rooms and hallways with unusual doors that seem to shift and change after passing through them. This is where Hatcher and his probe team observe McCray in his enclosure, which is no bigger than a prison cell, dark, and full of vaguely familiar objects: a spacesuit, a child's rocking chair, a chemistry set, a girl's bathing suit, an ax. Three of the walls are made of a hard, organic compound and the fourth is covered in grates from which a halogen-smelling air pours out into the room. Although everything is dark, Hatcher occasionally triggers a pinkish, halo-like light that allows McCray to examine his surroundings. Elsewhere in the structure is a place where the supervising council of all probes stays in permanent session, monitoring the work of all probe teams including the team at The Central Masses. When McCray breaks out of his initial enclosure, he finds himself in another dark room, large and bare. Using the beam from his suit lamp, he sees shelves, cupboard-like contraptions, and level surfaces that appeared to be waist-high workbenches attached to the walls and ceiling. He finds a gun on one of the benches. After finding the gun, he realizes the door he came through is gone; instead, there is an uneven, three-sided door he enters to find the unconscious woman on the other side.",
        "Summary_2": "The story is set in a time when humans have interstellar travel and are mapping new galaxies. They are feared by at least some of the aliens they have encountered, such as Hatcher\u2019s people who were almost completely wiped out after their last human contact. The aliens are so fearful now that they have abandoned a planet as a decoy for the humans and are capturing humans off the Starship Jodrell Bank that they\u2019ve detected in their galaxy to probe them and find out ways to fight or escape humans for good.\nWhen McCray is captured, he awakes in a strange room with three walls made of a hard organic compound, and one wall made of grates that a pungent halogen smell came out of. There is a dim pink light in the room, and it is filled with meaningful objects from McCray\u2019s past and present that he thinks of like a creepy trophy room of his life. Importantly there is a modern spacesuit that saves his life when the aliens administer a survival test that heats the room and pumps in chlorine gas through the grates. Directly outside of this room is a sterile hallway and the rest of the testing facilities of the aliens. There are other rooms similar to his where other humans are being probed by the aliens, such as the woman he hears screaming through the radio of his space suit who is in a nearby room.\nHatcher, the alien in charge of conducting the Probe Team to make contact with the humans, observes them with his team of scientists and they take detailed notes on their actions that are reported to the supervisory council of probes in another nearby room.\n",
        "Summary_3": "The story is set in the spiral arm of the galaxy where the aliens who abduct McCray are living. McCray is abducted from the Starship Jodrell Bank where he is navigator as the ship is on a trip from Earth to the colonies in Betelgeuse Nine. McCray is on the ship one minute, and the next, he is in a completely dark room full of unidentifiable objects. Unknown to him, the objects have been selected by the aliens as ones that are on McCray\u2019s ship to give him a homey setting. McCray has been trying to feel the objects and his surroundings to determine where he is. When he calls out in frustration because he can\u2019t see, they light up a spacesuit that gives him enough illumination to see the objects that include a set of Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, a space-ax, an old fashioned children\u2019s rocking chair, a chemistry set, and a girl\u2019s bathing suit. Three of the walls, the floor, and the room's ceiling are an unusual substance, possibly cellulose. The fourth wall is grated like a ventilation system, and there is a faint smell of halogen gases lingering in the room. The spacesuit has a radio which McCray uses to contact his ship, but it doesn\u2019t respond immediately. \n\tFrom another room, McCray is being observed by Hatcher and his probe team. Hatcher isn\u2019t exactly male; his race doesn\u2019t have them, but he isn\u2019t female either. He is a three-foot sphere-shaped glob of jelly covered with a hard shell. His arms and legs are not attached but rather are snakelike structures that obey his brain. They work best close to the body but can work up to a fourth of a mile from it. Hatcher\u2019s appendages are the calmest ones in the room.\n\tThe building where all this takes place is located underground. The supervising council is located in the same building, and Hatcher can move from his observation room to the council\u2019s room in a matter of minutes. Due to the lag in transmission time and message reception, McCray believes he is somewhere around five hundred light-years away from his ship.\n",
        "Summary_4": "The Five Hells of Orion by Frederick Pohl takes place on an unknown planet light-years away from the realm of human discovery. The probes, a blob-like alien race, have captured two humans and brought them back to their home to study and observe them. Herrel McCray wakes up to a dark prison cell filled with Earthly items, such as a book or a bathing suit. This tiny cell has three impenetrable walls, and then the fourth is made of something similar to plastic. He cuts into the fourth wall with an ax and escapes the room only to arrive in a new one. This one features cupboards with the same impenetrable surfaces and an antique pistol that had been previously taken apart. As Herrel makes his way through the story, the reader sees very little of the compound they\u2019re keeping him in, as there is presumably not a lot of light. However, we do know the probes eat in an eating room that features a trough where they can dispose of their bodily fluids. ",

Forone thing, a time traveler wouldn'tbe conspicuous. At a festival like thissomebody with a strange accent, orwho didn't know exactly how to wearhis clothes correctly, or was off theordinary in any of a dozen otherways, wouldn't be noticed. You couldbe a four-armed space traveler fromMars, and you still wouldn't be conspicuousat the      Oktoberfest     . Peoplewould figure they had D.T.'s.     But why would a time travelerwant to go to a\u2014 Betty began.     Why not! What better opportunityto study a people than when theyare in their cups? If      you     could goback a few thousand years, the thingsyou would wish to see would be aRoman Triumph, perhaps the Ritesof Dionysus, or one of Alexander'sorgies. You wouldn't want to wanderup and down the streets of, say,Athens while nothing was going on,particularly when you might be revealedas a suspicious character notbeing able to speak the language, notknowing how to wear the clothes andnot familiar with the city's layout.He took a deep breath. No ma'am,you'd have to stick to some greatevent, both for the sake of actualinterest and for protection against beingunmasked.     The old boy wound it up. Well,that's the story. What are your rates?The      Oktoberfest     starts on Friday andcontinues for sixteen days. You cantake the plane to Munich, spend aweek there and\u2014     Simon was shaking his head. Notinterested.     As soon as Betty had got her jawback into place, she glared unbelievinglyat him.     Mr. Oyster was taken aback himself.See here, young man, I realizethis isn't an ordinary assignment,however, as I said, I am willing torisk a considerable portion of myfortune\u2014     Sorry, Simon said. Can't bedone.     A hundred dollars a day plus expenses,Mr. Oyster said quietly. Ilike the fact that you already seemto have some interest and knowledgeof the matter. I liked the way youknew my name when I walked in thedoor; my picture doesn't appear oftenin the papers.     No go, Simon said, a sad qualityin his voice.     A fifty thousand dollar bonus ifyou bring me a time traveler.     Out of the question, Simonsaid.     But      why     ? Betty wailed.     Just for laughs, Simon told thetwo of them sourly, suppose I tellyou a funny story. It goes likethis:      I got a thousand dollars from Mr.Oyster (Simon began) in the wayof an advance, and leaving him withBetty who was making out a receipt,I hustled back to the apartment andpacked a bag. Hell, I'd wanted a vacationanyway, this was a natural. Onthe way to Idlewild I stopped off atthe Germany Information Offices forsome tourist literature.     It takes roughly three and a halfhours to get to Gander from Idlewild.I spent the time planning thefun I was going to have.     It takes roughly seven and a halfhours from Gander to Shannon andI spent that time dreaming up materialI could put into my reports toMr. Oyster. I was going to have togive him some kind of report for hismoney. Time travel yet! What alaugh!     Between Shannon and Munich afaint suspicion began to simmer inmy mind. These statistics I read onthe      Oktoberfest     in the Munich touristpamphlets. Five million peopleattended annually.     Where did five million peoplecome from to attend an overgrownfestival in comparatively remoteSouthern Germany? The tourist seasonis over before September 21st,first day of the gigantic beer bust.Nor could the Germans account forany such number. Munich itself hasa population of less than a million,counting children.     And those millions of gallons ofbeer, the hundreds of thousands ofchickens, the herds of oxen. Whoponied up all the money for such expenditures?How could the averageGerman, with his twenty-five dollarsa week salary?     In Munich there was no hotelspace available. I went to the Bahnhofwhere they have a hotel serviceand applied. They put my namedown, pocketed the husky bribe,showed me where I could check mybag, told me they'd do what theycould, and to report back in a fewhours.     I had another suspicious twinge.If five million people attended thisbeer bout, how were they accommodated?     The      Theresienwiese     , the fairground, was only a few blocksaway. I was stiff from the plane rideso I walked.  <doc-sep> The officer picked up the dollar bill and fingered it with evidentinterest. He turned it over and studied the printing. United States ofAmerica, he read aloud. What are those?     It's the name of the country I come from, Jeff said carefully.I\u2014uh\u2014got on the wrong train, apparently, and must have come furtherthan I thought. What's the name of this place?     This is Costa, West Goodland, in the Continental Federation. Say, youmust come from an umpty remote part of the world if you don't knowabout this country. His eyes narrowed. Where'd you learn to speakFederal, if you come from so far?     Jeff said helplessly, I can't explain, if you don't know about theUnited States. Listen, can you take me to a bank, or some place wherethey know about foreign exchange?     The policeman scowled. How'd you get into this country, anyway? Yougot immigrate clearance?     An angry muttering started among the bystanders.     The policeman made up his mind. You come with me.     At the police station, Jeff put his elbows dejectedly on the highcounter while the policeman talked to an officer in charge. Some menwhom Jeff took for reporters got up from a table and eased over tolisten.     I don't know whether to charge them with fakemake, bumsy, peekage orlunate, the policeman said as he finished.     His superior gave Jeff a long puzzled stare.     Jeff sighed. I know it sounds impossible, but a man brought me insomething he claimed was a time traveler. You speak the same language Ido\u2014more or less\u2014but everything else is kind of unfamiliar. I belongin the United States, a country in North America. I can't believe I'mso far in the future that the United States has been forgotten.     There ensued a long, confused, inconclusive interrogation.     The man behind the desk asked questions which seemed stupid to Jeff andgot answers which probably seemed stupid to him.     The reporters quizzed Jeff gleefully. Come out, what are youadvertising? they kept asking. Who got you up to this?     The police puzzled over his driver's license and the other cards in hiswallet. They asked repeatedly about the lack of a Work License, whichJeff took to be some sort of union card. Evidently there was gravedoubt that he had any legal right to be in the country.     In the end, Jeff and Ann were locked in separate cells for the night.Jeff groaned and pounded the bars as he thought of his wife, imprisonedand alone in a smelly jail. After hours of pacing the cell, he lay downin the cot and reached automatically for his silver pillbox. Then hehesitated.     In past weeks, his insomnia had grown worse and worse, so that latelyhe had begun taking stronger pills. After a longing glance at thebig red and yellow capsules, he put the box away. Whatever tomorrowbrought, it wouldn't find him slow and drowsy.      IV     He passed a wakeful night. In the early morning, he looked up to see alittle man with a briefcase at his cell door.     Wish joy, Mr. Elliott, the man said coolly. I am one of Mr. Bullen'sbarmen. You know, represent at law? He sent me to arrange your release,if you are ready to be reasonable.     Jeff lay there and put his hands behind his head. I doubt if I'mready. I'm comfortable here. By the way, how did you know where I was?     No problem. When we read in this morning's newspapers about a manclaiming to be a time traveler, we knew.     All right. Now start explaining. Until I understand where I am, Bullenisn't getting me out of here.     The lawyer smiled and sat down. Mr. Kersey told you yesterday\u2014you'vegone back six years. But you'll need some mental gymnastics tounderstand. Time is a dimension, not a stream of events like a moviefilm. A film never changes. Space does\u2014and time does. For example, ifa movie showed a burning house at Sixth and Main, would you expect tofind a house burning whenever you returned to that corner?     You mean to say that if I went back to 1865, I wouldn't find the CivilWar was over and Lincoln had been assassinated?     If you go back to the time you call 1865\u2014which is most easilydone\u2014you will find that the people there know nothing of a Lincoln orthat war.     Jeff looked blank. What are they doing then?     The little man spread his hands. What are the people doing now atSixth and Main? Certainly not the same things they were doing the dayof the fire. We're talking about a dimension, not an event. Don't yougrasp the difference between the two?     Nope. To me, 1865 means the end of the Civil War. How else can youspeak of a point in time except by the events that happened then?     Well, if you go to a place in three-dimensional space\u2014say, a lakein the mountains\u2014how do you identify that place? By looking forlandmarks. It doesn't matter that an eagle is soaring over a mountainpeak. That's only an event. The peak is the landmark. You follow me?     So far. Keep talking.  "

        "Query": "What is the role of Hatcher in THE FIVE HELLS OF ORION?",
        "Summary_1": "Hatcher is an alien of an unnamed race. He cannot be described as male because his race \"had no true males.\" He is three feet tall with a hard-shelled, circular body of jelly. His arms and legs are snakelike mandibles that can detach from his body, and he can control them with his brain from vast distances, although their effectiveness diminishes the further they travel from Hatcher's body. When they return to Hatcher's body, they rest in crevices in his skin. When he feeds, a slit appears at the bottom of his body and emits a thin, fetid fluid Hatcher throws away; he then places a nutrient-filled, kelp-like vegetable in the slit for sustenance. Hatcher is young, adventurous, scientifically gifted, knowledgeable, and enjoys playing sports. Although he does not feel the equivalent of human empathy, he also doesn't want harm to befall McCray and feels responsible for his proper care. Hatcher manages the probe team that observes McCray throughout the story, and he reports on McCray's behavior and his use of \"paranormal powers\" to the supervising council. Hatcher worries about hurrying to establish communication with McCray because he believes it will harm and perhaps even kill him, and later he wonders if communication is even possible at all with humans (later, he notes he is able to establish a minor level of communication with the female but wonders if others might be able to communicate with her). When Hatcher makes his report to the supervising council, they inform him of the return of the Old Ones, who have captured a member of The Central Masses Probe Team. He questions whether or not to tell his crew considering he was never explicitly told not to by the council. In many ways, Hatcher and McCray are similar although Hatcher is generally disgusted by the human body.",
        "Summary_2": "Hatcher is an alien from a race that was once nearly completely destroyed by humans (they call Old Ones) before. They are now probing humans from McCray\u2019s ship, Starship Jodrell Bank, because they have detected the human mapping mission in the spiral arm of their galaxy and are afraid of another encounter. They are looking for ways to fight or to escape humans for good, and have abandoned one of their planets as a precautionary decoy to avoid an encounter.\nHatcher runs one of the alien Probe Teams, and McCray is one of his human subjects. Hatcher is an adventurous, young scientist who enjoys games and sports, and he is in a position of importance - reporting only to a Councillor of the supervising council of all probes. Hatcher is a three foot diameter sphere with a hard shell and jelly interior. He possesses arms and legs but they are not attached to the sphere of his body. He controls those appendages with his brain telepathically, such that they can be operating in one room when he is in another. He doesn\u2019t want to harm his subjects, including McCray, because they are difficult to acquire. Hatcher doesn\u2019t necessarily have emotions, but he can comprehend human feelings and knows when McCray is in distress during the experiments. Hatcher\u2019s role is essential to his people making contact with humans and finding ways to deal with them so that they don\u2019t have to continue living through generations of fear about being wiped out by them.

        "Summary_3": "Hatcher leads the probe team observing Herrell McCray and testing him when he discovers that McCray has paranormal powers (which are actually his voice and the radio microphone). Once he realizes this, he immediately takes the news to the supervising council. After discussing the new information, the council orders Hatcher to establish communication with McCray immediately. They explain that the Central Masses team has just lost one of their probe team to the Old Ones, so the danger is even greater than before, and time is running out. Hatcher is reluctant to push McCray for fear of causing harm to him, but the council lets him know they are facing an emergency. Hatcher informs his team the council is ordering them to move to Stage Two. They increase the heat and pour a halogen gas into the room and watch as McCray uses the spacesuit for protection and breaks out of the room using the space-ax. This means that McCray has passed the first survival test. When the female subject cries out in pain, Hatcher watches with interest as McCray makes his way to her. He thinks that the female and McCray are communicating with each other. Hatcher\u2019s team adds a door to the room McCray is in so that he can find the female, and Hatcher is pleased that McCray has made it this far in their test.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Hatcher is one of the probes and the leader of his particular study group. He is a three-foot-tall blob with detachable limbs. He eats through a slit lower on his body, which processes vegetation and then essentially pees it out. He is fairly young, but also very intelligent and capable. Hatcher acts as the commander over the team of probes that are testing and observing Herrel McCray. He, of course, reports to the Council who oversee several different probe operations. Hatcher does not want to kill the Earthmen and believes they are moving too fast with their tests. ",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      His name was Herrell McCray and he was scared.     As best he could tell, he was in a sort of room no bigger than a prisoncell. Perhaps it was a prison cell. Whatever it was, he had no businessin it; for five minutes before he had been spaceborne, on the Long Jumpfrom Earth to the thriving colonies circling Betelgeuse Nine. McCraywas ship's navigator, plotting course corrections\u2014not that there wereany, ever; but the reason there were none was that the check-sightingswere made every hour of the long flight.

It was only a personal quaintness; he haddone it a thousand times. And while he was looking at Betelgeuse, Rigeland Saiph ... it happened.     The room was totally dark, and it seemed to be furnished with acollection of hard, sharp, sticky and knobby objects of various shapesand a number of inconvenient sizes. McCray tripped over somethingthat rocked under his feet and fell against something that clatteredhollowly. He picked himself up, braced against something that smelleddangerously of halogen compounds, and scratched his shoulder, rightthrough his space-tunic, against something that vibrated as he touchedit.     McCray had no idea where he was, and no way to find out.     Not only was he in darkness, but in utter silence as well. No. Notquite utter silence.     Somewhere, just at the threshold of his senses, there was somethinglike a voice. He could not quite hear it, but it was there. He sat asstill as he could, listening; it remained elusive.     Probably it was only an illusion.     But the room itself was hard fact. McCray swore violently and out loud.     It was crazy and impossible. There simply was no way for him to getfrom a warm, bright navigator's cubicle on      Starship Jodrell Bank     tothis damned, dark, dismal hole of a place where everything was out tohurt him and nothing explained what was going on. He cried aloud inexasperation: If I could only      see     !     He tripped and fell against something that was soft, slimy and, likebaker's dough, not at all resilient.     A flickering halo of pinkish light appeared. He sat up, startled. Hewas looking at something that resembled a suit of medieval armor.   <doc-sep> Hatcher hurried through the halls of the great buried structure inwhich he worked, toward the place where the supervising council of allprobes would be in permanent session. They admitted him at once.     Hatcher identified himself and gave a quick, concise report:     The subject recovered consciousness a short time ago and began toinspect his enclosure. His method of doing so was to put his ownmembers in physical contact with the various objects in the enclosure.After observing him do this for a time we concluded he might be unableto see and so we illuminated his field of vision for him.     This appeared to work well for a time. He seemed relativelyundisturbed. However, he then reverted to physical-contact,manipulating certain appurtenances of an artificial skin we hadprovided for him.     He then began to vibrate the atmosphere by means of resonating organsin his breathing passage.     Simultaneously, the object he was holding, attached to the artificialskin, was discovered to be generating paranormal forces.     The supervising council rocked with excitement. You're sure? demandedone of the councilmen.     Yes, sir. The staff is preparing a technical description of the forcesnow, but I can say that they are electromagnetic vibrations modulatinga carrier wave of very high speed, and in turn modulated by thevibrations of the atmosphere caused by the subject's own breathing.     Fantastic, breathed the councillor, in a tone of dawning hope. Howabout communicating with him, Hatcher? Any progress?     Well ... not much, sir. He suddenly panicked. We don't know why; butwe thought we'd better pull back and let him recover for a while.     The council conferred among itself for a moment, Hatcher waiting. Itwas not really a waste of time for him; with the organs he had left inthe probe-team room, he was in fairly close touch with what was goingon\u2014knew that McCray was once again fumbling among the objects in thedark, knew that the team-members had tried illuminating the room forhim briefly and again produced the rising panic.     Still, Hatcher fretted. He wanted to get back.     Stop fidgeting, commanded the council leader abruptly. Hatcher, youare to establish communication at once.     But, sir.... Hatcher swung closer, his thick skin quivering slightly;he would have gestured if he had brought members with him to gesturewith. We've done everything we dare. We've made the place homeyfor him\u2014 actually, what he said was more like,      we've warmed thebiophysical nuances of his enclosure     \u2014and tried to guess his needs;and we're frightening him half to death. We      can't     go faster. Thiscreature is in no way similar to us, you know. He relies on paranormalforces\u2014heat, light, kinetic energy\u2014for his life. His chemistry is notours, his processes of thought are not ours, his entire organism iscloser to the inanimate rocks of a sea-bottom than to ourselves.     Understood, Hatcher. In your first report you stated these creatureswere intelligent.     Yes, sir. But not in our way.     But in      a     way, and you must learn that way. I know. One lobster-clawshaped member drifted close to the councillor's body and raised itselfin an admonitory gesture. You want time. But we don't have time,Hatcher. Yours is not the only probe team working. The Central Massesteam has just turned in a most alarming report.     Have they secured a subject? Hatcher demanded jealously.     The councillor paused. Worse than that, Hatcher. I am afraid theirsubjects have secured one of them. One of them is missing.     There was a moment's silence. Frozen, Hatcher could only wait. Thecouncil room was like a tableau in a museum until the councillor spokeagain, each council member poised over his locus-point, his membersdrifting about him.     Finally the councillor said, I speak for all of us, I think. If theOld Ones have seized one of our probers our time margin is considerablynarrowed. Indeed, we may not have any time at all. You must doeverything you can to establish communication with your subject.     But the danger to the specimen\u2014 Hatcher protested automatically.     \u2014is no greater, said the councillor, than the danger to every oneof us if we do not find allies      now     .   <doc-sep> Hatcher returned to his laboratory gloomily.     It was just like the council to put the screws on; they had areputation for demanding results at any cost\u2014even at the cost ofdestroying the only thing you had that would make results possible.     Hatcher did not like the idea of endangering the Earthman. It cannotbe said that he was emotionally involved; it was not pity or sympathythat caused him to regret the dangers in moving too fast towardcommunication. Not even Hatcher had quite got over the revoltingphysical differences between the Earthman and his own people. ButHatcher did not want him destroyed. It had been difficult enoughgetting him here.     Hatcher checked through the members that he had left with the rest ofhis team and discovered that there were no immediate emergencies, so hetook time to eat. In Hatcher's race this was accomplished in ways notentirely pleasant to Earthmen. A slit in the lower hemisphere of hisbody opened, like a purse, emitting a thin, pussy, fetid fluid whichHatcher caught and poured into a disposal trough at the side of theeating room. He then stuffed the slit with pulpy vegetation the textureof kelp; it closed, and his body was supplied with nourishment foranother day.     He returned quickly to the room.     His second in command was busy, but one of the other team workersreported\u2014nothing new\u2014and asked about Hatcher's appearance before thecouncil. Hatcher passed the question off. He considered telling hisstaff about the disappearance of the Central Masses team member, butdecided against it. He had not been told it was secret. On the otherhand, he had not been told it was not. Something of this importance wasnot lightly to be gossiped about. For endless generations the threatof the Old Ones had hung over his race, those queer, almost mythicalbeings from the Central Masses of the galaxy. One brush with them, inages past, had almost destroyed Hatcher's people. Only by running andhiding, bearing one of their planets with them and abandoning it\u2014withits population\u2014as a decoy, had they arrived at all.     Now they had detected mapping parties of the Old Ones dangerously nearthe spiral arm of the galaxy in which their planet was located, theyhad begun the Probe Teams to find some way of combating them, or offleeing again.     But it seemed that the Probe Teams themselves might be betraying theirexistence to their enemies\u2014     Hatcher!     The call was urgent; he hurried to see what it was about. It was hissecond in command, very excited. What is it? Hatcher demanded.     Wait....     Hatcher was patient; he knew his assistant well. Obviously somethingwas about to happen. He took the moment to call his members back tohim for feeding; they dodged back to their niches on his skin, fittedthemselves into their vestigial slots, poured back their wastes intohis own circulation and ingested what they needed from the meal he hadjust taken.... Now! cried the assistant. Look!     At what passed among Hatcher's people for a viewing console an imagewas forming. Actually it was the assistant himself who formed it, not acathode trace or projected shadow; but it showed what it was meant toshow.     Hatcher was startled. Another one! And\u2014is it a different species? Ormerely a different sex?     Study the probe for yourself, the assistant invited.     Hatcher studied him frostily; his patience was not, after all, endless.No matter, he said at last. Bring the other one in.     And then, in a completely different mood, We may need him badly. Wemay be in the process of killing our first one now.     Killing him, Hatcher?     Hatcher rose and shook himself, his mindless members floating away likepuppies dislodged from suck. Council's orders, he said. We've got togo into Stage Two of the project at once.      III     Before Stage Two began, or before Herrell McCray realized it had begun,he had an inspiration.     The dark was absolute, but he remembered where the spacesuit had beenand groped his way to it and, yes, it had what all spacesuits had tohave. It had a light. He found the toggle that turned it on and pressedit.     Light. White, flaring, Earthly light, that showed everything\u2014evenhimself.     God bless, he said, almost beside himself with joy. Whatever thatpinkish, dancing halo had been, it had thrown him into a panic; nowthat he could see his own hand again, he could blame the weird effectson some strange property of the light.     At the moment he heard the click that was the beginning of Stage Two.     He switched off the light and stood for a moment, listening.     For a second he thought he heard the far-off voice, quiet, calm andalmost hopeless, that he had sensed hours before; but then that wasgone. Something else was gone. Some faint mechanical sound that hadhardly registered at the time, but was not missing. And there was,perhaps, a nice new sound that had not been there before; a veryfaint, an almost inaudible elfin hiss.     McCray switched the light on and looked around. There seemed to be nochange.     And yet, surely, it was warmer in here.     He could see no difference; but perhaps, he thought, he could smellone. The unpleasant halogen odor from the grating was surely strongernow. He stood there, perplexed.     A tinny little voice from the helmet of the space suit said sharply,amazement in its tone, McCray, is that you? Where the devil are youcalling from?     He forgot smell, sound and temperature and leaped for the suit. Thisis Herrell McCray, he cried. I'm in a room of some sort, apparentlyon a planet of approximate Earth mass. I don't know\u2014     McCray! cried the tiny voice in his ear. Where are you? This is      Jodrell Bank     calling. Answer, please!     I      am     answering, damn it, he roared. What took you so long?     Herrell McCray, droned the tiny voice in his ear, Herrell McCray,Herrell McCray, this is      Jodrell Bank     responding to your message,acknowledge please. Herrell McCray, Herrell McCray....     It kept on, and on.     McCray took a deep breath and thought. Something was wrong. Either theydidn't hear him, which meant the radio wasn't transmitting, or\u2014no.That was not it; they      had     heard him, because they were responding.But it seemed to take them so long....     Abruptly his face went white. Took them so long! He cast back in hismind, questing for a fact, unable to face its implications. When wasit he called them? Two hours ago? Three?     Did that mean\u2014did it      possibly     mean\u2014that there was a lag of an houror two each way? Did it, for example, mean that at the speed of hissuit's pararadio, millions of times faster than light, it took      hours     to get a message to the ship and back?     And if so ... where in the name of heaven was he?  "

        "Query": "What role do the probes play in THE FIVE HELLS OF ORION?",
        "Summary_1": "Physically speaking, the probes refer to the snakelike mandibles that form the arms and legs of the alien race to which Hatcher belongs. These mandibles are able to detach themselves and travel vast distances away from the body, conducting experiments and running errands controlled remotely by the brain. When they return to the body, they settle into little grooves formed in the skin at the base of the globular host body. Hatcher manages the probe team responsible for observing McCray and running him through a series of tests. The supervising council oversees operations of all the various Probe Teams throughout the universe; the ultimate goal of all Probe Teams is to discover a way in which to defend their race against the hostile Old Ones who have recently resurfaced and captured a team member from The Central Masses Probe Team.",
        "Summary_2": "The probes are significant because they are being conducted by an alien race in order to find a way to fight humans or to escape them. The threat of the humans (called Old Ones by the aliens) has loomed over the aliens for generations, and Hatcher describes that one encounter with them in the past had nearly completely destroyed their people. The only way they were able to escape was by abandoning one of their planets as a decoy and running away. When Hatcher\u2019s people once again detected that there were humans on a mapping mission in their spiral arm of the galaxy, they formed Probe Teams to capture and study the humans. The success of the probes in establishing contact with the humans is essential to them understanding how to protect their people from the fear they live under.\n",
        "Summary_3": "The probes are being carried out in an effort to find an ally among the Old Ones (humans) in order to save the beings of Orion. They had an encounter with the Old Ones years ago, and their race had almost been destroyed. They had to run and hide, take a populated planet with them, and then abandon it. Now the Old Ones are sending out mapping teams near their planet, and they are running out of time. The Probe Teams are trying to find a way to combat the Old Ones or else run from them again. Time is growing shorter because now the Central Masses have taken someone from one of their probe teams, so they might be getting the information to destroy them. ",
        "Summary_4": "The probes cause the main conflict in this story: the kidnapping and testing of two humans. The probes are worried that human domination will occur again and their species will be murdered or forced out of their homes. They plan to learn more about these humans, so they can destroy them, know their plans, or know when to run. The probes kidnap Herrel McCray from the Jodrell Bank and put him through a series of tests to better understand his race. Evidently, they have done this before, for Hatcher speaks of previous test subjects who all died during the first test. ",

I knew from the very beginning, Conrad finished, that I didn'thave to do anything at all. I just had to wait and you would destroyyourselves.     I don't understand, Bartholomew protested, searching the faces of thecousins closest to him. What does he mean, we have never existed?We're here, aren't we? What\u2014     Shut up! Raymond snapped. He turned on Martin. You don't seemsurprised.     The old man grinned. I'm not. I figured it all out years ago.     At first, he had wondered what he should do. Would it be better tothrow them into a futile panic by telling them or to do nothing? Hehad decided on the latter; that was the role they had assigned him\u2014towatch and wait and keep out of things\u2014and that was the role he wouldplay.     You knew all the time and you didn't tell us! Raymond spluttered.After we'd been so good to you, making a gentleman out of you insteadof a criminal.... That's right, he snarled, a criminal! An alcoholic,a thief, a derelict! How do you like that?     Sounds like a rich, full life, Martin said wistfully.     What an exciting existence they must have done him out of! But then, hecouldn't help thinking, he\u2014he and Conrad together, of course\u2014had donethem out of      any     kind of existence. It wasn't his responsibility,though; he had done nothing but let matters take whatever course wasdestined for them. If only he could be sure that it was the bettercourse, perhaps he wouldn't feel that nagging sense of guilt insidehim. Strange\u2014where, in his hermetic life, could he possibly havedeveloped such a queer thing as a conscience?     Then we've wasted all this time, Ninian sobbed, all this energy, allthis money, for nothing!     But you were nothing to begin with, Martin told them. And then,after a pause, he added, I only wish I could be sure there had beensome purpose to this.     He didn't know whether it was approaching death that dimmed his sight,or whether the frightened crowd that pressed around him was growingshadowy.     I wish I could feel that some good had been done in letting you bewiped out of existence, he went on voicing his thoughts. But I knowthat the same thing that happened to your worlds and my world willhappen all over again. To other people, in other times, but again. It'sbound to happen. There isn't any hope for humanity.     One man couldn't really change the course of human history, he toldhimself. Two men, that was\u2014one real, one a shadow.     Conrad came close to the old man's bed. He was almost transparent.     No, he said, there is hope. They didn't know the time transmitterworks two ways. I used it for going into the past only once\u2014just thisonce. But I've gone into the future with it many times. And\u2014 hepressed Martin's hand\u2014believe me, what I did\u2014what      we     did, you andI\u2014serves a purpose. It will change things for the better. Everythingis going to be all right.   <doc-sep> The immense orderly confusion of the basic memory level lay beforeme. Abstracted from it, aloof and observant, the monitoringpersonality-fraction scanned the pattern, searching the polydimensionalcontinuum for evidence of an alien intrusion.     And found it.     As the eye instantaneously detects a flicker of motion amid an infinityof static detail, so my inner eye perceived the subtle traces of theprobing Gool mind, like a whispered touch deftly rearranging my buriedmotivations.     I focused selectively, tuned to the recorded gestalt.           It is a contact, Effulgent One!                Softly, now! Nurture the spark well. It but trembles at thethreshold....                It is elusive, Master! It wriggles like a gorm-worm in the eatingtrough!          A part of my mind watched as the memory unreeled. I listened to thevoices\u2014yet not voices, merely the shape of concepts, indescribablyintricate. I saw how the decoy pseudo-personality which I hadconcretized for the purpose in a hundred training sessions had foughtagainst the intruding stimuli\u2014then yielded under the relentless thrustof the alien probe. I watched as the Gool operator took over the motorcenters, caused me to crawl through the choking smoke of the devastatedcontrol compartment toward the escape hatch. Fire leaped up, blockingthe way. I went on, felt ghostly flames whipping at me\u2014and then thehatch was open and I pulled myself through, forcing the broken leg.My blackened hand fumbled at the locking wheel. Then the blast asthe lifeboat leaped clear of the disintegrating dreadnought\u2014and theworld-ending impact as I fell.     At a level far below the conscious, the embattled pseudo-personalitylashed out again\u2014fighting the invader.           Almost it eluded me then, Effulgent Lord. Link with this lowly one!                Impossible! Do you forget all my teachings? Cling, though you expendthe last filament of your life-force!          Free from all distraction, at a level where comprehension and retentionare instantaneous and total, my monitoring basic personality fractionfollowed the skillful Gool mind as it engraved its commands deep inmy subconscious. Then the touch withdrew, erasing the scars of itspassage, to leave me unaware of its tampering\u2014at a conscious level.     Watching the Gool mind, I learned.     The insinuating probe\u2014a concept regarding which psychodynamicists hadtheorized\u2014was no more than a pattern in emptiness....     But a pattern which I could duplicate, now that I had seen what hadbeen done to me.     Hesitantly, I felt for the immaterial fabric of the continuum, warpingand manipulating it, copying the Gool probe. Like planes of paper-thincrystal, the polyfinite aspects of reality shifted into focus, aligningthemselves.     Abruptly, a channel lay open. As easily as I would stretch out my handto pluck a moth from a night-flower, I reached across the unimaginablevoid\u2014and sensed a pit blacker than the bottom floor of hell, and aglistening dark shape.     There was a soundless shriek.       Effulgence! It reached out\u2014touchedme!       "

He is young, adventurous, gifted in science and technology, and enjoys playing baseball, poker, and 3D chess. When McCray finds himself inexplicably abducted and transported to a dark room in an unknown location, he is confused about how he ended up in that location and why he is surrounded by items that vaguely remind him of his childhood. He is grateful when a pinkish light offers some illumination, and he attempts to contact his ship using the radio on a spacesuit he finds in the room. Before the light goes out, he panics when he is not able to see any part of his body; he later realizes this was a trick of the light.

The room is like a dark, scary, trophy room full of meaningful objects from McCray\u2019s past and present.

He tries the radio on a spacesuit in the room several times. He receives a message from his ship several hours later that gives him a glimmer of hope for rescue, but he calculates that he must be five hundred light years away from them to account for the hours-long lag between messages. When the room begins heating up and chlorine gas begins burning his lungs as the aliens administer a survival test, he quickly gets into the spacesuit and breaks out of the room with a large space axe. He passes the survival test without knowing it. He hears a woman scream for help on his radio and he realizes she is also in the facility and goes to her.

        "Summary_3": "Herrell McCray is the ship\u2019s navigator on the Starship Jodrell Bank. On a routine mission from Earth to the colonies circling Betelgeuse Nine, he visually confirms the navigation's locking mechanism when he suddenly finds himself in a completely dark room filled with various objects. He tries to explore the objects with his hands but in frustration, calls out that he wishes he could see, and there is a flicker of pinkish light from a spacesuit. With the light available to him, he looks at the other objects in the room: a set of Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, a space-ax, an old-fashioned child\u2019s rocking chair, a chemistry set\u2026.The objects are somewhat familiar, many of which he had owned himself. Three walls are solid, but the fourth seems to be a grating, perhaps a ventilator. McCray recalls that spacesuits have radios, so he tries to contact his ship but receives no answer. He thinks about the speed of radio transmissions and realizes he must be far away from his ship not to receive an immediate reply. \n\tUnknown to McCray, he has been selected for observation and an experiment by a probe team. They are testing his intelligence and need to communicate with McCray to find an ally; otherwise, their species is in great danger. McCray decides to put the spacesuit on just as the room begins warming up and a gas starts coming into the room. Then he hears a transmission from his ship, but he realizes they can\u2019t hear him when he responds to it. It dawns on him that the distance between him and his ship is so great that it takes two or three hours to transmit messages. After sending another message, he uses the space-ax to break through the door of the room because the gas is hurting his lungs. He finds himself in another room or hallway with what appear to be workbenches mounted at various heights. On one he sees the parts of a bullet-gun.\n\tNext, McCray hears a woman calling for help. He tries to determine the direction of her voice, and when he turns around, there is an open door where there wasn\u2019t one earlier. McCray goes down a hall, finds another open door, and the woman is in there. She is unconscious, and McCray thinks it\u2019s because she is breathing the air in the room.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Herrel McCray is the navigator on the Jodrell Bank, heading to Betelgeuse Nine from Earth. McCray is an avid sportsman, enjoying games like poker, 3-D chess, and baseball. Herrel McCray suddenly wakes up in an unfamiliar, dark room. He does not remember how he got there, in fact, his last memories were of being aboard the Jodrell Bank. After stumbling around in the dark, a faint pink glow partially illuminates his surroundings. He sees a bunch of random items, like books, a bathing suit, and a rocking chair. There\u2019s also a spacesuit, which he uses to attempt to communicate with his ship by accessing the microphone. No one responds to his cries though, and he notices that he is unable to see his hands in the reflection of the spacesuit. He screams and darkness falls again. Later, remembering another aspect of the handy-dandy spacesuit, Herrel flicks on the light inside of it and is now able to see the entire room. He is also able to see his own body again, which calms him down. He feels the temperature increase, smells a weird, halogenic-like scent, and hears a buzzing, but he ignores it as his spacesuit starts speaking. Someone aboard the Jodrell Bank is calling for him, so he responds, but there\u2019s no answer. He realizes that he must be hundreds of light-years away for communication to be taking this long. Realizing there\u2019s poison in the air, he steps inside the spacesuit to avoid suffocation. The suit cooled him and provided fresh air. He picks up an ax off the floor and uses it to chop down the door. He escapes his cell and explores the next room. Jodrell Bank calls in again, but this time a woman answers it, also calling for help. He tracked her voice and went through a previously-unopened door to find her. She\u2019s unconscious, and he worries that she has breathed in the poisonous air. ",
        "Article": "   THE FIVE HELLS OF ORION     BY FREDERICK POHL     Out in the great gas cloud of the Orion     Nebula McCray found an ally\u2014and a foe!     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Worlds of If Science Fiction, January 1963.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      His name was Herrell McCray and he was scared.     As best he could tell, he was in a sort of room no bigger than a prisoncell. Perhaps it was a prison cell. Whatever it was, he had no businessin it; for five minutes before he had been spaceborne, on the Long Jumpfrom Earth to the thriving colonies circling Betelgeuse Nine. McCraywas ship's navigator, plotting course corrections\u2014not that there wereany, ever; but the reason there were none was that the check-sightingswere made every hour of the long flight. He had read off the azimuthangles from the computer sights, automatically locked on their beaconstars, and found them correct; then out of long habit confirmed thelocking mechanism visually. It was only a personal quaintness; he haddone it a thousand times. And while he was looking at Betelgeuse, Rigeland Saiph ... it happened.     The room was totally dark, and it seemed to be furnished with acollection of hard, sharp, sticky and knobby objects of various shapesand a number of inconvenient sizes. McCray tripped over somethingthat rocked under his feet and fell against something that clatteredhollowly. He picked himself up, braced against something that smelleddangerously of halogen compounds, and scratched his shoulder, rightthrough his space-tunic, against something that vibrated as he touchedit.     McCray had no idea where he was, and no way to find out.     Not only was he in darkness, but in utter silence as well. No. Notquite utter silence.     Somewhere, just at the threshold of his senses, there was somethinglike a voice. He could not quite hear it, but it was there. He sat asstill as he could, listening; it remained elusive.     Probably it was only an illusion.     But the room itself was hard fact. McCray swore violently and out loud.     It was crazy and impossible. There simply was no way for him to getfrom a warm, bright navigator's cubicle on      Starship Jodrell Bank     tothis damned, dark, dismal hole of a place where everything was out tohurt him and nothing explained what was going on. He cried aloud inexasperation: If I could only      see     !     He tripped and fell against something that was soft, slimy and, likebaker's dough, not at all resilient.     A flickering halo of pinkish light appeared. He sat up, startled. Hewas looking at something that resembled a suit of medieval armor.   <doc-sep> Hatcher returned to his laboratory gloomily.     It was just like the council to put the screws on; they had areputation for demanding results at any cost\u2014even at the cost ofdestroying the only thing you had that would make results possible.     Hatcher did not like the idea of endangering the Earthman. It cannotbe said that he was emotionally involved; it was not pity or sympathythat caused him to regret the dangers in moving too fast towardcommunication. Not even Hatcher had quite got over the revoltingphysical differences between the Earthman and his own people. ButHatcher did not want him destroyed. It had been difficult enoughgetting him here.     Hatcher checked through the members that he had left with the rest ofhis team and discovered that there were no immediate emergencies, so hetook time to eat. In Hatcher's race this was accomplished in ways notentirely pleasant to Earthmen. A slit in the lower hemisphere of hisbody opened, like a purse, emitting a thin, pussy, fetid fluid whichHatcher caught and poured into a disposal trough at the side of theeating room. He then stuffed the slit with pulpy vegetation the textureof kelp; it closed, and his body was supplied with nourishment foranother day.     He returned quickly to the room.     His second in command was busy, but one of the other team workersreported\u2014nothing new\u2014and asked about Hatcher's appearance before thecouncil. Hatcher passed the question off. He considered telling hisstaff about the disappearance of the Central Masses team member, butdecided against it. He had not been told it was secret. On the otherhand, he had not been told it was not. Something of this importance wasnot lightly to be gossiped about. For endless generations the threatof the Old Ones had hung over his race, those queer, almost mythicalbeings from the Central Masses of the galaxy. One brush with them, inages past, had almost destroyed Hatcher's people. Only by running andhiding, bearing one of their planets with them and abandoning it\u2014withits population\u2014as a decoy, had they arrived at all.     Now they had detected mapping parties of the Old Ones dangerously nearthe spiral arm of the galaxy in which their planet was located, theyhad begun the Probe Teams to find some way of combating them, or offleeing again.     But it seemed that the Probe Teams themselves might be betraying theirexistence to their enemies\u2014     Hatcher!     The call was urgent; he hurried to see what it was about. It was hissecond in command, very excited. What is it? Hatcher demanded.     Wait....     Hatcher was patient; he knew his assistant well. Obviously somethingwas about to happen. He took the moment to call his members back tohim for feeding; they dodged back to their niches on his skin, fittedthemselves into their vestigial slots, poured back their wastes intohis own circulation and ingested what they needed from the meal he hadjust taken.... Now! cried the assistant. Look!     At what passed among Hatcher's people for a viewing console an imagewas forming. Actually it was the assistant himself who formed it, not acathode trace or projected shadow; but it showed what it was meant toshow.     Hatcher was startled. Another one! And\u2014is it a different species? Ormerely a different sex?     Study the probe for yourself, the assistant invited.     Hatcher studied him frostily; his patience was not, after all, endless.No matter, he said at last. Bring the other one in.     And then, in a completely different mood, We may need him badly. Wemay be in the process of killing our first one now.     Killing him, Hatcher?     Hatcher rose and shook himself, his mindless members floating away likepuppies dislodged from suck. Council's orders, he said. We've got togo into Stage Two of the project at once.      III     Before Stage Two began, or before Herrell McCray realized it had begun,he had an inspiration.     The dark was absolute, but he remembered where the spacesuit had beenand groped his way to it and, yes, it had what all spacesuits had tohave. It had a light. He found the toggle that turned it on and pressedit.     Light. White, flaring, Earthly light, that showed everything\u2014evenhimself.     God bless, he said, almost beside himself with joy. Whatever thatpinkish, dancing halo had been, it had thrown him into a panic; nowthat he could see his own hand again, he could blame the weird effectson some strange property of the light.     At the moment he heard the click that was the beginning of Stage Two.     He switched off the light and stood for a moment, listening.     For a second he thought he heard the far-off voice, quiet, calm andalmost hopeless, that he had sensed hours before; but then that wasgone. Something else was gone. Some faint mechanical sound that hadhardly registered at the time, but was not missing. And there was,perhaps, a nice new sound that had not been there before; a veryfaint, an almost inaudible elfin hiss.     McCray switched the light on and looked around. There seemed to be nochange.     And yet, surely, it was warmer in here.     He could see no difference; but perhaps, he thought, he could smellone. The unpleasant halogen odor from the grating was surely strongernow. He stood there, perplexed.     A tinny little voice from the helmet of the space suit said sharply,amazement in its tone, McCray, is that you? Where the devil are youcalling from?     He forgot smell, sound and temperature and leaped for the suit. Thisis Herrell McCray, he cried. I'm in a room of some sort, apparentlyon a planet of approximate Earth mass. I don't know\u2014     McCray! cried the tiny voice in his ear. Where are you? This is      Jodrell Bank     calling. Answer, please!     I      am     answering, damn it, he roared. What took you so long?     Herrell McCray, droned the tiny voice in his ear, Herrell McCray,Herrell McCray, this is      Jodrell Bank     responding to your message,acknowledge please. Herrell McCray, Herrell McCray....     It kept on, and on.     McCray took a deep breath and thought. Something was wrong. Either theydidn't hear him, which meant the radio wasn't transmitting, or\u2014no.That was not it; they      had     heard him, because they were responding.But it seemed to take them so long....     Abruptly his face went white. Took them so long! He cast back in hismind, questing for a fact, unable to face its implications. When wasit he called them? Two hours ago? Three?     Did that mean\u2014did it      possibly     mean\u2014that there was a lag of an houror two each way? Did it, for example, mean that at the speed of hissuit's pararadio, millions of times faster than light, it took      hours     to get a message to the ship and back?     And if so ... where in the name of heaven was he?   <doc-sep> It was, he saw in a moment, not armor but a spacesuit. But what was thelight? And what were these other things in the room?     Wherever he looked, the light danced along with his eyes. It was likehaving tunnel vision or wearing blinders. He could see what he waslooking at, but he could see nothing else. And the things he couldsee made no sense. A spacesuit, yes; he knew that he could constructa logical explanation for that with no trouble\u2014maybe a subspacemeteorite striking the      Jodrell Bank     , an explosion, himself knockedout, brought here in a suit ... well, it was an explanation with moreholes than fabric, like a fisherman's net, but at least it was rational.     How to explain a set of Gibbon's      Decline and Fall of the RomanEmpire?     A space-ax? Or the old-fashioned child's rocking-chair, thechemistry set\u2014or, most of all, the scrap of gaily printed fabricthat, when he picked it up, turned out to be a girl's scanty bathingsuit? It was slightly reassuring, McCray thought, to find that most ofthe objects were more or less familiar. Even the child's chair\u2014why,he'd had one more or less like that himself, long before he was oldenough to go to school. But what were they doing here?     Not everything he saw was familiar. The walls of the room itself werestrange. They were not metal or plaster or knotty pine; they werenot papered, painted or overlaid with stucco. They seemed to be madeof some sort of hard organic compound, perhaps a sort of plastic orprocessed cellulose. It was hard to tell colors in the pinkish light.But they seemed to have none. They were neutral\u2014the color of ageddriftwood or unbleached cloth.     Three of the walls were that way, and the floor and ceiling. The fourthwall was something else. Areas in it had the appearance of gratings;from them issued the pungent, distasteful halogen odor. They might beventilators, he thought; but if so the air they brought in was worsethan what he already had.     McCray was beginning to feel more confident. It was astonishing how alittle light made an impossible situation bearable, how quickly hiscourage flowed back when he could see again.     He stood still, thinking. Item, a short time ago\u2014subjectively itseemed to be minutes\u2014he had been aboard the      Jodrell Bank     withnothing more on his mind than completing his check-sighting and meetingone of the female passengers for coffee. Item, apart from beingshaken up and\u2014he admitted it\u2014scared damn near witless, he did notseem to be hurt. Item, wherever he was now, it became, not so much whathad happened to him, but what had happened to the ship?     He allowed that thought to seep into his mind. Suppose there had beenan accident to the      Jodrell Bank     .     He could, of course, be dead. All this could be the fantasies of acooling brain.     McCray grinned into the pink-lit darkness. The thought had somehowrefreshed him, like icewater between rounds, and with a clearing headhe remembered what a spacesuit was good for.     It held a radio.     He pressed the unsealing tabs, slipped his hand into the vacant chestof the suit and pulled out the hand mike. This is Herrell McCray, hesaid, calling the      Jodrell Bank     .     No response. He frowned. This is Herrell McCray, calling      JodrellBank     .     Herrell McCray, calling anybody, come in, please.     But there was no answer.     Thoughtfully he replaced the microphone. This was ultrawave radio,something more than a million times faster than light, with a rangemeasured, at least, in hundreds of light-years. If there was no answer,he was a good long way from anywhere.     Of course, the thing might not be operating.     He reached for the microphone again\u2014     He cried aloud.     The pinkish lights went out. He was in the dark again, worse dark thanbefore.     For before the light had gone, McCray had seen what had escapedhis eyes before. The suit and the microphone were clear enough inthe pinkish glimmer; but the hand\u2014his own hand, cupped to hold themicrophone\u2014he had not seen at all. Nor his arm. Nor, in one fleetingmoment of study, his chest.     McCray could not see any part of his own body at all.      II     Someone else could.     Someone was watching Herrell McCray, with the clinical fascinationof a biochemist observing the wigglings of paramecia in a newantibiotic\u2014and with the prayerful emotions of a starving, shipwrecked,sailor, watching the inward bobbing drift of a wave-born cask that      may     contain food.     Suppose you call him Hatcher (and suppose you call it a him.)Hatcher was not exactly male, because his race had no true males; butit did have females and he was certainly not that. Hatcher did not inany way look like a human being, but they had features in common.     If Hatcher and McCray had somehow managed to strike up an acquaintance,they might have got along very well. Hatcher, like McCray, was anadventurous soul, young, able, well-learned in the technical sciencesof his culture. Both enjoyed games\u2014McCray baseball, poker andthree-dimensional chess; Hatcher a number of sports which defy humandescription. Both held positions of some importance\u2014considering theirages\u2014in the affairs of their respective worlds.     Physically they were nothing alike. Hatcher was a three-foot,hard-shelled sphere of jelly. He had arms and legs, but they werenot organically attached to himself. They were snakelike things whichobeyed the orders of his brain as well as your mind can make your toescurl; but they did not touch him directly. Indeed, they worked as wella yard or a quarter-mile away as they did when, rarely, they restedin the crevices they had been formed from in his skin. At greaterdistances they worked less well, for reasons irrelevant to the Law ofInverse Squares.     Hatcher's principal task at this moment was to run the probe teamwhich had McCray under observation, and he was more than a littleexcited. His members, disposed about the room where he had sent them onvarious errands, quivered and shook a little; yet they were the calmestlimbs in the room; the members of the other team workers were in astate of violent commotion.     The probe team had had a shock.     Paranormal powers, muttered Hatcher's second in command, and theothers mumbled agreement. Hatcher ordered silence, studying thespecimen from Earth.     After a long moment he turned his senses from the Earthman.Incredible\u2014but it's true enough, he said. I'd better report. Watchhim, he added, but that was surely unnecessary. Their job was towatch McCray, and they would do their job; and even more, not one ofthem could have looked away to save his life from the spectacle ofa creature as odd and, from their point of view, hideously alien asHerrell McCray.

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in A Gleeb for Earth?",
        "Summary_1": "A Gleeb for Earth is a collection of letters, signed by two characters - Ivan Smernda (a human on Earth who owns the Plaza Ritz Arms hotel in New York City) and Glmpauszn (an alien from a world that is entwined with Earth through a spiritual fringe). \nIvan dictates the first letter through his son Ronnie (14 years old) and sends it to the Editor of a print publication, feeling responsible for publicizing what he witnessed to save humanity. Ivan recounts an occurrence in the Plaza Ritz Arms where two alcoholic guests that he calls \u201cstew bums\u201d, Joe Binkle and Ed Smith (an alias for Glmpauszn), mysteriously disappeared, leaving their suits behind as if they had melted out of them. Ed had checked in with a mirror with a heavy bronze frame. After their disappearance, Ivan found only their clothes, the frame of the mirror in Ed\u2019s room, and a stack of letters in the bureau in Joe\u2019s room, which are the letters that tell the remaining story.\nThe vibrational plane of an alien world extends into Earth\u2019s (which they call the not-world), allowing intrusive vibrations from Earth to semi-terrorize sentient alien vibrations. Human spiritual mediums can force psychic reproductions of themselves into the alien world, and conversely pull alien vibrations over the \u201cfringe\u201d. The aliens can\u2019t tolerate it, and send Glmpauszn and Joe to take on human form and develop a chemical weapon to kill all humans.\nGlmpauszn crosses the fringe through a vibrational gateway that allows his consciousness to move into a newborn baby. Joe has already arrived in human form. Glmpauszn quickly grows the baby into an adult man. At three days old, he is 36 inches tall and talking, and a couple of days later is an adult man. Glmpauszn writes to Joe by controlling the minds of sleeping people around the world to pen the letters and then mail them to Joe at the Plaza Ritz Arms in New York City. He wonders why Joe won\u2019t write to him, and can\u2019t contact him spiritually, like normal, since Joe has fallen into alcoholism. Glmpauszn forgets to wear clothes and is nearly arrested, but escapes by becoming invisible. When Joe finally writes, it is to ask for money, enraging Glmpauszn who reports Joe\u2019s actions to their boss, Blgftury. Glmpauszn becomes distracted by exploring human emotions like intimacy with women and love of money, which causes him to rob a bank and fill 18 rooms of a hotel with money. He also falls into alcoholism. Blgftury is accidentally summoned into a seance by a human medium who pulls Blgftury\u2019s vibrations through the fringe (the very thing they are trying to stop from happening), and Glmpauszn is caught with a red-haired woman by his boss not doing his job. Glmpauszn finally develops a mold that can kill humans, and meets with Joe at the Plaza Ritz Arms with lots of gin that they consume before successfully returning to the vibrational frequency of their world, releasing the mold in the room.\n",
        "Summary_2": "\n\tThe story begins with a letter to the editor of a magazine describing two unusual incidents in a hotel in New York. In both cases, two men checked into the hotel and then mysteriously disappeared, leaving all of their belongings behind, including the clothes they were wearing. The man who owns the hotel doesn\u2019t want to involve the police for fear of reprisals against him; therefore, he sends the letters to the magazine, hoping they will print them. \n\tThe rest of the story is a series of letters, all addressed to Joe Binkle but written in different handwritings and from other parts of the US and the world. They trace the progress of a being named Glmpauszn who, in the first letter, is preparing to be born so that he can enter human society. Once he is born, he grows quickly, and within days, he escapes the hospital and hides in a cave until he has grown into a man. At that point, he makes his way to a chemist to procure the chemicals he needs for his mission: to destroy humanity for encroaching on his world. He walks down the street trying to act normal, but a young lady sees him and begins screaming: he has forgotten to wear clothes. Glmpauszn blames part of his failure on Joe, who apparently is supposed to provide him with the background information he needs to succeed.\n\tGlmpauszn often comments that he has yet to receive a return letter from Joe, but when he does, he complains that Joe has asked him for a $5.00 loan. Glmpauszn refuses the loan initially, making much of the fact that Joe didn\u2019t greet him or express pleasure at his arrival. Glmpauszn alludes to the fact that humans have encroached on their world through the use of mediums or spiritualists. \n\tGlmpauszn takes time to experience various aspects of humanity, including emotions and impressions, such as love of money, love, beauty, pain, etc. He thinks he is on the verge of love until he suggests a biological exploration of it and the women say yes, leading him to conclude it isn\u2019t love. In the meantime, Glmpauszn drinks more and more and accidentally sets off an explosion in his hotel rooms. \n\tGlmpauszn keeps Joe up to date on what he is doing but complains about Blgrtury\u2019s criticism and demands for reports. Finally, Glmpauszn tells Joe that he has successfully created a mold that will destroy humans by dissolving their brains and then their bodies. He also tells Joe to meet him at his original place of birth, and he will bring the gateway, a large mirror. The plan is to drink all the gin they have and then plant the mold in the hotel.\n\tThe hotel owner has read all the letters and wants to know if anyone can tell him how long a gleeb is, as several times in his letters, Glmpauszn refers to this length of time.\n",
        "Summary_3": "The story begins with a hotel owner, Ivan Smernda, writing to the editor of a magazine about two strange guests at his hotel. Ivan has found only their suits, some letters, and the frame of a mirror left over after their stay. Ivan has forwarded these letters he has found to the editors of the magazine. These letters tell a story of two alien visitors to Ivan's world that intend to destroy all of humanity because the vibrations from Ivan's world sometimes cross over into their world. The alien visitors become addicted to alcohol and human feelings, but ultimately they succeed in developing a mold that will spread across humanity and kill everyone.",
        "Summary_4": "This epistolary narrative begins with a letter to the editor of a paranormal-themed magazine. The letter's author, Ivan Smernda, owns a hotel called Plaza Ritz Arms, and recently two of his guests mysteriously vanished leaving behind several letters, a mirror frame without the mirror, and each of their suit of clothes, perfectly intact. The men are named Ed Smith and Joe Binkle, although Ivan guesses these are aliases. Ivan shares the men's letters with the editor in the hopes that they will be printed and serve as a warning for humanity. The first letter reveals Ed Smith's true name, which is Glmpauszn. Glmpauszn and Joe are Frequencies, ghost-like entities that exist in a spirit dimension adjacent to human reality. Due to the rise of humans using the services of mediums and fortune tellers to make contact with loved ones in the spirit world, the Frequencies feel terrorized. Glmpauszn has been sent to inhabit the human dimension, what he calls the \"not-world\", in order to find a way to destroy humanity and end its assault upon the vibrations of the Frequencies. Joe has already spent several \"gleebs\" (an unspecified amount of time) on Earth studying human ways in order to prepare Glmpauszn for his mission. They write to each other by possessing the minds and bodies of sleeping humans who can translate the language and write the letters. Glmpauszn details how he attuned himself to a human fetus and then sped up the growing process upon his birth, believing that the speed of his growth would impress his not-mother and not-father. Instead, he only frightens them both, and he runs away to a cave whereupon he accelerates his growth until he becomes an adult. As he begins to seek out a chemist to help him begin to plan the destruction of humanity, he runs into a woman who screams when she sees he is totally naked. Embarrassed, Glmpauszn lashes out at Joe, complaining that he has not prepared him sufficiently for his mission, and he must better learn human customs and emotions. He slowly adapts the forms and impressions of the human dimension. Not only does he love drinking hard liquor, but he also uses his invisibility power to rob a bank and fill his eighteen-room suite at the hotel with money. As Glmpauszn grows increasingly enamored with the human experience, he begins to neglect his mission, including reporting to his boss, Blgftury. Glmpauszn drinks excessively and starts to court women, seeking out the elusive feeling of love. One night he even attends a seance, and the medium summons Blgftury, who glares at him in anger. As Glmpauszn falls deeper into alcoholism, his neglect of the mission becomes so bad that he accidentally blows up his suite of rooms at the hotel. Eventually, he devises a kind of mold that can cause a fatal disease to spread throughout the planet. Mission accomplished, Glmpauszn suggests he and Joe rendezvous at Joe's hotel and return to their home dimension through the mirror gateway.",
        "Article": "What is it you wish? he barked. I understood in my discussions withthe other ... ah ... civilian there'd be no further need for theseirritating conferences.

If Mr. Magnan were here, I'm surehe wouldn't dream of interfering in the work of other departments.I ... overheard your conversation with the gentleman from the CroanieLegation\u2014     The lists, Miss Furkle.     I'm not accustomed, Miss Furkle said, to intruding in mattersoutside our interest cluster.     That's worse than listening in on phone conversations, eh? But nevermind. I need the information, Miss Furkle.     Loyalty to my Chief\u2014     Loyalty to your pay-check should send you scuttling for the materialI've asked for, Retief said. I'm taking full responsibility. Nowscat.     The buzzer sounded. Retief flipped a key. MUDDLE, Retief speaking....     Arapoulous's brown face appeared on the desk screen.     How-do, Retief. Okay if I come up?     Sure, Hank. I want to talk to you.     In the office, Arapoulous took a chair. Sorry if I'm rushing you,Retief, he said. But have you got anything for me?     Retief waved at the wine bottles. What do you know about Croanie?     Croanie? Not much of a place. Mostly ocean. All right if you likefish, I guess. We import our seafood from there. Nice prawns in monsoontime. Over a foot long.     You on good terms with them?     Sure, I guess so. Course, they're pretty thick with Boge.     So?     Didn't I tell you? Boge was the bunch that tried to take us over herea dozen years back. They'd've made it too, if they hadn't had a lot ofbad luck. Their armor went in the drink, and without armor they're easygame.     Miss Furkle buzzed. I have your lists, she said shortly.     Bring them in, please.   <doc-sep> Moscow, Idaho     June 17     Dear Joe:     I received your first communication today. It baffles me. Do you greetme in the proper fringe-zone manner? No. Do you express joy, hope,pride, helpfulness at my arrival? No. You ask me for a loan of fivebucks!     It took me some time, culling my information catalog to come up withthe correct variant of the slang term buck. Is it possible that youare powerless even to provide yourself with the wherewithal to live inthis inferior world?     A reminder, please. You and I\u2014I in particular\u2014are now engaged ina struggle to free our world from the terrible, maiming intrusionsof this not-world. Through many long gleebs, our people have liveda semi-terrorized existence while errant vibrations from this worldripped across the closely joined vibration flux, whose individualfluctuations make up our sentient population.     Even our eminent, all-high Frequency himself has often been jeopardizedby these people. The not-world and our world are like two basketsas you and I see them in our present forms. Baskets woven with thegreatest intricacy, design and color; but baskets whose convex sidesare joined by a thin fringe of filaments. Our world, on the vibrationalplane, extends just a bit into this, the not-world. But being a worldof higher vibration, it is ultimately tenuous to these gross peoples.While we vibrate only within a restricted plane because of our purer,more stable existence, these people radiate widely into our world.     They even send what they call psychic reproductions of their own selvesinto ours. And most infamous of all, they sometimes are able to forcesome of our individuals over the fringe into their world temporarily,causing them much agony and fright.     The latter atrocity is perpetrated through what these people callmediums, spiritualists and other fatuous names. I intend to visit oneof them at the first opportunity to see for myself.     Meanwhile, as to you, I would offer a few words of advice. I pickedthem up while examining the slang portion of my information catalogwhich you unfortunately caused me to use. So, for the ultimatecause\u2014in this, the penultimate adventure, and for the glory and peaceof our world\u2014shake a leg, bub. Straighten up and fly right. In short,get hep.

        "Query": "What is the backdrop of the story \"A Gleeb for Earth\"?",
        "Summary_1": "A Gleeb for Earth takes place on Earth, where the spiritual vibrations of human mediums and psychics are intruding upon and semi-terrorizing another world populated by sentient vibrational beings. The vibrational plane of the alien world extends just a tiny bit into Earth (referred to as the not-world by the aliens), and the fringe between the two allows for human psychics to intrude into the alien\u2019s realm, or for human seance practises to summon alien vibrations on Earth in ways that are terrifying for the aliens. The aliens can\u2019t tolerate these vibrational intrusions any longer and have embarked on a mission to destroy all life on Earth by having two of their own take the form of humans and develop a chemical weapon (a mold) to wipe them out.\nThe mission of Glmpauszn and Joe takes place on Earth between June 8th and September 25th of an unknown year. Glmpauszn mails letters from various international locations to Joe at the Plaza Ritz Arms in New York City by controlling the minds of unknown sleeping humans to pen what he spiritually dictates, and mail the letters without ever knowing they have done it. Glmpauszn\u2019s physical location is not explicitly discussed, but it is possibly nearby to New York City since he does not mention the need for any long-distance or international travel in his letters. Both Glmpauszn and Joe become distracted from their mission at times by drugs, alcohol, stealing money using their invisibility, and the sensations of experiencing human emotions like love.\nThe Plaza Ritz Arms hotel in New York City is an especially important location in the story, because it is the final meeting place where Glmpauszn and Joe return to their vibrational realm through a mirror with a heavy bronze frame, leaving their clothes in heaps as if they had melted out of them, only the frame of the mirror, and the pile of letters from Glmpauszn to Joe that detail their entire mission on Earth.\n",
        "Summary_2": "The story is set in various locations on Earth. It begins and ends in the Plaza Ritz Arms Hotel in Rochester, New York, where two residents mysteriously disappear, leaving all of their belongings behind, including their one suit of clothes that appears to have just dropped off their bodies as they wore them. In between, the setting moves from place to place as Glmpauszn moves around, beginning in Bombay, India and moving to Wichita, Kansas; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Moscow, Idaho; Des Moines, Iowa; Boise, Idaho; Penobscot, Maine; Sacramento, California; and Florence, Italy. ",
        "Summary_3": "The story takes place at Ivan Smernda's hotel. The hotel is home to an alien that goes by the name \"Joe Binkle.\" Joe is an alcoholic and this consumption of alcohol has dulled his alien powers. The story also involves letters from an alien named Glmpauszn who went by the alias \"Ed Smith\" in this world. Glmpauszn has traveled to many different areas of the world in his quest to find something to destroy humanity once and for all. ",
        "Summary_4": "Glmpauszn and Joe come from a dimension that can be described as a kind of spirit world. The population of this dimension are referred to as Frequencies and are individual fluctuations within a larger vibration flux. They are able to enter the human dimension, which they refer to as \"not-world\", by attuning their vibrations to the human frequency because the dimensions are loosely joined together through the vibrational plane. They return to their dimension by using a \"gateway\" hidden in a normal-looking mirror. When Glmpauszn is sent to figure out a way to destroy humanity, he rents a suite of eighteen rooms at a hotel and fills it with stolen money as well as tubes, pipes, and other kinds of apparatus intended to be used to build a weapon of some kind. Joe lives at the Plaza Ritz Arms in New York City, which is where Ivan Smernda discovers his clothes as well as Glmpauszn\u2019s. Throughout the story, Glmpauszn writes to Joe from a number of locations including Florence, Italy, Rochester, New York, Sacramento, California, Penobscot, Maine, Moscow and Boise, Idaho, Des Moines, Iowa, Albuquerque, New Mexico, Wichita, Kansas, and Bombay, India. However, he is never physically in any of these locations. Instead, he possesses people sleeping in these cities to write the letters for him in order to avoid detection. During his time in the human dimension, Glmpauszn visits a darkened seance room, a movie theater, a nightclub, a bank, a cave, and a hospital.",

I feel wonderful. Get that? I actually feelwonderful, in spite of this miserable imitation of a body.     There are long hours during which I am so well-integrated into thisbody and this world that I almost consider myself a member of it. NowI can function efficiently. I sent Blgftury some long reports todayoutlining my experiments in the realm of chemistry where we mustfinally defeat these people. Of course, I haven't made the experimentsyet, but I will. This is not deceit, merely realistic anticipation ofthe inevitable. Anyway, what the old xbyzrt doesn't know won't muss hisvibrations.     I went to what they call a nightclub here and picked out ablonde-haired woman, the kind that the books say men prefer. She wasattracted to me instantly. After all, the body I have devised isperfect in every detail ... actually a not-world ideal.     I didn't lose any time overwhelming her susceptibilities. I rememberdistinctly that just as I stooped to pick up a large roll of money Ihad dropped, her eyes met mine and in them I could see her admiration.We went to my suite and I showed her one of the money rooms. Would youbelieve it? She actually took off her shoes and ran around through themoney in her bare feet! Then we kissed.     Concealed in the dermis of the lips are tiny, highly sensitized nerveends which send sensations to the brain. The brain interprets theseimpulses in a certain manner. As a result, the fate of secretion in theadrenals on the ends of the kidneys increases and an enlivening of theentire endocrine system follows. Thus I felt the beginnings of love.     I sat her down on a pile of money and kissed her again. Again thetingling, again the secretion and activation. I integrated myselfquickly.     Now in all the motion pictures\u2014true representations of life and lovein this world\u2014the man with a lot of money or virtue kisses the girland tries to induce her to do something biological. She then refuses.This pleases both of them, for he wanted her to refuse. She, in turn,wanted him to want her, but also wanted to prevent him so that he wouldhave a high opinion of her. Do I make myself clear?     I kissed the blonde girl and gave her to understand what I then wanted.Well, you can imagine my surprise when she said yes! So I had failed. Ihad not found love.     I became so abstracted by this problem that the blonde girl fellasleep. I thoughtfully drank quantities of excellent alcohol called ginand didn't even notice when the blonde girl left.     I am now beginning to feel the effects of this alcohol again. Ha. Don'tI wish old Blgftury were here in the vibrational pattern of an olive?I'd get the blonde in and have her eat him out of a Martini. That is agin mixture.     I think I'll get a hot report off to the old so-and-so right now. It'lltake him a gleeb to figure this one out.

        "Query": "What is the reason behind Glmpauszn's desire to assume a human form on Earth in the story \"A Gleeb for Earth\"?",
        "Summary_1": "Glmpauszn\u2019s consciousness takes the form of spiritual vibrations that can cross from his world into Earth\u2019s, allowing him to take control of humans on Earth and even insert his consciousness into a human fetus. He describes Earth as a \u201cweird extension of the Universe\u201d, because from his perspective the vibrational plane of his world extends just a tiny bit into Earth (which he calls the not-world). This is unacceptable to his people since human spiritual mediums on Earth have been able to force psychic reproductions of themselves into his world, and conversely temporarily kidnap some individuals from his planet over the \u201cfringe\u201d between the two worlds, frightening them. The intrusive vibrations from Earth have semi-terrorized the sentient vibrations that make up the population of Glmpauszn\u2019s world. Thus, Glmpauszn will now take on the form of a human on Earth and destroy the entirety of human existence to stop their intrusions.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Glmpauszn wants to take the form of a person on Earth to find a way to destroy the human race because humans are torturing his people, and he wants to be their liberator. The only way he can take the form of a person without arousing suspicion is to arrive as a newborn baby, which he does. The human world is intruding upon his world, which is terrorizing his people. While his world is on a higher plane with higher vibrations than the human world, sometimes the humans encroach on their world. At times, humans even send psychic reproductions of themselves into their world, causing agony and fright. This is accomplished through mediums and spiritualists. And to understand humans, Glmpauszn wants to experience their emotions. At the same time, Glmpauszn falls prey to the lure of alcohol and finds himself needing it to escape from the reality of the human world. In the end, he has created a mold that will destroy humans by dissolving the brain and then ruining the body. The mold will be planted in the hotel where Joe lives, and together, they will exit the human world through the mirror gateway.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Glmpauszn wishes to take the form of a human from Earth in order to avoid detection. Glmpauszn has been tasked with ending the human race so that they can no longer pull beings from their homeworld anymore and cause them great pain. Glmpauszn needs to travel to do this, and taking the form of a person on Earth means he can move freely, despite the fact that there is quite a learning curve in becoming disguised as a human.",
        "Summary_4": "Thanks to an increase in the number of humans using the services of mediums, fortune tellers, and s\u00e9ances, there has been substantial interference in the vibrational plane that connects the human dimension with the real of the Frequencies. The humans see this as a meaningful way to interact with deceased loved ones, while the Frequencies view this as an invasive practice that terrorizes their way of life. Glmpauszn has been sent from the Frequency realm to the human dimension in order to find a way to destroy humanity and restore peace to their society. By attuning himself to a human fetus, Glmpauszn believes he will be able to better disguise himself and avoid detection. He experiences growing pains as he works to assimilate to human customs and emotions. He struggles with alcoholism and begins dating women in order to find love. Glmpauszn grows to enjoy being human, but it also distracts him from his ultimate mission.",

As far as the five bucks is concerned, no dice.     Glmpauszn   <doc-sep> Taphetta rustled his speech ribbons quizzically. But I thought it wasproved that some humans did originate on one planet, that there was anunbroken line of evolution that could be traced back a billion years.     You're thinking of Earth, said Halden. Humans require a certain kindof planet. It's reasonable to assume that, if men were set down on ahundred such worlds, they'd seem to fit in with native life-forms on afew of them. That's what happened on Earth; when Man arrived, there wasactually a manlike creature there. Naturally our early evolutionistsstretched their theories to cover the facts they had.     But there are other worlds in which humans who were there before theStone Age aren't related to anything else there. We have to concludethat Man didn't originate on any of the planets on which he is nowfound. Instead, he evolved elsewhere and later was scattered throughoutthis section of the Milky Way.     And so, to account for the unique race that can interbreed acrossthousands of light-years, you've brought in the big ancestor,commented Taphetta dryly. It seems an unnecessary simplification.     Can you think of a better explanation? asked Kelburn.     Something had to distribute one species so widely and it's not theresult of parallel evolution\u2014not when a hundred human races areinvolved, and      only     the human race.     I can't think of a better explanation. Taphetta rearranged hisribbons. Frankly, no one else is much interested in Man's theoriesabout himself.     It was easy to understand the attitude. Man was the most numerousthough not always the most advanced\u2014Ribboneers had a civilization ashigh as anything in the known section of the Milky Way, and there wereothers\u2014and humans were more than a little feared. If they ever gottogether\u2014but they hadn't except in agreement as to their common origin.     Still, Taphetta the Ribboneer was an experienced pilot and could bevery useful. A clear statement of their position was essential inhelping him make up his mind. You've heard of the adjacency matingprinciple? asked Sam Halden.     Vaguely. Most people have if they've been around men.     We've got new data and are able to interpret it better. The theory isthat humans who can mate with each other were once physically close.We've got a list of all our races arranged in sequence. If planetaryrace F can mate with race E back to A and forward to M, and race G isfertile only back to B, but forward to O, then we assume that whatevertheir positions are now, at once time G was actually adjacent to F, butwas a little further along. When we project back into time those starsystems on which humans existed prior to space travel, we get a certainpattern. Kelburn can explain it to you.     The normally pink body of the Ribboneer flushed slightly. The colorchange was almost imperceptible, but it was enough to indicate that hewas interested.  "

        "Query": "How would you describe the connection between Glmpauszn and Joe in the story \"A Gleeb for Earth\"?",
        "Summary_1": "Glmpauszn is a sentient being from an alien world that takes the form of spiritual vibrations that are capable of controlling humans on Earth (which he refers to as the non-world), or entering the body of a human to take their form. He travels through a gateway (a vibrational point that alters the frequency of those who enter in the form of a mirror with a heavy bronze frame), allowing Glmpauszn to take on the frequency of a human and move his consciousness into a newborn baby. Once on Earth in newborn form, Glmpauszn quickly grows the body of the newborn baby into that of an adult man over a matter of days, and begins using the alias Ed Smith. He writes to Joe by vibrationaly controlling the minds of a variety of literate people around the world to pen the letters and then mail them to Joe at the Plaza Ritz Arms in New York City. The people he uses the mind of never become aware that they have written or mailed the letters.\nJoe (an alias name) is of the same world as Glmpauszn, and they are on a mission together to destroy all human life on Earth in order to stop the intrusive vibrations of Earth polluting their spiritually sentient world. There is a rocky start to their mission as Glmpauszn is not receiving any contact back from Joe who has become distracted by drugs and alcohol in his human form on Earth. Normally, Glmpauszn would be able to reach Joe through spiritual vibrations instead of letters, but Joe\u2019s vibrations are very weak due to the substances he takes. Joe eventually does write to Glmpauszn, but only to ask for money, which greatly offends Glmpauszn who becomes furious with him for abandoning their mission. However, their relationship changes as Glmpauszn begins to experiment with the feelings of being human, and tries to feel love and consume alcohol. Glmpauszn starts to relate to Joe\u2019s experience with alcohol, and they even decide to bring lots of gin to consume when they finally meet at the Plaza Ritz Arms to re-enter the gateway to their own world together after releasing the deadly mold that will kill all humans on Earth and complete their mission. They finish the mission triumphantly together, with Glmpauszn referring to them together in one of his final letters as conquerors and liberators for their world.\n",
        "Summary_2": "The relationship between Glmpauszn and Joe is much like that of brothers. Joe is like an older brother who gives Glmpauszn advice, but when Glmpauszn doesn\u2019t like what Joe writes in his letters, he makes sure to send them on to Blgftury to \u201ctell on him.\u201d Glmpauszn relies on Joe\u2019s information, based on his experience in the human world. In his first letter to Joe, though, Glmpauszn blames him for not responding to his vibrations, forcing Glmpauszn to communicate with Joe by mail. By his second letter, however, Glmpauszn is more sympathetic to complications that Joe must have encountered due to humans, although he still doesn\u2019t understand why he hasn\u2019t received letters in response to his own. \n       Interestingly, Glmpauszn tells Joe all about what he is doing but is less forthcoming with Blgftury. Yet Glmpauszn blames Joe for being inefficient in providing the information he needs to succeed in his mission. Interestingly, at one point, Glmpauszn complains that Joe has asked for a loan of $5.00, which Glmpauszn refuses until later. Glmpauszn confesses that he is trying to learn to love money as humans do and has been amassing large amounts of it; he agrees to loan Joe the $5.00 he requested earlier but only by sending it through the person writing the letter for him.\n\tLike a big brother, Joe gives Glmpauszn advice. He specifically advises him not to drink alcohol. By the time Glmpauszn receives this letter, he is already heavily imbibing and learning the impact of hangovers. Glmpauszn confesses that he needs the alcohol to escape from the reality of human life. He also acknowledges that it is dulling his abilities, including the ability to become invisible. For their final encounter, which will be when Glmpauszn launches his attack on humanity, he wants Joe to bring as much gin as he can, and he will do the same. Together, after all the gin is gone, Glmpauszn and Joe will return to their world through the gateway of the mirror.\n\n",
        "Summary_3": "Glmpauszn writes Joe as a companion on this quest to destroy humanity, but his written communications only go one way as far as the reader can tell. Joe never writes back, but can communicate with Glmpauszn via psychic ability, or \"vibrations.\" Glmpauszn quickly sours on Joe as he realizes that Joe has lost most of his alien abilities due to being addicted to alcohol and obsessed with money. However, Glmpauszn comes around on his fellow alien as he falls victim to alcoholism and \"money-love\" himself.",
        "Summary_4": "Glmpauszn and Joe are both Frequencies who have attuned themselves to different humans in order to disguise themselves and gather information that will assist them in a plot to destroy humanity. Joe has spent a significant amount of time longer on Earth than Glmpauszn, and therefore he has had more time to adapt to human customs and emotions. Joe lives in New York at Plaza Ritz Arms, a hotel where the two eventually rendezvous in order to return to their home dimension when they accomplish their mission.  Glmpauszn sends Joe a number of letters describing his slow adjustment to human form. Although Joe's communications are never explicitly shared, his replies to Glmpauszn are minimal and often unrelated  to the letter to which he's responding. For example, Joe asks Glmpauszn for five dollars in response to a letter about Glmpauszn's rocky entry into the human dimension. This anger Glmpauszn, and he is further incensed when he receives a nonsensical, insulting communication later. However, after Glmpauszn discovers alcohol, he begins to relate to Joe, who has also succumbed to the struggles of alcoholism. Eventually, Glmpauszn develops a mold that can eliminate humanity, and they rendezvous at Joe's hotel to make their re-entrance to the vibrational plane via the mirror gateway.",

I sent Blgftury some long reports todayoutlining my experiments in the realm of chemistry where we mustfinally defeat these people. Of course, I haven't made the experimentsyet, but I will. This is not deceit, merely realistic anticipation ofthe inevitable. Anyway, what the old xbyzrt doesn't know won't muss hisvibrations.     I went to what they call a nightclub here and picked out ablonde-haired woman, the kind that the books say men prefer. She wasattracted to me instantly. After all, the body I have devised isperfect in every detail ... actually a not-world ideal.     I didn't lose any time overwhelming her susceptibilities. I rememberdistinctly that just as I stooped to pick up a large roll of money Ihad dropped, her eyes met mine and in them I could see her admiration.We went to my suite and I showed her one of the money rooms. Would youbelieve it? She actually took off her shoes and ran around through themoney in her bare feet! Then we kissed.     Concealed in the dermis of the lips are tiny, highly sensitized nerveends which send sensations to the brain. The brain interprets theseimpulses in a certain manner. As a result, the fate of secretion in theadrenals on the ends of the kidneys increases and an enlivening of theentire endocrine system follows. Thus I felt the beginnings of love.     I sat her down on a pile of money and kissed her again. Again thetingling, again the secretion and activation. I integrated myselfquickly.     Now in all the motion pictures\u2014true representations of life and lovein this world\u2014the man with a lot of money or virtue kisses the girland tries to induce her to do something biological. She then refuses.This pleases both of them, for he wanted her to refuse. She, in turn,wanted him to want her, but also wanted to prevent him so that he wouldhave a high opinion of her. Do I make myself clear?     I kissed the blonde girl and gave her to understand what I then wanted.Well, you can imagine my surprise when she said yes! So I had failed. Ihad not found love.     I became so abstracted by this problem that the blonde girl fellasleep. I thoughtfully drank quantities of excellent alcohol called ginand didn't even notice when the blonde girl left.     I am now beginning to feel the effects of this alcohol again. Ha. Don'tI wish old Blgftury were here in the vibrational pattern of an olive?I'd get the blonde in and have her eat him out of a Martini. That is agin mixture.     I think I'll get a hot report off to the old so-and-so right now. It'lltake him a gleeb to figure this one out. I'll tell him I'm setting upan atomic reactor in the sewage systems here and that all we have to dois activate it and all the not-people will die of chain asphyxiation.     Boy, what an easy job this turned out to be. It's just a vacation. Joe,you old gold-bricker, imagine you here all these gleebs living off thefat of the land. Yak, yak. Affectionately.     Glmpauszn   <doc-sep> Rochester, New York     September 25     Dear Joe:     I have it! It is done! In spite of the alcohol, in spite of Blgftury'sniggling criticism, I have succeeded. I now have developed a formof mold, somewhat similar to the antibiotics of this world, that,transmitted to the human organism, will cause a disease whose end willbe swift and fatal.     First the brain will dissolve and then the body will fall apart.Nothing in this world can stop the spread of it once it is loose.Absolutely nothing.     We must use care. Stock in as much gin as you are able. I will bringwith me all that I can. Meanwhile I must return to my original place ofbirth into this world of horrors. There I will secure the gateway, alarge mirror, the vibrational point at which we shall meet and slowlyclimb the frequency scale to emerge into our own beautiful, now secureworld. You and I together, Joe, conquerors, liberators.     You say you eat little and drink as much as you can. The same withme. Even in this revolting world I am a sad sight. My not-world sensesfalter. This is the last letter. Tomorrow I come with the gateway. Whenthe gin is gone, we will plant the mold in the hotel where you live.     In only a single gleeb it will begin to work. The men of this queerworld will be no more. But we can't say we didn't have some fun, canwe, Joe?     And just let Blgftury make one crack. Just one xyzprlt. I'll havehgutry before the ghjdksla!     Glmpauszn   <doc-sep> Moscow, Idaho     June 17     Dear Joe:     I received your first communication today. It baffles me. Do you greetme in the proper fringe-zone manner? No. Do you express joy, hope,pride, helpfulness at my arrival? No. You ask me for a loan of fivebucks!     It took me some time, culling my information catalog to come up withthe correct variant of the slang term buck. Is it possible that youare powerless even to provide yourself with the wherewithal to live inthis inferior world?     A reminder, please. You and I\u2014I in particular\u2014are now engaged ina struggle to free our world from the terrible, maiming intrusionsof this not-world. Through many long gleebs, our people have liveda semi-terrorized existence while errant vibrations from this worldripped across the closely joined vibration flux, whose individualfluctuations make up our sentient population.     Even our eminent, all-high Frequency himself has often been jeopardizedby these people. The not-world and our world are like two basketsas you and I see them in our present forms. Baskets woven with thegreatest intricacy, design and color; but baskets whose convex sidesare joined by a thin fringe of filaments. Our world, on the vibrationalplane, extends just a bit into this, the not-world. But being a worldof higher vibration, it is ultimately tenuous to these gross peoples.While we vibrate only within a restricted plane because of our purer,more stable existence, these people radiate widely into our world.     They even send what they call psychic reproductions of their own selvesinto ours. And most infamous of all, they sometimes are able to forcesome of our individuals over the fringe into their world temporarily,causing them much agony and fright.     The latter atrocity is perpetrated through what these people callmediums, spiritualists and other fatuous names. I intend to visit oneof them at the first opportunity to see for myself.     Meanwhile, as to you, I would offer a few words of advice. I pickedthem up while examining the slang portion of my information catalogwhich you unfortunately caused me to use. So, for the ultimatecause\u2014in this, the penultimate adventure, and for the glory and peaceof our world\u2014shake a leg, bub. Straighten up and fly right. In short,get hep.     As far as the five bucks is concerned, no dice.     Glmpauszn  "

        "Query": "What is the story about and what is the role of Blgftury in it?",
        "Summary_1": "Blgftury is an alien of the same world as Glmpauszn and Joe, which is being semi-terrorized by intrusive vibrations from Earth (which they refer to as non-world) that pollute their world\u2019s sentient frequency. Their world wishes to destroy all human life on Earth to become free from these intrusions. Blgftury is the boss of the other two, and Glmpauszn often refers to having to write reports for him begrudgingly to update on the status of the mission.\nBlgftury is not a supportive boss, because he wished to go on this mission himself. Glmpauszn describes that Blgftury gave him little praise, and even wrote thinly-veiled threats, in his response to Glmpauszn\u2019s report on how he escaped the pursuit of the police when he was caught naked in public after forgetting humans need to put on clothes. Blgftury has the authority to take corrective action related to the mission, evidenced by how Glmpauszn doesn\u2019t hesitate to forward him the letters from Joe that he finds offensive about asking for money and discussing \u201crevolting bodily processes.\u201d \nBlgftury has to pester Glmpauszn for reports when he begins to go off the plan and experiment with human feelings like falling in love and alcohol. Glmpauszn does finally successfully develop a mold that will kill all humans on Earth and sends detailed chemistry reports back to Blgftury on the subject. \nBlgftury spends a lot of time sending vibrations in the fringe area between Earth and their world, and by accident his vibrations are summoned by a spiritual medium into a white, shapeless cascade of light at a human seance gathering that Glmpauszn happens to be attending on Earth where he is fooling around with a red-headed woman in the corner of the room (flagrantly not doing the work of the mission) in full visibility to Blgftury. Blgftury responded with a pattern in his matrix that showed pain, anger, fear and amazement. Glmpauszn goes on to complete the mission and return with Joe to their home world without further interaction with Blgftury.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Blgftury is the being who supervises Glmpauszn and whom Glmpauszn seems to dislike and want to impress at the same time. Glmpauszn thinks that Blgftury\u2019s criticism and threats are actually praise; he also thinks that Blgftury wanted to be the one to go on the expedition that Glmpauszn is on and is jealous that he didn\u2019t get to. At the same time, Glmpauszn wants to impress Blgftury. And when Glmpauszn has a complaint against Joe, he forwards it to Blgftury so that he is aware of what Joe is doing, most likely to make himself look better. Glmpauszn grows annoyed with Blgftury\u2019s requests for reports because he thinks he has other, more important things to do, such as exploring human emotions. To pacify Blgftury, Glmpauszn sends him reports about his experiments with chemistry that he plans to use to defeat humans, although he has not actually carried out these experiments. Glmpauszn doesn\u2019t have much respect for Blgftury and envisions an incident where Blgftury is present as an olive and is eaten by the blonde girl. \nAt a seance that Glmpauszn attends, the medium actually brings Blgftury across when she is trying to bring over a woman\u2019s grandmother. Blgftury looks angry and sees Glmpauszn, peering at him with an expression of pain, anger, fear, and amazement. At the end of the story, Glmpauszn has succeeded in his mission of creating a way to destroy the human race in the form of a mold. This mold will dissolve the brain and then cause the body to fall apart. Glmpauszn is pleased to have succeeded, and he dares Blgftury to make any criticism against what he has accomplished. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Blgftury is the alien in charge of this operation to destroy the \"not-world,\" which the reader would know better as Earth. Blgftury is concerned with the success of this mission and constantly badgers Glmpauszn for status reports. Blgftury appears briefly on Earth during a human seance, and this causes him great pain. Glmpauszn becomes quite annoyed with Blgftury, describing Blgftury's attempts to get updates about the mission as an annoyance. This is likely due to Glmpauszn becoming an alcoholic and being more interested in learning about human emotions like love instead of the mission at hand. ",
        "Summary_4": "Blgftury is a fellow Frequency to whom Glmpauszn is supposed to send consistent status updates on his mission to develop a way to destroy humanity. Blgftury had wanted to complete the mission himself, and he is rarely complimentary, so his communications with Glmpauszn are often curt. At first, Glmpauszn warns Joe he has forwarded his inappropriate, insulting letters to Blgftury. As time goes on, however, Glmpauszn reveals a growing distaste and impatience for Blgftury's grumpiness, criticisms, and bureaucratic oversight. At one point, he even expresses a desire for Blgftury to enter the human dimension in the vibrational pattern of an olive so that his blonde date could eat him. When Glmpauszn attends a s\u00e9ance conducted by Mrs. Somebody, he is horrified to see an angry Blgftury summoned instead of Grandma Lucy. ",

Glmpauszn   <doc-sep> Des Moines, Iowa     June 19     Dear Joe:     Your letter was imponderable till I had thrashed through long passagesin my information catalog that I had never imagined I would need.Biological functions and bodily processes which are labeled hererevolting are used freely in your missive. You can be sure they areall being forwarded to Blgftury. If I were not involved in the mostimportant part of my journey\u2014completion of the weapon against thenot-worlders\u2014I would come to New York immediately. You would rue thatday, I assure you.     Glmpauszn   <doc-sep> Wichita, Kansas     June 13     Dear Joe:     Mnghjkl, fhfjgfhjklop phelnoprausynks. No. When I communicate with you,I see I must avoid those complexities of procedure for which there areno terms in this language. There is no way of describing to you innot-language what I had to go through during the first moments of mybirth.     Now I know what difficulties you must have had with your limitedequipment. These not-people are unpredictable and strange. Their doctorcame in and weighed me again the day after my birth. Consternationreigned when it was discovered I was ten pounds heavier. Whatdifference could it possibly make? Many doctors then came in to see me.As they arrived hourly, they found me heavier and heavier. Naturally,since I am growing. This is part of my instructions. My not-mother(Gezsltrysk!) then burst into tears. The doctors conferred, threw uptheir hands and left.     I learned the following day that the opposite component of mynot-mother, my not-father, had been away riding on some conveyanceduring my birth. He was out on ... what did they call it? Oh, yes, abender. He did not arrive till three days after I was born.     When I heard them say that he was straightening up to come see me, Imade a special effort and grew marvelously in one afternoon. I was 36not-world inches tall by evening. My not-father entered while I wasstanding by the crib examining a syringe the doctor had left behind.He stopped in his tracks on entering the room and seemed incapable ofspeech.     Dredging into the treasury of knowledge I had come equipped with, Iproduced the proper phrase for occasions of this kind in the not-world.     Poppa, I said.     This was the first use I had made of the so-called vocal cords thatare now part of my extended matrix. The sound I emitted soundedlow-pitched, guttural and penetrating even to myself. It must havejarred on my not-father's ears, for he turned and ran shouting from theroom.     They apprehended him on the stairs and I heard him babble somethingabout my being a monster and no child of his. My not-mother appeared atthe doorway and instead of being pleased at the progress of my growth,she fell down heavily. She made a distinct      thump     on the floor.     This brought the rest of them on the run, so I climbed out the windowand retreated across a nearby field. A prolonged search was launched,but I eluded them. What unpredictable beings!     I reported my tremendous progress back to our world, including thecleverness by which I managed to escape my pursuers. I received a replyfrom Blgftury which, on careful analysis, seems to be small praiseindeed. In fact, some of his phrases apparently contain veiled threats.But you know old Blgftury. He wanted to go on this expedition himselfand it's his nature never to flatter anyone.     From now on I will refer to not-people simply as people, dropping thequalifying preface except where comparisons must be made between thisalleged world and our own. It is merely an offshoot of our primitivemythology when this was considered a spirit world, just as these peoplerefer to our world as never-never land and other anomalies. But welearned otherwise, while they never have.     New sensations crowd into my consciousness and I am having a hardtime classifying them. Anyway, I shall carry on swiftly now to theinevitable climax in which I singlehanded will obliterate the terror ofthe not-world and return to our world a hero. I cannot understand yournot replying to my letters. I have given you a box number. What couldhave happened to your vibrations?     Glmpauszn  "

        "Query": "What is the storyline of The Haunted Fountain?",
        "Summary_1": "Lois and Lorraine are having lunch at Judy\u2019s house, speaking about how Judy nearly spoiled their double-wedding where they both became sisters under the name Farringdon-Petts by solving a mystery.  \nJudy starts telling the story of the haunted fountain. She discovered a photo of a spectacular fountain in her grandmother\u2019s hot attic one summer as she was stuck there for two weeks while her parents went on vacation. She shed a tear onto the photo while recalling her sadness about not having friends or a sister, and imagined the fountain was a place for lonely girls to fill with their tears. Her grandmother overhears her speaking aloud her wishes and calls that she shouldn\u2019t keep her wishes to herself, because \u201cmost of them aren\u2019t so impossible.\u201d\nJudy\u2019s grandparents take her to the fountain in the photo and it speaks to Judy, directing her to shed a tear into it and make wishes. Judy sheds a tear thinking about how her only friend just moved out of town and then hurries through her wishes before the ripples disappear - to have lots of friends, a sister, to marry a G-man and to solve a lot of mysteries. All things that have come true in her life.\nAbruptly returning to Judy\u2019s modern timeline, she takes Lois and Lorraine to the attic. They are spooked by Judy\u2019s black cat, Blackberry, who makes sudden noises. Judy finds the photo and Lorraine recognizes the fountain is identical to one on her estate - yet it is in a different location. They surmise that it is in the woods on the edge of town that are part of the Brandt estate, and drive to it immediately.\nDuring their adventure, Judy recalls more of her fountain memory. Her grandparents didn\u2019t know the Brandt\u2019s well enough to pay them a visit, but instead stopped by the fountain on their way to drop off her grandmother\u2019s hooked rugs at the estate further up the path. Judy was left behind napping in a hammock - told by her grandparents they were getting her a surprise, but they didn\u2019t return. She followed a path to an old windowless tower, but got distracted by the sound of her grandfather's cart leaving. This is all she recalls, but there is evidently more to discover that will solve the mystery.\nThe trip to the fountain shakes the confidence of Lorraine in the back seat, who knows information about the new owners of the estate - Roger Banning - that she is withholding. Lois and Judy probe her about what she knows and why she ducked down to hide her face from a stranger passing in a car. Although Lorraine tells them about Roger, she does not reveal why she is afraid. Judy mentions knowing Roger\u2019s pal Dick Hartwell, who is apparently in the Federal Penitentiary for forgery now. As they park and exit the car to walk to the fountain, two dark-coated strangers approach them. This is where the story ends.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Judy, a woman known for solving mysteries and chasing ghosts, had her friends Lois and Lorraine over for lunch in the haunted house she had inherited from her family. When Judy was growing up, her parents would spend summers on vacation without her, so she did a lot of reading at her Grandmother Smeed's house. These were sad summers for her, but she would soon start to solve mysteries and find her own adventures. She mentioned her tears falling on a magazine with a picture of a fountain; she imagined it was full of tears of many girls and pondered the idea of an enchanted fountain. Her grandparents took her to see a fountain the next day, where she heard a voice that told her to make a wish and to cry into the fountain--the same fountain that was in the picture in the magazine. Judy's friends got more excited about the story, and it continued: she had to think of a wise wish, but reacted too quickly to think carefully. Her wishes did come true; she wanted lots of friends, a sister, to solve mysteries, and to marry a G-man. All of these things came true, and the fountain kept Judy captivated. She patiently explained to her friends that she hadn't tried to learn the secret of the fountain, and it didn't speak to her after the initial encounter. Judy had lost her appetite for her dessert but wanted to retrieve the photo of the fountain to see if Lois recognized it; they all went to the attic, bringing Blackberry the cat with them. Lorraine recognized the photo of the fountain, but it seemed to make her nervous. Lois didn't want to leave yet even though Lorraine was clearly uncomfortable and wanted to go, and thought she might recognize the fountain from the Brandt estate, so Lois and Judy decide it's worth checking out to see if it's the same one. Lorraine only agreed to join after they promised not to drive all the way up to the house, and to walk the last part of the way. After a twenty-minute drive, Judy talked more about what she remembered about the day she visited the garden; she'd fallen asleep in a hammock, and woke up to an empty garden. She headed towards a tower but found her grandfather's car before she encountered anyone. Through all of this, Lorraine hints that she knows more than she's letting on, and doesn't think things will be as Judy expected. This is when Judy picks up on Lorraine's reticence. Judy and Lois want to explore the old tower and look for the fountain, when Lois admits she knows Roger Banning has been around the area. Lucy and Lois push Lorraine to say more about why she isn't talking, and they want to know why she doesn't want to be recognized. The story ends in suspense as two people in dark coats are walking towards the three women.",
        "Summary_3": "Judy has invited her friends, Lois and Lorraine (who are sisters-in-law), to lunch at her home. She and her husband, Peter, live in a house she inherited from her grandmother. While Judy is out of the room, Lois asks Lorraine to tell Judy about something that is upsetting Lorraine, but Lorraine accuses Lois of always siding with Judy. On top of that, she claims that Judy almost ruined their double wedding. Judy enters at the end of the conversation, admitting that she has problems, too, and hasn\u2019t been able to solve all the mysteries she has attempted. When Judy mentions a promise she made not to discuss the dam and that she should have told Arthur, Lorraine has a pained expression and asks them not to talk about him.\nLois changes the subject, praising Judy\u2019s mystery-solving and ghost tracking abilities that she then explains sensibly; she asks Judy to tell them a story about one of her mysteries. Judy tells them about the haunted fountain that she saw when she was fifteen years old and spending part of the summer with her grandparents while her parents were on vacation. In the attic to look at some of her grandmother\u2019s old magazines, Judy began feeling sorry for being left behind and started crying. Her tear fell onto a picture of a fountain, and she pretended it was filled with the tears of lonely girls. Aloud, she comments that would make the fountain enchanted and starts to say a wish when her grandmother interrupts to tell her that if she let people know her wishes, most of them wouldn\u2019t be impossible to fulfill.\nThe next day, Judy\u2019s grandparents took her to a fountain that looked just like the one in the magazine. Judy walked into it and heard a voice telling her that if she sheds a tear in the fountain and makes a wish, her wish will come true. But the voice admonishes her to wish wisely. So Judy thought about how lonely she had been since her best friend had moved away and wished for lots of friends and a sister, to marry a G-man, and to solve lots of mysteries, all of which have come true.   \nJudy shows her friends magazine with the fountain, and Lois realizes it looks like the fountain on the nearby Brandt estate. On a whim, the three women decide to drive there to look at it. Although Lorraine is less than enthusiastic about the venture, she goes along but insists they not drive all the way to the house. After they turn into the long drive, a car approaches with a memorable-looking man at the wheel. As they near the path to the fountain, Judy recalls that her grandfather started to drive off without her, and she assumed he was teasing her. Lorraine admits she knows the Brandts no longer own the estate and has seen a classmate, Roger Banning, nearby. Suddenly, two dark-coated figures approach them.\n\n",

Upon seeing the picture of the fountain, Lorraine and Lois seem to know its location. The three ladies head there but it seems that Lorraine is hiding some secret connection with the fountain, and there are people there that don't seem to want them around the fountain.",

Judy rememberedthat it was Lorraine\u2019s father, Richard ThorntonLee, who gave him his job with the      FarringdonDaily Herald     . He had turned in some interestingchurch news, convincing Mr. Lee that he had in him  the makings of a good reporter. And so it was thathe spent the summer Judy was remembering in Farringdonwhere the Farringdon-Petts had their turretedmansion, while she had to suffer the heat andloneliness of Dry Brook Hollow.     Her thoughts were what had made it so hard, sheconfessed now as she reviewed everything that hadhappened. She just couldn\u2019t help resenting the factthat her parents left her every summer while theywent off on a vacation by themselves. What did theythink she would do?     \u201cYou\u2019ll have plenty to read,\u201d her father had toldher. \u201cI bought you six new books in that mysteryseries you like. When they\u2019re finished there areplenty of short stories around. Your grandmothernever throws anything away. She has magazines she\u2019ssaved since your mother was a girl. If you ask forthem she\u2019ll let you have the whole stack. I know howyou love to read.\u201d     \u201cI do, Dad, but if the magazines are that old\u2014\u201d     Judy had stopped. She had seen her father\u2019s tiredeyes and had realized that a busy doctor needed avacation much more than a schoolgirl who had toolittle to do. He and Judy\u2019s mother usually went tothe beach hotel where they had honeymooned. Itwas a precious memory. Every summer Dr. Boltonand his wife relived it. And every summer Judywent to stay with her grandmother Smeed, whoscolded and fussed and tried to pretend she wasn\u2019tglad to have her.     \u201cYou here again?\u201d she had greeted her that summer,and Judy hadn\u2019t noticed her old eyes twinklingbehind her glasses. \u201cWhat do you propose to do withyourself this time?\u201d     \u201cRead,\u201d Judy had told her. \u201cMom and Dad sayyou have a whole stack of old magazines\u2014\u201d     \u201cIn the attic. Go up and look them over if youcan stand the heat.\u201d     Judy went, not to look over the old magazines somuch as to escape to a place where she could have agood cry. It was the summer before her fifteenthbirthday. In another year she would have outgrownher childish resentment of her parents\u2019 vacation orbe grown up enough to ask them to let her have avacation of her own. In another year she wouldbe summering among the beautiful Thousand Islandsand solving a mystery to be known as the      GhostParade     .     \u201cA whole parade of ghosts,\u201d Lois would be tellingher, \u201cand you solved everything.\u201d     But then she didn\u2019t even know Lois. She had noidea so many thrilling adventures awaited her. Thereseemed to be nothing\u2014nothing\u2014and so the tearscame and spilled over on one of the magazines. AsJudy wiped it away she noticed that it had fallenon a picture of a fountain.     \u201cA fountain with tears for water. How strange!\u201dshe remembered saying aloud.     Judy had never seen a real fountain. The thrill ofwalking up to the door of the palatial Farringdon-Pettmansion was still ahead of her. On the lawn afountain still caught and held rainbows like thoseshe was to see on her honeymoon at Niagara Falls.But all that was in the future. If anyone had toldthe freckled-faced, pigtailed girl that she would oneday marry Peter Dobbs, she would have laughed intheir faces.     \u201cThat tease!\u201d     For then she knew Peter only as an older boy whoused to tease her and call her carrot-top until one dayshe yelled back at him, \u201cCarrot-tops are green and soare you!\u201d     Peter was to win Judy\u2019s heart when he gave her akitten and suggested the name Blackberry for him.The kitten was now a dignified family cat. But thesummer Judy found the picture of a fountain andspilled tears on it she had no kitten. She had nothing,she confessed, not even a friend. It had helped topretend the fountain in the picture was filled withall the tears lonely girls like herself had ever cried.     \u201cBut that would make it enchanted!\u201d she had suddenlyexclaimed. \u201cIf I could find it I\u2019d wish\u2014\u201d     A step had sounded on the stairs. Judy rememberedit distinctly. She had turned to see her grandmother  and to hear her say in her usual abrupt fashion,\u201cEnchanted fountain, indeed! If you let peopleknow your wishes instead of muttering them toyourself, most of them aren\u2019t so impossible.\u201d     \u201cWere they?\u201d asked Lois.     She and Lorraine had listened to this much of whatJudy was telling them without interruption.     \u201cThat\u2019s the unsolved mystery,\u201d Judy replied.\u201cThere weren\u2019t any of them impossible.\u201d     And she went on to tell them how, the very nextday, her grandparents had taken her to a fountainexactly like the one in the picture. It was in the centerof a deep, circular pool with steps leading up to it.Beside the steps were smaller fountains with thewater spurting from the mouths of stone lions. Judyhad stared at them a moment and then climbed thesteps to the pool.     \u201cAm I dreaming?\u201d she remembered saying aloud.\u201cIs this beautiful fountain real?\u201d     A voice had answered, although she could see noone.     \u201cMake your wishes, Judy. Wish wisely. If youshed a tear in the fountain your wishes will surelycome true.\u201d     \u201cA tear?\u201d Judy had asked. \u201cHow can I shed atear when I\u2019m happy? This is a wonderful place.\u201d     \u201cShed a tear in the fountain and your wishes willsurely come true,\u201d the voice had repeated.     \u201cBut what is there to cry about?\u201d     \u201cYou found plenty to cry about back at yourgrandmother\u2019s house,\u201d the mysterious voice had remindedher. \u201cWeren\u2019t you crying on my picture upthere in the attic?\u201d     \u201cThen you\u2014you      are     the fountain!\u201d Judy rememberedexclaiming. \u201cBut a fountain doesn\u2019t speak. Itdoesn\u2019t have a voice.\u201d     \u201cWish wisely,\u201d the voice from the fountain hadsaid in a mysterious whisper.    <doc-sep>  id=chap02>  CHAPTER II   If Wishes Came True    \u201cDid you?\u201d Lois interrupted the story to ask excitedly.\u201cOh, Judy! Don\u2019t keep us in suspense anylonger. What did you wish?\u201d     \u201cPatience,\u201d Judy said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m comingto that.\u201d     First, she told her friends, she had to think of awise wish. There had been so much she wanted inthose early days before the flood. Dora Scott hadbeen her best friend in Roulsville, but she had movedaway.     \u201cYou see,\u201d she explained, \u201cI made the mistake ofhaving just one best friend. There wasn\u2019t anybodyin Dry Brook Hollow. I remember thinking of howlonely I was and how I wished for a friend or a sister,  and suddenly a tear splashed in the water. It madelittle ripples. I thought I had to wish quickly beforethey vanished, and so I began naming the things Iwanted as fast as I could. I\u2019m not sure they werewise wishes. They seem rather selfish to me, now. Iwasn\u2019t thinking of anybody but me, Judy Bolton,and what I wanted. It wasn\u2019t until after I began tothink of others that my wishes started to come true.\u201d     \u201cBut what were they?\u201d Lois insisted.     Lorraine seemed unusually quiet and thoughtful.Judy did not notice the fear in her eyes as she repliedairily, \u201cOh, didn\u2019t I tell you? I wished for lotsof friends and a sister, and I wished I could marry aG-man and solve a lot of mysteries and that\u2019s as faras I got when the ripples vanished. I thought thespell was broken and so I didn\u2019t wish for anythingmore.\u201d     \u201cWasn\u2019t there anything more you wanted?\u201d Loisasked.     \u201cOf course,\u201d replied Judy. \u201cThere were lots morethings. I wanted to go places, of course, and keeppets, and have a nice home, and\u2014\u201d     \u201cAnd your wishes all came true!\u201d     \u201cEvery one of them,\u201d Judy agreed, \u201ceven the oneabout the sister. You see, it wasn\u2019t a baby sister Iwanted. It was a sister near my own age. Thatseemed impossible at the time, but the future didhold a sister for me.\u201d     \u201cIt held one for me, too,\u201d Lois said, squeezingLorraine\u2019s hand under the table. \u201cDon\u2019t you thinksisters should tell each other their problems, Judy?\u201d     \u201cHoney and I always do,\u201d she replied \u201cbut thenit was different. I didn\u2019t know I would marry Peteror that he would become a G-man, and he didn\u2019tknow he had a sister. It is strange, isn\u2019t it? But thestrangest thing of all was the fountain itself.\u201d     \u201cWhy?\u201d asked Lorraine. \u201cDo you still think it wasenchanted?\u201d     Lois laughed at this, but Judy was serious as sheanswered, \u201cI was still little girl enough to think soat the time. I wandered around, growing verydrowsy. Then I found a hammock and climbed intoit. I must have gone to sleep, because I rememberwaking up and wondering if the voice in the fountainhad been a dream.\u201d     \u201cA hammock?\u201d Lois questioned. \u201cAre you sure itwasn\u2019t a flying carpet?\u201d     \u201cNo, it was a hammock all right,\u201d Judy assuredher, laughing. \u201cIt was hung between two trees in abeautiful garden all enclosed in rose trellises thickwith roses. Did I tell you it was June?\u201d     \u201cAll the year around?\u201d     Again Lois laughed. But Lorraine said abruptly,\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about rose gardens in June. It\u2019s a longway from June to December.\u201d     \u201cDo you mean a garden changes? I know,\u201d Judysaid, \u201cbut I think this one would be beautiful at anytime of the year. There were rhododendrons, too,and I don\u2019t know how many different kinds of evergreens.I explored the garden all around the fountain.\u201d     \u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d Lorraine urged her.     \u201cYes, yes. Go on,\u201d entreated Lois. \u201cI didn\u2019t dreamyou\u2019d kept anything that exciting a secret. Why didn\u2019tyou try to solve the mystery?\u201d     \u201cI think I would have tried,\u201d Judy admitted, \u201cifI had been older or more experienced. I really shouldhave investigated it more thoroughly and learned thesecret of the fountain. But after the ripples wentaway it didn\u2019t speak to me any more, and I didn\u2019treally think it had heard my wishes. I was still wishingfor a friend when I met you, Lois. It did seemimpossible for us to be friends at first, didn\u2019t it? Lorrainewas your friend.\u201d     \u201cI did make trouble for you,\u201d Lorraine remembered.\u201cIt was all because of my foolish jealousy.\u201d     \u201cIt was nothing compared to the trouble caused bythe Roulsville flood,\u201d declared Judy. \u201cAfter thatthings started happening so fast that I completelyforgot about the fountain. Honestly, Lois, I don\u2019tbelieve I thought about it again until after we movedto Farringdon and I walked up to your door andsaw the fountain on your lawn.\u201d     \u201cThe Farringdon-Pett puddle, I always called it,\u201dLois said with a giggle. \u201cI\u2019ve seen lots nicer fountains.\u201d     \u201cYou have?\u201d asked Judy. \u201cThen maybe you\u2019veseen the one I\u2019ve been telling you about. I think thepicture of it is still in the attic. Come on up and I\u2019llshow you.\u201d     Lois and Lorraine had finished their dessert whileJudy was telling them the story of the fountain.Somehow, she wasn\u2019t hungry for hers. She hadtasted it too often while she was making it.     \u201cI\u2019ll leave it for Blackberry,\u201d she decided.     Lois watched in amusement as the cat lapped upthe chocolate pudding after Judy had mixed it generouslywith cream.     \u201cSometimes,\u201d Judy said fondly, \u201cBlackberry thinkshe\u2019s a person. He eats everything we eat, includinglettuce. Do you mind if he comes with us, Lorraine?He wants to explore the attic, too.\u201d     \u201cHe\u2019ll remember he\u2019s a cat fast enough if thereare any mice up there,\u201d Lois said with a giggle.     Leaving the table, they all started upstairs withthe cat bounding ahead of them. In modernizing hergrandparents\u2019 house to suit her own and Peter\u2019stastes, Judy had seen to it that the old stair door wasremoved. But there was still a door closing off thenarrower stairs that led to the attic. Blackberryreached it first and yowled for Judy to open it.     \u201cHe can read my mind. He always knows whereI\u2019m going,\u201d Judy said as the door creaked open andthe cat shot through it. A moment later a weird rollingnoise came from the floor above.     \u201cCome on. There\u2019s nothing up here to be afraidof,\u201d Judy urged her friends.     \u201cMaybe not, but I\u2019m beginning to get the shivers,\u201dconfessed Lois as she followed Judy to the sewingroom at the top of the last flight of stairs.     \u201cSo am I,\u201d Lorraine admitted. \u201cI\u2019m not superstitiousabout black cats, but they are creepy. DoesBlackberry have to roll spools across the floor?\u201d     \u201cNow he thinks he\u2019s a kitten,\u201d laughed Judy.Pausing at still another door that led to the darkerpart of the attic, she turned and said mysteriously,\u201cUp here we can all turn back the clock. Does anybodycare to explore the past?\u201d     The exploration began enthusiastically with Judyrelating still more of what she remembered aboutthe fountain.     \u201cWhen I told Grandma about it she laughed andsaid I must have dreamed it. She said if wishes cametrue that easily she\u2019d be living in a castle. But wouldshe?\u201d Judy wondered. \u201cWhen I first remember thishouse she was still burning kerosene lamps like thoseyou see on that high shelf by the window. I thinkshe and Grandpa like the way they lived withoutany modern conveniences or anything.\u201d     \u201cI think so, too,\u201d Lois agreed, looking around theold attic with a shiver. \u201cIt is strange they both diedthe same winter, isn\u2019t it?\u201d     \u201cMaybe they wanted it that way. Maybe theywished neither of them would outlive the other. Ifthey did wish in the fountain,\u201d Judy went on morethoughtfully, \u201cI\u2019m sure that was one of their wishes.Another could have been to keep the good old days,as Grandma used to call them. That one came truein a way. They did manage to keep a little of thepast when they kept all these old things. That\u2019s whatI meant about turning back the clock.\u201d     \u201cIf wishes came true I\u2019d like to turn it back a littlemyself,\u201d Lorraine began. \u201cIt would be nice if thingswere the way they used to be when I trustedArthur\u2014\u201d     \u201cDon\u2019t you trust him now?\u201d Judy asked.     Afterwards she was sorry for the interruption. Loisand Judy both questioned Lorraine, but that was allshe would say. Judy wondered, as they searchedthrough the old magazines, what was wrong. Lorrainewas of a jealous disposition. Was the green-eyedmonster coming between her and her handsome husband,Arthur Farringdon-Pett? Until now they hadseemed blissfully happy. But there was no happinessin Lorraine\u2019s face as she gazed at a picture of one ofthe fountains and then said in a tight little voice, \u201cItis. It\u2019s the very same one.\u201d     \u201cBut that\u2019s the picture I\u2019ve been searching for!\u201dJudy said eagerly. \u201cDo you know where it is?\u201d     \u201cI can\u2019t be sure. But if it ever was enchanted, I\u2019msure it isn\u2019t now. Let\u2019s go,\u201d Lorraine said suddenlyto Lois. Judy knew she was suggesting a fast trip home.But, apparently, Lois did not understand it that way.If she did, she pretended not to.     \u201cWhere?\u201d she asked. \u201cTo the fountain? I\u2019d loveto, wouldn\u2019t you, Judy?\u201d     \u201cI certainly would,\u201d Judy replied enthusiastically.\u201cDo you recognize it, too?\u201d     \u201cI think so,\u201d Lois answered after studying a littlemore closely the picture they had found. \u201cIt lookslike the fountain on the Brandt estate.\u201d     \u201cThe department store Brandts?\u201d Judy questioned.\u201cThen my grandparents must have driven old Fannyall the way to Farringdon.\u201d     \u201cNot quite all the way,\u201d Lorraine objected. \u201cTheBrandts own that stretch of woods just before youcome into the city. You\u2019ve passed it lots of times.\u201d     \u201cOf course,\u201d agreed Judy. She put the magazineback in its place under the eaves and turned eagerlyto her friends. \u201cI do remember a road turning offinto the woods and going on uphill,\u201d she told them.\u201cI never thought it led to a house, though. Thereisn\u2019t even a gate. Could that be the road my grandparentstook?\u201d     \u201cWhy don\u2019t we take it ourselves and find out?\u201dLois suggested.   "

        "Query": "What is the backdrop of The Haunted Fountain?",
        "Summary_1": "The story opens at Judy\u2019s house as she has Lois and Lorraine over for lunch. Judy\u2019s lives in her grandparents' old house that she modernized with her husband, Peter. The house has an attic that is up a narrow set of stairs with a door at the top. They have a black cat named Blackberry that spooks her friends because it is creepy when it makes unexpected noises in the attic.\nWhen Judy is recalling the story of the fountain, the narrative bounces back and forth into their present reality as Lois and Lorraine ask questions.\nIn Judy\u2019s recalled story, she is a young red-haired girl with no friends who spends two weeks in the summer with her grandparents at their home. They have a hot attic filled with keepsakes and old reading materials, most notably a picture of a fountain that Judy\u2019s grandmother later brings her to. The fountain was centered in a deep, circular pool, and had steps leading up to it that were bordered with smaller fountains of lions with water spurting out of the mouths. Judy thinks it could be a beautiful location at any time of the year, surrounded by lush vegetation like rhododendrons and evergreens. From the fountain there was a path leading to a windowless old tower that was populated by cupids and gnomes that peered out at Judy.\nBack in modern day, when Judy, Lois and Lorraine go looking for the fountain, the tower is still visible, and Lorraine describes it as something out of \u201cGrimm\u2019s Fairy Tales.\u201d The friends visit it on a day where the trees are leafless in the woods, making the rhododendrons appear vibrantly green, under a gray sky. They do not actually reach the fountain in the story, but they do pass several posted signs for \u201cNO TRESPASSING\u201d along the wooded road.\n",
        "Summary_2": "The house that Judy lives in was inherited from her grandparents, and she now lives there with her husband Peter and their cat Blackberry. She has made some changes to the house, including in the staircases to the attic, but she has not yet gone through all of her grandmother's belongings so they take up a lot of the attic. Judy's friends consider the house haunted, but Judy insists that at least the attic is not. After the three leave the house to investigate where the fountain might be, they head into the woods where there is an uphill road leading to the Brandt estate. In this estate, there was an old water tower that was visible from the path the women were on, but the story ended before the women were able to confirm if the fountain was on this estate or not. ",
        "Summary_3": "The story takes place around the early 20th century in a town called Farringdon in the USA as Judy\u2019s grandparents still drove a horse-led wagon, but Lois now drives a car, and Judy\u2019s husband is employed by the FBI. The story begins at Judy\u2019s house, which she inherited from her grandparents. While she is in the process of renovating the house, she still has her grandmother\u2019s things in the attic, including the magazine with the picture of the fountain. Lois alludes to the fact that Judy has tracked down the ghosts in the attic and cellar of the house. The attic is where Judy found the magazine with the picture of the fountain on it that she is telling her friends about. When Judy saw the picture, she had never seen a fountain in person, although there is a fountain at the nearby turreted Farringdon-Petts mansion. After Judy shows the picture of the fountain to Lois and Lorraine, the two women recognize it as the fountain on the Brandt estate.\n        The fountain is part of the setting in the flashback in the story. Judy remembers visiting the fountain during June; it was centered in a deep, circular pool with steps leading to the fountain. Smaller fountains in the shapes of lions were beside the steps, and water spurted from their mouths. After leaving the fountain, Judy found a hammock in a beautiful garden encircled by rose trellises. There were also rhododendrons and evergreens in the garden. After waking from her nap in the hammock, Judy saw an old windowless tower and a path leading to it. She followed the trail, and all along it were cupid and gnome figures that seemed to be looking out at her, tucked into surprising places. Just as she reached the tower, she heard her grandfather leaving with the wagon.  \n\tThe rest of the story occurs in the present\u2019s second setting, the Brandt estate. The drive off the main road is a narrow, gravel road uphill through the woods. An oncoming car driven by a swarthy man with hypnotic eyes startles them. Traveling on, they pass more evergreens and a hedge of rhododendron and can see the tower from the car. As Lois turns the car around, two figures in dark coats approach them.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Most of the story takes place in Judy's grandparents' house, which Judy currently owns and has modernized. The main focus of the first half of the story is on the house's attic, where Judy's grandmother's things are kept. The story also takes place in a car on the way to the Brandt estate, which is the location of the fountain. The characters wind up on the estate, but it is a private estate and there are people there who do not want them there. The story takes place in a time period that seems older, with a lot of pomp and propriety. ",

He was the hero without even meaning tobe. He was the one who rode through town andwarned people that the flood was coming.

Therewas one I used to call the spirit of the fountain, butwhat she was or how she spoke to me is more thanI know. If my grandparents knew, they weren\u2019t telling.And now they\u2019re both dead and I can\u2019t ask them.They left me a lot of unsolved mysteries along withthis house. Maybe I\u2019ll find the answers to some ofthem when I finish sorting Grandma\u2019s things. They\u2019restored in one end of the attic.\u201d     \u201cAnother haunted attic? How thrilling!\u201d exclaimedLois. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have another ghost party andshow up the spooks?\u201d     \u201cI didn\u2019t say the attic was haunted.\u201d     Judy was almost sorry she had mentioned it. Shewasn\u2019t in the mood for digging up old mysteries,but Lois and Lorraine insisted. It all began, she finallytold them, the summer before they met. Horacehad just started working on the paper. Judy rememberedthat it was Lorraine\u2019s father, Richard ThorntonLee, who gave him his job with the      FarringdonDaily Herald     . He had turned in some interestingchurch news, convincing Mr. Lee that he had in him  the makings of a good reporter. And so it was thathe spent the summer Judy was remembering in Farringdonwhere the Farringdon-Petts had their turretedmansion, while she had to suffer the heat andloneliness of Dry Brook Hollow.     Her thoughts were what had made it so hard, sheconfessed now as she reviewed everything that hadhappened. She just couldn\u2019t help resenting the factthat her parents left her every summer while theywent off on a vacation by themselves. What did theythink she would do?     \u201cYou\u2019ll have plenty to read,\u201d her father had toldher. \u201cI bought you six new books in that mysteryseries you like. When they\u2019re finished there areplenty of short stories around. Your grandmothernever throws anything away. She has magazines she\u2019ssaved since your mother was a girl. If you ask forthem she\u2019ll let you have the whole stack. I know howyou love to read.\u201d     \u201cI do, Dad, but if the magazines are that old\u2014\u201d     Judy had stopped. She had seen her father\u2019s tiredeyes and had realized that a busy doctor needed avacation much more than a schoolgirl who had toolittle to do. He and Judy\u2019s mother usually went tothe beach hotel where they had honeymooned. Itwas a precious memory. Every summer Dr. Boltonand his wife relived it. And every summer Judywent to stay with her grandmother Smeed, whoscolded and fussed and tried to pretend she wasn\u2019tglad to have her.     \u201cYou here again?\u201d she had greeted her that summer,and Judy hadn\u2019t noticed her old eyes twinklingbehind her glasses. \u201cWhat do you propose to do withyourself this time?\u201d     \u201cRead,\u201d Judy had told her. \u201cMom and Dad sayyou have a whole stack of old magazines\u2014\u201d     \u201cIn the attic. Go up and look them over if youcan stand the heat.\u201d     Judy went, not to look over the old magazines somuch as to escape to a place where she could have agood cry. It was the summer before her fifteenthbirthday. In another year she would have outgrownher childish resentment of her parents\u2019 vacation orbe grown up enough to ask them to let her have avacation of her own. In another year she wouldbe summering among the beautiful Thousand Islandsand solving a mystery to be known as the      GhostParade     .     \u201cA whole parade of ghosts,\u201d Lois would be tellingher, \u201cand you solved everything.\u201d     But then she didn\u2019t even know Lois. She had noidea so many thrilling adventures awaited her. Thereseemed to be nothing\u2014nothing\u2014and so the tearscame and spilled over on one of the magazines. AsJudy wiped it away she noticed that it had fallenon a picture of a fountain.     \u201cA fountain with tears for water. How strange!\u201dshe remembered saying aloud.     Judy had never seen a real fountain. The thrill ofwalking up to the door of the palatial Farringdon-Pettmansion was still ahead of her. On the lawn afountain still caught and held rainbows like thoseshe was to see on her honeymoon at Niagara Falls.But all that was in the future. If anyone had toldthe freckled-faced, pigtailed girl that she would oneday marry Peter Dobbs, she would have laughed intheir faces.     \u201cThat tease!\u201d     For then she knew Peter only as an older boy whoused to tease her and call her carrot-top until one dayshe yelled back at him, \u201cCarrot-tops are green and soare you!\u201d     Peter was to win Judy\u2019s heart when he gave her akitten and suggested the name Blackberry for him.The kitten was now a dignified family cat. But thesummer Judy found the picture of a fountain andspilled tears on it she had no kitten. She had nothing,she confessed, not even a friend. It had helped topretend the fountain in the picture was filled withall the tears lonely girls like herself had ever cried.     \u201cBut that would make it enchanted!\u201d she had suddenlyexclaimed. \u201cIf I could find it I\u2019d wish\u2014\u201d     A step had sounded on the stairs. Judy rememberedit distinctly. She had turned to see her grandmother  and to hear her say in her usual abrupt fashion,\u201cEnchanted fountain, indeed! If you let peopleknow your wishes instead of muttering them toyourself, most of them aren\u2019t so impossible.\u201d     \u201cWere they?\u201d asked Lois.     She and Lorraine had listened to this much of whatJudy was telling them without interruption.     \u201cThat\u2019s the unsolved mystery,\u201d Judy replied.\u201cThere weren\u2019t any of them impossible.\u201d     And she went on to tell them how, the very nextday, her grandparents had taken her to a fountainexactly like the one in the picture. It was in the centerof a deep, circular pool with steps leading up to it.Beside the steps were smaller fountains with thewater spurting from the mouths of stone lions. Judyhad stared at them a moment and then climbed thesteps to the pool.     \u201cAm I dreaming?\u201d she remembered saying aloud.\u201cIs this beautiful fountain real?\u201d     A voice had answered, although she could see noone.     \u201cMake your wishes, Judy. Wish wisely. If youshed a tear in the fountain your wishes will surelycome true.\u201d     \u201cA tear?\u201d Judy had asked. \u201cHow can I shed atear when I\u2019m happy? This is a wonderful place.\u201d     \u201cShed a tear in the fountain and your wishes willsurely come true,\u201d the voice had repeated.     \u201cBut what is there to cry about?\u201d     \u201cYou found plenty to cry about back at yourgrandmother\u2019s house,\u201d the mysterious voice had remindedher. \u201cWeren\u2019t you crying on my picture upthere in the attic?\u201d     \u201cThen you\u2014you      are     the fountain!\u201d Judy rememberedexclaiming. \u201cBut a fountain doesn\u2019t speak. Itdoesn\u2019t have a voice.\u201d     \u201cWish wisely,\u201d the voice from the fountain hadsaid in a mysterious whisper.    <doc-sep>  id=chap02>  CHAPTER II   If Wishes Came True    \u201cDid you?\u201d Lois interrupted the story to ask excitedly.\u201cOh, Judy! Don\u2019t keep us in suspense anylonger. What did you wish?\u201d     \u201cPatience,\u201d Judy said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m comingto that.\u201d     First, she told her friends, she had to think of awise wish. There had been so much she wanted inthose early days before the flood. Dora Scott hadbeen her best friend in Roulsville, but she had movedaway.     \u201cYou see,\u201d she explained, \u201cI made the mistake ofhaving just one best friend. There wasn\u2019t anybodyin Dry Brook Hollow. I remember thinking of howlonely I was and how I wished for a friend or a sister,  and suddenly a tear splashed in the water. It madelittle ripples. I thought I had to wish quickly beforethey vanished, and so I began naming the things Iwanted as fast as I could. I\u2019m not sure they werewise wishes. They seem rather selfish to me, now. Iwasn\u2019t thinking of anybody but me, Judy Bolton,and what I wanted. It wasn\u2019t until after I began tothink of others that my wishes started to come true.\u201d     \u201cBut what were they?\u201d Lois insisted.     Lorraine seemed unusually quiet and thoughtful.Judy did not notice the fear in her eyes as she repliedairily, \u201cOh, didn\u2019t I tell you? I wished for lotsof friends and a sister, and I wished I could marry aG-man and solve a lot of mysteries and that\u2019s as faras I got when the ripples vanished. I thought thespell was broken and so I didn\u2019t wish for anythingmore.\u201d     \u201cWasn\u2019t there anything more you wanted?\u201d Loisasked.     \u201cOf course,\u201d replied Judy. \u201cThere were lots morethings. I wanted to go places, of course, and keeppets, and have a nice home, and\u2014\u201d     \u201cAnd your wishes all came true!\u201d     \u201cEvery one of them,\u201d Judy agreed, \u201ceven the oneabout the sister. You see, it wasn\u2019t a baby sister Iwanted. It was a sister near my own age. Thatseemed impossible at the time, but the future didhold a sister for me.\u201d     \u201cIt held one for me, too,\u201d Lois said, squeezingLorraine\u2019s hand under the table. \u201cDon\u2019t you thinksisters should tell each other their problems, Judy?\u201d     \u201cHoney and I always do,\u201d she replied \u201cbut thenit was different. I didn\u2019t know I would marry Peteror that he would become a G-man, and he didn\u2019tknow he had a sister. It is strange, isn\u2019t it? But thestrangest thing of all was the fountain itself.\u201d     \u201cWhy?\u201d asked Lorraine. \u201cDo you still think it wasenchanted?\u201d     Lois laughed at this, but Judy was serious as sheanswered, \u201cI was still little girl enough to think soat the time. I wandered around, growing verydrowsy. Then I found a hammock and climbed intoit. I must have gone to sleep, because I rememberwaking up and wondering if the voice in the fountainhad been a dream.\u201d     \u201cA hammock?\u201d Lois questioned. \u201cAre you sure itwasn\u2019t a flying carpet?\u201d     \u201cNo, it was a hammock all right,\u201d Judy assuredher, laughing. \u201cIt was hung between two trees in abeautiful garden all enclosed in rose trellises thickwith roses. Did I tell you it was June?\u201d     \u201cAll the year around?\u201d     Again Lois laughed. But Lorraine said abruptly,\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about rose gardens in June. It\u2019s a longway from June to December.\u201d     \u201cDo you mean a garden changes? I know,\u201d Judysaid, \u201cbut I think this one would be beautiful at anytime of the year. There were rhododendrons, too,and I don\u2019t know how many different kinds of evergreens.I explored the garden all around the fountain.\u201d     \u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d Lorraine urged her.     \u201cYes, yes. Go on,\u201d entreated Lois. \u201cI didn\u2019t dreamyou\u2019d kept anything that exciting a secret. Why didn\u2019tyou try to solve the mystery?\u201d     \u201cI think I would have tried,\u201d Judy admitted, \u201cifI had been older or more experienced. I really shouldhave investigated it more thoroughly and learned thesecret of the fountain. But after the ripples wentaway it didn\u2019t speak to me any more, and I didn\u2019treally think it had heard my wishes. I was still wishingfor a friend when I met you, Lois. It did seemimpossible for us to be friends at first, didn\u2019t it? Lorrainewas your friend.\u201d     \u201cI did make trouble for you,\u201d Lorraine remembered.\u201cIt was all because of my foolish jealousy.\u201d     \u201cIt was nothing compared to the trouble caused bythe Roulsville flood,\u201d declared Judy. \u201cAfter thatthings started happening so fast that I completelyforgot about the fountain. Honestly, Lois, I don\u2019tbelieve I thought about it again until after we movedto Farringdon and I walked up to your door andsaw the fountain on your lawn.\u201d     \u201cThe Farringdon-Pett puddle, I always called it,\u201dLois said with a giggle. \u201cI\u2019ve seen lots nicer fountains.\u201d     \u201cYou have?\u201d asked Judy. \u201cThen maybe you\u2019veseen the one I\u2019ve been telling you about. I think thepicture of it is still in the attic. Come on up and I\u2019llshow you.\u201d     Lois and Lorraine had finished their dessert whileJudy was telling them the story of the fountain.Somehow, she wasn\u2019t hungry for hers. She hadtasted it too often while she was making it.     \u201cI\u2019ll leave it for Blackberry,\u201d she decided.     Lois watched in amusement as the cat lapped upthe chocolate pudding after Judy had mixed it generouslywith cream.     \u201cSometimes,\u201d Judy said fondly, \u201cBlackberry thinkshe\u2019s a person. He eats everything we eat, includinglettuce. Do you mind if he comes with us, Lorraine?He wants to explore the attic, too.\u201d     \u201cHe\u2019ll remember he\u2019s a cat fast enough if thereare any mice up there,\u201d Lois said with a giggle.     Leaving the table, they all started upstairs withthe cat bounding ahead of them. In modernizing hergrandparents\u2019 house to suit her own and Peter\u2019stastes, Judy had seen to it that the old stair door wasremoved. But there was still a door closing off thenarrower stairs that led to the attic. Blackberryreached it first and yowled for Judy to open it.     \u201cHe can read my mind. He always knows whereI\u2019m going,\u201d Judy said as the door creaked open andthe cat shot through it. A moment later a weird rollingnoise came from the floor above.     \u201cCome on. There\u2019s nothing up here to be afraidof,\u201d Judy urged her friends.     \u201cMaybe not, but I\u2019m beginning to get the shivers,\u201dconfessed Lois as she followed Judy to the sewingroom at the top of the last flight of stairs.     \u201cSo am I,\u201d Lorraine admitted. \u201cI\u2019m not superstitiousabout black cats, but they are creepy. DoesBlackberry have to roll spools across the floor?\u201d     \u201cNow he thinks he\u2019s a kitten,\u201d laughed Judy.Pausing at still another door that led to the darkerpart of the attic, she turned and said mysteriously,\u201cUp here we can all turn back the clock. Does anybodycare to explore the past?\u201d     The exploration began enthusiastically with Judyrelating still more of what she remembered aboutthe fountain.     \u201cWhen I told Grandma about it she laughed andsaid I must have dreamed it. She said if wishes cametrue that easily she\u2019d be living in a castle. But wouldshe?\u201d Judy wondered. \u201cWhen I first remember thishouse she was still burning kerosene lamps like thoseyou see on that high shelf by the window. I thinkshe and Grandpa like the way they lived withoutany modern conveniences or anything.\u201d     \u201cI think so, too,\u201d Lois agreed, looking around theold attic with a shiver. \u201cIt is strange they both diedthe same winter, isn\u2019t it?\u201d     \u201cMaybe they wanted it that way. Maybe theywished neither of them would outlive the other. Ifthey did wish in the fountain,\u201d Judy went on morethoughtfully, \u201cI\u2019m sure that was one of their wishes.Another could have been to keep the good old days,as Grandma used to call them. That one came truein a way. They did manage to keep a little of thepast when they kept all these old things. That\u2019s whatI meant about turning back the clock.\u201d     \u201cIf wishes came true I\u2019d like to turn it back a littlemyself,\u201d Lorraine began. \u201cIt would be nice if thingswere the way they used to be when I trustedArthur\u2014\u201d     \u201cDon\u2019t you trust him now?\u201d Judy asked.     Afterwards she was sorry for the interruption. Loisand Judy both questioned Lorraine, but that was allshe would say. Judy wondered, as they searchedthrough the old magazines, what was wrong. Lorrainewas of a jealous disposition. Was the green-eyedmonster coming between her and her handsome husband,Arthur Farringdon-Pett? Until now they hadseemed blissfully happy. But there was no happinessin Lorraine\u2019s face as she gazed at a picture of one ofthe fountains and then said in a tight little voice, \u201cItis. It\u2019s the very same one.\u201d     \u201cBut that\u2019s the picture I\u2019ve been searching for!\u201dJudy said eagerly. \u201cDo you know where it is?\u201d     \u201cI can\u2019t be sure. But if it ever was enchanted, I\u2019msure it isn\u2019t now. Let\u2019s go,\u201d Lorraine said suddenlyto Lois. Judy knew she was suggesting a fast trip home.But, apparently, Lois did not understand it that way.If she did, she pretended not to.     \u201cWhere?\u201d she asked. \u201cTo the fountain? I\u2019d loveto, wouldn\u2019t you, Judy?\u201d     \u201cI certainly would,\u201d Judy replied enthusiastically.\u201cDo you recognize it, too?\u201d     \u201cI think so,\u201d Lois answered after studying a littlemore closely the picture they had found. \u201cIt lookslike the fountain on the Brandt estate.\u201d     \u201cThe department store Brandts?\u201d Judy questioned.\u201cThen my grandparents must have driven old Fannyall the way to Farringdon.\u201d     \u201cNot quite all the way,\u201d Lorraine objected. \u201cTheBrandts own that stretch of woods just before youcome into the city. You\u2019ve passed it lots of times.\u201d     \u201cOf course,\u201d agreed Judy. She put the magazineback in its place under the eaves and turned eagerlyto her friends. \u201cI do remember a road turning offinto the woods and going on uphill,\u201d she told them.\u201cI never thought it led to a house, though. Thereisn\u2019t even a gate. Could that be the road my grandparentstook?\u201d     \u201cWhy don\u2019t we take it ourselves and find out?\u201dLois suggested.   "

        "Query": "What kind of personality does Judy have in The Haunted Fountain?",
        "Summary_1": "Judy was a freckled-faced, pigtailed girl that spent two weeks every summer with her grandmother, Smeed, and grandfather while her parents went on vacation to a beach hotel they honeymooned at many years ago. Judy resented being left behind by her parents. However, during one summer with her grandparents, they took her to an enchanted fountain that Judy found a photo of in their attic. The fountain spoke to Judy and asked her to shed a tear into the fountain and make wishes. All of the things that Judy wished for in her life came true - to have a lot of friends, a sister, to marry a G-man and to solve a lot of mysteries. \nIn the telling of the story, Judy is older, married, and has a sister Lois (by way of Judy\u2019s marriage to her brother), and another close friend like a sister, Lorraine (by way of her marrying into the same family as Lois - the Farringdon-Petts). Judy shows modesty by bringing up the mysteries she never solved when Lois and Lorraine shower her with compliments. Judy\u2019s grandparents have since passed, but she lives in their home and keeps their belongings in the attic, showing her connection with family. \nJudy (maiden name Bolten) is married to Peter Dobbs, an FBI agent, and she prefers to discuss facts instead of gossiping about hear-say with Lois and Lorraine. Judy is diligent in asking questions about Lorraine\u2019s behavior when she ducks down in the car to hide her face from a passing stranger, and probes her to tell the truth about knowing who the new owner of the Brandt estate is - Roger Banning. Her wit is sharp, and she comes across as determined and willing to take risks to solve her mysteries (like passing no trespassing signs in broad daylight after they have already been spotted by a stranger).\n",
        "Summary_2": "Judy is a woman known for her sharp detective abilities. She is married to Peter Dobbs, and took his last name when they married instead of keeping her maiden name, Bolton. She grew up rather lonely, not having many friends--the one friend she did have moved away. After she made a wish in an enchanted fountain, however, her life changed--she found friends, a sister, a dream husband, and a new ability to solve mysteries which brought her notoriety in the area. She is a very curious person who loves to read, which is why she was with the magazines in the attic at her grandmother's in the first place. She grew up interested in mystery books also, as evidenced by the books her father bought her, which likely led to her interest in solving mysteries of her own. ",
        "Summary_3": "Judy Dobbs, n\u00e9e Bolton, is friends with Lois and Lorraine and their friend and her sister-in-law Honey. She is married to Peter Dobbs, an employee of the FBI. Growing up an only child, Judy had only one best friend and was very lonely when her friend moved away. She also never got to go on family vacations; her parents would leave her with her grandparents while they went to the beach hotel where they had spent their honeymoon. Judy is a forthright, somewhat self-centered woman. She is very curious and has a habit of pursuing mysterious occurrences to discover what is behind them. When the voice in the fountain urged her to make wise wishes, Judy wished for just the things that have happened in her life, but Judy points out that her wishes didn\u2019t come true until she started thinking of others. She also believes that as she goes through her grandmother\u2019s belongings, she might be able to solve some of the mysteries about her grandparents\u2019 lives. Judy is also analytical; she notices Lorraine\u2019s tendency toward jealousy and Lorraine\u2019s reaction to mentions of Arthur and suspects that Lorraine might be jealous about him. She also notices Lorraine\u2019s reaction to the oncoming car, hiding herself behind Lois, and her reluctance to tell them what she knows about the Brandt estate and confronts her, asking for her reasons.",
        "Summary_4": "Judy is the main character of the story and she has become famous for solving paranormal mysteries. Judy's drive to see the fountain that brought her all her good fortune is what drives the story forward and gets the characters into trouble. Judy seems like a privileged character who is thankful for that privilege. She's highly inquisitive, never wanting to let a mystery go unsolved. She is a content character, but much of the story's beginning is dedicated to describing how she was before she became content as a lonely, depressed younger girl in need of friends.",
        "Article": " id=chap01>  CHAPTER I   An Unsolved Mystery    \u201cTell Judy about it,\u201d begged Lois. \u201cPlease, Lorraine,it can\u2019t be as bad as it appears.

But you always did take Judy\u2019spart. She was the one who nearly spoiled our doublewedding trying to solve a mystery.

I met you when the wholevalley below the big Roulsville dam was threatenedby flood and you solved that\u2014\u201d     \u201cThat,\u201d declared Judy, \u201cwas my brother Horace,not me. He was the hero without even meaning tobe. He was the one who rode through town andwarned people that the flood was coming. I was offchasing a shadow.\u201d     \u201cA vanishing shadow,\u201d Lois said with a sigh.\u201cWhat you did wasn\u2019t easy, Judy.\u201d     \u201cIt didn\u2019t need to be as hard as it was,\u201d Judy confessed.\u201cI know now that keeping that promise notto talk about the dam was a great big mistake andcould have cost lives.

Maybe you were mistaken about a thing ortwo before the flood, but what about the haunted  house you moved into? You were the one whotracked down the ghosts in the attic and the cellarand goodness knows where all.

Therewas one I used to call the spirit of the fountain, butwhat she was or how she spoke to me is more thanI know. If my grandparents knew, they weren\u2019t telling.And now they\u2019re both dead and I can\u2019t ask them.They left me a lot of unsolved mysteries along withthis house. Maybe I\u2019ll find the answers to some ofthem when I finish sorting Grandma\u2019s things. They\u2019restored in one end of the attic.\u201d     \u201cAnother haunted attic? How thrilling!\u201d exclaimedLois. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have another ghost party andshow up the spooks?\u201d     \u201cI didn\u2019t say the attic was haunted.\u201d     Judy was almost sorry she had mentioned it. Shewasn\u2019t in the mood for digging up old mysteries,but Lois and Lorraine insisted. It all began, she finallytold them, the summer before they met. Horacehad just started working on the paper. Judy rememberedthat it was Lorraine\u2019s father, Richard ThorntonLee, who gave him his job with the      FarringdonDaily Herald     . He had turned in some interestingchurch news, convincing Mr. Lee that he had in him  the makings of a good reporter. And so it was thathe spent the summer Judy was remembering in Farringdonwhere the Farringdon-Petts had their turretedmansion, while she had to suffer the heat andloneliness of Dry Brook Hollow.     Her thoughts were what had made it so hard, sheconfessed now as she reviewed everything that hadhappened. She just couldn\u2019t help resenting the factthat her parents left her every summer while theywent off on a vacation by themselves. What did theythink she would do?     \u201cYou\u2019ll have plenty to read,\u201d her father had toldher. \u201cI bought you six new books in that mysteryseries you like. When they\u2019re finished there areplenty of short stories around. Your grandmothernever throws anything away. She has magazines she\u2019ssaved since your mother was a girl. If you ask forthem she\u2019ll let you have the whole stack. I know howyou love to read.\u201d     \u201cI do, Dad, but if the magazines are that old\u2014\u201d     Judy had stopped. She had seen her father\u2019s tiredeyes and had realized that a busy doctor needed avacation much more than a schoolgirl who had toolittle to do. He and Judy\u2019s mother usually went tothe beach hotel where they had honeymooned. Itwas a precious memory. Every summer Dr. Boltonand his wife relived it. And every summer Judywent to stay with her grandmother Smeed, whoscolded and fussed and tried to pretend she wasn\u2019tglad to have her.     \u201cYou here again?\u201d she had greeted her that summer,and Judy hadn\u2019t noticed her old eyes twinklingbehind her glasses. \u201cWhat do you propose to do withyourself this time?\u201d     \u201cRead,\u201d Judy had told her. \u201cMom and Dad sayyou have a whole stack of old magazines\u2014\u201d     \u201cIn the attic. Go up and look them over if youcan stand the heat.\u201d     Judy went, not to look over the old magazines somuch as to escape to a place where she could have agood cry. It was the summer before her fifteenthbirthday. In another year she would have outgrownher childish resentment of her parents\u2019 vacation orbe grown up enough to ask them to let her have avacation of her own. In another year she wouldbe summering among the beautiful Thousand Islandsand solving a mystery to be known as the      GhostParade     .     \u201cA whole parade of ghosts,\u201d Lois would be tellingher, \u201cand you solved everything.\u201d     But then she didn\u2019t even know Lois. She had noidea so many thrilling adventures awaited her. Thereseemed to be nothing\u2014nothing\u2014and so the tearscame and spilled over on one of the magazines. AsJudy wiped it away she noticed that it had fallenon a picture of a fountain.     \u201cA fountain with tears for water. How strange!\u201dshe remembered saying aloud.     Judy had never seen a real fountain. The thrill ofwalking up to the door of the palatial Farringdon-Pettmansion was still ahead of her. On the lawn afountain still caught and held rainbows like thoseshe was to see on her honeymoon at Niagara Falls.But all that was in the future. If anyone had toldthe freckled-faced, pigtailed girl that she would oneday marry Peter Dobbs, she would have laughed intheir faces.     \u201cThat tease!\u201d     For then she knew Peter only as an older boy whoused to tease her and call her carrot-top until one dayshe yelled back at him, \u201cCarrot-tops are green and soare you!\u201d     Peter was to win Judy\u2019s heart when he gave her akitten and suggested the name Blackberry for him.The kitten was now a dignified family cat. But thesummer Judy found the picture of a fountain andspilled tears on it she had no kitten. She had nothing,she confessed, not even a friend. It had helped topretend the fountain in the picture was filled withall the tears lonely girls like herself had ever cried.     \u201cBut that would make it enchanted!\u201d she had suddenlyexclaimed. \u201cIf I could find it I\u2019d wish\u2014\u201d     A step had sounded on the stairs. Judy rememberedit distinctly. She had turned to see her grandmother  and to hear her say in her usual abrupt fashion,\u201cEnchanted fountain, indeed! If you let peopleknow your wishes instead of muttering them toyourself, most of them aren\u2019t so impossible.\u201d     \u201cWere they?\u201d asked Lois.     She and Lorraine had listened to this much of whatJudy was telling them without interruption.     \u201cThat\u2019s the unsolved mystery,\u201d Judy replied.\u201cThere weren\u2019t any of them impossible.\u201d     And she went on to tell them how, the very nextday, her grandparents had taken her to a fountainexactly like the one in the picture. It was in the centerof a deep, circular pool with steps leading up to it.Beside the steps were smaller fountains with thewater spurting from the mouths of stone lions. Judyhad stared at them a moment and then climbed thesteps to the pool.     \u201cAm I dreaming?\u201d she remembered saying aloud.\u201cIs this beautiful fountain real?\u201d     A voice had answered, although she could see noone.     \u201cMake your wishes, Judy. Wish wisely. If youshed a tear in the fountain your wishes will surelycome true.\u201d     \u201cA tear?\u201d Judy had asked. \u201cHow can I shed atear when I\u2019m happy? This is a wonderful place.\u201d     \u201cShed a tear in the fountain and your wishes willsurely come true,\u201d the voice had repeated.     \u201cBut what is there to cry about?\u201d     \u201cYou found plenty to cry about back at yourgrandmother\u2019s house,\u201d the mysterious voice had remindedher. \u201cWeren\u2019t you crying on my picture upthere in the attic?\u201d     \u201cThen you\u2014you      are     the fountain!\u201d Judy rememberedexclaiming. \u201cBut a fountain doesn\u2019t speak. Itdoesn\u2019t have a voice.\u201d     \u201cWish wisely,\u201d the voice from the fountain hadsaid in a mysterious whisper.    <doc-sep>  id=chap02>  CHAPTER II   If Wishes Came True    \u201cDid you?\u201d Lois interrupted the story to ask excitedly.\u201cOh, Judy! Don\u2019t keep us in suspense anylonger. What did you wish?\u201d     \u201cPatience,\u201d Judy said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m comingto that.\u201d     First, she told her friends, she had to think of awise wish. There had been so much she wanted inthose early days before the flood. Dora Scott hadbeen her best friend in Roulsville, but she had movedaway.     \u201cYou see,\u201d she explained, \u201cI made the mistake ofhaving just one best friend. There wasn\u2019t anybodyin Dry Brook Hollow. I remember thinking of howlonely I was and how I wished for a friend or a sister,  and suddenly a tear splashed in the water. It madelittle ripples. I thought I had to wish quickly beforethey vanished, and so I began naming the things Iwanted as fast as I could. I\u2019m not sure they werewise wishes. They seem rather selfish to me, now. Iwasn\u2019t thinking of anybody but me, Judy Bolton,and what I wanted. It wasn\u2019t until after I began tothink of others that my wishes started to come true.\u201d     \u201cBut what were they?\u201d Lois insisted.     Lorraine seemed unusually quiet and thoughtful.Judy did not notice the fear in her eyes as she repliedairily, \u201cOh, didn\u2019t I tell you? I wished for lotsof friends and a sister, and I wished I could marry aG-man and solve a lot of mysteries and that\u2019s as faras I got when the ripples vanished. I thought thespell was broken and so I didn\u2019t wish for anythingmore.\u201d     \u201cWasn\u2019t there anything more you wanted?\u201d Loisasked.     \u201cOf course,\u201d replied Judy. \u201cThere were lots morethings. I wanted to go places, of course, and keeppets, and have a nice home, and\u2014\u201d     \u201cAnd your wishes all came true!\u201d     \u201cEvery one of them,\u201d Judy agreed, \u201ceven the oneabout the sister. You see, it wasn\u2019t a baby sister Iwanted. It was a sister near my own age. Thatseemed impossible at the time, but the future didhold a sister for me.\u201d     \u201cIt held one for me, too,\u201d Lois said, squeezingLorraine\u2019s hand under the table. \u201cDon\u2019t you thinksisters should tell each other their problems, Judy?\u201d     \u201cHoney and I always do,\u201d she replied \u201cbut thenit was different. I didn\u2019t know I would marry Peteror that he would become a G-man, and he didn\u2019tknow he had a sister. It is strange, isn\u2019t it? But thestrangest thing of all was the fountain itself.\u201d     \u201cWhy?\u201d asked Lorraine. \u201cDo you still think it wasenchanted?\u201d     Lois laughed at this, but Judy was serious as sheanswered, \u201cI was still little girl enough to think soat the time. I wandered around, growing verydrowsy. Then I found a hammock and climbed intoit. I must have gone to sleep, because I rememberwaking up and wondering if the voice in the fountainhad been a dream.\u201d     \u201cA hammock?\u201d Lois questioned. \u201cAre you sure itwasn\u2019t a flying carpet?\u201d     \u201cNo, it was a hammock all right,\u201d Judy assuredher, laughing. \u201cIt was hung between two trees in abeautiful garden all enclosed in rose trellises thickwith roses. Did I tell you it was June?\u201d     \u201cAll the year around?\u201d     Again Lois laughed. But Lorraine said abruptly,\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about rose gardens in June. It\u2019s a longway from June to December.\u201d     \u201cDo you mean a garden changes? I know,\u201d Judysaid, \u201cbut I think this one would be beautiful at anytime of the year. There were rhododendrons, too,and I don\u2019t know how many different kinds of evergreens.I explored the garden all around the fountain.\u201d     \u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d Lorraine urged her.     \u201cYes, yes. Go on,\u201d entreated Lois. \u201cI didn\u2019t dreamyou\u2019d kept anything that exciting a secret. Why didn\u2019tyou try to solve the mystery?\u201d     \u201cI think I would have tried,\u201d Judy admitted, \u201cifI had been older or more experienced. I really shouldhave investigated it more thoroughly and learned thesecret of the fountain. But after the ripples wentaway it didn\u2019t speak to me any more, and I didn\u2019treally think it had heard my wishes. I was still wishingfor a friend when I met you, Lois. It did seemimpossible for us to be friends at first, didn\u2019t it? Lorrainewas your friend.\u201d     \u201cI did make trouble for you,\u201d Lorraine remembered.\u201cIt was all because of my foolish jealousy.\u201d     \u201cIt was nothing compared to the trouble caused bythe Roulsville flood,\u201d declared Judy. \u201cAfter thatthings started happening so fast that I completelyforgot about the fountain. Honestly, Lois, I don\u2019tbelieve I thought about it again until after we movedto Farringdon and I walked up to your door andsaw the fountain on your lawn.\u201d     \u201cThe Farringdon-Pett puddle, I always called it,\u201dLois said with a giggle. \u201cI\u2019ve seen lots nicer fountains.\u201d     \u201cYou have?\u201d asked Judy. \u201cThen maybe you\u2019veseen the one I\u2019ve been telling you about. I think thepicture of it is still in the attic. Come on up and I\u2019llshow you.\u201d     Lois and Lorraine had finished their dessert whileJudy was telling them the story of the fountain.Somehow, she wasn\u2019t hungry for hers. She hadtasted it too often while she was making it.     \u201cI\u2019ll leave it for Blackberry,\u201d she decided.     Lois watched in amusement as the cat lapped upthe chocolate pudding after Judy had mixed it generouslywith cream.     \u201cSometimes,\u201d Judy said fondly, \u201cBlackberry thinkshe\u2019s a person. He eats everything we eat, includinglettuce. Do you mind if he comes with us, Lorraine?He wants to explore the attic, too.\u201d     \u201cHe\u2019ll remember he\u2019s a cat fast enough if thereare any mice up there,\u201d Lois said with a giggle.     Leaving the table, they all started upstairs withthe cat bounding ahead of them. In modernizing hergrandparents\u2019 house to suit her own and Peter\u2019stastes, Judy had seen to it that the old stair door wasremoved. But there was still a door closing off thenarrower stairs that led to the attic. Blackberryreached it first and yowled for Judy to open it.     \u201cHe can read my mind. He always knows whereI\u2019m going,\u201d Judy said as the door creaked open andthe cat shot through it. A moment later a weird rollingnoise came from the floor above.     \u201cCome on. There\u2019s nothing up here to be afraidof,\u201d Judy urged her friends.     \u201cMaybe not, but I\u2019m beginning to get the shivers,\u201dconfessed Lois as she followed Judy to the sewingroom at the top of the last flight of stairs.     \u201cSo am I,\u201d Lorraine admitted. \u201cI\u2019m not superstitiousabout black cats, but they are creepy. DoesBlackberry have to roll spools across the floor?\u201d     \u201cNow he thinks he\u2019s a kitten,\u201d laughed Judy.Pausing at still another door that led to the darkerpart of the attic, she turned and said mysteriously,\u201cUp here we can all turn back the clock. Does anybodycare to explore the past?\u201d     The exploration began enthusiastically with Judyrelating still more of what she remembered aboutthe fountain.     \u201cWhen I told Grandma about it she laughed andsaid I must have dreamed it. She said if wishes cametrue that easily she\u2019d be living in a castle. But wouldshe?\u201d Judy wondered. \u201cWhen I first remember thishouse she was still burning kerosene lamps like thoseyou see on that high shelf by the window. I thinkshe and Grandpa like the way they lived withoutany modern conveniences or anything.\u201d     \u201cI think so, too,\u201d Lois agreed, looking around theold attic with a shiver. \u201cIt is strange they both diedthe same winter, isn\u2019t it?\u201d     \u201cMaybe they wanted it that way. Maybe theywished neither of them would outlive the other. Ifthey did wish in the fountain,\u201d Judy went on morethoughtfully, \u201cI\u2019m sure that was one of their wishes.Another could have been to keep the good old days,as Grandma used to call them. That one came truein a way. They did manage to keep a little of thepast when they kept all these old things. That\u2019s whatI meant about turning back the clock.\u201d     \u201cIf wishes came true I\u2019d like to turn it back a littlemyself,\u201d Lorraine began. \u201cIt would be nice if thingswere the way they used to be when I trustedArthur\u2014\u201d     \u201cDon\u2019t you trust him now?\u201d Judy asked.     Afterwards she was sorry for the interruption. Loisand Judy both questioned Lorraine, but that was allshe would say. Judy wondered, as they searchedthrough the old magazines, what was wrong. Lorrainewas of a jealous disposition. Was the green-eyedmonster coming between her and her handsome husband,Arthur Farringdon-Pett? Until now they hadseemed blissfully happy. But there was no happinessin Lorraine\u2019s face as she gazed at a picture of one ofthe fountains and then said in a tight little voice, \u201cItis. It\u2019s the very same one.\u201d     \u201cBut that\u2019s the picture I\u2019ve been searching for!\u201dJudy said eagerly. \u201cDo you know where it is?\u201d     \u201cI can\u2019t be sure. But if it ever was enchanted, I\u2019msure it isn\u2019t now. Let\u2019s go,\u201d Lorraine said suddenlyto Lois. Judy knew she was suggesting a fast trip home.But, apparently, Lois did not understand it that way.If she did, she pretended not to.     \u201cWhere?\u201d she asked. \u201cTo the fountain? I\u2019d loveto, wouldn\u2019t you, Judy?\u201d     \u201cI certainly would,\u201d Judy replied enthusiastically.\u201cDo you recognize it, too?\u201d     \u201cI think so,\u201d Lois answered after studying a littlemore closely the picture they had found. \u201cIt lookslike the fountain on the Brandt estate.\u201d     \u201cThe department store Brandts?\u201d Judy questioned.\u201cThen my grandparents must have driven old Fannyall the way to Farringdon.\u201d     \u201cNot quite all the way,\u201d Lorraine objected. \u201cTheBrandts own that stretch of woods just before youcome into the city. You\u2019ve passed it lots of times.\u201d     \u201cOf course,\u201d agreed Judy. She put the magazineback in its place under the eaves and turned eagerlyto her friends. \u201cI do remember a road turning offinto the woods and going on uphill,\u201d she told them.\u201cI never thought it led to a house, though. Thereisn\u2019t even a gate. Could that be the road my grandparentstook?\u201d     \u201cWhy don\u2019t we take it ourselves and find out?\u201dLois suggested.    <doc-sep>  id=chap03>  CHAPTER III   A Strange Encounter    Lorraine was not too enthusiastic about the proposedtrip to the Brandt estate. Finally she agreed toit under one condition. They were not to drive allthe way to the house which, she said, was just overthe hilltop. They were to park the car where noone would see it and follow the path to the fountain.     \u201cBut suppose we can\u2019t find the path?\u201d asked Judy.     \u201cYou\u2019ll remember it, won\u2019t you?\u201d     Judy thought she would, but she wasn\u2019t too sure.She and Lois both argued that it would be better toinquire at the house. Lois knew Helen Brandt slightly.     \u201cShe\u2019d be glad to show us around. This way itlooks as if we\u2019re planning a crime,\u201d Lois said as theystarted off in the blue car she was driving.     It was a neat little car, not too conspicuous, andeasy to park in out-of-the-way places. Judy laughedand said if they did find the fountain she thoughtshe\u2019d wish for one exactly like it.     \u201cWell, you know what your grandmother saidabout wishes, don\u2019t you?\u201d Lorraine asked. \u201cIf youlet people know about them instead of mutteringthem to yourself most of them aren\u2019t so impossible.\u201d     \u201cQuite true,\u201d Judy agreed. \u201cI\u2019ll let Peter knowabout this one. He\u2019s my Santa Claus, and it will soonbe Christmas. Maybe I should have worn the furcoat he gave me last year.\u201d     \u201cYour reversible\u2019s better in case it rains. It\u2019s toowarm for snow. We picked a perfect day for thistrip,\u201d Lois continued, guiding the car around curvesas it climbed the steep hill beyond Dry Brook Hollow.     The trip was a short one. In twenty minutes theyhad covered the distance that had seemed such along way to Judy when she was riding in her grandfather\u2019swagon.     \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it,\u201d she said, \u201cand I\u2019vejust about figured out how it happened. I didn\u2019tthink my grandparents knew the Brandts well enoughto pay them a visit, though. We must have lookedqueer driving up to a beautiful estate in Grandpa\u2019sold farm wagon. I do remember that Grandma had  some hooked rugs to deliver. But that still doesn\u2019texplain what happened afterwards. When I wokeup in the hammock I was alone in the garden. Horse,wagon, grandparents\u2014all had disappeared.\u201d     \u201cHow could they?\u201d asked Lois.     \u201cAnyway,\u201d Lorraine began, \u201cyou had a chance tosee how beautiful everything was before\u2014\u201d     Again she broke off as if there were somethingshe wanted to tell but didn\u2019t quite dare.     \u201cBefore what?\u201d questioned Judy.     \u201cOh, nothing. Forget I said anything about it. Youwere telling us how you woke up in the hammock,but you never did explain how you got back home,\u201dLorraine reminded her.     \u201cDidn\u2019t I?\u201d asked Judy. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten a lot of it,but it\u2019s beginning to come back now. I do rememberdriving home along this road. You see, I thought mygrandparents had left me in the garden for a surpriseand would return for me. I told you I was all alone.There wasn\u2019t a house in sight.\u201d     \u201cThe Brandt house is just over the top of this nexthill,\u201d Lois put in.     \u201cI know. You told me that. Now I know why Icouldn\u2019t see it. All I could see was a windowless oldtower and a path leading in that direction. Naturally,I followed it. There\u2019s something about a path inthe woods that always tempts me.\u201d     \u201cWe know that, Judy. Honey told us all aboutyour latest mystery. You followed a trail or something.\u201d     \u201cWell, this trail led out of the rose garden wherethe hammock was and then through an archway,\u201dJudy continued. \u201cAll sorts of little cupids and gnomespeered out at me from unexpected places. I wasactually scared by the time I reached the old tower.There wasn\u2019t time to explore it. Just then I heardthe rumble of my grandfather\u2019s wagon and knew hewas driving off without me.\u201d     \u201cHe was!\u201d Judy\u2019s friends both chorused in surprise,and Lois asked, \u201cWhy would he do a thing likethat?\u201d     \u201cI think now it was just to tease me. He did stopand wait for me after a while,\u201d Judy remembered.\u201cThe rugs were gone. Grandma must have deliveredthem, but I didn\u2019t ask where. If she made them forMrs. Brandt they may still be there.\u201d     \u201cI wouldn\u2019t depend on it,\u201d Lorraine said as theyturned up the narrow road to the Brandt estate.     \u201cWatch out!\u201d Judy suddenly exclaimed. \u201cThere\u2019sanother car coming.\u201d     As Lois swerved to avoid the oncoming car, Lorraineducked her head. She kept herself hidden behindJudy until the car had passed. The man drivingit was a stranger to Judy, but she would rememberhis hypnotic, dark eyes and swarthy complexion for along time. The soft brown hat he was wearing coveredmost of his hair.     \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you two?\u201d asked Loiswhen the car had passed. \u201cAren\u2019t you a little old forplaying hide and seek?\u201d     \u201cI wasn\u2019t\u2014playing. Let\u2019s not go up there,\u201d Lorrainebegged. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Brandts live thereany more.\u201d     \u201cMaybe not, but we can pretend we think they do,can\u2019t we?\u201d Judy replied a little uncertainly.     She was beginning to suspect that Lorraine knewmore about the Brandt estate than she was telling.     Lois kept on driving along the narrow, gravellyroad. Soon there were more evergreens and a hedgeof rhododendrons to be seen. They looked verygreen next to the leafless trees in the woods beyond.The sky was gray with white clouds being drivenacross it by the wind.     \u201cThere\u2019s the tower!\u201d Lorraine exclaimed. \u201cI cansee it over to the left. It looks like something out ofGrimm\u2019s Fairy Tales, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d     \u201cIt looks grim all right,\u201d agreed Judy. \u201cI wonderwhat it is.\u201d     \u201cI suppose it\u2019s nothing but an old water tower. Itwould be fun to explore it, though,\u201d Lois said. \u201cButif there are new people living here they\u2019ll never giveus permission.\u201d     \u201cWe might explore it without permission,\u201d Judysuggested daringly. \u201cCome on!\u201d she urged her friendsas Lois parked the car in a cleared place beside theroad. \u201cWho\u2019s going to stop us? And who wants toexplore a gloomy old tower, anyway? Let\u2019s look forthe fountain.\u201d     \u201cDo you think we should?\u201d Lorraine asked. \u201cItwon\u2019t be enchanted. I told you\u2014\u201d     \u201cYou told us very little,\u201d Lois reminded her. \u201cIfyou know anything about the people who live herenow, I think you ought to let us know. Otherwise,I\u2019m afraid we won\u2019t be very welcome.\u201d     \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll welcome us, anyway. I doknow who they are,\u201d Lorraine admitted. \u201cYou rememberRoger Banning from school, don\u2019t you?I\u2019ve seen him around here. His family must haveacquired sudden wealth, or else he\u2019s just working onthe estate.\u201d     \u201cThen you\u2019ve been here lately? Why didn\u2019t youtell me?\u201d asked Lois. \u201cWe always used to go placestogether.\u201d     \u201cIt wasn\u2019t important,\u201d Lorraine replied evasively.\u201cI was just out for a drive.\u201d     \u201cYou plutocrats!\u201d laughed Judy. \u201cEach with acar of your own. You\u2019re not interested in RogerBanning, are you, Lois? I\u2019m sure you can do betterthan that. I did know him slightly, but not fromschool. The boys and girls were separated and wentto different high schools by the time we moved to  Farringdon. I remember his pal, Dick Hartwell, alot better. He was in our young people\u2019s group atchurch.\u201d     \u201cSh!\u201d Lois cautioned her. \u201cNice people no longermention Dick Hartwell\u2019s name. He\u2019s doing time.\u201d     \u201cFor what?\u201d asked Judy.     Like Peter, her FBI husband, she preferred factsto gossip.     \u201cForgery, I guess. He stole some checkbooks fromhis father\u2019s desk and forged the names of a lot of importantbusiness people. I think he forged some legaldocuments, too. Anyway, he went to the Federal Penitentiary.It was all in the papers,\u201d Lorraine told her.     Now Judy did remember. It was something shewould have preferred to forget. She liked to thinkshe was a good judge of character, and she had takenDick Hartwell for a quiet, refined boy who wouldnever stoop to crime.     \u201cI don\u2019t see what all this has to do with the fountain,\u201dLois said impatiently. \u201cAre we going to lookfor it, or aren\u2019t we?\u201d     \u201cOf course we are. That\u2019s what we came for. Ijust like to know what a tiger looks like before hesprings at me,\u201d Judy explained.     \u201cYou seem to think there\u2019s danger in this expeditionof ours, don\u2019t you?\u201d asked Lorraine.     \u201cI don\u2019t know what to think. You\u2019re the one whoseems to know the answers, but you\u2019re not telling.  Hiding your face back there gave you away. You\u2019veseen that character who drove down this road and,for some reason, you were afraid he would see you.Why, Lorraine? Why didn\u2019t you want to be recognized?\u201d     Lorraine hesitated a moment and then repliedevasively, \u201cPeople don\u2019t generally enter privateestates without an invitation. That\u2019s all.\u201d     \u201cI\u2019d better turn the car around,\u201d Lois decided,\u201cin case we have to leave in a hurry. I don\u2019t expectwe\u2019ll encounter any tigers, but we may be accusedof trespassing.\u201d     \u201cI\u2019m sure we will be,\u201d announced Judy as twodark-coated figures strode down the road towardthem. \u201cYou drove right by a  NO TRESPASSING  sign,and this isn\u2019t a welcoming committee coming tomeet us!\u201d   "

        "Query": "What role do tears play in The Haunted Fountain?",
        "Summary_1": "Tears are the inciting event that connect Judy with the photo of the fountain as a tear rolls off her cheek and onto the photo as she thinks of her loneliness in her grandparents attic. Expressing her longing for friendship and a sister aloud sparks her grandmother to take her along to the fountain itself. When visiting the fountain, tears again become important because the fountain asks for a tear to be shed into it before wishes can be made.\nThe physical description of tears rolling onto a photograph or causing small ripples in the fountain that travel and dissipate are important visualizations that draw the reader into Judy\u2019s story, and make her character feel real. \n\n",
        "Summary_2": "Tears are first brought up when Judy is thinking about her summers that she spent in the attic at her grandmother's house, where she said she was reading but really needed some space to herself to cry. Her tears fell on a magazine that had a picture of a fountain, and she found it amusing that the fountain had tears as its source of water. She pretended that it was full of tears of many young girls, and her grandmother overheard her pondering this possible enchanted fountain, so they went to see a similar fountain the next day.  She cried into the fountain and her dreams eventually came true, changing the course of her life in many ways. ",
        "Summary_3": "Judy\u2019s tears over her loneliness of losing her best friend and not going on vacation with her parents provide the catalyst for significant changes in her life. When her tears fall on the picture of the fountain, and her grandmother overhears her comment about the enchanted fountain and her wishes, it marks the beginning of life-changing events. Her grandparents take her to see the fountain on the Brandt estate, and there, she hears the voice telling her if she sheds a tear in the fountain, her wishes will come true. As she watches the ripples in the water caused by her tear, Judy quickly comes up with several wishes that ultimately come true; even the wish for a sister that seemingly would be impossible to fill comes true when she gains a sister-in-law. Her story about the fountain and her tears are the impetus for Lois\u2019s push to visit the Brandt estate to see the fountain and for the women being caught trespassing on the property.",
        "Summary_4": "Judy spills tears while she is first looking at the photograph of the fountain in a magazine. Judy is crying because her parents have left her with her grandmother Smeed, whom she finds a complete bore. The tears spill onto the magazine and seem to bring the fountain to life with the tears of all the lonely girls like Judy. Seeing the fountain in this way helps Judy make a connection with the fountain and draws her toward finding it the first time. ",
        "Article": " id=chap01>  CHAPTER I   An Unsolved Mystery    \u201cTell Judy about it,\u201d begged Lois. \u201cPlease, Lorraine,it can\u2019t be as bad as it appears. There isn\u2019tanything that Judy can\u2019t solve.\u201d     Lorraine tilted her head disdainfully. \u201cWe\u2019re sistersnow. We\u2019re both Farringdon-Petts and should beloyal to each other. But you always did take Judy\u2019spart. She was the one who nearly spoiled our doublewedding trying to solve a mystery. I don\u2019t believeshe\u2019d understand\u2014understand any better than I do.Everyone has problems, and I\u2019m sure Judy is noexception.\u201d     \u201cYou\u2019re right, Lorraine,\u201d announced Judy, comingin to serve dessert to the two friends she had invitedfor lunch at Peter\u2019s suggestion. \u201cI do haveproblems, and there are plenty of mysteries I can\u2019tsolve.\u201d     \u201cName one,\u201d charged Lois. \u201cJust mention onesingle spooky thing you couldn\u2019t explain, and I\u2019llbelieve you. I\u2019ve seen you in action, Judy Bolton\u2014\u201d     \u201cJudy Dobbs, remember?\u201d     \u201cWell, you were Judy Bolton when you solvedall those mysteries. I met you when the wholevalley below the big Roulsville dam was threatenedby flood and you solved that\u2014\u201d     \u201cThat,\u201d declared Judy, \u201cwas my brother Horace,not me. He was the hero without even meaning tobe. He was the one who rode through town andwarned people that the flood was coming. I was offchasing a shadow.\u201d     \u201cA vanishing shadow,\u201d Lois said with a sigh.\u201cWhat you did wasn\u2019t easy, Judy.\u201d     \u201cIt didn\u2019t need to be as hard as it was,\u201d Judy confessed.\u201cI know now that keeping that promise notto talk about the dam was a great big mistake andcould have cost lives. I should have told Arthur.\u201d     \u201cPlease,\u201d Lorraine said, a pained expression cloudingher pretty face, \u201clet\u2019s not talk about him now.\u201d     \u201cVery well,\u201d Judy agreed. \u201cWhat shall we talkabout?\u201d     \u201cYou,\u201d Lois said, \u201cand all the mysteries you\u2019vesolved. Maybe you were mistaken about a thing ortwo before the flood, but what about the haunted  house you moved into? You were the one whotracked down the ghosts in the attic and the cellarand goodness knows where all. You\u2019ve been chasingghosts ever since I met you, and not one of them didyou fail to explain in some sensible, logical fashion.\u201d     \u201cBefore I met you,\u201d Judy said, thinking back,\u201cthere were plenty of them I couldn\u2019t explain. Therewas one I used to call the spirit of the fountain, butwhat she was or how she spoke to me is more thanI know. If my grandparents knew, they weren\u2019t telling.And now they\u2019re both dead and I can\u2019t ask them.They left me a lot of unsolved mysteries along withthis house. Maybe I\u2019ll find the answers to some ofthem when I finish sorting Grandma\u2019s things. They\u2019restored in one end of the attic.\u201d     \u201cAnother haunted attic? How thrilling!\u201d exclaimedLois. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have another ghost party andshow up the spooks?\u201d     \u201cI didn\u2019t say the attic was haunted.\u201d     Judy was almost sorry she had mentioned it. Shewasn\u2019t in the mood for digging up old mysteries,but Lois and Lorraine insisted. It all began, she finallytold them, the summer before they met. Horacehad just started working on the paper. Judy rememberedthat it was Lorraine\u2019s father, Richard ThorntonLee, who gave him his job with the      FarringdonDaily Herald     . He had turned in some interestingchurch news, convincing Mr. Lee that he had in him  the makings of a good reporter. And so it was thathe spent the summer Judy was remembering in Farringdonwhere the Farringdon-Petts had their turretedmansion, while she had to suffer the heat andloneliness of Dry Brook Hollow.     Her thoughts were what had made it so hard, sheconfessed now as she reviewed everything that hadhappened. She just couldn\u2019t help resenting the factthat her parents left her every summer while theywent off on a vacation by themselves. What did theythink she would do?     \u201cYou\u2019ll have plenty to read,\u201d her father had toldher. \u201cI bought you six new books in that mysteryseries you like. When they\u2019re finished there areplenty of short stories around. Your grandmothernever throws anything away. She has magazines she\u2019ssaved since your mother was a girl. If you ask forthem she\u2019ll let you have the whole stack. I know howyou love to read.\u201d     \u201cI do, Dad, but if the magazines are that old\u2014\u201d     Judy had stopped. She had seen her father\u2019s tiredeyes and had realized that a busy doctor needed avacation much more than a schoolgirl who had toolittle to do. He and Judy\u2019s mother usually went tothe beach hotel where they had honeymooned. Itwas a precious memory. Every summer Dr. Boltonand his wife relived it. And every summer Judywent to stay with her grandmother Smeed, whoscolded and fussed and tried to pretend she wasn\u2019tglad to have her.     \u201cYou here again?\u201d she had greeted her that summer,and Judy hadn\u2019t noticed her old eyes twinklingbehind her glasses. \u201cWhat do you propose to do withyourself this time?\u201d     \u201cRead,\u201d Judy had told her. \u201cMom and Dad sayyou have a whole stack of old magazines\u2014\u201d     \u201cIn the attic. Go up and look them over if youcan stand the heat.\u201d     Judy went, not to look over the old magazines somuch as to escape to a place where she could have agood cry. It was the summer before her fifteenthbirthday. In another year she would have outgrownher childish resentment of her parents\u2019 vacation orbe grown up enough to ask them to let her have avacation of her own. In another year she wouldbe summering among the beautiful Thousand Islandsand solving a mystery to be known as the      GhostParade     .     \u201cA whole parade of ghosts,\u201d Lois would be tellingher, \u201cand you solved everything.\u201d     But then she didn\u2019t even know Lois. She had noidea so many thrilling adventures awaited her. Thereseemed to be nothing\u2014nothing\u2014and so the tearscame and spilled over on one of the magazines. AsJudy wiped it away she noticed that it had fallenon a picture of a fountain.     \u201cA fountain with tears for water. How strange!\u201dshe remembered saying aloud.     Judy had never seen a real fountain. The thrill ofwalking up to the door of the palatial Farringdon-Pettmansion was still ahead of her. On the lawn afountain still caught and held rainbows like thoseshe was to see on her honeymoon at Niagara Falls.But all that was in the future. If anyone had toldthe freckled-faced, pigtailed girl that she would oneday marry Peter Dobbs, she would have laughed intheir faces.     \u201cThat tease!\u201d     For then she knew Peter only as an older boy whoused to tease her and call her carrot-top until one dayshe yelled back at him, \u201cCarrot-tops are green and soare you!\u201d     Peter was to win Judy\u2019s heart when he gave her akitten and suggested the name Blackberry for him.The kitten was now a dignified family cat. But thesummer Judy found the picture of a fountain andspilled tears on it she had no kitten. She had nothing,she confessed, not even a friend. It had helped topretend the fountain in the picture was filled withall the tears lonely girls like herself had ever cried.     \u201cBut that would make it enchanted!\u201d she had suddenlyexclaimed. \u201cIf I could find it I\u2019d wish\u2014\u201d     A step had sounded on the stairs. Judy rememberedit distinctly. She had turned to see her grandmother  and to hear her say in her usual abrupt fashion,\u201cEnchanted fountain, indeed! If you let peopleknow your wishes instead of muttering them toyourself, most of them aren\u2019t so impossible.\u201d     \u201cWere they?\u201d asked Lois.     She and Lorraine had listened to this much of whatJudy was telling them without interruption.     \u201cThat\u2019s the unsolved mystery,\u201d Judy replied.\u201cThere weren\u2019t any of them impossible.\u201d     And she went on to tell them how, the very nextday, her grandparents had taken her to a fountainexactly like the one in the picture. It was in the centerof a deep, circular pool with steps leading up to it.Beside the steps were smaller fountains with thewater spurting from the mouths of stone lions. Judyhad stared at them a moment and then climbed thesteps to the pool.     \u201cAm I dreaming?\u201d she remembered saying aloud.\u201cIs this beautiful fountain real?\u201d     A voice had answered, although she could see noone.     \u201cMake your wishes, Judy. Wish wisely. If youshed a tear in the fountain your wishes will surelycome true.\u201d     \u201cA tear?\u201d Judy had asked. \u201cHow can I shed atear when I\u2019m happy? This is a wonderful place.\u201d     \u201cShed a tear in the fountain and your wishes willsurely come true,\u201d the voice had repeated.     \u201cBut what is there to cry about?\u201d     \u201cYou found plenty to cry about back at yourgrandmother\u2019s house,\u201d the mysterious voice had remindedher. \u201cWeren\u2019t you crying on my picture upthere in the attic?\u201d     \u201cThen you\u2014you      are     the fountain!\u201d Judy rememberedexclaiming. \u201cBut a fountain doesn\u2019t speak. Itdoesn\u2019t have a voice.\u201d     \u201cWish wisely,\u201d the voice from the fountain hadsaid in a mysterious whisper.    <doc-sep>    The Haunted Fountain    <doc-sep>  id=chap02>  CHAPTER II   If Wishes Came True    \u201cDid you?\u201d Lois interrupted the story to ask excitedly.\u201cOh, Judy! Don\u2019t keep us in suspense anylonger. What did you wish?\u201d     \u201cPatience,\u201d Judy said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m comingto that.\u201d     First, she told her friends, she had to think of awise wish. There had been so much she wanted inthose early days before the flood. Dora Scott hadbeen her best friend in Roulsville, but she had movedaway.     \u201cYou see,\u201d she explained, \u201cI made the mistake ofhaving just one best friend. There wasn\u2019t anybodyin Dry Brook Hollow. I remember thinking of howlonely I was and how I wished for a friend or a sister,  and suddenly a tear splashed in the water. It madelittle ripples. I thought I had to wish quickly beforethey vanished, and so I began naming the things Iwanted as fast as I could. I\u2019m not sure they werewise wishes. They seem rather selfish to me, now. Iwasn\u2019t thinking of anybody but me, Judy Bolton,and what I wanted. It wasn\u2019t until after I began tothink of others that my wishes started to come true.\u201d     \u201cBut what were they?\u201d Lois insisted.     Lorraine seemed unusually quiet and thoughtful.Judy did not notice the fear in her eyes as she repliedairily, \u201cOh, didn\u2019t I tell you? I wished for lotsof friends and a sister, and I wished I could marry aG-man and solve a lot of mysteries and that\u2019s as faras I got when the ripples vanished. I thought thespell was broken and so I didn\u2019t wish for anythingmore.\u201d     \u201cWasn\u2019t there anything more you wanted?\u201d Loisasked.     \u201cOf course,\u201d replied Judy. \u201cThere were lots morethings. I wanted to go places, of course, and keeppets, and have a nice home, and\u2014\u201d     \u201cAnd your wishes all came true!\u201d     \u201cEvery one of them,\u201d Judy agreed, \u201ceven the oneabout the sister. You see, it wasn\u2019t a baby sister Iwanted. It was a sister near my own age. Thatseemed impossible at the time, but the future didhold a sister for me.\u201d     \u201cIt held one for me, too,\u201d Lois said, squeezingLorraine\u2019s hand under the table. \u201cDon\u2019t you thinksisters should tell each other their problems, Judy?\u201d     \u201cHoney and I always do,\u201d she replied \u201cbut thenit was different. I didn\u2019t know I would marry Peteror that he would become a G-man, and he didn\u2019tknow he had a sister. It is strange, isn\u2019t it? But thestrangest thing of all was the fountain itself.\u201d     \u201cWhy?\u201d asked Lorraine. \u201cDo you still think it wasenchanted?\u201d     Lois laughed at this, but Judy was serious as sheanswered, \u201cI was still little girl enough to think soat the time. I wandered around, growing verydrowsy. Then I found a hammock and climbed intoit. I must have gone to sleep, because I rememberwaking up and wondering if the voice in the fountainhad been a dream.\u201d     \u201cA hammock?\u201d Lois questioned. \u201cAre you sure itwasn\u2019t a flying carpet?\u201d     \u201cNo, it was a hammock all right,\u201d Judy assuredher, laughing. \u201cIt was hung between two trees in abeautiful garden all enclosed in rose trellises thickwith roses. Did I tell you it was June?\u201d     \u201cAll the year around?\u201d     Again Lois laughed. But Lorraine said abruptly,\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about rose gardens in June. It\u2019s a longway from June to December.\u201d     \u201cDo you mean a garden changes? I know,\u201d Judysaid, \u201cbut I think this one would be beautiful at anytime of the year. There were rhododendrons, too,and I don\u2019t know how many different kinds of evergreens.I explored the garden all around the fountain.\u201d     \u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d Lorraine urged her.     \u201cYes, yes. Go on,\u201d entreated Lois. \u201cI didn\u2019t dreamyou\u2019d kept anything that exciting a secret. Why didn\u2019tyou try to solve the mystery?\u201d     \u201cI think I would have tried,\u201d Judy admitted, \u201cifI had been older or more experienced. I really shouldhave investigated it more thoroughly and learned thesecret of the fountain. But after the ripples wentaway it didn\u2019t speak to me any more, and I didn\u2019treally think it had heard my wishes. I was still wishingfor a friend when I met you, Lois. It did seemimpossible for us to be friends at first, didn\u2019t it? Lorrainewas your friend.\u201d     \u201cI did make trouble for you,\u201d Lorraine remembered.\u201cIt was all because of my foolish jealousy.\u201d     \u201cIt was nothing compared to the trouble caused bythe Roulsville flood,\u201d declared Judy. \u201cAfter thatthings started happening so fast that I completelyforgot about the fountain. Honestly, Lois, I don\u2019tbelieve I thought about it again until after we movedto Farringdon and I walked up to your door andsaw the fountain on your lawn.\u201d     \u201cThe Farringdon-Pett puddle, I always called it,\u201dLois said with a giggle. \u201cI\u2019ve seen lots nicer fountains.\u201d     \u201cYou have?\u201d asked Judy. \u201cThen maybe you\u2019veseen the one I\u2019ve been telling you about. I think thepicture of it is still in the attic. Come on up and I\u2019llshow you.\u201d     Lois and Lorraine had finished their dessert whileJudy was telling them the story of the fountain.Somehow, she wasn\u2019t hungry for hers. She hadtasted it too often while she was making it.     \u201cI\u2019ll leave it for Blackberry,\u201d she decided.     Lois watched in amusement as the cat lapped upthe chocolate pudding after Judy had mixed it generouslywith cream.     \u201cSometimes,\u201d Judy said fondly, \u201cBlackberry thinkshe\u2019s a person. He eats everything we eat, includinglettuce. Do you mind if he comes with us, Lorraine?He wants to explore the attic, too.\u201d     \u201cHe\u2019ll remember he\u2019s a cat fast enough if thereare any mice up there,\u201d Lois said with a giggle.     Leaving the table, they all started upstairs withthe cat bounding ahead of them. In modernizing hergrandparents\u2019 house to suit her own and Peter\u2019stastes, Judy had seen to it that the old stair door wasremoved. But there was still a door closing off thenarrower stairs that led to the attic. Blackberryreached it first and yowled for Judy to open it.     \u201cHe can read my mind. He always knows whereI\u2019m going,\u201d Judy said as the door creaked open andthe cat shot through it. A moment later a weird rollingnoise came from the floor above.     \u201cCome on. There\u2019s nothing up here to be afraidof,\u201d Judy urged her friends.     \u201cMaybe not, but I\u2019m beginning to get the shivers,\u201dconfessed Lois as she followed Judy to the sewingroom at the top of the last flight of stairs.     \u201cSo am I,\u201d Lorraine admitted. \u201cI\u2019m not superstitiousabout black cats, but they are creepy. DoesBlackberry have to roll spools across the floor?\u201d     \u201cNow he thinks he\u2019s a kitten,\u201d laughed Judy.Pausing at still another door that led to the darkerpart of the attic, she turned and said mysteriously,\u201cUp here we can all turn back the clock. Does anybodycare to explore the past?\u201d     The exploration began enthusiastically with Judyrelating still more of what she remembered aboutthe fountain.     \u201cWhen I told Grandma about it she laughed andsaid I must have dreamed it. She said if wishes cametrue that easily she\u2019d be living in a castle. But wouldshe?\u201d Judy wondered. \u201cWhen I first remember thishouse she was still burning kerosene lamps like thoseyou see on that high shelf by the window. I thinkshe and Grandpa like the way they lived withoutany modern conveniences or anything.\u201d     \u201cI think so, too,\u201d Lois agreed, looking around theold attic with a shiver. \u201cIt is strange they both diedthe same winter, isn\u2019t it?\u201d     \u201cMaybe they wanted it that way. Maybe theywished neither of them would outlive the other. Ifthey did wish in the fountain,\u201d Judy went on morethoughtfully, \u201cI\u2019m sure that was one of their wishes.Another could have been to keep the good old days,as Grandma used to call them. That one came truein a way. They did manage to keep a little of thepast when they kept all these old things. That\u2019s whatI meant about turning back the clock.\u201d     \u201cIf wishes came true I\u2019d like to turn it back a littlemyself,\u201d Lorraine began. \u201cIt would be nice if thingswere the way they used to be when I trustedArthur\u2014\u201d     \u201cDon\u2019t you trust him now?\u201d Judy asked.     Afterwards she was sorry for the interruption. Loisand Judy both questioned Lorraine, but that was allshe would say. Judy wondered, as they searchedthrough the old magazines, what was wrong. Lorrainewas of a jealous disposition. Was the green-eyedmonster coming between her and her handsome husband,Arthur Farringdon-Pett? Until now they hadseemed blissfully happy. But there was no happinessin Lorraine\u2019s face as she gazed at a picture of one ofthe fountains and then said in a tight little voice, \u201cItis. It\u2019s the very same one.\u201d     \u201cBut that\u2019s the picture I\u2019ve been searching for!\u201dJudy said eagerly. \u201cDo you know where it is?\u201d     \u201cI can\u2019t be sure. But if it ever was enchanted, I\u2019msure it isn\u2019t now. Let\u2019s go,\u201d Lorraine said suddenlyto Lois. Judy knew she was suggesting a fast trip home.But, apparently, Lois did not understand it that way.If she did, she pretended not to.     \u201cWhere?\u201d she asked. \u201cTo the fountain? I\u2019d loveto, wouldn\u2019t you, Judy?\u201d     \u201cI certainly would,\u201d Judy replied enthusiastically.\u201cDo you recognize it, too?\u201d     \u201cI think so,\u201d Lois answered after studying a littlemore closely the picture they had found. \u201cIt lookslike the fountain on the Brandt estate.\u201d     \u201cThe department store Brandts?\u201d Judy questioned.\u201cThen my grandparents must have driven old Fannyall the way to Farringdon.\u201d     \u201cNot quite all the way,\u201d Lorraine objected. \u201cTheBrandts own that stretch of woods just before youcome into the city. You\u2019ve passed it lots of times.\u201d     \u201cOf course,\u201d agreed Judy. She put the magazineback in its place under the eaves and turned eagerlyto her friends. \u201cI do remember a road turning offinto the woods and going on uphill,\u201d she told them.\u201cI never thought it led to a house, though. Thereisn\u2019t even a gate. Could that be the road my grandparentstook?\u201d     \u201cWhy don\u2019t we take it ourselves and find out?\u201dLois suggested.   "

        "Query": "How would you describe the dynamic between Lois and Lorraine in The Haunted Fountain?",
        "Summary_1": "Lois and Lorraine became sisters by marriage as they both married into the Farringdon-Petts family in a double-wedding event. Judy (a sister to Lois by way of her marrying Lois\u2019 brother, Peter Dobbs), nearly ruined the double-wedding trying to solve a mystery.\nLois is perhaps more forgiving to Judy, and Lorraine goes as far as to describe that Lois has always taken Judy\u2019s side. Both Lois and Lorraine acknowledge that Judy is great at solving mysteries and try to lift her up when she is down on herself about the few that she couldn\u2019t solve when they come over for lunch. \nLorraine becomes evasive and hides from view when the three of them go to the fountain together, concealing information about the new owners of the Brandt estate that Lois and Judy eventually get out of her by probing questions. This event shows Lois\u2019 willingness to challenge Lorraine, and perhaps also supporting \u201cJudy\u2019s side\u201d as Lois calls her out on earlier in the story.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Lois and Lorraine are sisters-in-law who want to look out for one another. Lois is excitable and very giggly, whereas Lorraine is a bit more mild-tempered and careful, less sure about having Blackberry the cat around. Lorraine is going through an emotional time when this story takes place, only admitting small bits of information at a time about how she doesn't trust Arthur anymore, but won't give up more detail when pushed. Judy found Lorraine to seem somewhat jealous, but both Judy and Lois seem to know that Lorraine is keeping something from them. On the other hand, Lois is very open and encourages the others to speak their minds to work through anything that might be bothering them. ",
        "Summary_3": "Lois and Lorraine are sisters-in-law who care for each other, although Lorraine can sometimes be difficult to get along with. Lois is the friendlier, perkier of the two, while Lorraine is brooding and distrusting. Lorraine has a jealous streak that interfered with the budding friendship between Lois and Judy, and even now, Lorraine complains that Lois always sides with Judy. She also holds grudges, as she brings up the point that Judy almost ruined their double wedding. Lorraine has a problem that appears to be related to her husband, and Lois thinks Lorraine should tell Judy about it because Judy is so good at solving problems and mysteries. When Judy mentions Arthur, Lorraine looks as though she is in pain and asks the others not to talk about him now. Later, she comments that she wishes she could go back in the past to the time when she trusted Arthur, and when they meet the oncoming car on the way to the Brandt estate, she hides herself from the driver. Lois encourages Lorraine to tell her what her problem is, but Lorraine won\u2019t. All day, Lois engages in eager conversation, asking Judy questions as she tells her story, while Lorraine appears lost, glum, and hurt; Lorraine starts comments that she doesn\u2019t finish and mysteriously seems to know more about the Brandt estate than she will tell the other two women.",
        "Summary_4": "Lois and Lorraine appear to be sisters. At one point, Judy is recounting how she wished for a sister her age, and Lois squeezes Lorraine's hand, proclaiming that her future held a sister just like Judy's future held a sister. It isn't clear, however, if they are biological sisters or symbolic sisters. Judy is describing more of a symbolic relationship with a woman of her age, but Lois does not clarify if her relationship with Lorraine is by blood or simply by love like how Judy is describing. Either way, the two characters seem very close and care for one another deeply.",
        "Article": " id=chap01>  CHAPTER I   An Unsolved Mystery    \u201cTell Judy about it,\u201d begged Lois. \u201cPlease, Lorraine,it can\u2019t be as bad as it appears. There isn\u2019tanything that Judy can\u2019t solve.\u201d     Lorraine tilted her head disdainfully. \u201cWe\u2019re sistersnow. We\u2019re both Farringdon-Petts and should beloyal to each other. But you always did take Judy\u2019spart. She was the one who nearly spoiled our doublewedding trying to solve a mystery. I don\u2019t believeshe\u2019d understand\u2014understand any better than I do.Everyone has problems, and I\u2019m sure Judy is noexception.\u201d     \u201cYou\u2019re right, Lorraine,\u201d announced Judy, comingin to serve dessert to the two friends she had invitedfor lunch at Peter\u2019s suggestion. \u201cI do haveproblems, and there are plenty of mysteries I can\u2019tsolve.\u201d     \u201cName one,\u201d charged Lois. \u201cJust mention onesingle spooky thing you couldn\u2019t explain, and I\u2019llbelieve you. I\u2019ve seen you in action, Judy Bolton\u2014\u201d     \u201cJudy Dobbs, remember?\u201d     \u201cWell, you were Judy Bolton when you solvedall those mysteries. I met you when the wholevalley below the big Roulsville dam was threatenedby flood and you solved that\u2014\u201d     \u201cThat,\u201d declared Judy, \u201cwas my brother Horace,not me. He was the hero without even meaning tobe. He was the one who rode through town andwarned people that the flood was coming. I was offchasing a shadow.\u201d     \u201cA vanishing shadow,\u201d Lois said with a sigh.\u201cWhat you did wasn\u2019t easy, Judy.\u201d     \u201cIt didn\u2019t need to be as hard as it was,\u201d Judy confessed.\u201cI know now that keeping that promise notto talk about the dam was a great big mistake andcould have cost lives. I should have told Arthur.\u201d     \u201cPlease,\u201d Lorraine said, a pained expression cloudingher pretty face, \u201clet\u2019s not talk about him now.\u201d     \u201cVery well,\u201d Judy agreed. \u201cWhat shall we talkabout?\u201d     \u201cYou,\u201d Lois said, \u201cand all the mysteries you\u2019vesolved. Maybe you were mistaken about a thing ortwo before the flood, but what about the haunted  house you moved into? You were the one whotracked down the ghosts in the attic and the cellarand goodness knows where all. You\u2019ve been chasingghosts ever since I met you, and not one of them didyou fail to explain in some sensible, logical fashion.\u201d     \u201cBefore I met you,\u201d Judy said, thinking back,\u201cthere were plenty of them I couldn\u2019t explain. Therewas one I used to call the spirit of the fountain, butwhat she was or how she spoke to me is more thanI know. If my grandparents knew, they weren\u2019t telling.And now they\u2019re both dead and I can\u2019t ask them.They left me a lot of unsolved mysteries along withthis house. Maybe I\u2019ll find the answers to some ofthem when I finish sorting Grandma\u2019s things. They\u2019restored in one end of the attic.\u201d     \u201cAnother haunted attic? How thrilling!\u201d exclaimedLois. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have another ghost party andshow up the spooks?\u201d     \u201cI didn\u2019t say the attic was haunted.\u201d     Judy was almost sorry she had mentioned it. Shewasn\u2019t in the mood for digging up old mysteries,but Lois and Lorraine insisted. It all began, she finallytold them, the summer before they met. Horacehad just started working on the paper. Judy rememberedthat it was Lorraine\u2019s father, Richard ThorntonLee, who gave him his job with the      FarringdonDaily Herald     . He had turned in some interestingchurch news, convincing Mr. Lee that he had in him  the makings of a good reporter. And so it was thathe spent the summer Judy was remembering in Farringdonwhere the Farringdon-Petts had their turretedmansion, while she had to suffer the heat andloneliness of Dry Brook Hollow.     Her thoughts were what had made it so hard, sheconfessed now as she reviewed everything that hadhappened. She just couldn\u2019t help resenting the factthat her parents left her every summer while theywent off on a vacation by themselves. What did theythink she would do?     \u201cYou\u2019ll have plenty to read,\u201d her father had toldher. \u201cI bought you six new books in that mysteryseries you like. When they\u2019re finished there areplenty of short stories around. Your grandmothernever throws anything away. She has magazines she\u2019ssaved since your mother was a girl. If you ask forthem she\u2019ll let you have the whole stack. I know howyou love to read.\u201d     \u201cI do, Dad, but if the magazines are that old\u2014\u201d     Judy had stopped. She had seen her father\u2019s tiredeyes and had realized that a busy doctor needed avacation much more than a schoolgirl who had toolittle to do. He and Judy\u2019s mother usually went tothe beach hotel where they had honeymooned. Itwas a precious memory. Every summer Dr. Boltonand his wife relived it. And every summer Judywent to stay with her grandmother Smeed, whoscolded and fussed and tried to pretend she wasn\u2019tglad to have her.     \u201cYou here again?\u201d she had greeted her that summer,and Judy hadn\u2019t noticed her old eyes twinklingbehind her glasses. \u201cWhat do you propose to do withyourself this time?\u201d     \u201cRead,\u201d Judy had told her. \u201cMom and Dad sayyou have a whole stack of old magazines\u2014\u201d     \u201cIn the attic. Go up and look them over if youcan stand the heat.\u201d     Judy went, not to look over the old magazines somuch as to escape to a place where she could have agood cry. It was the summer before her fifteenthbirthday. In another year she would have outgrownher childish resentment of her parents\u2019 vacation orbe grown up enough to ask them to let her have avacation of her own. In another year she wouldbe summering among the beautiful Thousand Islandsand solving a mystery to be known as the      GhostParade     .     \u201cA whole parade of ghosts,\u201d Lois would be tellingher, \u201cand you solved everything.\u201d     But then she didn\u2019t even know Lois. She had noidea so many thrilling adventures awaited her. Thereseemed to be nothing\u2014nothing\u2014and so the tearscame and spilled over on one of the magazines. AsJudy wiped it away she noticed that it had fallenon a picture of a fountain.     \u201cA fountain with tears for water. How strange!\u201dshe remembered saying aloud.     Judy had never seen a real fountain. The thrill ofwalking up to the door of the palatial Farringdon-Pettmansion was still ahead of her. On the lawn afountain still caught and held rainbows like thoseshe was to see on her honeymoon at Niagara Falls.But all that was in the future. If anyone had toldthe freckled-faced, pigtailed girl that she would oneday marry Peter Dobbs, she would have laughed intheir faces.     \u201cThat tease!\u201d     For then she knew Peter only as an older boy whoused to tease her and call her carrot-top until one dayshe yelled back at him, \u201cCarrot-tops are green and soare you!\u201d     Peter was to win Judy\u2019s heart when he gave her akitten and suggested the name Blackberry for him.The kitten was now a dignified family cat. But thesummer Judy found the picture of a fountain andspilled tears on it she had no kitten. She had nothing,she confessed, not even a friend. It had helped topretend the fountain in the picture was filled withall the tears lonely girls like herself had ever cried.     \u201cBut that would make it enchanted!\u201d she had suddenlyexclaimed. \u201cIf I could find it I\u2019d wish\u2014\u201d     A step had sounded on the stairs. Judy rememberedit distinctly. She had turned to see her grandmother  and to hear her say in her usual abrupt fashion,\u201cEnchanted fountain, indeed! If you let peopleknow your wishes instead of muttering them toyourself, most of them aren\u2019t so impossible.\u201d     \u201cWere they?\u201d asked Lois.     She and Lorraine had listened to this much of whatJudy was telling them without interruption.     \u201cThat\u2019s the unsolved mystery,\u201d Judy replied.\u201cThere weren\u2019t any of them impossible.\u201d     And she went on to tell them how, the very nextday, her grandparents had taken her to a fountainexactly like the one in the picture. It was in the centerof a deep, circular pool with steps leading up to it.Beside the steps were smaller fountains with thewater spurting from the mouths of stone lions. Judyhad stared at them a moment and then climbed thesteps to the pool.     \u201cAm I dreaming?\u201d she remembered saying aloud.\u201cIs this beautiful fountain real?\u201d     A voice had answered, although she could see noone.     \u201cMake your wishes, Judy. Wish wisely. If youshed a tear in the fountain your wishes will surelycome true.\u201d     \u201cA tear?\u201d Judy had asked. \u201cHow can I shed atear when I\u2019m happy? This is a wonderful place.\u201d     \u201cShed a tear in the fountain and your wishes willsurely come true,\u201d the voice had repeated.     \u201cBut what is there to cry about?\u201d     \u201cYou found plenty to cry about back at yourgrandmother\u2019s house,\u201d the mysterious voice had remindedher. \u201cWeren\u2019t you crying on my picture upthere in the attic?\u201d     \u201cThen you\u2014you      are     the fountain!\u201d Judy rememberedexclaiming. \u201cBut a fountain doesn\u2019t speak. Itdoesn\u2019t have a voice.\u201d     \u201cWish wisely,\u201d the voice from the fountain hadsaid in a mysterious whisper.    <doc-sep>  id=chap02>  CHAPTER II   If Wishes Came True    \u201cDid you?\u201d Lois interrupted the story to ask excitedly.\u201cOh, Judy! Don\u2019t keep us in suspense anylonger. What did you wish?\u201d     \u201cPatience,\u201d Judy said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m comingto that.\u201d     First, she told her friends, she had to think of awise wish. There had been so much she wanted inthose early days before the flood. Dora Scott hadbeen her best friend in Roulsville, but she had movedaway.     \u201cYou see,\u201d she explained, \u201cI made the mistake ofhaving just one best friend. There wasn\u2019t anybodyin Dry Brook Hollow. I remember thinking of howlonely I was and how I wished for a friend or a sister,  and suddenly a tear splashed in the water. It madelittle ripples. I thought I had to wish quickly beforethey vanished, and so I began naming the things Iwanted as fast as I could. I\u2019m not sure they werewise wishes. They seem rather selfish to me, now. Iwasn\u2019t thinking of anybody but me, Judy Bolton,and what I wanted. It wasn\u2019t until after I began tothink of others that my wishes started to come true.\u201d     \u201cBut what were they?\u201d Lois insisted.     Lorraine seemed unusually quiet and thoughtful.Judy did not notice the fear in her eyes as she repliedairily, \u201cOh, didn\u2019t I tell you? I wished for lotsof friends and a sister, and I wished I could marry aG-man and solve a lot of mysteries and that\u2019s as faras I got when the ripples vanished. I thought thespell was broken and so I didn\u2019t wish for anythingmore.\u201d     \u201cWasn\u2019t there anything more you wanted?\u201d Loisasked.     \u201cOf course,\u201d replied Judy. \u201cThere were lots morethings. I wanted to go places, of course, and keeppets, and have a nice home, and\u2014\u201d     \u201cAnd your wishes all came true!\u201d     \u201cEvery one of them,\u201d Judy agreed, \u201ceven the oneabout the sister. You see, it wasn\u2019t a baby sister Iwanted. It was a sister near my own age. Thatseemed impossible at the time, but the future didhold a sister for me.\u201d     \u201cIt held one for me, too,\u201d Lois said, squeezingLorraine\u2019s hand under the table. \u201cDon\u2019t you thinksisters should tell each other their problems, Judy?\u201d     \u201cHoney and I always do,\u201d she replied \u201cbut thenit was different. I didn\u2019t know I would marry Peteror that he would become a G-man, and he didn\u2019tknow he had a sister. It is strange, isn\u2019t it? But thestrangest thing of all was the fountain itself.\u201d     \u201cWhy?\u201d asked Lorraine. \u201cDo you still think it wasenchanted?\u201d     Lois laughed at this, but Judy was serious as sheanswered, \u201cI was still little girl enough to think soat the time. I wandered around, growing verydrowsy. Then I found a hammock and climbed intoit. I must have gone to sleep, because I rememberwaking up and wondering if the voice in the fountainhad been a dream.\u201d     \u201cA hammock?\u201d Lois questioned. \u201cAre you sure itwasn\u2019t a flying carpet?\u201d     \u201cNo, it was a hammock all right,\u201d Judy assuredher, laughing. \u201cIt was hung between two trees in abeautiful garden all enclosed in rose trellises thickwith roses. Did I tell you it was June?\u201d     \u201cAll the year around?\u201d     Again Lois laughed. But Lorraine said abruptly,\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about rose gardens in June. It\u2019s a longway from June to December.\u201d     \u201cDo you mean a garden changes? I know,\u201d Judysaid, \u201cbut I think this one would be beautiful at anytime of the year. There were rhododendrons, too,and I don\u2019t know how many different kinds of evergreens.I explored the garden all around the fountain.\u201d     \u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d Lorraine urged her.     \u201cYes, yes. Go on,\u201d entreated Lois. \u201cI didn\u2019t dreamyou\u2019d kept anything that exciting a secret. Why didn\u2019tyou try to solve the mystery?\u201d     \u201cI think I would have tried,\u201d Judy admitted, \u201cifI had been older or more experienced. I really shouldhave investigated it more thoroughly and learned thesecret of the fountain. But after the ripples wentaway it didn\u2019t speak to me any more, and I didn\u2019treally think it had heard my wishes. I was still wishingfor a friend when I met you, Lois. It did seemimpossible for us to be friends at first, didn\u2019t it? Lorrainewas your friend.\u201d     \u201cI did make trouble for you,\u201d Lorraine remembered.\u201cIt was all because of my foolish jealousy.\u201d     \u201cIt was nothing compared to the trouble caused bythe Roulsville flood,\u201d declared Judy. \u201cAfter thatthings started happening so fast that I completelyforgot about the fountain. Honestly, Lois, I don\u2019tbelieve I thought about it again until after we movedto Farringdon and I walked up to your door andsaw the fountain on your lawn.\u201d     \u201cThe Farringdon-Pett puddle, I always called it,\u201dLois said with a giggle. \u201cI\u2019ve seen lots nicer fountains.\u201d     \u201cYou have?\u201d asked Judy. \u201cThen maybe you\u2019veseen the one I\u2019ve been telling you about. I think thepicture of it is still in the attic. Come on up and I\u2019llshow you.\u201d     Lois and Lorraine had finished their dessert whileJudy was telling them the story of the fountain.Somehow, she wasn\u2019t hungry for hers. She hadtasted it too often while she was making it.     \u201cI\u2019ll leave it for Blackberry,\u201d she decided.     Lois watched in amusement as the cat lapped upthe chocolate pudding after Judy had mixed it generouslywith cream.     \u201cSometimes,\u201d Judy said fondly, \u201cBlackberry thinkshe\u2019s a person. He eats everything we eat, includinglettuce. Do you mind if he comes with us, Lorraine?He wants to explore the attic, too.\u201d     \u201cHe\u2019ll remember he\u2019s a cat fast enough if thereare any mice up there,\u201d Lois said with a giggle.     Leaving the table, they all started upstairs withthe cat bounding ahead of them. In modernizing hergrandparents\u2019 house to suit her own and Peter\u2019stastes, Judy had seen to it that the old stair door wasremoved. But there was still a door closing off thenarrower stairs that led to the attic. Blackberryreached it first and yowled for Judy to open it.     \u201cHe can read my mind. He always knows whereI\u2019m going,\u201d Judy said as the door creaked open andthe cat shot through it. A moment later a weird rollingnoise came from the floor above.     \u201cCome on. There\u2019s nothing up here to be afraidof,\u201d Judy urged her friends.     \u201cMaybe not, but I\u2019m beginning to get the shivers,\u201dconfessed Lois as she followed Judy to the sewingroom at the top of the last flight of stairs.     \u201cSo am I,\u201d Lorraine admitted. \u201cI\u2019m not superstitiousabout black cats, but they are creepy. DoesBlackberry have to roll spools across the floor?\u201d     \u201cNow he thinks he\u2019s a kitten,\u201d laughed Judy.Pausing at still another door that led to the darkerpart of the attic, she turned and said mysteriously,\u201cUp here we can all turn back the clock. Does anybodycare to explore the past?\u201d     The exploration began enthusiastically with Judyrelating still more of what she remembered aboutthe fountain.     \u201cWhen I told Grandma about it she laughed andsaid I must have dreamed it. She said if wishes cametrue that easily she\u2019d be living in a castle. But wouldshe?\u201d Judy wondered. \u201cWhen I first remember thishouse she was still burning kerosene lamps like thoseyou see on that high shelf by the window. I thinkshe and Grandpa like the way they lived withoutany modern conveniences or anything.\u201d     \u201cI think so, too,\u201d Lois agreed, looking around theold attic with a shiver. \u201cIt is strange they both diedthe same winter, isn\u2019t it?\u201d     \u201cMaybe they wanted it that way. Maybe theywished neither of them would outlive the other. Ifthey did wish in the fountain,\u201d Judy went on morethoughtfully, \u201cI\u2019m sure that was one of their wishes.Another could have been to keep the good old days,as Grandma used to call them. That one came truein a way. They did manage to keep a little of thepast when they kept all these old things. That\u2019s whatI meant about turning back the clock.\u201d     \u201cIf wishes came true I\u2019d like to turn it back a littlemyself,\u201d Lorraine began. \u201cIt would be nice if thingswere the way they used to be when I trustedArthur\u2014\u201d     \u201cDon\u2019t you trust him now?\u201d Judy asked.     Afterwards she was sorry for the interruption. Loisand Judy both questioned Lorraine, but that was allshe would say. Judy wondered, as they searchedthrough the old magazines, what was wrong. Lorrainewas of a jealous disposition. Was the green-eyedmonster coming between her and her handsome husband,Arthur Farringdon-Pett? Until now they hadseemed blissfully happy. But there was no happinessin Lorraine\u2019s face as she gazed at a picture of one ofthe fountains and then said in a tight little voice, \u201cItis. It\u2019s the very same one.\u201d     \u201cBut that\u2019s the picture I\u2019ve been searching for!\u201dJudy said eagerly. \u201cDo you know where it is?\u201d     \u201cI can\u2019t be sure. But if it ever was enchanted, I\u2019msure it isn\u2019t now. Let\u2019s go,\u201d Lorraine said suddenlyto Lois. Judy knew she was suggesting a fast trip home.But, apparently, Lois did not understand it that way.If she did, she pretended not to.     \u201cWhere?\u201d she asked. \u201cTo the fountain? I\u2019d loveto, wouldn\u2019t you, Judy?\u201d     \u201cI certainly would,\u201d Judy replied enthusiastically.\u201cDo you recognize it, too?\u201d     \u201cI think so,\u201d Lois answered after studying a littlemore closely the picture they had found. \u201cIt lookslike the fountain on the Brandt estate.\u201d     \u201cThe department store Brandts?\u201d Judy questioned.\u201cThen my grandparents must have driven old Fannyall the way to Farringdon.\u201d     \u201cNot quite all the way,\u201d Lorraine objected. \u201cTheBrandts own that stretch of woods just before youcome into the city. You\u2019ve passed it lots of times.\u201d     \u201cOf course,\u201d agreed Judy. She put the magazineback in its place under the eaves and turned eagerlyto her friends. \u201cI do remember a road turning offinto the woods and going on uphill,\u201d she told them.\u201cI never thought it led to a house, though. Thereisn\u2019t even a gate. Could that be the road my grandparentstook?\u201d     \u201cWhy don\u2019t we take it ourselves and find out?\u201dLois suggested.    <doc-sep>  id=chap03>  CHAPTER III   A Strange Encounter    Lorraine was not too enthusiastic about the proposedtrip to the Brandt estate. Finally she agreed toit under one condition. They were not to drive allthe way to the house which, she said, was just overthe hilltop. They were to park the car where noone would see it and follow the path to the fountain.     \u201cBut suppose we can\u2019t find the path?\u201d asked Judy.     \u201cYou\u2019ll remember it, won\u2019t you?\u201d     Judy thought she would, but she wasn\u2019t too sure.She and Lois both argued that it would be better toinquire at the house. Lois knew Helen Brandt slightly.     \u201cShe\u2019d be glad to show us around. This way itlooks as if we\u2019re planning a crime,\u201d Lois said as theystarted off in the blue car she was driving.     It was a neat little car, not too conspicuous, andeasy to park in out-of-the-way places. Judy laughedand said if they did find the fountain she thoughtshe\u2019d wish for one exactly like it.     \u201cWell, you know what your grandmother saidabout wishes, don\u2019t you?\u201d Lorraine asked. \u201cIf youlet people know about them instead of mutteringthem to yourself most of them aren\u2019t so impossible.\u201d     \u201cQuite true,\u201d Judy agreed. \u201cI\u2019ll let Peter knowabout this one. He\u2019s my Santa Claus, and it will soonbe Christmas. Maybe I should have worn the furcoat he gave me last year.\u201d     \u201cYour reversible\u2019s better in case it rains. It\u2019s toowarm for snow. We picked a perfect day for thistrip,\u201d Lois continued, guiding the car around curvesas it climbed the steep hill beyond Dry Brook Hollow.     The trip was a short one. In twenty minutes theyhad covered the distance that had seemed such along way to Judy when she was riding in her grandfather\u2019swagon.     \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it,\u201d she said, \u201cand I\u2019vejust about figured out how it happened. I didn\u2019tthink my grandparents knew the Brandts well enoughto pay them a visit, though. We must have lookedqueer driving up to a beautiful estate in Grandpa\u2019sold farm wagon. I do remember that Grandma had  some hooked rugs to deliver. But that still doesn\u2019texplain what happened afterwards. When I wokeup in the hammock I was alone in the garden. Horse,wagon, grandparents\u2014all had disappeared.\u201d     \u201cHow could they?\u201d asked Lois.     \u201cAnyway,\u201d Lorraine began, \u201cyou had a chance tosee how beautiful everything was before\u2014\u201d     Again she broke off as if there were somethingshe wanted to tell but didn\u2019t quite dare.     \u201cBefore what?\u201d questioned Judy.     \u201cOh, nothing. Forget I said anything about it. Youwere telling us how you woke up in the hammock,but you never did explain how you got back home,\u201dLorraine reminded her.     \u201cDidn\u2019t I?\u201d asked Judy. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten a lot of it,but it\u2019s beginning to come back now. I do rememberdriving home along this road. You see, I thought mygrandparents had left me in the garden for a surpriseand would return for me. I told you I was all alone.There wasn\u2019t a house in sight.\u201d     \u201cThe Brandt house is just over the top of this nexthill,\u201d Lois put in.     \u201cI know. You told me that. Now I know why Icouldn\u2019t see it. All I could see was a windowless oldtower and a path leading in that direction. Naturally,I followed it. There\u2019s something about a path inthe woods that always tempts me.\u201d     \u201cWe know that, Judy. Honey told us all aboutyour latest mystery. You followed a trail or something.\u201d     \u201cWell, this trail led out of the rose garden wherethe hammock was and then through an archway,\u201dJudy continued. \u201cAll sorts of little cupids and gnomespeered out at me from unexpected places. I wasactually scared by the time I reached the old tower.There wasn\u2019t time to explore it. Just then I heardthe rumble of my grandfather\u2019s wagon and knew hewas driving off without me.\u201d     \u201cHe was!\u201d Judy\u2019s friends both chorused in surprise,and Lois asked, \u201cWhy would he do a thing likethat?\u201d     \u201cI think now it was just to tease me. He did stopand wait for me after a while,\u201d Judy remembered.\u201cThe rugs were gone. Grandma must have deliveredthem, but I didn\u2019t ask where. If she made them forMrs. Brandt they may still be there.\u201d     \u201cI wouldn\u2019t depend on it,\u201d Lorraine said as theyturned up the narrow road to the Brandt estate.     \u201cWatch out!\u201d Judy suddenly exclaimed. \u201cThere\u2019sanother car coming.\u201d     As Lois swerved to avoid the oncoming car, Lorraineducked her head. She kept herself hidden behindJudy until the car had passed. The man drivingit was a stranger to Judy, but she would rememberhis hypnotic, dark eyes and swarthy complexion for along time. The soft brown hat he was wearing coveredmost of his hair.     \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you two?\u201d asked Loiswhen the car had passed. \u201cAren\u2019t you a little old forplaying hide and seek?\u201d     \u201cI wasn\u2019t\u2014playing. Let\u2019s not go up there,\u201d Lorrainebegged. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Brandts live thereany more.\u201d     \u201cMaybe not, but we can pretend we think they do,can\u2019t we?\u201d Judy replied a little uncertainly.     She was beginning to suspect that Lorraine knewmore about the Brandt estate than she was telling.     Lois kept on driving along the narrow, gravellyroad. Soon there were more evergreens and a hedgeof rhododendrons to be seen. They looked verygreen next to the leafless trees in the woods beyond.The sky was gray with white clouds being drivenacross it by the wind.     \u201cThere\u2019s the tower!\u201d Lorraine exclaimed. \u201cI cansee it over to the left. It looks like something out ofGrimm\u2019s Fairy Tales, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d     \u201cIt looks grim all right,\u201d agreed Judy. \u201cI wonderwhat it is.\u201d     \u201cI suppose it\u2019s nothing but an old water tower. Itwould be fun to explore it, though,\u201d Lois said. \u201cButif there are new people living here they\u2019ll never giveus permission.\u201d     \u201cWe might explore it without permission,\u201d Judysuggested daringly. \u201cCome on!\u201d she urged her friendsas Lois parked the car in a cleared place beside theroad. \u201cWho\u2019s going to stop us? And who wants toexplore a gloomy old tower, anyway? Let\u2019s look forthe fountain.\u201d     \u201cDo you think we should?\u201d Lorraine asked. \u201cItwon\u2019t be enchanted. I told you\u2014\u201d     \u201cYou told us very little,\u201d Lois reminded her. \u201cIfyou know anything about the people who live herenow, I think you ought to let us know. Otherwise,I\u2019m afraid we won\u2019t be very welcome.\u201d     \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll welcome us, anyway. I doknow who they are,\u201d Lorraine admitted. \u201cYou rememberRoger Banning from school, don\u2019t you?I\u2019ve seen him around here. His family must haveacquired sudden wealth, or else he\u2019s just working onthe estate.\u201d     \u201cThen you\u2019ve been here lately? Why didn\u2019t youtell me?\u201d asked Lois. \u201cWe always used to go placestogether.\u201d     \u201cIt wasn\u2019t important,\u201d Lorraine replied evasively.\u201cI was just out for a drive.\u201d     \u201cYou plutocrats!\u201d laughed Judy. \u201cEach with acar of your own. You\u2019re not interested in RogerBanning, are you, Lois? I\u2019m sure you can do betterthan that. I did know him slightly, but not fromschool. The boys and girls were separated and wentto different high schools by the time we moved to  Farringdon. I remember his pal, Dick Hartwell, alot better. He was in our young people\u2019s group atchurch.\u201d     \u201cSh!\u201d Lois cautioned her. \u201cNice people no longermention Dick Hartwell\u2019s name. He\u2019s doing time.\u201d     \u201cFor what?\u201d asked Judy.     Like Peter, her FBI husband, she preferred factsto gossip.     \u201cForgery, I guess. He stole some checkbooks fromhis father\u2019s desk and forged the names of a lot of importantbusiness people. I think he forged some legaldocuments, too. Anyway, he went to the Federal Penitentiary.It was all in the papers,\u201d Lorraine told her.     Now Judy did remember. It was something shewould have preferred to forget. She liked to thinkshe was a good judge of character, and she had takenDick Hartwell for a quiet, refined boy who wouldnever stoop to crime.     \u201cI don\u2019t see what all this has to do with the fountain,\u201dLois said impatiently. \u201cAre we going to lookfor it, or aren\u2019t we?\u201d     \u201cOf course we are. That\u2019s what we came for. Ijust like to know what a tiger looks like before hesprings at me,\u201d Judy explained.     \u201cYou seem to think there\u2019s danger in this expeditionof ours, don\u2019t you?\u201d asked Lorraine.     \u201cI don\u2019t know what to think. You\u2019re the one whoseems to know the answers, but you\u2019re not telling.  Hiding your face back there gave you away. You\u2019veseen that character who drove down this road and,for some reason, you were afraid he would see you.Why, Lorraine? Why didn\u2019t you want to be recognized?\u201d     Lorraine hesitated a moment and then repliedevasively, \u201cPeople don\u2019t generally enter privateestates without an invitation. That\u2019s all.\u201d     \u201cI\u2019d better turn the car around,\u201d Lois decided,\u201cin case we have to leave in a hurry. I don\u2019t expectwe\u2019ll encounter any tigers, but we may be accusedof trespassing.\u201d     \u201cI\u2019m sure we will be,\u201d announced Judy as twodark-coated figures strode down the road towardthem. \u201cYou drove right by a  NO TRESPASSING  sign,and this isn\u2019t a welcoming committee coming tomeet us!\u201d   "

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in \"I am a Nucleus\"?",
        "Summary_1": "Alec Graham returns to his home from the office after a long day. His wife Molly has left, and he still feels that it looks wife-deserted even after doing many chores to clean it up. He recounts his bad day, having forgotten to set his alarm and rushing to the TV Studio that he writes for. The taxi driver refuses to take him to Madison and Fifty-fourth, and the rain has gotten worse. His hand continuously bleeds after passing by a big excavation site, and he misses his story conference. After hearing the same phrases numerous times and all six elevators being jammed, he is convinced that he is coincidence prone. Molly leaves him instructions on how to take care of himself, and he works on his novel. More of these events happen with pigeons colliding and somebody getting five straight-flushes in a row. Nat tells Alec about the strange occurrence as they get soda. The three bottles do not break after falling at least five feet, and Danny, the cop, is shocked. Outside, more strange events occur when Nat almost gets caught up with a swerving taxi. Once they return home, he immediately calls McGill, an assistant mathematics professor for some expert advice. Once McGill arrives, he says that all of the events are very improbable, which makes him inclined to believe that Alec is stringing him on or subject to delusion. They do an experiment involving coin-throwing, and all of the coins are arranged in a neat pile when Alec throws them. McGill asks him some more questions about any recent occurrences, but Alec suggests that they go outside to eat. Outside, the cars are being towed away, while two pedestrians are having trouble letting each other pass. Danny is confused by all that is happening. Alec also runs into Molly, stuck in a confused wrangle of umbrellas with two other women. She explains that somebody from their home had kept calling her mother\u2019s number, so she came back to investigate. Back at the apartment, all of this is traced back to Alec as the center. McGill tries to explain what is possibly happening to Alec, but they are interrupted by the telephone repairman. Molly suggests they go out to a restaurant to eat, and Nat comes along. They pass by the car jam again, and the police lieutenant looks at Alec with interest. Even at the restaurant, Alec realizes that his Tom Collins drink is made with salt instead of sugar. When the bartender tries to remake the drink for them, the shaker has frozen solid. It happens again with a new shaker, and the waiter is extremely confused. When Alec\u2019s hand collides with Molly\u2019s cigarette, it goes into the neighboring lady\u2019s vichyssoise. The two of them are displeased, and when Alec stands up, he ends up pulling all of the contents on their entire table onto the floor. The lady and the man are furious at Alec; even the owner has come to fix the situation. ",
        "Summary_2": "Alec returns to his apartment after a day at the office, feeling worn out and defeated. He recalls the events from earlier that day; he had forgotten to set his alarm clock, making him late for a conference at the advertising studio he works at. He had forgotten an umbrella and found himself in the pouring rain, where he caught a taxi only for it to not start. The subways had suffered delays as well. On his walk to the office, Alec passed by a construction site, where he was nicked by a piece of glass from an explosion. He ended up missing his conference, and on his way home, a cop tells him that the elevators in his office building had all broken down as soon as he left. Alec reflects on these events, perplexed by the accident-prone coincidences. He decides to write at his typewriter when he drops his pencil, finding that it has landed standing on its end. As he continues to be stunned by the events, he fixes a drink for himself, taking note of the several notes that his wife, Molly, had left him while she visits her mother. Alec then witnesses a card game between his neighbor, Nat, and a group of men, in which Nat draws five straight flushes. Alec invites Nat in after the heated game, and after breaking a soda, they go to the corner store to buy more, where the bottles fall through the bottom of the bag. As the two walk back to their apartment, Nat is nearly bumped into and he steps onto the curb, causing a severe accident between multiple cars. Nat later leaves to his office to write an article about the strange events, and Alec calls up McGill, a mathematics professor and friend. McGill comes to Alec's apartment, and he is suspicious that he may be delusional or lying, due to the impossible probability of the events occurring. McGill then tosses some change onto the floor, testing to see if they all land on heads; instead, the coins stack up on top of each other. McGill is also confused, trying to imagine an explanation, and Alec suggests that some form of life is controlling the events. The two go out for food and pass by three women who have their umbrellas tangled up together. One of the women turns out to be Molly, who says she returned after her mother had been receiving constant calls from Alec's phone with no one on the other end. They go back to the apartment and discuss the matter, as the telephone repairman arrives. After, the three go to a restaurant, and face more inconveniences, such as having salt in their drink instead of sugar. Alec then accidentally drops a cigarette onto a neighboring party, and the woman gets angry, as Alec somehow pulls their tablecloth and dinner onto the floor, angering many. ",
        "Summary_3": "The story begins with Alec missing his wife\u2019s presence as he feels lost without her aid in his life. He details how his commute to work was heavily hindered by unlucky transportation happenings and awful weather. When Alec leaves work and gets back to his apartment, he attempts to write a bit. In addition, he thinks over the strange coincidences that have happened during the day thus far. Upon hearing a loud commotion in his apartment building hallway, he goes to investigate. He finds his neighbor Nat in an argument with a group of men accusing Nat of cheating. In a fit of rage, one of the men hits the deck of cards that Nat is holding, causing them to be tossed to the floor. In another strange coincidence, half of the cards land face down but all the face-up cards are red. The group of men leave in confusion and Alec invites Nat into his apartment for a drink to cool down. \n\nAfter consuming most of the club soda, the two men leave to grab more club soda in a nearby deli. At the deli, another strange incident occurs. The 3 glasses of club soda fall through a thin plastic bag, 5 feet towards the ground and do not break when they should have broken due to the fall. The storekeeper is shocked but Alec shrugs off the weird incident. Nat and Alec return to his apartment where he notices more strange coincidences. Alec grows frustrated and decides to call his friend McGill to help him make sense of everything. McGill promptly comes over to Alec\u2019s apartment to help. McGill gets to the apartment and Alec tries to explain all of the coincidences. McGill is understandably very skeptical and wants Alec to prove it for his own eyes. \n\nAlec is able to prove that something strange his happening with a demonstration that involves throwing coins to the floor. The coins are thrown and somehow clustered together into a perfectly stacked pile. McGill then begins to believe Alec. He is uncertain about the probability of the coincidences but refuses to attribute it to superstitious happenings and states that it is an unknown force. When the two leave to go get food, they see and meet up with Molly on the street and quickly return to the apartment to catch Molly up on the strange occurrences. After much discussion over what could be causing the day\u2019s incidents, they decide to all go to get food. They order drinks at the restaurant, but mysteriously the shaker is causing the liquids to freeze. Molly notes how the restaurant is continuously becoming warmer, and later Alec mentally notes that he can no longer hear the sound of the air conditioner. While preparing to discuss the issue of the AC, Alec accidentally flips his cigarette onto another occupied table. This causes a heated argument with the other guests and the unapproving look from the owner of the restaurant towards Alec. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Alec, the narrator, had a very weird and exhausting day. In the morning he overslept work and hurried out. A rain storm started the subway was delayed and there was a huge excavation on his way. The drill working with clay hit something glittering inside and a little explosion happened. The narrator's face was slightly scratched and bleeding. His absence at the conference wasn't noticed. Back home Alec saw his wife's nots with directions all around as she left to attend to her mother. Then he tried to write his novel and came to a dead end, so he poured himself a drink and watched some pigeons being trained outside, when some traffic occurred and a couple birds fell. There were loud voices outside: four men confronted the narrator's neighbor, a shy guy named Nat. Then the man came in for a drink, and told Alec that he had miraculously won in cards a couple times in a row, and his partners believed he had cheated. The narrator and Nat went out for sodas in glass bottles, which fell and miraculously did not break. On the street, a pedestrian, who suddenly stopped in front of Nat, caused a series of accidents leading to a huge traffic jam. Back at Alec's place, the curtain was weirdly tied in three knots and he called his knowledgeable friend McGill to get a consultation. The man came and considered all of the day's weird events very improbable but not impossible. McGill offered to make a demonstration, so Alec threw a handful of coins which bounced together, stacking into a neat pile. McGill's coins created an exactly straight line. McGill stated that Alec was the center of the weird events and there must be some design in that. They went out to eat and the cars were wrecking all along their way, overwhelming the cops. Two people were unable to go past each other, they fought making the same motions and saying identical words. Many similar situations were happening all around. One of the women with intertwined umbrellas was Molly, the wife. Her mother's number was constantly dialed with no one on the line, and Alec's number was always busy, so Molly got worried. At that point Danny, the local policeman, started suspecting Alec. The three went out for dinner eventually and took Nat with them, who wanted to hear the story. Alec dropped his cigarettes out of the pack under the suspicious gaze of Danny and a lieutenant. In the restaurant the whole company got salty drinks which puzzled the bartender. When he tried to do the new ones, nothing came out of the shaker - everything inside turned into ice. The place suddenly started getting warmer and quieter. Alec's hand collided with Molly's and her cigarette fell into the dish of a perturbed lady at the nearby table. While standing up, Alec accidentally pulled everything from that table to the floor and the angry lady slapped him. ",
        "Article": "What is it you wish? he barked. I understood in my discussions withthe other ... ah ... civilian there'd be no further need for theseirritating conferences.     I've just learned you're placing more students abroad, Mr. Gulver. Howmany this time?     Two thousand.     And where will they be going?     Croanie. It's all in the application form I've handed in. Your job isto provide transportation.     Will there be any other students embarking this season?     Why ... perhaps. That's Boge's business. Gulver looked at Retief withpursed lips. As a matter of fact, we had in mind dispatching anothertwo thousand to Featherweight.     Another under-populated world\u2014and in the same cluster, I believe,Retief said. Your people must be unusually interested in that regionof space.     If that's all you wanted to know, I'll be on my way. I have matters ofimportance to see to.     After Gulver left, Retief called Miss Furkle in. I'd like to have abreak-out of all the student movements that have been planned under thepresent program, he said. And see if you can get a summary of whatMEDDLE has been shipping lately.     Miss Furkle compressed her lips. If Mr. Magnan were here, I'm surehe wouldn't dream of interfering in the work of other departments.I ... overheard your conversation with the gentleman from the CroanieLegation\u2014     The lists, Miss Furkle.     I'm not accustomed, Miss Furkle said, to intruding in mattersoutside our interest cluster.     That's worse than listening in on phone conversations, eh? But nevermind. I need the information, Miss Furkle.     Loyalty to my Chief\u2014     Loyalty to your pay-check should send you scuttling for the materialI've asked for, Retief said. I'm taking full responsibility. Nowscat.     The buzzer sounded. Retief flipped a key. MUDDLE, Retief speaking....     Arapoulous's brown face appeared on the desk screen.     How-do, Retief. Okay if I come up?     Sure, Hank. I want to talk to you.     In the office, Arapoulous took a chair. Sorry if I'm rushing you,Retief, he said. But have you got anything for me?     Retief waved at the wine bottles. What do you know about Croanie?     Croanie? Not much of a place. Mostly ocean. All right if you likefish, I guess. We import our seafood from there. Nice prawns in monsoontime. Over a foot long.     You on good terms with them?     Sure, I guess so. Course, they're pretty thick with Boge.     So?     Didn't I tell you? Boge was the bunch that tried to take us over herea dozen years back. They'd've made it too, if they hadn't had a lot ofbad luck. Their armor went in the drink, and without armor they're easygame.     Miss Furkle buzzed. I have your lists, she said shortly.     Bring them in, please.   <doc-sep> Molly looked at me with a curious expression for a moment. Do you      feel     all right, darling? she asked me. I nodded brightly. You'llthink this silly of me, she went on to McGill, but why isn't itsomething like an overactive poltergeist?     Pure concept, he said. No genuine evidence.     Magnetism?     Absolutely not. For one thing, most of the objects affected weren'tmagnetic\u2014and don't forget magnetism is a force, not a form of energy,and a great deal of energy has been involved. I admit the energy hasmainly been supplied by the things themselves, but in a magnetic field,all you'd get would be stored kinetic energy, such as when a piece ofiron moves to a magnet or a line of force. Then it would just staythere, like a rundown clock weight. These things do a lot more thanthat\u2014they go on moving.     Why did you mention a crystal before? Why not a life-form?     Only an analogy, said McGill. A crystal resembles life in that ithas a definite shape and exhibits growth, but that's all. I'll agreethis\u2014thing\u2014has no discernible shape and motion      is     involved, butplants don't move and amebas have no shape. Then a crystal feeds, butit does not convert what it feeds on; it merely rearranges it into anon-random pattern. In this case, it's rearranging random motions andit has a nucleus and it seems to be growing\u2014at least in what you mightcall improbability.     Molly frowned. Then what      is     it? What's it made of?     I should say it was made of the motions. There's a similar idea aboutthe atom. Another thing that's like a crystal is that it appears tobe forming around a nucleus not of its own material\u2014the way a speckof sand thrown into a supersaturated solution becomes the nucleus ofcrystallization.     Sounds like the pearl in an oyster, Molly said, and gave me animpertinent look.     Why, I asked McGill, did you say the coins couldn't have the samedate? I mean apart from the off chance I got them that way.     Because I don't think this thing got going before today andeverything that's happened can all be described as improbable motionshere and now. The dates were already there, and to change them wouldrequire retroactive action, reversing time. That's out, in my book.That telephone now\u2014     The doorbell rang.

        "Summary_1": "The story is initially set in Alec\u2019s home. There is a radio, Greenwich Village thermometer, and a living room. In the home, there is also carpet, cushions, and ashtrays for cigarettes. Alec also owns an alarm clock to help him wake up. In the living room, there is also a typewriter and a telephone. Alec tries to go to his conference in New York, but it is raining heavily, and the cab refuses to take him to his destination. However, the story also mentions the subway, which he takes. Alec\u2019s stop is Fifty-first and Lexington. There is also mention of a big excavation site for a new building. On his way to the studio, he also stops at the drugstore. There are also at least six elevators in his building. Around the corner of the apartment, there is a delicatessen that sells soda. On the streets outside, cars are jamming into each other and have to be towed away. Later, the story is set in a restaurant near Sixth Avenue. The restaurant is crowded but cool, and there is a bar too. There is also background music and the faint hum of the air-conditioner, both that stop shortly after. \n",
        "Summary_2": "The story takes place in New York City. Alec lives in Greenwich Village and works at an office on the Upper East Side, on Madison Avenue. Alec lives in an apartment complex in a comfortable home, containing a living room where he keeps his typewriter, a small kitchen, and a bedroom. Alec's living room window offers a view of the roof across from him. Throughout the story, Alec visits many different places. In addition to his office, he goes to a small corner store to purchase soda, as well as a restaurant near Sixth Avenue. ",
        "Summary_3": "The main setting of the story is presumed to be in Manhattan in New York City. Alec goes to different parts of the city due to work, where he lives, and for food. His commute on the subway was fraught with troubles and he ends up missing a meeting at work, though his absence goes unnoticed. His wife, Molly, who was visiting her mother, finds him on the street surrounded by a bunch of commotion. Alec, his wife, and McGill return to Alec\u2019s apartment to discuss what has been happening. After much discussion, they go out to eat. As more strange coincidences happen at the restaurant, Molly notes how it keeps getting warmer. ",
        "Summary_4": "The story starts in Alec's apartment which looks wife-deserted as Molly, his wife, is visiting her mother. All around the apartment there are what-to-do notes from Molly. Alec rushes out for his job and it starts raining really bad outside. The cab doesn't move and he gets into the subway. Then he exits near his job, there is a huge excavation nearby, with men drilling clay and some spectators. Inside one piece of clay there is something shiny, like glass. Alec gets to his TV studio and soon takes the subway back home. At home he makes a drink in the kitchen and sits down in the living room with some papers which are supposedly his future novel and a typewriter. Weird events like a pencil standing straight and a tied in three knots curtain keep happening. From the window Alec sees a man exercising a flock of pigeons on the rooftop and a weird traffic occurs among the birds. Alec hears loud voices and opens the door to see his neighbor, Nat, being confronted by four men in the hallway. The two get into Alec's apartment and soon go out for sodas. At the delicatessen on the corner, Alec drops three bottles of water but they don't break. A series of accidents happen on the road outside and create an enormous traffic jam. Soon, Alec is alone in his apartment and invites his friend McGill to figure out the weird happenings. After a couple more very unprovable events they go out for food. The traffic outside is incredible, every car wrecks and pedestrians can't get past one another and fight. Molly appears among the women fighting over umbrellas and the three go back home. After a couple more weird events including the broken phone, they take Nat and go to a restaurant after all. The traffic on the street is still crazy. The restaurant is air-conditioned and noisy. The drinks are salty, and when the bartender tries to redo them, the liquid freezes, gathering many spectators. The air gets warmer and another accident creates a fight between Alec and a lady at the next table.\n",

Barr, have you ever thought muchabout the larger aspects of the problem of individuality?     Jack jumped slightly. He had let his thoughts wander very far.     Not especially, sir, he mumbled.     The house was still. A few minutes after the professor's arrival,Mrs. Kesserich had gone off with an anxious glance at Jack. He knewwhy and wished he could reassure her that he would not mention theirconversation to the professor.     Kesserich had spent perhaps a half hour briefing him on the moreimportant papers delivered at the conferences. Then, almost as ifit were a teacher's trick to show up a pupil's inattention, he hadsuddenly posed this question about individuality.     You know what I mean, of course, Kesserich pressed. The factors thatmake you you, and me me.     Heredity and environment, Jack parroted like a freshman.     Kesserich nodded. Suppose\u2014this is just speculation\u2014that we couldcontrol heredity and environment. Then we could re-create the sameindividual at will.     Jack felt a shiver go through him. To get exactly the same pattern ofhereditary traits. That'd be far beyond us.     What about identical twins? Kesserich pointed out. And then there'sparthenogenesis to be considered. One might produce a duplicate of themother without the intervention of the male. Although his voice hadgrown more idly speculative, Kesserich seemed to Jack to be smilingsecretly. There are many examples in the lower animal forms, to saynothing of the technique by which Loeb caused a sea urchin to reproducewith no more stimulus than a salt solution.     Jack felt the hair rising on his neck. Even then you wouldn't getexactly the same pattern of hereditary traits.     Not if the parent were of very pure stock? Not if there were somespecial technique for selecting ova that would reproduce all themother's traits?     But environment would change things, Jack objected. The duplicatewould be bound to develop differently.     Is environment so important? Newman tells about a pair of identicaltwins separated from birth, unaware of each other's existence. They metby accident when they were twenty-one. Each was a telephone repairman.Each had a wife the same age. Each had a baby son. And each had a foxterrier called 'Trixie.' That's without trying to make environmentssimilar. But suppose you did try. Suppose you saw to it that each ofthem had exactly the same experiences at the same times....     For a moment it seemed to Jack that the room was dimming and wavering,becoming a dark pool in which the only motionless thing was Kesserich'ssphinx-like face.     Well, we've escaped quite far enough from Jamieson's marine worms,the biologist said, all brisk again. He said it as if Jack were theone who had led the conversation down wild and unprofitable channels.Let's get on to your project. I want to talk it over now, because Iwon't have any time for it tomorrow.     Jack looked at him blankly.     Tomorrow I must attend to a very important matter, the biologistexplained.   <doc-sep>    I am a Nucleus     By STEPHEN BARR     Illustrated by GAUGHAN     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Galaxy Science Fiction February 1957.

When I got home from the office, I was not so much tired as beatendown, but the effect is similar. I let myself into the apartment, whichhad an absentee-wife look, and took a cold shower. The present downtowntemperature, according to the radio, was eighty-seven degrees, butaccording to my Greenwich Village thermometer, it was ninety-six. I gotdressed and went into the living room, and wished ardently that mywife Molly were here to tell me why the whole place looked so woebegone.     What do they do, I asked myself, that I have left undone? I've vacuumedthe carpet, I've dusted and I've straightened the cushions.... Ah! Theashtrays. I emptied them, washed them and put them back, but still theplace looked wife-deserted.     It had been a bad day; I had forgotten to wind the alarm clock, so I'dhad to hurry to make a story conference at one of the TV studios Iwrite for. I didn't notice the impending rain storm and had no umbrellawhen I reached the sidewalk, to find myself confronted with an almosttropical downpour. I would have turned back, but a taxi came up and awoman got out, so I dashed through the rain and got in.     Madison and Fifty-fourth, I said.     Right, said the driver, and I heard the starter grind, and then goon grinding. After some futile efforts, he turned to me. Sorry, Mac.You'll have to find another cab. Good hunting.     If possible, it was raining still harder. I opened my newspaper overmy hat and ran for the subway: three blocks. Whizzing traffic heldme up at each crossing and I was soaked when I reached the platform,just in time to miss the local. After an abnormal delay, I got onewhich exactly missed the express at Fourteenth Street. The same thinghappened at both ends of the crosstown shuttle, but I found the rainhad stopped when I got out at Fifty-first and Lexington.  "

        "Summary_1": "McGill is an assistant mathematics professor at a nearby university. He is friends with both Alec and Molly, even calling to ask about the both of them. He is considered to be highly imaginative, but they believe that he knows everything. Personality-wise, McGill is a very logical person. He believes that what Alec has told him is normally impossible, and the odds against it are very astronomical as well. Even when Alec shows him what has happened to him, he continues to pursue a logical explanation. However, despite these theories, he tries to approach these findings logically and tells Alec not to be superstitious when they initially discuss why this is happening to him. ",
        "Summary_2": "McGill works at a university as an assistant professor of mathematics. He is known to be extremely intelligent, as well as imaginative, as Alec describes him. McGill is eager to help Alec explain his improbable luck, both out of friendship and excitement by his passion for science. Though McGill is imaginative, he is also skeptical and not easily gullible, as shown when he is wary of Alec's legitimacy behind his claims. However, he can easily think outside of the box, and uses his knowledge of science to propose unheard possibilities.",

He is described as being very imaginative, but his advice is held in high regard. He is quick to help Alec after a simple phone call with no explanation of Alec\u2019s need.

He is open to anything and considers every possibility, even the impossible and supernatural as long as he doesn't have any other explanation.

When I picked up the receiver, the line sounded dead and I thought,      more     trouble. Then I heard a man cough and I said hello. McGill'svoice said, Alec? You must have picked up the receiver just as we wereconnected. That's a damn funny coincidence.     Not in the least, I said. Come on over here. I've got something foryou to work on.

If all this, as you call it, will let us.     In the lobby, we ran into Nat, looking smug in a journalistic way.     I've been put on the story\u2014who could be better?\u2014I live here. So far,I don't quite get what's been happening. I've been talking to Danny,but he didn't say much. I got the feeling he thinks you're involved insome mystical, Hibernian way. Hello, McGill, what's with you?     He's got a theory, said Molly. Come and eat with us and he'll tellyou all about it.     Since we decided on an air-conditioned restaurant nearby on SixthAvenue, we walked. The jam of cars didn't seem to be any less thanbefore and we saw Danny again. He was talking to a police lieutenant,and when he caught sight of us, he said something that made thelieutenant look at us with interest. Particularly at me.     If you want your umbrella, Mrs. Graham, Danny said, it's at thestation house. What there's left of it, that is.     Molly thanked him and there was a short pause, during which I feltthe speculative regard of the lieutenant. I pulled out a packet ofcigarettes, which I had opened, as always, by tearing off the top. Ihappened to have it upside down and all the cigarettes fell out. BeforeI could move my foot to obliterate what they had spelled out on thesidewalk, the two cops saw it. The lieutenant gave me a hard look, butsaid nothing. I quickly kicked the insulting cigarettes into the gutter.     When we got to the restaurant, it was crowded but cool\u2014although itdidn't stay cool for long. We sat down at a side table near the doorand ordered Tom Collinses as we looked at the menu. Sitting at thenext table were a fat lady, wearing a very long, brilliant greenevening gown, and a dried-up sour-looking man in a tux. When the waiterreturned, they preempted him and began ordering dinner fussily: coldcuts for the man, and vichyssoise, lobster salad and strawberry parfaitfor the fat lady.     I tasted my drink. It was most peculiar; salt seemed to have been usedinstead of sugar. I mentioned this and my companions tried theirs, andmade faces.   <doc-sep> Danny appeared at that moment. His face was dripping. You all right,Mr. Graham? he asked. I don't know what's going on around here, butever since I came on this afternoon, things are going crazy. Bartley!he shouted\u2014he could succeed as a hog-caller. Bring those dames overhere!     Three women in a confused wrangle, with their half-open umbrellasintertwined, were brought across the street, which meant climbing overfenders. Bartley, a fine young patrolman, seemed self-conscious; theladies seemed not to be.     All right, now, Mrs. Mac-Philip! one of them said. Leave go of myumbrella and we'll say no more about it!     And so now it's Missus Mac-Philip, is it? said her adversary.     The third, a younger one with her back turned to us, her umbrella alsocaught in the tangle, pulled at it in a tentative way, at which theother two glared at her. She turned her head away and tried to let go,but the handle was caught in her glove. She looked up and I saw it wasMolly. My nurse-wife.     Oh, Alec! she said, and managed to detach herself. Are you allright? Was      I     all right!     Molly! What are you doing here?     I was so worried, and when I saw all this, I didn't know what tothink. She pointed to the stalled cars. Are you really all right?     Of course I'm all right. But why....     The Oyster Bay operator said someone kept dialing and dialing Mother'snumber and there wasn't anyone on the line, so then she had it tracedand it came from our phone here. I kept calling up, but I only got abusy signal. Oh, dear, are you      sure     you're all right?     I put my arm around her and glanced at McGill. He had an inward look.Then I caught Danny's eye. It had a thoughtful, almost suspicious castto it.     Trouble does seem to follow you, Mr. Graham, was all he said.     When we got upstairs, I turned to McGill. Explain to Molly, I said.And incidentally to me. I'm not properly briefed yet.     He did so, and when he got to the summing up, I had the feeling she wasa jump ahead of him.     In other words, you think it's something organic?     Well, McGill said, I'm trying to think of anything else it might be.I'm not doing so well, he confessed.     But so far as I can see, Molly answered, it's mere probability, andwithout any over-all pattern.     Not quite. It has a center. Alec is the center.  "

Molly is depicted as a caring and nurturing wife, shown particularly through the notes that she leaves Alec as he stays home alone. The notes, instructing Alec on housekeeping, also imply that Molly takes on a more dominant role in the household, knowing how to tend to a home and sustain the both of them.

If you want your umbrella, Mrs. Graham, Danny said, it's at thestation house. What there's left of it, that is.     Molly thanked him and there was a short pause, during which I feltthe speculative regard of the lieutenant. I pulled out a packet ofcigarettes, which I had opened, as always, by tearing off the top. Ihappened to have it upside down and all the cigarettes fell out. BeforeI could move my foot to obliterate what they had spelled out on thesidewalk, the two cops saw it. The lieutenant gave me a hard look, butsaid nothing. I quickly kicked the insulting cigarettes into the gutter.     When we got to the restaurant, it was crowded but cool\u2014although itdidn't stay cool for long. We sat down at a side table near the doorand ordered Tom Collinses as we looked at the menu. Sitting at thenext table were a fat lady, wearing a very long, brilliant greenevening gown, and a dried-up sour-looking man in a tux. When the waiterreturned, they preempted him and began ordering dinner fussily: coldcuts for the man, and vichyssoise, lobster salad and strawberry parfaitfor the fat lady.     I tasted my drink. It was most peculiar; salt seemed to have been usedinstead of sugar. I mentioned this and my companions tried theirs, andmade faces.   <doc-sep> Danny appeared at that moment. His face was dripping. You all right,Mr. Graham? he asked. I don't know what's going on around here, butever since I came on this afternoon, things are going crazy. Bartley!he shouted\u2014he could succeed as a hog-caller. Bring those dames overhere!     Three women in a confused wrangle, with their half-open umbrellasintertwined, were brought across the street, which meant climbing overfenders. Bartley, a fine young patrolman, seemed self-conscious; theladies seemed not to be.     All right, now, Mrs. Mac-Philip! one of them said. Leave go of myumbrella and we'll say no more about it!     And so now it's Missus Mac-Philip, is it? said her adversary.     The third, a younger one with her back turned to us, her umbrella alsocaught in the tangle, pulled at it in a tentative way, at which theother two glared at her. She turned her head away and tried to let go,but the handle was caught in her glove. She looked up and I saw it wasMolly. My nurse-wife.     Oh, Alec! she said, and managed to detach herself. Are you allright? Was      I     all right!     Molly! What are you doing here?     I was so worried, and when I saw all this, I didn't know what tothink. She pointed to the stalled cars. Are you really all right?     Of course I'm all right. But why....     The Oyster Bay operator said someone kept dialing and dialing Mother'snumber and there wasn't anyone on the line, so then she had it tracedand it came from our phone here. I kept calling up, but I only got abusy signal. Oh, dear, are you      sure     you're all right?     I put my arm around her and glanced at McGill. He had an inward look.Then I caught Danny's eye. It had a thoughtful, almost suspicious castto it.     Trouble does seem to follow you, Mr. Graham, was all he said.     When we got upstairs, I turned to McGill. Explain to Molly, I said.And incidentally to me. I'm not properly briefed yet.     He did so, and when he got to the summing up, I had the feeling she wasa jump ahead of him.     In other words, you think it's something organic?     Well, McGill said, I'm trying to think of anything else it might be.I'm not doing so well, he confessed.     But so far as I can see, Molly answered, it's mere probability, andwithout any over-all pattern.     Not quite. It has a center. Alec is the center.   <doc-sep>    Bridge Crossing     BY DAVE DRYFOOS     Illustrated by HARRISON     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Galaxy Science Fiction May 1951.

But who was his enemy?      In 1849, the mist that sometimes rolled through the Golden Gate wasknown as fog. In 2149, it had become far more frequent, and was knownas smog. By 2349, it was fog again.     But tonight there was smoke mixed with the fog. Roddie could smell it.Somewhere in the forested ruins, fire was burning.     He wasn't worried. The small blaze that smoldered behind him on thecracked concrete floor had consumed everything burnable within blocks;what remained of the gutted concrete office building from which hepeered was fire-proof.     But Roddie was himself aflame with anger. As always when Invaders brokein from the north, he'd been left behind with his nurse, Molly, whilethe soldiers went out to fight.     And nowadays Molly's presence wasn't the comfort it used to be. He feltalmost ready to jump out of his skin, the way she rocked and knitted inthat grating ruined chair, saying over and over again, The soldiersdon't      want     little boys. The soldiers don't      want     little boys. Thesoldiers don't\u2014     I'm      not     a little boy! Roddie suddenly shouted. I'm full-grown andI've never even      seen     an Invader. Why won't you let me go and fight?     Fiercely he crossed the bare, gritty floor and shook Molly's shoulder.She rattled under his jarring hand, and abruptly changed the subject.     A is for Atom, B is for Bomb, C is for Corpse\u2014 she chanted.     Roddie reached into her shapeless dress and pinched. Lately that hadhelped her over these spells. But this time, though it stopped thekindergarten song, the treatment only started something worse.     Wuzzums hungry? Molly cooed, still rocking.     Utterly disgusted, Roddie ripped her head off her neck.     It was a completely futile gesture. The complicated mind that hadcared for him and taught him speech and the alphabet hadn't made him amechanic, and his only tool was a broken-handled screwdriver.  "

        "Query": "How does Alec's mood change as a result of the unusual coincidences that occur in the story \"I am a Nucleus\"?",
        "Summary_1": "Alec is tired, upset, and confused about the strange coincidences relating to him. When he first goes home, he is extremely tired and compares his day to be the same as being beaten down. Judging from the events throughout his workday, he does not understand how they all relate to him and thinks of them as extremely weird coincidences. He even thinks of himself as being coincidence-prone. After the soda incident, however, he no longer finds it surprising after all that has happened to him. As the events build up, Alec slowly realizes that he is the center of it all, and he knows that he cannot get out of it. No matter how hard he tries, he directly interacts with or is nearby becomes strange coincidences. ",
        "Summary_2": "As the strange coincidences occur in the story, Alec becomes increasingly frustrated. However, instead of driving him to the point of rage, the frustration drives him to exhaustion. At the beginning of the story, Alec already describes himself as feeling beaten down due to the morning's events. He feels more and more defeated as the day goes on, but also becomes more and more perplexed and fascinated. By the end of the story, Alec feels both helpless due to his uncontrollable bad luck and eager to find an explanation for this rare scenario, seeking other people for help and validation.",
        "Summary_3": "For a large portion of the story, Alec is very casual about the strange coincidences that occur. He acknowledges them but does not fuss over them as much as those who also see them. When he is told that he just missed being stuck in his office building\u2019s elevators, he brushes it off as another coincidence. He does the same when his pencil lands on the floor standing on its end. Towards the end of the story, he grows more aware of the coincidences and becomes frustrated with them. The story ends with him getting into a heated argument at a restaurant when it is assumed that he purposefully flew his cigarette at an occupied table. ",
        "Summary_4": "The first coincidences are just some bad luck as Alec thinks. When one oversleeps something important and is in a hurry, series of delaying events can happen as some bad luck. He is simply nervous about missing the conference, and tired of constant failures. It'[s also hard for him to live without his wife, his place looks wife-deserted which upsets him and this is the part of the reasons for his tardiness. When his absence isn't noticed, he returns home in a better mood and tries to write. Nothing helps though and Alec is stuck. Unnatural events start happening which distract him, at first, they simply surprise Alec. Later, they become more strong, often highly improbable - not breaking bottles, traffic, especially the three knots on the curtain. These ones look impossible to Alec and therefore scare him, so he calls McGill for a consultation. Further evidence convinces Alec in him being the center of a huge mess. He is confused and tries to hide his failures from the overseers.",
        "Article": "Upstairs, the wind was blowing into the apartment and I closed thewindows, mainly to shut out the tumult and the shouting. Nat hadbrightened up considerably.     I'll stay for one more drink and then I'm due at the office, he said.You know, I think this would make an item for the paper. He grinnedand nodded toward the pandemonium.     When he was gone, I noticed it was getting dark and turned on the desklamp. Then I saw the curtains. They were all tied in knots, exceptone. That was tied in three knots.     All      right     , I told myself, it was the wind. But I felt the time hadcome for me to get expert advice, so I went to the phone to callMcGill. McGill is an assistant professor of mathematics at a universityuptown and lives near us. He is highly imaginative, but we believe heknows everything.     When I picked up the receiver, the line sounded dead and I thought,      more     trouble. Then I heard a man cough and I said hello. McGill'svoice said, Alec? You must have picked up the receiver just as we wereconnected. That's a damn funny coincidence.     Not in the least, I said. Come on over here. I've got something foryou to work on.     Well, as a matter of fact, I was calling up to ask you and Molly\u2014     Molly's away for the week. Can you get over here quick? It's urgent.     At once, he said, and hung up.     While I waited, I thought I might try getting down a few paragraphs ofmy novel\u2014perhaps something would come now. It did, but as I came to apoint where I was about to put down the word agurgling, I decided itwas too reminiscent of Gilbert and Sullivan, and stopped at the letterR. Then I saw that I had unaccountably hit all four keys one step tothe side of the correct ones, and tore out the page, with my face red.     This was absolutely not my day.   <doc-sep> Molly looked at me with a curious expression for a moment. Do you      feel     all right, darling? she asked me. I nodded brightly. You'llthink this silly of me, she went on to McGill, but why isn't itsomething like an overactive poltergeist?     Pure concept, he said. No genuine evidence.     Magnetism?     Absolutely not. For one thing, most of the objects affected weren'tmagnetic\u2014and don't forget magnetism is a force, not a form of energy,and a great deal of energy has been involved. I admit the energy hasmainly been supplied by the things themselves, but in a magnetic field,all you'd get would be stored kinetic energy, such as when a piece ofiron moves to a magnet or a line of force. Then it would just staythere, like a rundown clock weight. These things do a lot more thanthat\u2014they go on moving.     Why did you mention a crystal before? Why not a life-form?     Only an analogy, said McGill. A crystal resembles life in that ithas a definite shape and exhibits growth, but that's all. I'll agreethis\u2014thing\u2014has no discernible shape and motion      is     involved, butplants don't move and amebas have no shape. Then a crystal feeds, butit does not convert what it feeds on; it merely rearranges it into anon-random pattern. In this case, it's rearranging random motions andit has a nucleus and it seems to be growing\u2014at least in what you mightcall improbability.     Molly frowned. Then what      is     it? What's it made of?     I should say it was made of the motions. There's a similar idea aboutthe atom. Another thing that's like a crystal is that it appears tobe forming around a nucleus not of its own material\u2014the way a speckof sand thrown into a supersaturated solution becomes the nucleus ofcrystallization.     Sounds like the pearl in an oyster, Molly said, and gave me animpertinent look.     Why, I asked McGill, did you say the coins couldn't have the samedate? I mean apart from the off chance I got them that way.     Because I don't think this thing got going before today andeverything that's happened can all be described as improbable motionshere and now. The dates were already there, and to change them wouldrequire retroactive action, reversing time. That's out, in my book.That telephone now\u2014     The doorbell rang. We were not surprised to find it was the telephonerepairman. He took the set apart and clucked like a hen.     I guess you dropped it on the floor, mister, he said with strongdisapproval.     Certainly not, I said. Is it broken?     Not exactly      broken     , but\u2014 He shook his head and took it apart somemore.   <doc-sep> At first glance Theodor thought the Deep Space Bar was empty.

        "Summary_1": "Peter Karson has finished planning out the blueprint for the Citadel. He is excited to see it be built and go off into space to collect new information. Something suddenly snaps him out of his fantasy. Fifty stories above the window, there is a blood-red and subtly inhuman face staring back at him. The face slowly disappears, but he is stunned by the image. He then shakingly lights a cigarette and turns on the newsbox to see that an invader has appeared in Boston. More disasters are listed below, and the World Police announces that the Invaders have already begun terrorizing the world since they appeared twenty-four hours ago. Peter is doubtful that they can take down the Invaders and goes to Lorelei Cooper\u2019s laboratory. Lorelei does not know what is happening because Harry and she have been working for thirty-six hours straight. She does not have a newsbox, but he tells her to turn on her scanner to see the news. The panel shows the Science City of Manhattan, but the Invaders have come and snatched up men and women. Slowly, two Invaders make their way to the Atlas building, where Peter and Lorelei are. He goes into the inner room, even though she yells at him not to go. The Invaders have reduced Harry to nothing but a puddle of flesh, and Peter begins to ask why they are doing this desperately. They whisper to him in a strange language; he suddenly realizes that Lorelei has followed him. She drops to the floor after looking at the Invaders, which makes Peter scream. When he awakes again, a doctor named Arnold tells him to lie back down and that he is in a hospital. Although Dr. Arnold initially tells him that he has been in the hospital for three months, he eventually finds out that it has already been nine and a half months since he went into his coma. All of the survivors are underground because nobody knew how to kill the Invaders. Peter is considered their last hope because he is a scientist, and he thinks back to his plan of the Citadel. The ship is built, and it is called The Avenger instead. Lorelei tries to plead with Peter, but he refuses and says that it must be him who finds a superman that can destroy the Invaders. He goes into space until the ship curves into orbit. Peter kills many of the changeling children, but he allows one to live. The child is named Robert and is considered to be a super-intelligent being. Peter is hopeful that the changeling can kill the Invaders, but Robert says he will not return to Earth. He explains that they are like kin to him, and he logically has no reason to kill him. Peter is shocked and tries to plead with Robert, but the superman does not understand emotions. Robert does not feel good about the expression on Peter\u2019s face, and he hastens to an inevitable end. ",
        "Summary_2": "Blood is dripping from a dead body in the room, Peter Karson. The story moves to the past, when young Peter finished the project of 'Citadel' - a spaceship to set off to an orbit. 'Citadel' was supposed to be a huge well-equipped laboratory, the first of its kind. While imagining the greatness of the creation, Peter felt dread and saw a face staring at him outside the window, fifty stories up. The face was scary and inhuman, the body hung without support for a while and then disappeared. Everything around was normal and Peter was worried he had gone mad. Then he saw the red headlines in the newspapers about appearing invaders and disappearing people. Cities worldwide were attacked and the World Police were mobilizing. The news proclaimed that the greatest enemy was to be faced and defeated. Peter rushed downstairs to Lorelei's laboratory, who had been working without breaks and hadn't seen the news. After Peter's agonized pleas, Lorelei turned on the news and saw a video of people becoming an unrecognizable joined mass, helpless and suffering. Then the two saw their own building in the news and halted. Peter went towards the inner room despite Lorelei's protests. He saw two aliens staring at Harry, Lorelei's assistant, and turning him into a boneless mess. Peter was so shocked that he screamed \"why?\" and heard some incomprehensible whisper in his head in response. Suddenly, Peter saw that Lorelei had followed him and her body dropped to the floor. Peter screamed inhumanely loudly and faded. He woke up in a hospital, the doctor said he had been very sick for three months and that Lorelei was fine. When Peter kept asking, he finally learned that he had been in a coma for more than nine months because of the rather long contact he had had with the invaders. Lorelei was simply shocked and recovered much faster. Arnold, the doctor, finally decided that Peter was strong enough to learn the truth and told about the part of humanity hiding underground as killing the aliens turned out to be impossible. Peter was needed as a scientist. His 'Citadel' project contained everything necessary to live a lifetime, it was a new independent world to save the rest of humanity. So, it was renamed 'The Avenger' and finished, as life underground was not a solution but a delay. Lorelei was in despair because of Peter boarding the ship and wanted to follow, but the rays were strong and even Peter had low chances of staying alive. When 'The Avenger' reached orbit, Peter felt the rays burning his flesh and smashed the mirrors to allow the embryos to mature. After a long time Peter told the story to Robert, the mutation-child with a superior brain who could destroy the invaders. Robert refused to go to Earth as his brain was logical and saw no reasons to destroy the Invaders. Peter didn't understand and the inevitable end approached. ",
        "Summary_3": "The story opens with the character Peter Karson dead, as the narrator, identity unknown, contemplates their emptiness after killing him. The narrator says that they do not regret doing so, but they are unable to explain their emotions as they feel a tear rolling down their cheek. The story then goes back to a younger Peter as he finishes his project, the development of the Citadel spaceship. He suddenly hears a strange whisper within his brain, and he turns around to see a face with a shriveled body staring at him through the window. The creature slowly dissolves and disappears, and Peter is left stunned. He finds breaking news of invasions all over the world, murdering hundreds of civilians. The invaders, according to Secretary of the Council, are from outer space, and the World Police is attempting to destroy them. Peter rushes downstairs to find Lorelei, his lover, in the laboratory. She is unaware of the news, and upon seeing footage of the gruesome attacks, she is shocked, and they soon see the invaders approaching their building from the television. Peter steps into another room, seeing the two creatures with their focus on Harry Kanin, Lorelei's assistant. To Peter's horror, Harry quickly becomes a limp pile of flesh. Peter confronts the creatures but only hears foreign whispers, as Lorelei drops to the floor behind him. Peter lets out a scream, and wakes up in a hospital. The doctor tells him that he has been there in a coma for over nine months, and that Lorelei had recovered from shock. The doctor then tells Peter that society has moved to living underground in order to avoid the invaders; Peter, as a scientist, is their last hope. Later, Peter approaches the newly crafted spaceship, titled The Avenger, which lacks the typical shield to protect one from cosmic rays. Lorelei begs Peter not to go, but he believes it is necessary, and too much of a risk for Lorelei to join him. He boards the ship with the mission to create a \"superman\" to ultimately defeat the invaders; the plan is to allow the cosmic rays to mutate several embryos on board, hopefully creating a strong enough being. As The Avenger leaves and goes into orbit, Peter begins feeling the effects of the rays as his skin and hair mutates. As time passes, he allows the embryos to develop, destroying all but one. He raises the embryo as it develops into a person, and the story jumps many years later, as the child becomes a man named Robert. Peter had raised Robert, with a superior brain and logical ability, to be the defeater of the invaders. Informing Robert of the plan to return back to Earth, Robert surprisingly refuses. Peter is taken aback, and Robert explains that he is not able to comprehend the emotions that would lead him to kill the invaders and save Earthmen. Peter begs helplessly, and Robert ultimately feels it inevitable to kill him. ",

He finishes his work for the moment and turns on the news to discover horrifying imagery and chaos being reported. He runs to Lorelei Cooper\u2019s laboratory to go share the disturbing news with her. Lorelei and Peter have a romantic relationship. He asks Lorelei to turn on the news and she is shocked by the imagery that is being detailed. Both Peter and Lorelei become stunned when they realize that the invaders to Earth are headed towards their building. They hold each other in stunned silence until they hear a scream from Lorelei\u2019s assistant, Harry Kanin. Peter goes out to investigate and discovers the Invaders turning Harry\u2019s body into nothing but flesh. Unbeknownst to Peter, Lorelei followed him and when the Invaders are done with Harry they begin to focus on her to Peter\u2019s terror.\n\nPeter then wakes up in a hospital bed. After much prodding, he is eventually informed that he has been in a coma for a little over nine months. He is told that humans are losing the fight against the Invaders and have retreated to living underground. He is soon informed that he must gain back his strength because as a scientist he is much needed in the fight against the Invaders.\n\nThe story then goes into detail about how Peter has been chosen to go to space on the Avenger ship and raise a viable embryo that has successfully mutated due to cosmic rays. The resulting person will then be used to fight against the Invaders. He does this while orbiting space on the ship. He destroys the inappropriate creations and keeps one embryo that sees as potential. That would grow up to be Robert. Many years have passed as he raises Robert. Eventually, he tells Robert the story of how he was created and details the mission that he is meant to carry out. Robert has great brain prowess due to his mutations and Peter is hopeful that he will be able to successfully fight against the invaders.\n\nHowever, Robert soon informs Peter that he will not go through with the plan. He reasons that he does not experience emotion and has no reason to care for the humans on Earth.

He was big even for his kind\u2014in the neighborhood of nine feet high,and getting on toward a ton. He planted himself firmly on his threestocky feet, extended his massive arms in a Kallerian greeting-gesture,and growled, I am Vallo Heraal, Freeman of Kaller IV.

        "Query": "What is the backdrop of THE AVENGER story?",
        "Summary_1": "The story is first set inside Peter\u2019s office. There is a window that he initially sees the Invader through. The window can see up to fifty stories high. There is also a desk with a newsbox on it, where he lights his cigarette. His office also has a chair. Many places worldwide are mentioned too, such as London, Hong Kong, Paris, and Boston. Lorelei\u2019s laboratory is two stories down the moving ramp. It is behind a door marked \u201cRadiation\u201d, and there is also a door mechanism with a password set to \u201cEtaoin Shrdlu\u201d. Lorelei owns a scanner, a video panel on the wall that is initially covered in papers. There is also an inner room with an X-ray chamber. The building they are in is called the Atlas building. After Peter wakes from his coma, the story is set in a hospital underground. There is a metal stand and a bed for Peter to lie on. When he goes off with the mission to bring back a superman, the ship exits from the underground launch chamber and goes into space. Peter goes past the Moon, past Mars, and over the asteroid belt. From his distance, Earth is a tiny blue star. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story begins in a silent room with only blood dripping from Peter Karson's dead body. The stars are visible from the window. Then the story goes back in time, to when Peter was a young scientist. He was completing the project of 'Citadel' on paper and imagining his creation. It was supposed to be a huge metal laboratory-spaceship. The ship was to have many levels of laboratories and storerooms, the meteor deflectors, the air renewal system and the mighty engines. Suddenly, Peter felt some kind of dread around, he looked out from the window of his office and saw a horrible creature fifty stories up. Then he took the newspapers from his newsboy and saw the headlines about the invaders. He rushed two floors down through the staircase to the radioactive laboratory, where Lorelei, his girlfriend, was working. She was in the forest corner with a huge ledger. The two went to the scanner to watch the news and suddenly saw their own building, a tall, pure white structure. The silence was oppressive. Peter moved towards the inner room and confronted the aliens. Then he woke up in a sort of hospital after a long coma, he couldn't understand where he was and for how long. All the major cities were destroyed. People were digging to hide underground, but it was a delay rather than a solution. A new ship 'The Avenger' was built following the model of 'Citadel'. 'The Avenger' wasn't that big as 'Citadel' was supposed to be, it was a steel globe with compressed oxygen and concentrated food enough for a lifetime. Peter boarded the ship and sealed the door, then he sank down on the floor, knowing his low chances of staying alive. He closed the inner door and walked to the control room. He turned the keys and was pressed into the chair. He passed the moon and Mars and reached orbit. He felt the rays burning him there and broke the windows. For years he watched the embryos grow until Robert, the needed mutation, appeared. Peter fed him with knowledge for years. Earth was a tiny blue star far away, where many more years passed. When Robert refused to save the Earth, everything came to an end. ",
        "Summary_3": "The beginning of the story takes place on Earth, in the Atlas building in the science city Manhattan. The building is a tall, white structure, with about fifty floors. The building contains both Peter's office, where he works on the Citadel, and Lorelei's laboratory, located two stories below. The laboratory contains several rooms, scattered with machinery and papers, with a video panel on the wall. After Peter's encounter with the invaders, he wakes up in a hospital, and he is then taken to the relocated city underground. The final part of the story takes place aboard The Avenger, a ship like others, except supplied with sufficient food and without cosmic ray shields. ",
        "Summary_4": "The story begins in a laboratory in New York City where Peter is working on a ship in his part of the building. Upon seeing disturbing news on the TV, he runs to Lorelei\u2019s lab which is further down into the building. The building they both work in is the Atlas building. After the Invaders attack their building and seemingly kill Lorelei, Peter wakes up in a hospital room. He is able to leave and meet up with Lorelei \u2013 who is actually alive- in an underground city once he recovers. Peter then goes on a mission to orbit space on the Avenger ship in hopes of finding an embryo that has mutated in a manner that could help save Earth. This process takes years and he reaches an old age completing this mission on the ship. ",

They had seen many such stars come near out of the galaxy's glitteringbackdrop, and had seen them dwindle, turn red and go out as the      QuestIII     drove on its way once more, lashed by despair toward the speed oflight, leaving behind the mockery of yet another solitary and lifelessluminary unaccompanied by worlds where men might dwell.

It was a subdued excitement; men and women, theycame and stood quietly gazing into the big vision screens that showedthe oncoming star, and there were wide-eyed children who had been bornin the ship and had never seen a planet.

There was no sound in the room except for the small splashing theblood made as it dropped into the sticky pool on the floor. The greatbanks of machinery around the walls were silent. I knew that they wouldnever come to life again.         I rose and walked over to the window. Outside, the stars were asbefore: tiny, myriad points of light, infinitely far away. They had notchanged, and yet they were suddenly no longer friendly. They were coldand alien. It was I who had changed: something inside me was dead, likethe machinery, and like Peter.         It was a kind of indefinable emptiness. I do not think it was whatPeter called an emotion; and yet it had nothing to do with logic,either.

When Lorelei sees Peter, she calls him \u201cmy love\u201d and \u201cdarling.\u201d She puts her hands on his shoulders too and kisses him impulsively as a sign of affection. Peter cares greatly about Lorelei, too, as she was the first person he went to find after seeing the news about the Invaders. When he tries to investigate, she clings to him and pleads for him not to go. However, she follows along too, and he is horrified at what might happen to her. After Lorelei passes out, Peter cannot help but let out a scream. Even when he wakes up from his coma, the first thing he thinks about is Lorelei and repeatedly asks where she is. Lorelei continues to beg Peter not to leave on The Avenger and asks him to reconsider. He does not want to go, but he tells her that it is the only solution. She cries, and he goes on remorselessly even though it hurts him. Lorelei wants to come along too; Peter cares too much and tells her that he could not stand seeing her change from somebody beautiful because of the rays. Although they say farewell to each other and Lorelei affirms that he will come back, Peter does not trust himself to kiss her goodbye. ",
        "Summary_2": "Peter and Lorelei are in love. They care for each other a lot - Lorelei begs Peter not to go towards any danger, and he doesn't want her to follow. They are also very tender and find tranquility in each other. In face of danger they embrace each other or kiss. The two also work together in the same building within a two floors distance. They know each other's habits - the lock on the laboratory, the lack of newsboy at Lorelei's. Peter worries for her more than for himself, and losing his girlfriend means his own death to him, that's the reason he gives for her not to follow him to the orbit. He also considers Lorelei very beautiful even when tired, and her beauty matters a lot for him - he says he won't handle its loss on the spaceship.",
        "Summary_3": "Peter and Lorelei are romantically involved. Their relationship is loving and serious, which is apparent from their first interaction in the story as Peter meets her in the laboratory. Peter feels protective over Lorelei, especially given the recent invasions and dangers. When Lorelei appears to be hurt by the invaders, Peter lets out a shrilling scream and blacks out.

        "Article": "Somebody said, Doctor!     He wanted to say, Yes, get a doctor. Lorelei\u2014 but his mouth onlytwitched feebly. He couldn't seem to get it to work properly.     He tried again. Doctor.     Yes? A gentle, masculine voice.     He opened his eyes with an effort. There was a blurred face before him;in a moment it grew clearer. The strong, clean-shaven chin contrastedoddly with the haggard circles under the eyes. There was a clean,starched odor.     Where am I? he said. He tried to turn his head, but a firm handpressed him back into the sheets.     You're in a hospital. Just lie quietly, please.     He tried to get up again. Where's Lorelei?     She's well, and you'll see her soon. Now lie quietly. You've been avery sick man.     Peter sank back in the bed. The room was coming into focus. He lookedaround him slowly. He felt very weak, but perfectly lucid.     Yes.... he said. How long have I been here, Doctor?     The man hesitated, looked at him intently. Three months, he said. Heturned and gave low-voiced instructions to a nurse, and then went away.     Peter's head began spinning just a little. Glass clinked from a metalstand near his head; the nurse bent over him with a glass half full ofmilky fluid. It tasted awful, but she made him drink it all.     In a moment he began to relax, and the room got fuzzy again. Justbefore he drifted off, he said sleepily, You can't\u2014fool me. It's been      more     \u2014than three\u2014months.     He was right. All the nurses, and even Dr. Arnold, were evasive, but hekept asking them why he couldn't see Lorelei, and finally he wormed itout of them. It had been nine and a half months, not three, and he'dbeen in a coma all that time. Lorelei, it seemed, had recovered muchsooner.     She was only suffering from ordinary shock, Arnold explained.Seeing that assistant of hers\u2014it was enough to knock anybody out,especially a woman. But you stood actual mental contact with      them     for approximately five minutes. Yes, we know\u2014you talked a lot. It's amiracle you're alive, and rational.     But where is she? Peter complained. You still haven't explained whyI haven't been able to see her.     Arnold frowned. All right, he said. I guess you're strong enough totake it. She's underground, with the rest of the women and children,and a good two-thirds of the male population. That's where you'll go,as soon as you're well enough to be moved. We started digging in sixmonths ago.     But why? Peter whispered.     Arnold's strong jaw knotted. We're hiding, he said. Everything elsehas failed.     Peter couldn't think of anything to say. Dr. Arnold's voice went onafter a moment, musingly. We're burrowing into the earth, like worms.It didn't take us long to find out we couldn't kill them. They didn'teven take any notice of our attempts to do so, except once. That waswhen a squadron of the Police caught about fifty of them together atone time, and attacked with flame guns and a new secret weapon. Itdidn't hurt them, but it annoyed them. It was the first time they'dbeen annoyed, I think. They blew up half a state, and it's stillsmoldering.     And since then? Peter asked huskily.     Since then, we've been burrowing. All the big cities.... It would bean impossible task if we tried to include all the thinly-populatedareas, of course, but it doesn't matter. By the time we excavateenough to take care of a quarter of the earth's population, the otherthree-quarters will be dead, or worse.     I wonder, Peter said shakily, if I am strong enough to take it.     Arnold laughed harshly. You are. You've got to be. You're part of ourlast hope, you see.     Our last hope?     Yes. You're a scientist.     I see, said Peter. And for the first time, he thought of the      Citadel     . No plan leaped full-born into his mind, but,      maybe     , hethought,      there's a chance     ....   <doc-sep> It wasn't very big, the thing that had been his shining dream. It laythere in its rough cradle, a globe of raw dura-steel not more thanfive hundred meters in diameter, where the      Citadel     was to have been athousand. It wouldn't house a hundred scientists, eagerly delving intothe hinterland of research. The huge compartments weren't filled withthe latest equipment for chemical and physical experiment; instead,there was compressed oxygen there, and concentrated food, enough tolast a lifetime.     It was a new world, all by itself; or else it was a tomb. And there wasone other change, one that you couldn't see from the outside. The solidmeters of lead in its outer skin, the shielding to keep out cosmicrays, were gone.     A man had just finished engraving the final stroke on its nameplate, tothe left of the airlock\u2014      The Avenger     . He stepped away now, and joinedthe group a little distance away, silently waiting.     Lorelei said, You can't do it. I won't let you! Peter\u2014     Darling, he began wearily.     Don't throw your life away! Give us time\u2014there must be another way.     There's no other way, Peter said. He gripped her arms tightly, as ifhe could compel her to understand by the sheer pressure of his fingers.Darling, listen to me. We've tried everything. We've gone underground,but that's only delaying the end.      They     still come down here, only notas many. The mortality rate is up, the suicide rate is up, the birthrate is down, in spite of anything we can do. You've seen the figures:we're riding a curve that ends in extinction fifty years from now.     They'll live, and we'll die, because they're a superior race. We're amillion years too far back even to understand what they are or wherethey came from. Besides them, we're apes. There's only one answer.     She was crying now, silently, with great racking sobs that shook herslender body. But he went remorselessly on.     Out there, in space, the cosmics change unshielded life. Theymake tentacles out of arms; or scales out of hair; or twelve toes,or a dozen ears\u2014or a better brain. Out of those millions ofpossible mutations, there's one that will save the human race. Wecan't fight      them     , but a superman could. That's our only chance.Lorelei\u2014darling\u2014don't you see that?     She choked, But why can't you take me along?     He stared unseeingly past her wet, upturned face. You know why, hesaid bitterly. Those rays are strong. They don't only work on embryos;they change adult life forms, too. I have one chance in seven ofstaying alive. You'd have one chance in a million of staying beautiful.I couldn't stand that. I'd kill myself, and then humanity would die,too. You'd be their murderer.     Her sobs gradually died away. She straightened slowly until he nolonger had to support her, but all the vitality and resilience was goneout of her body. All right, she said in a lifeless voice. You'llcome back, Peter.     He turned away suddenly, not trusting himself to kiss her goodbye. Aline from an old film kept echoing through his head.       They'll     comeback\u2014but not as      boys     !     We'll come back, but not as men.     We'll come back, but not as elephants.     We'll come back, but not as octopi.   <doc-sep> Peter forced himself forward another step. Little Harry Kanin,Lorelei's assistant, was crumpled in a corner, half supported by thebroad base of an X-ray chamber. His face was flaccid and bloated. Hisglazed eyes, impassive yet somehow pleading, stared at nothingnessstraight ahead of him.     The Invaders ignored Peter, staring expressionlessly down at Kanin.In a moment Peter realized what they were doing to him. He stood,paralyzed with horror, and watched it happen.     The little man's body was sagging, ever so slowly, as if he wererelaxing tiredly. His torso was telescoping, bit by bit; his spreadlegs grew wider and more shapeless, his cheeks caved in and his skullgrew gradually flatter.     When it was over, the thing that had been Kanin was a limp, bonelesspuddle of flesh. Peter could not look at it.     There was a scream in his throat that would not come out. He was beyondfear, beyond agony. He turned to the still-hovering monsters and saidin a terrible voice, Why? Why?     The nearest being turned slowly to regard him. Its lips did not move,but there was a tiny sound in Peter's brain, a thin, dry whispering.     The scream was welling up. He fought it down and listened.           Wurnkomellilonasendiktolsasangkanmiamiamimami....          The face was staring directly into his, the bulging eyes hypnotic. Theears were small, no more than excresences of skin. The narrow lipsseemed sealed together; a thin, slimy ichor drooled from them. Therewere lines in the face, but they were lines of age, not emotion. Onlythe eyes were alive.           ... raswilopreatadvuonistuwurncchtusanlgkelglawwalinom....          I can't understand, he cried wildly. What do you want?           ... morofelcovisyanmamiwurlectaunntous.          He heard a faint sound behind him, and whirled. It was the firsttime he had realized that Lorelei had followed him. She stood there,swaying, very pale, looking at the red Invaders. Her eyes swiveledslowly....           Opreniktoulestritifenrelngetnaktwiltoctpre.          His voice was hoarse. Don't look! Don't\u2014Go back! The horrible,mindless noise in his throat was almost beyond his power to repress.His insides writhed to thrust it out.     She didn't see him. Her eyes glazed, and she dropped limply to thefloor.     The scream came out then. Before he knew, even, that he could holdit back no longer, his mouth was wide open, his muscles tensed, hisfingernails slicing his palms. It echoed with unbelievable volume inthe room. It was a scream to split eardrums; a scream to wake the dead.  "

My fingers roamed to the meshgun trigger, just in case oftrouble.     The Kallerian stood motionless before me. They're hairy creatures, andthis one had a coarse, thick mat of blue fur completely covering hisbody. Two fierce eyes glimmered out through the otherwise dense blanketof fur. He was wearing the kilt, girdle and ceremonial blaster of hiswarlike race.     I said, You'll have to understand, Freeman Heraal, that it's not ourpolicy to maintain more than a few members of each species at ourInstitute. And we're not currently in need of any Kallerian males,because\u2014     You will hire me or trouble I will make!     I opened our inventory chart. I showed him that we were alreadycarrying four Kallerians, and that was more than plenty.     The beady little eyes flashed like beacons in the fur. Yes, you havefour representatives\u2014of the Clan Verdrokh! None of the Clan Gursdrinn!For three years, I have waited for a chance to avenge this insult tothe noble Clan Gursdrinn!     At the key-word      avenge     , I readied myself to ensnarl the Kallerianin a spume of tanglemesh the instant he went for his blaster, but hedidn't move. He bellowed, I have vowed a vow, Earthman. Take me toEarth, enroll a Gursdrinn, or the consequences will be terrible!   <doc-sep> It wasn't very big, the thing that had been his shining dream. It laythere in its rough cradle, a globe of raw dura-steel not more thanfive hundred meters in diameter, where the      Citadel     was to have been athousand. It wouldn't house a hundred scientists, eagerly delving intothe hinterland of research. The huge compartments weren't filled withthe latest equipment for chemical and physical experiment; instead,there was compressed oxygen there, and concentrated food, enough tolast a lifetime.     It was a new world, all by itself; or else it was a tomb. And there wasone other change, one that you couldn't see from the outside. The solidmeters of lead in its outer skin, the shielding to keep out cosmicrays, were gone.     A man had just finished engraving the final stroke on its nameplate, tothe left of the airlock\u2014      The Avenger     . He stepped away now, and joinedthe group a little distance away, silently waiting.     Lorelei said, You can't do it. I won't let you! Peter\u2014     Darling, he began wearily.     Don't throw your life away! Give us time\u2014there must be another way.     There's no other way, Peter said. He gripped her arms tightly, as ifhe could compel her to understand by the sheer pressure of his fingers.Darling, listen to me. We've tried everything. We've gone underground,but that's only delaying the end.      They     still come down here, only notas many. The mortality rate is up, the suicide rate is up, the birthrate is down, in spite of anything we can do. You've seen the figures:we're riding a curve that ends in extinction fifty years from now.     They'll live, and we'll die, because they're a superior race. We're amillion years too far back even to understand what they are or wherethey came from. Besides them, we're apes. There's only one answer.     She was crying now, silently, with great racking sobs that shook herslender body. But he went remorselessly on.     Out there, in space, the cosmics change unshielded life. Theymake tentacles out of arms; or scales out of hair; or twelve toes,or a dozen ears\u2014or a better brain. Out of those millions ofpossible mutations, there's one that will save the human race. Wecan't fight      them     , but a superman could. That's our only chance.Lorelei\u2014darling\u2014don't you see that?     She choked, But why can't you take me along?     He stared unseeingly past her wet, upturned face. You know why, hesaid bitterly. Those rays are strong. They don't only work on embryos;they change adult life forms, too. I have one chance in seven ofstaying alive. You'd have one chance in a million of staying beautiful.I couldn't stand that. I'd kill myself, and then humanity would die,too. You'd be their murderer.     Her sobs gradually died away. She straightened slowly until he nolonger had to support her, but all the vitality and resilience was goneout of her body. All right, she said in a lifeless voice. You'llcome back, Peter.     He turned away suddenly, not trusting himself to kiss her goodbye. Aline from an old film kept echoing through his head.       They'll     comeback\u2014but not as      boys     !     We'll come back, but not as men.     We'll come back, but not as elephants.     We'll come back, but not as octopi.   <doc-sep> The mild shocks went on\u2014whether from projectiles or energy-charges,would be hard to find out and it didn't matter; whatever was hittingthe      Quest III's     shell was doing it at velocities where thedistinction between matter and radiation practically ceases to exist.     But that shell was tough. It was an extension of the gravitic drivefield which transmitted the engines' power equally to every atom ofthe ship; forces impinging on the outside of the field were similarlytransmitted and rendered harmless. The effect was as if the vessel andall space inside its field were a single perfectly elastic body. Ameteoroid, for example, on striking it rebounded\u2014usually vaporized bythe impact\u2014and the ship, in obedience to the law of equal and oppositeforces, rebounded too, but since its mass was so much greater, itsdeflection was negligible.     The people in the      Quest III     would have felt nothing at all ofthe vicious onslaught being hurled against them, save that theirinertialess drive, at its normal thrust of two hundred gravities,was intentionally operated at one half of one per cent efficiency toprovide the illusion of Earthly gravitation.     One of the officers said shakily, It's as if they've been lying inwait for us. But why on Earth\u2014     That, said the captain grimly, is what we have to find out. Why\u2014onEarth. At least, I suspect the answer's there.     The      Quest III     bored steadily on through space, decelerating. Even ifone were no fatalist, there seemed no reason to stop decelerating orchange course. There was nowhere else to go and too little fuel leftif there had been; come what might, this was journey's end\u2014perhapsin a more violent and final way than had been anticipated. All aroundwheeled the pigmy enemies, circling, maneuvering, and attacking,always attacking, with the senseless fury of maddened hornets. Theinterstellar ship bore no offensive weapons\u2014but suddenly on one of thevision screens a speck of light flared into nova-brilliance, dazzlingthe watchers for the brief moment in which its very atoms were tornapart.     Knof Jr. whooped ecstatically and then subsided warily, but no one waspaying attention to him. The men on the      Quest III's     bridge lookedquestions at each other, as the thought of help from outside flashedinto many minds at once. But Captain Llud said soberly, It must havecaught one of their own shots, reflected. Maybe its own, if it scoredtoo direct a hit.     He studied the data so far gathered. A few blurred pictures had beengot, which showed cylindrical space ships much like the      Quest III     ,except that they were rocket-propelled and of far lesser size. Theirsize was hard to ascertain, because you needed to know their distanceand speed\u2014but detector-beam echoes gave the distance, and likewise, bythe Doppler method, the velocity of directly receding or approachingships. It was apparent that the enemy vessels were even smaller thanGwar Den had at first supposed\u2014not large enough to hold even one man.Tiny, deadly hornets with a colossal sting.     Robot craft, no doubt, said Knof Llud, but a chill ran down his spineas it occurred to him that perhaps the attackers weren't of humanorigin. They had seen no recognizable life in the part of the galaxythey had explored, but one of the other      Quests     might have encounteredand been traced home by some unhuman race that was greedy and able toconquer.

        "Query": "What are the characteristics of Robert in THE AVENGER?",
        "Summary_1": "Robert is the one changeling child that Peter did not destroy. He is described to have an eager brain, and Peter keeps feeding knowledge to it. Robert also has a superior brain, capable of instinctively solving problems that would take mechanical computers hours of work. Physically, Robert also has talons. However, despite being a successful superman, Robert does not understand anything emotional. He refuses to go back to Earth to destroy the Invaders, citing that he is a being of logic. Robert says that he will use the people on Earth for his own gain, which the Invaders are already doing. Therefore, he finds it illogical when Peter asks him to kill the Invaders and not his people. Even when Peter says that he is his friend, Robert says he does not understand and believes that gratitude is a reciprocal arrangement. ",
        "Summary_2": "Robert was raised on 'The Avenger'. He was one of many embryos brought by the ship into space to be raised under the strong rays. Such an upbringing causes mutations, and people planned to create a mutant similar to the Invaders - a superior logical brain, who can understand and conquer the Invaders. This was the only hope for the humanity to be saved as they couldn't defeat the Aliens with their own forces. Robert is that one right mutation, a superman. There was a flaw in the calculations though, as a coldly logical being Robert has no reasons for destroying the Aliens. He doesn't have feeling, so he doesn't have compassion towards the humans to help them. Moreover, as the Invaders are easy for him to understand, he is rather on their side. He cares for Peter as much as he can, but his gratitude can't overcome his lack of desire to do something. After Peter's death, he can't feel emotions either but he feels some emptiness inside, which shows he has developed some warmth towards Peter. This emptiness has no reasons and no solutions, which puzzles Robert for the first time in his life. ",
        "Summary_3": "Robert is the final embryo that Peter allows to develop on The Avenger. He has spent his entire life on the ship with Peter, and has absorbed knowledge through him for years. Consequently, and in tandem with the cosmic ray mutations, Robert's brain is superior and advanced, with the ability to solve any problem and think with perfect logic. Because of his advanced knowledge, Robert is unable to feel emotions, including love, hate, and fear. This leads Robert to not understand the mission that Peter has set out for him, and he refuses despite his intelligence.",
        "Summary_4": "Robert is the embryo that Peter selected to raise on the Avenger ship. He was deemed as having the best likelihood of successfully fighting against the Invaders due to his mutations. Unfortunately, he does not agree to complete the mission he was destined to complete. Peter describes him.  as being a superman as he is able to solve complex problems faster than even computers. Physically he is described as having talons. Mentally, he is coldly logical. He does experience emotions the same way as humans and does show loyalty to the human race. He does not understand nor like Peter\u2019s reaction to the news that he will not be carrying out the mission to save Earth. ",
        "Article": "The first harbinger of woe turned up after lunch in the person of aKallerian. The Kallerian was the sixth applicant that afternoon. Ihad turned away three more ursinoids, hired a vegetable from Miazan,and said no to a scaly pseudo-armadillo from one of the Delta Worlds.Hardly had the 'dillo scuttled dejectedly out of my office when theKallerian came striding in, not even waiting for Stebbins to admit himofficially.     He was big even for his kind\u2014in the neighborhood of nine feet high,and getting on toward a ton. He planted himself firmly on his threestocky feet, extended his massive arms in a Kallerian greeting-gesture,and growled, I am Vallo Heraal, Freeman of Kaller IV. You will sign meimmediately to a contract.     Sit down, Freeman Heraal. I like to make my own decisions, thanks.     You will grant me a contract!     Will you please sit down?

At the key-word      avenge     , I readied myself to ensnarl the Kallerianin a spume of tanglemesh the instant he went for his blaster, but hedidn't move. He bellowed, I have vowed a vow, Earthman. Take me toEarth, enroll a Gursdrinn, or the consequences will be terrible!   <doc-sep> Wilkins moved away. Isobar waited until the Patrolman was completelyout of sight. Then swiftly he pulled open the massive gate, slippedthrough, and closed it behind him.     A flood of warmth, exhilarating after the constantly regulatedtemperature of the Dome, descended upon him. Fresh air, thin, butfragrant with the scent of growing things, made his pulses stir withjoyous abandon. He was Outside! He was Outside, in good sunlight, atlast! After six long and dreary months!     Raptly, blissfully, all thought of caution tossed to the gentle breezesthat ruffled his sparse hair, Isobar Jones stepped forward into thelunar valley....     How long he wandered thus, carefree and utterly content, he could notafterward say. It seemed like minutes; it must have been longer. Heonly knew that the grass was green beneath his feet, the trees were alacy network through which warm sunlight filtered benevolently, thechirrupings of small insects and the rustling whisper of the breezesformed a tiny symphony of happiness through which he moved as onecharmed.     It did not occur to him that he had wandered too far from the Dome'sentrance until, strolling through an enchanting flower-decked glade, hewas startled to hear\u2014off to his right\u2014the sharp, explosive bark of aHaemholtz ray pistol.     He whirled, staring about him wildly, and discovered that though hismeandering had kept him near the Dome, he had unconsciously followedits hemispherical perimeter to a point nearly two miles from theGateway. By the placement of ports and windows, Isobar was able tojudge his location perfectly; he was opposite that portion of thestructure which housed Sparks' radio turret.     And the shooting? That could only be\u2014     He did not have to name its reason, even to himself. For at thatmoment, there came racing around the curve of the Dome a pair offigures, Patrolmen clad in fatigue drab. Roberts and Brown. Roberts wasstaggering, one foot dragged awkwardly as he ran; Brown's left arm,bloodstained from shoulder to elbow, hung limply at his side, but inhis good right fist he held a spitting Haemholtz with which he tried tocover his comrade's sluggish retreat.     And behind these two, grim, grey, gaunt figures that moved withastonishing speed despite their massive bulk, came three ... six ... adozen of those lunarites whom all men feared. The Grannies!      III     Simultaneously with his recognition of the pair, Joe Roberts saw him. Agasp of relief escaped the wounded man.     Jones! Thank the Lord! Then you picked up our cry for help? Quick,man\u2014where is it? Theres not a moment to waste!     W-where, faltered Isobar feebly, is      what     ?     The tank, of course! Didn't you hear our telecast? We can't possiblymake it back to the gate without an armored car. My foot's broken,and\u2014 Roberts stopped suddenly, an abrupt horror in his eyes. Youdon't have one! You're here      alone     ! Then you didn't pick up our call?But, why\u2014?     Never mind that, snapped Isobar, now! Placid by nature, he couldmove when urgency drove. His quick mind saw the immediateness of theirperil. Unarmed, he could not help the Patrolmen fight a delaying actionagainst their foes, nor could he hasten their retreat. Anyway, weaponswere useless, and time was of the essence. There was but one temporaryway of staving off disaster. Over here ... this tree! Quick! Up yougo! Give him a lift, Brown\u2014There! That's the stuff!     He was the last to scramble up the gnarled bole to a tentative leafysanctuary. He had barely gained the security of the lowermost boughwhen a thundering crash resounded, the sturdy trunk trembled beneathhis clutch. Stony claws gouged yellow parallels in the bark scantinches beneath one kicking foot, then the Granny fell back with a thud.The Graniteback was      not     a climber. It was far too ungainly, much tooweighty for that.     Roberts said weakly, Th-thanks, Jonesy! That was a close call.     That goes for me, too, Jonesy, added Brown from an upper bough.But I'm afraid you just delayed matters. This tree's O.Q. as longas it lasts, but\u2014 He stared down upon the gathering knot ofGrannies unhappily\u2014it's not going to last long with that bunch ofsuperdreadnaughts working out on it! Hold tight, fellows! Here theycome!     For the Grannies, who had huddled for a moment as if in telepathicconsultation, now joined forces, turned, and as one body chargedheadlong toward the tree. The unified force of their attack was likethe shattering impact of a battering ram. Bark rasped and grittedbeneath the besieged men's hands, dry leaves and twigs pelted aboutthem in a tiny rain, tormented fibrous sinews groaned as the agedforest monarch shuddered in agony.     Desperately they clung to their perches. Though the great tree bent, itdid not break. But when it stopped trembling, it was canted drunkenlyto one side, and the erstwhile solid earth about its base was brokenand cracked\u2014revealing fleshy tentacles uprooted from ancient moorings!   <doc-sep> Brown stared at this evidence of the Grannies' power withterror-fascinated eyes. His voice was none too firm.     Lord! Piledrivers! A couple more like that\u2014     Isobar nodded. He knew what falling into the clutch of the Granniesmeant. He had once seen the grisly aftermath of a Graniteback feast.Even now their adversaries had drawn back for a second attack. A suddenidea struck him. A straw of hope at which he grasped feverishly.     You telecast a message to the Dome? Help should be on the way by now.If we can just hold out\u2014     But Roberts shook his head.     We sent a message, Jonesy, but I don't think it got through. I've justbeen looking at my portable. It seems to be busted. Happened when theyfirst attacked us, I guess. I tripped and fell on it.     Isobar's last hope flickered out.     Then I\u2014I guess it won't be long now, he mourned. If we could haveonly got a message through, they would have sent out an armored car topick us up. But as it is\u2014     Brown's shrug displayed a bravado he did not feel.     Well, that's the way it goes. We knew what we were risking when wevolunteered to come Outside. This damn moon! It'll never be wortha plugged credit until men find some way to fight those murderousstones-on-legs!     Roberts said, That's right. But what are      you     doing out here, Isobar?And why, for Pete's sake, the bagpipes?     Oh\u2014the pipes? Isobar flushed painfully. He had almost forgottenhis original reason for adventuring Outside, had quite forgottenhis instrument, and was now rather amazed to discover that somehowthroughout all the excitement he had held onto it. Why, I justhappened to\u2014Oh!      the pipes!          Hold on! roared Roberts. His warning came just in time. Once more,the three tree-sitters shook like dried peas in a pod as their leafyrefuge trembled before the locomotive onslaught of the lunar beasts.This time the already-exposed roots strained and lifted, severalsnapped; when the Grannies again withdrew, complacently unaware thatthe lethal ray of Brown's Haemholtz was wasting itself upon theiradamant hides in futile fury, the tree was bent at a precarious angle.     Brown sobbed, not with fear but with impotent anger, and in a gestureof enraged desperation, hurled his now-empty weapon at the retreatingGrannies.     No good! Not a damn bit of good! Oh, if there was only some way offighting those filthy things\u2014     But Isobar Jones had a one-track mind. The pipes! he cried again,excitedly. That's the answer! And he drew the instrument into playingposition, bag cuddled beneath one arm-pit, drones stiffly erect overhis shoulder, blow-pipe at his lips. His cheeks puffed, his breathexpelled. The giant lung swelled, the chaunter emitted its distinctive,fearsome,       Kaa-aa-o-o-o-oro-oong!          Roberts moaned.     Oh, Lord! A guy can't even die in peace!     And Brown stared at him hopelessly.     It's no use, Isobar. You trying to scare them off? They have no senseof hearing. That's been proven\u2014     Isobar took his lips from the reed to explain.     It's not that. I'm trying to rouse the boys in the Dome. We're rightopposite the atmosphere-conditioning-unit. See that grilled duct overthere? That's an inhalation-vent. The portable transmitter's out oforder, and our voices ain't strong enough to carry into the Dome\u2014butthe sound of these pipes is! And Commander Eagan told me just a shortwhile ago that the sound of the pipes carries all over the building!     If they hear this, they'll get mad because I'm disobeyin' orders.They'll start lookin' for me. If they can't find me inside, maybethey'll look Outside. See that window? That's Sparks' turret. If we canmake him look out here\u2014           Stop talking!      roared Roberts. Stop talking, guy, and startblowing! I think you've got something there. Anyhow, it's our lasthope.      Blow!          And quick! appended Brown. For here they come!        Isobar played, blew with all his might, while the Grannies raged below.        He meant the Grannies. Again they were huddling for attack, once more,a solid phalanx of indestructible, granite flesh, they were smashingdown upon the tree.           Haa-a-roong!      blew Isobar Jones.      IV     And\u2014even he could not have foreseen the astounding results ofhis piping! What happened next was as astonishing as it wasincomprehensible. For as the pipes, filled now and primed to burst intowhatever substitute for melody they were prodded into, wailed intoaction\u2014the Grannies' rush came to an abrupt halt!     As one, they stopped cold in their tracks and turned dull, colorless,questioning eyes upward into the tree whence came this weird andvibrant droning!     So stunned with surprise was Isobar that his grip on the pipes relaxed,his lips almost slipped from the reed. But Brown's delighted bellowlifted his paralysis.     Sacred rings of Saturn-look! They      like     it! Keep playing, Jonesy!Play, boy, like you never played before!     And Roberts roared, above the skirling of the      piobaireachd     intowhich Isobar had instinctively swung, Music hath charms to soothe thesavage beast! Then we were wrong. They      can     hear, after all! See that?They're lying down to listen\u2014like so many lambs! Keep playing, Isobar!For once in my life I'm glad to hear that lovely, wonderful music!     Isobar needed no urging. He, too, had noted how the Grannies' attackhad stopped, how every last one of the gaunt grey beasts had suddenly,quietly, almost happily, dropped to its haunches at the base of thetree.     There was no doubt about it; the Grannies      liked     this music. Eyesraptly fixed, unblinking, unwavering, they froze into postures ofgentle beatitude. One stirred once, dangerously, as for a moment Isobarpaused to catch his breath, but Isobar hastily lipped the blow-pipewith redoubled eagerness, and the Granny relapsed into quietude.     Followed then what, under somewhat different circumstances, should havebeen a piper's dream. For Isobar had an audience which would not\u2014andin two cases      dared     not\u2014allow him to stop playing. And to thisaudience he played over and over again his entire repertoire. Marches,flings, dances\u2014the stirring      Rhoderik Dhu     and the lilting      LassiesO'Skye     , the mournful      Coghiegh nha Shie     whose keening is like thesound of a sobbing nation.       The Cock o' the North     , he played, and      Mironton     ...      Wee Flow'r o'Dee     and      MacArthur's March     ...      La Cucuracha     and\u2014     And his lungs were parched, his lips dry as swabs of cotton. Bloodpounded through his temples, throbbing in time to the drone of thechaunter, and a dark mist gathered before his eyes. He tore theblow-pipe from his lips, gasped,     Keep playing! came the dim, distant howl of Johnny Brown. Just a fewminutes longer, Jonesy! Relief is on the way. Sparks saw us from histurret window five minutes ago!     And Isobar played on. How, or what, he did not know. The memory ofthose next few minutes was never afterward clear in his mind. All heknew was that above the skirling drone of his pipes there came anothersound, the metallic clanking of a man-made machine ... an armored tank,sent from the Dome to rescue the beleaguered trio.     He was conscious, then, of a friendly voice shouting words ofencouragement, of Joe Roberts calling a warning to those below.     Careful, boys! Drive the tank right up beneath us so we can hop in andget out of here! Watch the Grannies\u2014they'll be after us the minuteIsobar stops playing!     Then the answer from below. The fantastic answer in Sparks' familiarvoice. The answer that caused the bagpipes to slip from Isobar'sfingers as Isobar Jones passed out in a dead faint:     After you? Those Grannies? Hell's howling acres\u2014      those Grannies arestone dead     !  "

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in A Gift From Earth?",
        "Summary_1": "The House of Masur is a family business in Zur, run by Koltan and his six sons. The business specializes in pottery and clay manufacturing for Zur. The family gathers as they deliberate the upcoming arrival of Earthmen. Some of the brothers express frustration that the Earthmen will be landing among the Thorabians rather than in Zur, disrupting their plan to steal the precious, scarce metals off their ship. Zotul, the youngest of the brothers, discourages the plan, saying that the Earthmen's ship is their only way of transport. After the meeting, Zotul ponders what other benefits the Earthmen could serve. The Earthmen eventually arrive at Zur, parading the streets and making speeches, and leaving shortly after. They return with multiple ships and establish corporations all over Zur. One day, Zotul's wife brings home a metal pot, which she had bought from Earthmen; she tells him that they are high in demand and that a new type of stove is essential to use them. Zotul protests, but later designs a ceramic stove, which becomes a successful development in their business. Earthmen continue introducing more technology to Zur, including a printing press and telegraphs. Zotul notes internally that though the business has made profit, it is dependent upon the pots from Earth. The business quickly begins declining, with sales dropping. They attempt to advertise their business, but advertisement has become fully occupied by Earth. After ten years, during which Koltan has passed on, the Masur business has dwindled. The brothers decide to go to the governor of Lor, who tells them that the developments are all beneficial, informing them of a new production of highways. The brothers are optimistic that they would be able to use their clay for the roads, but Earthmen begin using cement. The governor then refers the brothers to Earth's Merchandising Council, where Zotul meets Kent Broderick, where he expresses sympathy about the status of the Masur business and offers them the luxuries brought by Earthmen, completely free except for the cost of freight. The cost, however, is more than the brothers could ever afford, and so Broderick sets them up with a credit system, as well as a contract for the family to supply Earthmen with ceramic parts. The brothers enjoy their luxury, but it is short lived, as their contract expires and they find themselves in debt. Zotul then revisits the governor, who ends up being Broderick. Broderick informs Zotul that Earth has bought them, and every business in Zur, out, and that they own everything. Broderick tells Zotul that the family will work for Earth now, and that Earth will fully conquer Zur. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story is about a group of people on a planet called Zur. One day, they are visited by Earthmen who arrive in a ship made of valuable material. The Earthmen come with announcements that they only intend to provide the world of Zur with great things and that all will be well if the Zurian people cooperate. Soon, more Earthmen arrive on the planet. They land a ship in every city on Zur and begin trading basic items. When they trade, they take the Zurian version of their goods and destroy them. Zotul is forced to design new stoves for the new cookware. Zotul and his brothers are initially able to make a great profit selling their new ceramic stoves. \n\nThe Earthmen continue to bring new inventions that the Zurian population do not possess. They bring new communication devices like the printing press, then radios, and eventually television sets. Eventually, Zotul and his brother\u2019s operations are unable to compete with the Earthmen\u2019s goods. Their profits drop to abysmal levels in all of their industries. Zotul is told by his brothers to go make a formal complaint. He goes to the headquarters of the Merchandising Council where he meets Kent Broderick, the Earthman in charge of the Council. Broderick acts very nice to Zotul and appears to only have good intentions. Broderick promises to help Zotul and offers to give him many luxurious gifts that Zotul states he cannot afford. Broderick explains to Zotul that is of no issue and he can offer him credit. After only explaining the good parts of credit to Zotul, Zotul goes and convinces his brothers to sign up for the credit system. In addition, Broderick gives them a contract to manufacture some goods for the Earthmen. However, the contract does not last long and the Earthmen build their own plant. As a result, the House of Masur is unable to keep up with its debts. Zotul\u2019s brothers express their anger and accuse Zotul of getting them into incredible poverty. In an effort to remedy the situation, Zotul goes to the Council House where he does not find Mr. Broderick but a man named Mr. Siwicki. Mr. Siwicki informs him that the Earthmen will repossess everything him and his brothers own if they do not pay their debts. Zotul\u2019s brothers are so stunned by the news that they do not even beat him. In a last-ditch effort, Zotul goes to the governor\u2019s palace for help. There he finds Broderick is now the governor. Broderick then informs Zotul that the Earthmen were slowly taking ownership of Zur away from the Zurian to then move in an attempt to peacefully take over the planet. The ultimate goal is to mix with the native population and then form a cohesive one. However, the Zurian caste system had to be first broken down. The story ends with Broderick asking if Zotul and his brothers are ready to willfully oblige to their assignments and Zotul replies yes. \n",
        "Summary_3": "\nKoltan of the House of Masur is furious that the Earthmen are coming to live amongst the Thorabians in the world of Zur while his brother, Zotul, is in favor of it. Kalrab Masur says that there is nothing to worry about because the Earthmen will eventually leave, but clay will go on forever. Morvan thinks that the Earthmen could have come to Lor, and Singula implies that the Thorabians would rob the Earthmen. Zotul tries to explain that they cannot take the Earthmen\u2019s method of transport away from them, but the other brothers tell him to be quiet. The Earthmen arrive at Lor and are impressed with the city, and they communicate through interpreters. Some agreements between the Lorian government and the Earthmen are made. Although the anti-Earthmen Faction is happy that the Earthmen are gone, the visitors come back and establish corporations to engage in trade. When Zotul comes home, his wife Lania shows him an aluminum pot. She tells him that the Earthmen are selling these items cheap. She tells him that he will need to design a new ceramic stove for a dozen pots. He beats his wife but goes off to design the stove anyways; the Masurs begin to profit more than ever from the porcelain stoves. The Earthmen also bring other items such as the printing press, copper wire for telegraph lines, and plastic cutlery. The Masur family ceramics are slowly being replaced. Kalrab concludes that the items from Earth are the main reason.  The Earthmen begin to lay pipelines after the discovery of crude oil and natural gas. The Masur stove business is also gone after ten years; the brothers plan to protest to the governor of Lor. They see the Earthmen are building more structures, such as an assembly plant for radio receiving sets. The brothers want to rely on their tile business, but the Earthmen have begun manufacturing Portland cement. The governor is in support of the Earthmen, and they go to speak to Kent Broderick, who is in charge of the Merchandising Council. Broderick tells him that he will give the expensive Earth items to Zotul for the payment of freight charges on items. Broderick offers credit to him and his brothers as part of the Easy Payment Plan. All of the brothers sign. The brothers slowly go into debt, and the Earthmen build plants that cost lower to manufacture materials. They tell Zotul to speak with Broderick again, but Mr. Siwicki speaks to him instead and says that the brothers will need to assign the remaining three-quarters of their pottery. Koltan tells Zotul to see the governor, but the person is revealed to be Broderick. He says that they have taken over everything on Zur because Earth is too overcrowded. The future population will be a mixture of Zurians and Earthmen; he tells Zotul that he will have his job back but work for the Earthmen. Broderick then hands assignment papers for him and his brothers to sign. ",
        "Summary_4": "The House of Masur owns a prosperous family business of pottery and consists of six brothers, each having their position in business according to their rank of age. The Earthmen come to the world of Zur, which enrages some members of the family. The younger brother, Zotul, is sympathetic to the Eartmen, but the youngest can\u2019t speak up and he gets beaten. The Earthmen parade through Zur, proclaiming the intention to do great things and asking for cooperation. After a while, many more ships come from Earth to every Zurian city to establish \"corporations\" for trade. Zotul's wife buys a set of cheap aluminum pots at the market, which are being bought by all the housewives as they are better than those from clay. New pots require completely different stoves and Zotul has to design such. Koltan, the elder brother, puts the model into production as the demand is high. The Masurs flourish with the new business and depend on the metal pots from Earth, as the production of their own falls. The Earthmen keep introducing new things like telegraph lines and printing presses. The Earthmen find a great deal of metals, crude oil and natural gas, and sell it to the Zurians themselves. Further introduction of plastic utensils undermines the Masur's business completely. They head to the governor, who talks about the benefits of new culture and upcoming autos and highways. The Earthmen introduce cement and the hopes for tile business go down as well. The complaints are redirected to the Merchandising Council set by the Earthmen, where Zotul is met by Broderick. The man is sympathetic to the brothers\u2019 poverty, but he can only grant Zotul a gas range, a gas-fired furnace and a car, a luxury only a few can afford and everyone envies. The goal of the Earthmen is to spread technology through the galaxy, so Broderick only asks Zotul to pay for the freight, which is a huge sum, and, therefore, can only be in credit for the family. Enchanted Zotul takes the credit papers for all his brothers to sign to get the same goods. Broderick also gives a contract for making ceramic parts for the cars, which will help the brothers pay off the credit. After signing the papers, the brothers enjoy the luxuries and receive one fourth of the ceramic profits. In three years the Earthmen cancel the contract, the family is poor and Zotul is forced to visit the council again as the Masurs can't pay. A new man threatens him with the court and asks to assign the rest of the business to the Earthmen. Zotul heads to the governor for support, but finds Broderick on his place, who tells the Masur's business is the last to be bought off. Earth is overcrowded, so the new planets are required to take over. Instead of painful wars, the Earthmen buy off other nations to work for them until both nations are equal and mixed. ",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]       Every lonely man tries to make friends.     Manet just didn't know when to stop!      William Manet was alone.     In the beginning, he had seen many advantages to being alone. It wouldgive him an unprecedented opportunity to once and for all correlateloneliness to the point of madness, to see how long it would take himto start slavering and clawing the pin-ups from the magazines, to beginteaching himself classes in philosophy consisting of interminablelectures to a bored and captive audience of one.     He would be able to measure the qualities of peace and decide whetherit was really better than war, he would be able to get as fat and asdirty as he liked, he would be able to live more like an animal andthink more like a god than any man for generations.     But after a shorter time than he expected, it all got to be a tearingbore. Even the waiting to go crazy part of it.     Not that he was going to have any great long wait of it. He was alreadytalking to himself, making verbal notes for his lectures, and he hadcut out a picture of Annie Oakley from an old book. He tacked it up andwinked at it whenever he passed that way.     Lately she was winking back at him.     Loneliness was a physical weight on his skull. It peeled the flesh fromhis arms and legs and sandpapered his self-pity to a fine sensitivity.     No one on Earth was as lonely as William Manet, and even William Manetcould only be this lonely on Mars.     Manet was Atmosphere Seeder Station 131-47's own human.     All Manet had to do was sit in the beating aluminum heart in the middleof the chalk desert and stare out, chin cupped in hands, at the flat,flat pavement of dirty talcum, at the stars gleaming as hard in theblack sky as a starlet's capped teeth ... stars two of which were moonsand one of which was Earth. He had to do nothing else. The wholegimcrack was cybernetically controlled, entirely automatic. No one wasneeded here\u2014no human being, at least.     The Workers' Union was a pretty small pressure group, but it didn'ttake much to pressure the Assembly. Featherbedding had been carefullyspecified, including an Overseer for each of the Seeders to honeycombMars, to prepare its atmosphere for colonization.     They didn't give tests to find well-balanced, well-integrated peoplefor the job. Well-balanced, well-integrated men weren't going toisolate themselves in a useless job. They got, instead, William Manetand his fellows.     The Overseers were to stay as long as the job required. Passenger fareto Mars was about one billion dollars. They weren't providing commuterservice for night shifts. They weren't providing accommodationsfor couples when the law specified only one occupant. They weren'tproviding fuel (at fifty million dollars a gallon) for visits betweenthe various Overseers. They weren't very providential.     But it was two hundred thousand a year in salary, and it offeredwonderful opportunities.     It gave William Manet an opportunity to think he saw a spaceship makinga tailfirst landing on the table of the desert, its tail burning asbright as envy.  "

Despite their equal roles in the business, Zotul is the youngest brother, and for this reason is mistreated. In meetings and conferences, he is rarely allowed to speak without being scolded, and his input is never taken seriously. Zotul also experiences beatings by his brothers regularly.

        "Summary_2": "Zotul and his 5 brothers have a hierarchal type of relationship. It does appear to be a loving nor welcoming familial relationship. Zotul is the youngest of his brothers and as tradition is expected to not talk unless spoken to and to enthusiastically agree with the decisions of his elders.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]         Except for transportation, it was absolutely       free ... but how much would the freight cost?        It is an outrage, said Koltan of the House of Masur, that theEarthmen land among the Thorabians!     Zotul, youngest of the Masur brothers, stirred uneasily. Personally, hewas in favor of the coming of the Earthmen to the world of Zur.     At the head of the long, shining table sat old Kalrab Masur, in hisdotage, but still giving what he could of aid and comfort to thePottery of Masur, even though nobody listened to him any more andhe knew it. Around the table sat the six brothers\u2014Koltan, eldestand Director of the Pottery; Morvan, his vice-chief; Singula, theirtreasurer; Thendro, sales manager; Lubiosa, export chief; and last inthe rank of age, Zotul, who was responsible for affairs of design.     Behold, my sons, said Kalrab, stroking his scanty beard. What arethese Earthmen to worry about? Remember the clay. It is our strengthand our fortune. It is the muscle and bone of our trade. Earthmen maycome and Earthmen may go, but clay goes on forever ... and with it, thefame and fortune of the House of Masur.     It      is     a damned imposition, agreed Morvan, ignoring his father'sphilosophical attitude. They could have landed just as easily here inLor.     The Thorabians will lick up the gravy, said Singula, whose mind ranrather to matters of financial aspect, and leave us the grease.     By this, he seemed to imply that the Thorabians would rob the Earthmen,which the Lorians would not. The truth was that all on Zur were pantingto get their hands on that marvelous ship, which was all of metal, avery scarce commodity on Zur, worth billions of ken.   <doc-sep> The engaging manner of the man won Zotul's confidence. After all, itwas no more than fair to pay transportation.     He said, How much does the freight cost?     Broderick told him.     It may seem high, said the Earthman, but remember that Earth issixty-odd light-years away. After all, we are absorbing the cost of themerchandise. All you pay is the freight, which is cheap, consideringthe cost of operating an interstellar spaceship.     Impossible, said Zotul drably. Not I and all my brothers togetherhave so much money any more.     You don't know us of Earth very well yet, but you will. I offer youcredit!     What is that? asked Zotul skeptically.     It is how the poor are enabled to enjoy all the luxuries of therich, said Broderick, and went on to give a thumbnail sketch of theinvolutions and devolutions of credit, leaving out some angles thatmight have had a discouraging effect.     On a world where credit was a totally new concept, it was enchanting.Zotul grasped at the glittering promise with avidity. What must I doto get credit?     Just sign this paper, said Broderick, and you become part of ourEasy Payment Plan.     Zotul drew back. I have five brothers. If I took all these things formyself and nothing for them, they would beat me black and blue.     Here. Broderick handed him a sheaf of chattel mortgages. Have eachof your brothers sign one of these, then bring them back to me. That isall there is to it.     It sounded wonderful. But how would the brothers take it? Zotulwrestled with his misgivings and the misgivings won.     I will talk it over with them, he said. Give me the total so I willhave the figures.     The total was more than it ought to be by simple addition. Zotulpointed this out politely.     Interest, Broderick explained. A mere fifteen per cent. After all,you get the merchandise free. The transportation company has to bepaid, so another company loans you the money to pay for the freight.This small extra sum pays the lending company for its trouble.     I see. Zotul puzzled over it sadly. It is too much, he said. Ourplant doesn't make enough money for us to meet the payments.     I have a surprise for you, smiled Broderick. Here is a contract. Youwill start making ceramic parts for automobile spark plugs and certainparts for radios and gas ranges. It is our policy to encourage localmanufacture to help bring prices down.     We haven't the equipment.     We will equip your plant, beamed Broderick. It will require onlya quarter interest in your plant itself, assigned to our terrestrialcompany.  "

Zur is initially a mellow city, made of clay and tile. However, once Earth begins overtaking Zur, the city becomes more crowded and filled with large, corporate buildings, made of cement and metal.

When the Earthmen come, they fly in strange metal contraptions. Ten years later, one area of the city has been turned into a spaceport for Earthmen. There are also new plants opening up for radio receiving sets and cement. Pipelines are also added, connecting every major and minor area on the planet.

At first, the markets are overflowed by aluminum pots, bought by every housewife. One of those appears in Zotul's house, and he designs a new stove for it, which is soon produced by the family business. Newspapers appear in every house, then telegraphs, radio, autos and ,any other things. The city gets urbanized and the people become poor as they try to obtain all the new technologies.

As Zotul made to protest, he cut him offwith a wave of his hand. It is the least we can do for you. Pick a carfrom the lot outside. I will arrange to have the other things deliveredand installed in your home.     To receive gifts, said Zotul, incurs an obligation.     None at all, beamed the Earthman cheerily. Every item is given toyou absolutely free\u2014a gift from the people of Earth. All we ask isthat you pay the freight charges on the items. Our purpose is not tomake profit, but to spread technology and prosperity throughout theGalaxy. We have already done well on numerous worlds, but working outthe full program takes time.

EVERYTHING IT HAD WAS     IN THE GARDEN     BY R. A. LAFFERTY     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Worlds of If Science Fiction, March 1961.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      The protozoic recorder chirped like a bird. Not only would there belife traces on that little moon, but it would be a lively place. Sothey skipped several steps in the procedure.     The chordata discerner read      Positive     over most of the surface. Therewas spinal fluid on that orb, rivers of it. So again they omittedseveral tests and went to the cognition scanner. Would it show Thoughton the body?     Naturally they did not get results at once, nor did they expect to; itrequired a fine adjustment. But they were disappointed that they foundnothing for several hours as they hovered high over the rotation. Thenit came\u2014clearly and definitely, but from quite a small location only.     Limited, said Steiner, as though within a pale. As though there werebut one city, if that is its form. Shall we follow the rest of thesurface to find another, or concentrate on this? It'll be twelve hoursbefore it's back in our ken if we let it go now.     Let's lock on this one and finish the scan. Then we can do the rest ofthe world to make sure we've missed nothing, said Stark.     There was one more test to run, one very tricky and difficult ofanalysis, that with the Extraordinary Perception Locator. This wasdesigned simply to locate a source of superior thought. But this mightbe so varied or so unfamiliar that often both the machine and thedesigner of it were puzzled as to how to read the results.     The E. P. Locator had been designed by Glaser. But when the Locatorhad refused to read      Positive     when turned on the inventor himself,bad blood developed between machine and man. Glaser knew that he hadextraordinary perception. He was a much honored man in his field. Hetold the machine so heatedly.     The machine replied, with such warmth that its relays chattered, thatGlaser did      not     have extraordinary perception; he had only ordinaryperception to an extraordinary degree. There is a      difference     , themachine insisted.     It was for this reason that Glaser used that model no more, but builtothers more amenable. And it was for this reason also that the ownersof Little Probe had acquired the original machine so cheaply.     And there was no denying that the Extraordinary Perception Locator (orEppel) was a contrary machine. On Earth it had read      Positive     on anumber of crack-pots, including Waxey Sax, a jazz tootler who could noteven read music. But it had also read      Positive     on ninety per cent ofthe acknowledged superior minds of the Earth. In space it had been asound guide to the unusual intelligences encountered. Yet on Suzuki-Miit had read      Positive     on a two-inch-long worm, only one of them out ofbillions. For the countless identical worms no trace of anything at allwas shown by the test.     So it was with mixed expectations that Steiner locked onto the areaand got a flick. He then narrowed to a smaller area (apparently oneindividual, though this could not be certain) and got very definiteaction. Eppel was busy. The machine had a touch of the ham in it, andassumed an air of importance when it ran these tests.     Finally it signaled the result, the most exasperating result it everproduces: the single orange light. It was the equivalent of the shrugof the shoulders in a man. They called it the You tell      me     light.     So among the intelligences there was at least one that might beextraordinary, though possibly in a crackpot way. It is good to beforewarned.   <doc-sep> Gritting my teeth, I turned to the man on the stretcher. Something hadpretty near torn half his face away. It was all there, but not in theright place, and it wasn't pretty. I turned away, caught my mother'seye, and then I didn't even dare to throw up. I looked at that smashedface again and all the first-aid lessons I'd had flew out of my head asif some super-psi had plucked them from me.     The man was bleeding terribly. I had never seen blood pouring out likethat before. The first thing to do, I figured sickly, was mop it up. Iwet a sponge and dabbed gingerly at the face, but my hands were shakingso hard that the sponge slipped and my fingers were on the raw gapingwound. I could feel the warm viscosity of the blood and nothing, noteven my mother, could keep my meal down this time, I thought.     Mother had uttered a sound of exasperation as I dropped the sponge. Icould hear her coming toward me. Then I heard her gasp. I looked at mypatient and my mouth dropped open. For suddenly there was no wound,no wound at all\u2014just a little blood and the fellow's face was wholeagain. Not even a scar.     Wha\u2014wha happened? he asked. It doesn't hurt any more!     He touched his cheek and looked up at me with frightened eyes. And Iwas frightened, too\u2014too frightened to be sick, too frightened to doanything but stare witlessly at him.     Touch some of the others, quick! my mother commanded, pushingastounded attendants away from stretchers.     I touched broken limbs and torn bodies and shattered heads, and theywere whole again right away. Everybody in the room was looking at me inthe way I had always dreamed of being looked at. Lucy was opening andshutting her beautiful mouth like a beautiful fish. In fact, the wholething was just like a dream, except that I was awake. I couldn't haveimagined all those horrors.     But the horrors soon weren't horrors any more. I began to find themalmost pleasing; the worse a wound was, the more I appreciated it.There was so much more satisfaction, virtually an esthetic thrill, inseeing a horrible jagged tear smooth away, heal, not in days, as itwould have done under the cure-all, but in seconds.     Timothy was right, my mother said, her eyes filled with tears, andI was wrong ever to have doubted. You have a gift, son\u2014 and she saidthe word son loud and clear so that everybody could hear it\u2014thegreatest gift of all, that of healing. She looked at me proudly. AndLucy and the others looked at me as if I were a god or something.     I felt ... well, good.  "

        "Query": "How do the Earthlings manage to colonize Zur in A Gift From Earth?",
        "Summary_1": "The Earthmen first visit Zur as a small group, exploring the city and giving speeches declaring future prosperity for Zur. They return shortly after with more people, and establish corporations and a trade business. The Earthmen begin with small products, metal pots, but other businesses soon have to accommodate to Earth's goods. Earth quickly earns profit, with many Zurian businesses dependent on their production. They begin establishing more advanced forms of technology, such as printing, radio, and automobiles. The people of Zur are fascinated, and business booms even more. Eventually, Zur is completely remodeled with Earth products and services, driving other businesses to failure and resulting in the overtaking of the city.",
        "Summary_2": "The Earthmen start by establishing small trading visits with the Zurian people. Once they have gained their trust in trade, they heavily accelerate the number of goods they trade. They establish themselves in every city on Zur to increase their visibility. They bring new communication methods such as the printing press, newspapers, radios, and television sets \u2013 all of which they control the supply. They build projects on the planet of Zur, like highways. They start their own manufacturing operations, successfully competing against and outpricing the native Zurian manufacturing operations. In addition, they lure the populace to be tempted by the new shiny luxury goods they bring and convince the Zurians to sign contracts that put them in debt that they can never realistically pay. They slowly but assuredly took over all of the industries on Zur so that they would have full economic control of the populace. Then they take over the leadership positions on the planet in another angle to obtain full control. The methods of the Earthmen is to ensure that the Zurians are either in debt to them, under their control, or how to work for them to survive. ",
        "Summary_3": "The Earthmen are able to expand to Zur through advertising and selling their products. After signing some agreements, the Earthmen begin importing their materials to Zur. The Earthmen begin bringing products such as aluminum pots, but they eventually move onto even grander things such as the printing press. The purpose of this is to not only spread knowledge but also provide more means of advertising for their products. Eventually, they begin to set up radio stations to broadcast their products even more. Gas-fired ranges, furnaces, heaters, and later cars all drive many of the old ways of Zurian life to the ground. Broderick even tells Zotul that their goal is to buy out all of the companies and eventually become the ruling government on Zur. ",
        "Summary_4": "From the beginning, the Earthmen put themselves as friendly mentors, willing to share their knowledge. The newly introduced goods are cheap and much better than the old ones. It disposes the Zurians towards the kind newcomers. The newspapers and telegraphs are free and gain popularity, while they advertise Earth goods all through the planet. As the time goes by, the Earthmen bring in more expensive and advanced technologies like autos, TVs, radios. People become dependent on those technologies, and as they break, they need to buy the new ones, everyone dreams of luxury cars, etc. At the same time the local businesses fail and poverty approaches. To be able to buy the new technologies, the Zurians get credits and work for the Earthmen to pay them off. Then the contracts are cancelled and the people have to sell their businesses. Therefore, the Earthmen gain control over the whole planet. ",

It is an outrage, said Koltan of the House of Masur, that theEarthmen land among the Thorabians!     Zotul, youngest of the Masur brothers, stirred uneasily. Personally, hewas in favor of the coming of the Earthmen to the world of Zur.     At the head of the long, shining table sat old Kalrab Masur, in hisdotage, but still giving what he could of aid and comfort to thePottery of Masur, even though nobody listened to him any more andhe knew it. Around the table sat the six brothers\u2014Koltan, eldestand Director of the Pottery; Morvan, his vice-chief; Singula, theirtreasurer; Thendro, sales manager; Lubiosa, export chief; and last inthe rank of age, Zotul, who was responsible for affairs of design.     Behold, my sons, said Kalrab, stroking his scanty beard. What arethese Earthmen to worry about? Remember the clay. It is our strengthand our fortune. It is the muscle and bone of our trade. Earthmen maycome and Earthmen may go, but clay goes on forever ... and with it, thefame and fortune of the House of Masur.     It      is     a damned imposition, agreed Morvan, ignoring his father'sphilosophical attitude. They could have landed just as easily here inLor.     The Thorabians will lick up the gravy, said Singula, whose mind ranrather to matters of financial aspect, and leave us the grease.     By this, he seemed to imply that the Thorabians would rob the Earthmen,which the Lorians would not. The truth was that all on Zur were pantingto get their hands on that marvelous ship, which was all of metal, avery scarce commodity on Zur, worth billions of ken.   <doc-sep> All the chill recriminations and arguments Zotul had stored for thisoccasion were dissipated in the warmth of the Earthman's manner.     Almost apologetically, Zotul told of the encroachment that had beenmade upon the business of the Pottery of Masur.     Once, he said formally, the Masur fortune was the greatest inthe world of Zur. That was before my father, the famous KalrabMasur\u2014Divinity protect him\u2014departed this life to collect his greaterreward. He often told us, my father did, that the clay is the flesh andbones of our culture and our fortune. Now it has been shown how proneis the flesh to corruption and how feeble the bones. We are ruined, andall because of new things coming from Earth.     Broderick stroked his shaven chin and looked sad. Why didn't you cometo me sooner? This would never have happened. But now that it has,we're going to do right by you. That is the policy of Earth\u2014always todo right by the customer.     Divinity witness, Zorin said, that we ask only compensation fordamages.

You don't know what an overcrowded world is like, he said. A streetlike this, with so few people and vehicles on it, would be impossibleon Earth.     But it's mobbed, protested Zotul. It gave me a headache.     And to us it's almost empty. The pressure of population on Earth hasmade us range the Galaxy for places to put our extra people. The onlyhabitable planets, unfortunately, are populated ones. We take the leastpopulous worlds and\u2014well, buy them out and move in.     And after that?     Broderick smiled gently. Zur will grow. Our people will intermarrywith yours. The future population of Zur will be neither true Zuriansnor true Earthmen, but a mixture of both.     Zotul sat in silent thought. But you did not have to buy us out. Youhad the power to conquer us, even to destroy us. The whole planet couldhave been yours alone. He stopped in alarm. Or am I suggesting anidea that didn't occur to you?     No, said Broderick, his usually smiling face almost pained withmemory. We know the history of conquest all too well.

Now that the unpleasant job isfinished, we can repair the dislocations.     At last I understand what you said about the tortoise.     Slow but sure.

After all, itwas no more than fair to pay transportation.     He said, How much does the freight cost?     Broderick told him.     It may seem high, said the Earthman, but remember that Earth issixty-odd light-years away. After all, we are absorbing the cost of themerchandise. All you pay is the freight, which is cheap, consideringthe cost of operating an interstellar spaceship.     Impossible, said Zotul drably. Not I and all my brothers togetherhave so much money any more.     You don't know us of Earth very well yet, but you will. I offer youcredit!     What is that? asked Zotul skeptically.     It is how the poor are enabled to enjoy all the luxuries of therich, said Broderick, and went on to give a thumbnail sketch of theinvolutions and devolutions of credit, leaving out some angles thatmight have had a discouraging effect.     On a world where credit was a totally new concept, it was enchanting.Zotul grasped at the glittering promise with avidity. What must I doto get credit?     Just sign this paper, said Broderick, and you become part of ourEasy Payment Plan.     Zotul drew back. I have five brothers. If I took all these things formyself and nothing for them, they would beat me black and blue.     Here. Broderick handed him a sheaf of chattel mortgages. Have eachof your brothers sign one of these, then bring them back to me. That isall there is to it.     It sounded wonderful. But how would the brothers take it? Zotulwrestled with his misgivings and the misgivings won.     I will talk it over with them, he said. Give me the total so I willhave the figures.     The total was more than it ought to be by simple addition. Zotulpointed this out politely.     Interest, Broderick explained. A mere fifteen per cent. After all,you get the merchandise free. The transportation company has to bepaid, so another company loans you the money to pay for the freight.This small extra sum pays the lending company for its trouble.     I see. Zotul puzzled over it sadly. It is too much, he said. Ourplant doesn't make enough money for us to meet the payments.     I have a surprise for you, smiled Broderick. Here is a contract. Youwill start making ceramic parts for automobile spark plugs and certainparts for radios and gas ranges. It is our policy to encourage localmanufacture to help bring prices down.     We haven't the equipment.     We will equip your plant, beamed Broderick.

Once inside, Kevin falls down from muscle pain and Doc starts mumbling something that Kevin subconsciously remembers to be of utter importance. After writing down everything he heard from the old man, Kevin leaves in a search for coffee. A woman on the street agrees to pay for his drink and food despite Kevin\u2019s impoverished appearance -  we learn that he has a caffeine addiction that presents in a way more profound and serious way in Centurian men than in earthmen. She introduces herself as Vivian Casey and asks for a favor in return, handing him what seems to be a magazine coupon with some strange content. Suddenly Kevin becomes disoriented, Vivian disappears, leaving the money for the food in his fist. He pays for the bill, ordering some more to take with him, and comes back to Doc who has managed to create some strangely looking device from a bulb, a pen, and the bed carcass while Kevin was away. After kneeling beside Doc while the old man is murmuring something Kevin soon realizes that he is in a Victorian living room. He finally remembers that time travel was the reason why he considered Doc important. He meets two men that seem to be Sherlock Holmes and Dr.Watson. They briefly talk about time travel and after the doctor gives him his manuscript  Kevin finally goes back to his time only to find Miss Casey\u2019s gun pointed at him. She turns out to be a constable and tells Kevin that Doc found a way to travel in time and decided to make money by getting rare books in the past, but apparently started bringing works that had never existed. Kevin throws coffee at Casey, disarming her, but instantly sees a Martian at his door. Andre, as he introduced himself, continues the story Casey started and claims that hundreds of people disappeared after receiving Doc\u2019s books, but what\u2019s even more important, these books, which never existed, can help humans reach a state of pure logic. During their conversation, Andre also helps Kevin remember that Doc is his father and Kevin himself is actually an earthman not a Centurian. Overwhelmed, Kevin quickly decides to break the time travel device and, thus, lose this knowledge for many years because he\u2019s certain that neither Martians nor earthmen are truly ready for time travel.",
        "Summary_3": "The story introduces an initially unnamed protagonist, who accompanies a fellow named \u201cDoc\u201d, both of whom are men but not Earthmen, hence Centurians. Doc is first introduced as choking a human man, seemingly in a trance and talking about a man reaching the moon. The protagonist carefully removes the human from Doc\u2019s hold and asks for forgiveness, claiming memory issues, and the pair move on to a cheap motel. While arguing for the cost of their stay, the clerk finds out that the protagonist had cheapened him despite having a quarter, and keeps the remaining nickel. \n\nThere, the protagonist lays Doc on the bed in the dirty room and as he begins to mumble, the protagonist begins to take notes amidst his own cramps and feelings of dirtiness. He soon remembers that the Doc holds the information to become a powerful man. However, his own pain wins out and the protagonist stumbles out of the room and encounters a clean, young woman, hoping to beg for a cup of coffee and she does, but only as she accompanies him in drinking coffee and eating several hamburgers. Introducing herself as Miss Vivian Casey and himself as John Kevin - the protagonist finally realizing his name - Casey presents Kevin with a coupon clipping from a magazine detailing a request for \u201cThe Scarlet Book\u201d. As he reads it however, Kevin finds himself disoriented and the young woman gone. Kevin heads back to the room and finds that Doc has created an unnamed thing, which he finds trouble understanding its meaning. \n\nKevin suddenly finds himself in a Victorian living room with a man he labels as a snowbird, the latter who probes Kevin to reveal what time and place he has come from. Surprised, Kevin realizes that the information he was trying to get from Doc was time travel, and this Victorian snowbird had come to this conclusion as well. Through a length of discourse, Kevin describes what he knows about various Earth theories like yoga and relativity. Afterwards, he asks the doctor a question about his first manuscript and accepts the papers before finding himself back in the original timeline of this story, looking straight into Casey\u2019s gun. \n\nMiss Casey turns out to be a policewoman, who after being handed the manuscript papers, reveals to Kevin that Doc has indeed figured out a method for time travel by obtaining rare editions of literature and books that did not exist for his clients. Aided by a Martian named Andre, it is revealed that hundreds of people have disappeared after receiving a book from the Doc and that Kevin was actually Doc\u2019s son - and human. A dispute soon occurs between the three ending with Kevin destroying the time machine, hoping that the future rediscovery of time travel will be accompanied by the world\u2019s readiness for it. In his ending thoughts - Kevin debates why he did that - for the human race\u2019s purpose, or for the production of coffee. \n",
        "Summary_4": "When John Kevin caught up with Doc, a man was grabbing the collar of Doc. He took Doc from the man and walked him to a flophouse. When he got them a room to stay in, he tried to save some money from the only quarter. He needed that money to get something caffeinated after taking care of Doc. However, he failed, and the clerk took the money in the flophouse. After he recorded some notes for Doc\u2019s mumbling, he went out to get food. He begged for a woman on the street for money, but the woman would only buy him food after watching him eat. He gulped some hamburgers and coffee when the woman watched him eat, bought some food after the women had left, and left for the flophouse to feed the Doc. John Kevin has trouble finding the memory of himself because of the side effects of time travel. He mistook himself as Kevin O\u2019Malley, which is Doc\u2019s name. He also mistakenly considered himself a Centurian, who regarded drinking coffee as a vice, when he was an Earthman. When the woman asked for his name, he introduced himself as Kevin because he thought Kevin O\u2019Malley was his name. When John Kevin went back to the room, he saw Doc had made a thing by using the materials in the room.\n\nHe time-traveled to the Victorian era, where he saw two men sitting on chairs and chatting. During his stay in that era, he realized what he had been trying to know from Doc was time travel. He also realized that the man he talked to within the room, who he mistook as a snowbird, is Doc. After talking to the men, he received the first manuscript from them and returned to his own time, where he reencountered the woman, whose gun pointed at him. She revealed herself as a constable from the police, trying to tell Kevin the truth. But he rivaled against her. Then a Martian came, trying to do the same thing as the woman. From their saying, John Kevin realized his true identity as Doc\u2019s son and knew the consequences of Doc\u2019s use of time travel. Once he understood the situation, he destroyed the time machine because he didn\u2019t want to live in a pure logical state, which is the outcome of using time travel to make fantasy reality.\n",

You know what happens before the end of the line reaches the counter.No more packages.     Well, I couldn't get myself off N/P status until I got a post, andwith my name I      couldn't     get a post.     Nor could I change my name. You know what happens when you try tochange something already on the records. The very idea of wantingchange implies criticism of the State. Unthinkable behavior.

        "Summary_1": "Vivian Casey is described as a pink and clean woman who smells of clean soap. Her hair is platinum, pulled straight back to draw her cheek-bones tighter. She has an appealing mouth; Kevin also notes that her body is lean, athletic, and feminine. She also wears a powder-blue dress that goes down to the lower-half of her legs. She speaks in an educated voice and is kind enough to take Kevin to get some food. Although he is annoyed she decided to tag along, she lets him order multiple hamburgers to satisfy his hunger. When she introduces herself, he assumes that she is a schoolteacher. Kevin later realizes that she did not pay for his dinner at all. Miss Casey then comes back with a tiny gun. She is shown to be proficient with the firearm, introducing her true identity as a Constable of the North American Mounted Police. She is also very intelligent, being fully aware of what Doc has tried to do in the past. Although she uses force to judo hold Kevin, she doesn\u2019t put her heart into it. Finally, she is shown to be proud of Kevin when he does the right thing and destroys the time machine. ",
        "Summary_2": "Vivian Casey is a decently looking woman who agrees to pay for the drink and food of Kevin, a poor Centurian man who has been wandering around North America with Doc, someone who Kevin believes to be important to him. After Kevin uses the time travel device, that Doc has made while Kevin was away, and finally comes back from the Victorian era, Vivian waits for him with a gun and introduces herself as a constable of North American mounted Police. Apparently, she has been following Kevin and Doc, his father who found a method of time travel,  for a while and even got closer to him by pretending to be an innocent bystander when he was hungry and suffering withdrawal effects in the beginning of the story. When Kevin destroys the device she cries and admits that she\u2019s glad he did that. Vivian seems to be a good constable who can understand people well, but she\u2019s also sincere enough to accept her view on things. ",
        "Summary_3": "Vivian Casey is first introduced to us as a clean young woman waiting at a bus stop, assumed by Kevin to be a schoolteacher and a tourist. She is approached by Kevin as he begs for a small amount of change to use to buy coffee. His request will only be fulfilled if she accompanies him, so Kevin reluctantly follows her as she buys him coffee and hamburgers. She is heavily emphasized as being clean and introduces herself to Kevin as Miss Vivian Casey with a bright smile. After providing him with food and drink, Casey requests a small favor from Kevin and presents him with a coupon clipping from a magazine that details a request for \u201cThe Scarlet Book\u201d. \n\nWe see Miss Casey again as the protagonist reappears in front of her tiny gun, where it is revealed that she is not a schoolteacher nor a tourist but rather a North American Mounted Police. Her interaction with Kevin was intentional, as she had been tracking him and the Doc in order to stop the latter\u2019s method of time travel. She plays a key role in helping Kevin unravel the truth about his identity and what the Doc was doing. In the scuffle to keep the time machine out of the hands of the Martians, she grabs Kevin in a judo hold which he quickly breaks and then  destroys the machine.

        "Query": "What negative effects result from Doc's utilization of time travel in Confidence Game?",
        "Summary_1": "Doc\u2019s use of time travel has caused hundreds of people to disappear from North America a few months ago. He initially starts off using time travel to get rare editions of books and magazines in mint condition. However, he derails and starts getting books that do not exist. For many of his clients, they shortly ceased to exist after obtaining a book from Doc. Doc also had bought the entire stock of an ancient metaphysical order, which he then supplied to his clients. Books such as the Book of Dyzan, Book of Thoth, Seven Cryptical Books of Hsan, and the Necromican were given away even if they do not exist in the present-day. These books are extremely harmful because they essentially instruct the human race on how to achieve a state of pure logic without requiring food, sex, or conflict. ",
        "Summary_2": "After finding a method to travel in time Doc, an earthly scholar, decided to make money by bringing rare book editions from different times to his clients. But once he started bringing books that have never existed his clients disappeared soon after receiving them - at least several hundred people in North America ceased to exist after getting their order from Doc. Furthermore, time traveling allowed the \u201cunconscious racial mind\u201d to construct new worlds and realities by creating new books that were able to teach humans how to reach the state of pure logic and therefore deprive them of all humanly characteristics. ",
        "Summary_3": "Doc\u2019s use of time travel has caused hundreds of people to disappear from North America - as if they ceased to exist. This occurred shortly after Doc gave them a book - books that were collected in metaphysical order and distributed to his liking. As a result, the interplay of time travel and bringing books and their knowledge in and out of existence has caused them to ultimately not exist, but still influence the unconscious mind into creating them. As such, it is revealed that the human mind has been able to understand and access the powers of ESP, telekinesis, etc as well as achieve states of pure logic and thought. Both immediate consequences, like the erasure of people\u2019s existence, as well as existential consequences like the potential for the power of human minds to be accessed occurred because of his time travel. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Time travel allows the unconscious racial mind, a mind that knows the power of extrasensory perception, to go back in time and create books that do not exist before. These books allow the human race to teach itself how to turn the material body with desires into a pure logic state without the body, where they don\u2019t need sex, food, or any material supply. Therefore, when Doc uses time travel to create those books and distribute them to people, people who received the books from Doc disappear. Their material existence vanishes. And Doc himself also reaches the state of pure logic, where his material existence disappears.",

Maybe I had destroyed the time machine because a world without materialneeds would not grow and roast coffee.    <doc-sep> She inclined the lethal silver toy. Let me see those papers, Kevin.     I handed her the doctor's manuscript.     Her breath escaped slowly and loudly. It's all right. It's all right.It exists. It's real. Not even one of the unwritten ones. I've readthis myself.     Doc was lying on the cot, half his face twisted into horror.     Don't move, Kevin, she said. I'll have to shoot you\u2014maybe not tokill, but painfully.     I watched her face flash blue, red, blue and knew she meant it. But Ihad known too much in too short a time. I had to help Doc, but therewas something else.     I just want a drink of coffee from that container on the chair, Itold her.     She shook her head. I don't know what you think it does to you.     It was getting hard for me to think. Who are you?     She showed me a card from her wrist purse. Vivian Casey, Constable,North American Mounted Police.     I had to help Doc. I had to have some coffee. What do you want?     Listen, Kevin. Listen carefully to what I am saying. Doc founda method of time travel. It was almost a purely mathematical,topographical way divorced from modern physical sciences. He kept itsecret and he wanted to make money with it. He was an idealist\u2014he hadhis crusades. How can you make money with time travel?     I didn't know whether she was asking me, but I didn't know. All I knewwas that I had to help Doc and get some coffee.     It takes money\u2014money Doc didn't have\u2014to make money, Miss Caseysaid, even if you know what horse will come in and what stock willprosper. Besides, horse-racing and the stock market weren't a part ofDoc's character. He was a scholar.     Why did she keep using the past tense in reference to Doc? It scaredme. He was lying so still with the left side of his face so twisted. Ineeded some coffee.     He became a book finder. He got rare editions of books and magazinesfor his clients in absolutely mint condition. That was all right\u2014untilhe started obtaining books that      did not exist     .  "

        "Summary_1": "Kevin initially believes that he is a Centurian who must carry Doc around in order to achieve something powerful from the man. He firmly believes him and Doc to be superior to the Earthmen and Martian tourists. Kevin is filthy, but he refuses to take a bath. He also has an addiction to caffeine, mistakenly believing that it is the side effect of being a Centurian. Although he looks down on humans, he is desperate enough to ask one for help and for some food. His fingernails are black-crowned and broken, while his teeth are of yellow ivory. He is also suntan and sprouts a short mane. Although he lies to Miss Casey and says his name is John Kevin, he realizes that his name is actually Kevin O\u2019Malley. While Kevin does admit that he wants something from Doc, he also is clearly shown to care for the old man. It is later revealed that Doc is his father, Kevin O\u2019Malley Sr. Even after Miss Casey reveals she is a member of the police, Kevin is still brave enough to throw the rest of the coffee in her face. Later, he realizes that he is actually an Earth human and not a Centurian. His caffeine addiction comes from the mind. Even though he cares for his father, Kevin does choose to make the right decision to destroy the time machine because he does not want humanity to become purely logical. ",
        "Summary_2": "Kevin is a Centurian humanoid who roams around North America with Doc, a man whom Kevin finds utterly important though he doesn\u2019t exactly remember why. He has a strong caffeine addiction and doesn\u2019t know a lot of facts about his life. Kevin cares about Doc even before he remembers that the man is his father. He aspires to get the knowledge of time travel from Doc, but later understands that his time is not ready for this yet and he cannot let two powerful empires fight for it and destroys the device. Kevin is lost and confused throughout the entire story, he\u2019s sometimes judgmental and condescending but also kind and gentle.   \n",
        "Summary_3": "Kevin is the protagonist in this story, who is first introduced as accompanying the Doc as to gain some important information from him to become the most powerful person in the Solar Federation. He is described to be incessantly dirty - no matter how many baths he may take he can never be clean, and hence chooses not to be anymore. He is a self-proclaimed Centuarian, and like his kind, has a vice for caffeine which he fulfills with coffee or if desperate, with leftover droplets of soda. If he does not get enough caffeine, he becomes withdrawn with pain and behaves similar to an addict. Kevin has a disliking for Martians, tourists and Earth-humans, and is always sure to emphasize the distinction between him as a Man but not as a Earth-man. \n\nThroughout Kevin\u2019s own time travel adventures and later interactions with Miss Casey, the policewoman, and the Martian Andre, he finds out that he is the Doctor, Kevin O\u2019Malley Senior\u2019s son, and is in fact human. As the story comes to a close, he plays an integral role in destroying the Doc\u2019s time machine and hence halting science\u2019s momentary progression on time travel. In some of his ending thoughts, he debates requesting Miss Casey\u2019s help in stopping his addiction to caffeine while also wanting to ensure the continued production of coffee. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Kevin is the son of Doc, the son of a scholar who found the method of time travel and caused the disappearance of hundreds of people in Northern America. Kevin is dirty and addicted to caffeine. Kevin also introduced himself as John Kevin when he misremembered Doc\u2019s name as his own. He is unsanitary and underfed. He is also addicted to rum or opium. His teeth are yellow, and his fingernails are filled with black dirt and broken. He never grows a beard. He staggers like a wino. He considered himself a Centurian, a humanoid species that sees drinking coffee as a vice. However, contrary to his memory, he was an Earthman, but he didn\u2019t want to admit this fact. He didn\u2019t want to be cured or told who he was.\n\n",

She pushed a white rectangle in front of me on the painted maroon bar.What do you think of this?     I looked at the piece of paper. It was a coupon from a magazine.       Dear Acolyte R. I.

There was a five dollar bill tight in my fist. The counterman wastrying to pull it out.     I looked up at his stubbled face. I had half a dozen hamburgers, acup of coffee and a glass of milk. I want four more 'burgers to go anda pint of coffee. By your prices, that will be one sixty-five\u2014if thelady didn't pay you.     She didn't, he stammered. Why do you think I was trying to get thatbill out of your hand?     I didn't say anything, just got up off the floor. After the countermanput down my change, I spread out the five dollar bill on the vacantbar, smoothing it.     I scooped up my change and walked out the door. There was no one on thesidewalk, only in the doorways.   <doc-sep> Playing the game was fabulously expensive; it had to be to make itprofitable for the Vinzz to run it. Those odd creatures from Altair'sseventh planet cared nothing for the welfare of the completely alienhuman beings; all they wanted was to feather their own pockets withinterstellar credits, so that they could return to Vinau and buy manyslaves. For, on Vinau, bodies were of little account, and so to themzarquil was the equivalent of the terrestrial game musical chairs.Which was why they came to Terra to make profits\u2014there has never beenbig money in musical chairs as such.     When the zarquil operators were apprehended, which was not frequent\u2014asthey had strange powers, which, not being definable, were beyond thelaw\u2014they suffered their sentences with equanimity. No Earth courtcould give an effective prison sentence to a creature whose lifespanned approximately two thousand terrestrial years. And capitalpunishment had become obsolete on Terra, which very possibly saved theterrestrials embarrassment, for it was not certain that their weaponscould kill the Vinzz ... or whether, in fact, the Vinzz merely expiredafter a period of years out of sheer boredom. Fortunately, becausetrade was more profitable than war, there had always been peace betweenVinau and Terra, and, for that reason, Terra could not bar the entranceof apparently respectable citizens of a friendly planet.     The taxi driver took the fat man to one of the rather seedy locales inwhich the zarquil games were usually found, for the Vinzz attempted toconduct their operations with as much unobtrusiveness as was possible.But the front door swung open on an interior that lacked the opulenceof the usual Vinoz set-up; it was down-right shabby, the dim olivelight hinting of squalor rather than forbidden pleasures. That wasthe trouble in these smaller towns\u2014you ran greater risks of gettinginvolved in games where the players had not been carefully screened.     The Vinoz games were usually clean, because that paid off better, but,when profits were lacking, the Vinzz were capable of sliding off intodarkside practices. Naturally the small-town houses were more likely tohave trouble in making ends meet, because everybody in the parish kneweverybody else far too well.     The fat man wondered whether that had been his quarry's motive incoming to such desolate, off-trail places\u2014hoping that eventuallydisaster would hit the one who pursued him. Somehow, such a plan seemedtoo logical for the man he was haunting.     However, beggars could not be choosers. The fat man paid off theheli-driver and entered the zarquil house. One? the small greencreature in the slightly frayed robe asked.     One, the fat man answered.      III     The would-be thief fled down the dark alley, with the hot bright raysfrom the stranger's gun lancing out after him in flamboyant but futilepatterns. The stranger, a thin young man with delicate, angularfeatures, made no attempt to follow. Instead, he bent over to examineGabriel Lockard's form, appropriately outstretched in the gutter. Onlyweighted out, he muttered, he'll be all right. Whatever possessed youtwo to come out to a place like this?     I really think Gabriel      must     be possessed.... the girl said, mostlyto herself. I had no idea of the kind of place it was going to beuntil he brought me here. The others were bad, but this is even worse.It almost seems as if he went around looking for trouble, doesn't it?     It does indeed, the stranger agreed, coughing a little. It wasgrowing colder and, on this world, the cities had no domes to protectthem from the climate, because it was Earth and the air was breathableand it wasn't worth the trouble of fixing up.     The girl looked closely at him. You look different, but you      are     thesame man who pulled us out of that aircar crash, aren't you? And beforethat the man in the gray suit? And before that...?     The young man's cheekbones protruded as he smiled. Yes, I'm all ofthem.     Then what they say about the zarquil games is true? There are peoplewho go around changing their bodies like\u2014like hats? Automatically shereached to adjust the expensive bit of blue synthetic on her moon-palehair, for she was always conscious of her appearance; if she had notbeen so before marriage, Gabriel would have taught her that.   <doc-sep> For more than a century, robotocists have been trying to build Asimov'sfamous Three Laws of Robotics into a robot brain.       First Law: A robot shall not, either through action or inaction, allowharm to come to a human being.         Second Law: A robot shall obey the orders of a human being, exceptwhen such orders conflict with the First Law     .     [15]       Third Law: A robot shall strive to protect its own existence, exceptwhen this conflicts with the First or Second Law.       Nobody has succeeded yet, because nobody has yet succeeded in definingthe term human being in such a way that the logical mind of a robotcan encompass the concept.     A traffic robot is useful only because the definition has been rigidlynarrowed down. As far as a traffic robot is concerned, human beingsare the automobiles on its highways. Woe betide any poor sap who tries,illegally, to cross a robot-controlled highway on foot. The robot'sonly concern would be with the safety of the automobiles, and if theonly way to avoid destruction of an automobile were to be by nudgingthe pedestrian aside with a fender, that's what would happen.     And, since its orders only come from one place, I suppose that atraffic robot thinks that the guy who uses that typer is an automobile.     With the first six models of the McGuire ships, the robotocistsattempted to build in the Three Laws exactly as stated. And the firstsix went insane.     If one human being says jump left, and another says jump right,the robot is unable to evaluate which human being has given the morevalid order. Feed enough confusing and conflicting data into a robotbrain, and it can begin behaving in ways that, in a human being, wouldbe called paranoia or schizophrenia or catatonia or what-have-you,depending  [16]  on the symptoms. And an insane robot is fully as dangerousas an insane human being controlling the same mechanical equipment, ifnot more so.     So the seventh model had been modified. The present McGuire's brain wasimpressed with slight modifications of the First and Second Laws.     If it is difficult to define a human being, it is much more difficultto define a      responsible     human being. One, in other words, who canbe relied upon to give wise and proper orders to a robot, who can berelied upon not to drive the robot insane.     The robotocists at Viking Spacecraft had decided to take anothertack. Very well, they'd said, if we can't define all the membersof a group, we can certainly define an individual. We'll pick oneresponsible person and build McGuire so that he will take orders onlyfrom that person.     As it turned out, I was that person. Just substitute Daniel Oakfor human being in the First and Second Laws, and you'll see howimportant I was to a certain spaceship named McGuire.  "

        "Summary_1": "The story first begins with Doc and Kevin going to a flophouse three doors down from where Doc has his confrontation. As they turn around the corner, many Martian tourists walk by. The flophouse door is fly-specked, and a tubercular clerk is sitting in a gaudy comics section. The room they later go to is six feet in all directions with five feet high walls. The other foot is finished in chickenwire; there is also a wino singing on the left, wino praying on the right, and a door with no lock. There is also a gray-brown cot that Kevin lays Doc on, and a light bulb for light. Kevin also sits in a chair; the floor is littered and uncovered. The knob of the door is slick with greasy dirt. Later, Kevin goes out to the streets. They go to a restaurant, where he sits at the counter with a cup of coffee. There is also a stool for Miss Casey to sit in next to his stool. As he leaves, he notices that there is nobody on the sidewalks. Kevin describes himself opening the door to an amber world and then an azure one. Neon light also comes from the chickenwire border of the room, from a window somewhere beyond. When Kevin brings back food to the flophouse, he mentions that there are rats in the walls. Inside his mind, one man sits on an ornate armchair. Another man is sprawled in the other chair. Later, as Kevin goes back to reality, the confrontation between Miss Casey, Andre, and him happens in the same room with Doc still on the cot. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story is set in the world where earthmen run a Solar Federation - it incorporates several different planets and population groups, including humans, Martians, Centurian humanoids, etc. Kevin, a Centurian man, and Doc, a nameless old earthman that Kevin remembers to be very important for something, walk to a flophouse. They get a small room which Kevin leaves shortly after on a search for food and coffee - he has a caffeine addiction. He meets a woman called Vivian at the bus stop and she agrees to pay for his food, leading him to a cafe. Later, he comes back to Doc who has managed to construct a device which is used for time travel as Kevin understands after he unexpectedly finds himself  in an old Victorian room. Coming back to his time and his room, Kevin meets Vivian, a North American constable, holding a gun and later, Andre, the representative of the Martians. After they tell him the truth about the consequences of time traveling and help him remember his identity, Kevin breaks the device, destroying the time travel knowledge for many years, as it seems to be the most prudent decision to him. \n",

Tourists seem to be prevalent as well as the protagonist moves around from various locations within the setting like the bus stop, the diner or restaurant, and the motel room. The story primarily takes place in the dirty motel room where it is first inhabited by the Doc on the single bed and the protagonist, Kevin, slipping in out and then later by the stand-off between the Doc, Kevin, Vivian Casey and Andre. \nDue to the existence of time travel in this story, the setting also changes momentarily for Kevin. In the middle of the story, he finds himself in a Victorian living room, which he is able to identify due to his familiarity with Earth\u2019s history. In this temporary setting, he finds himself in the company of a thin, sickly man who sits in an ornate chair and another man filling a curved pipe with what looked like ice-skate. \n",

Throughout the whole story, he finally found out his dad, an Earthman known as Doc, had caused many people to disappear from Northern America due to the use of time travel. Time travel allows people to make things that do not exist come into existence by extrasensory perception.

Doc had this solemn human by the throat when I caught up with him.     Tonight, Doc was saying in his old voice that was as crackled andimportant as parchment, tonight Man will reach the Moon. The goldenMoon and the silver ship, symbols of greed. Tonight is the night whenthis is to happen.     Sure, the man agreed severely, prying a little worriedly at Doc'sarthritic fingers that were clamped on his collar. No argument. Sure,up we go. But leave me go or, so help me, I'll fetch you one in theteeth!     I came alongside and carefully started to lever the old man loose,one finger at a time. It had to be done this way. I had learned thatduring all these weeks and months. His hands looked old and crippled,but I felt they were the strongest in the world. If a half dozen winosin Seattle hadn't helped me get them loose, Doc and I would have beenwanted for the murder of a North American Mountie.     It was easier this night and that made me afraid. Doc's thin frame,layered with lumpy fat, was beginning to muscle-dance against my side.One of his times was coming on him. Then at last he was free of thegreasy collar of the human.     I hope you'll forgive him, sir, I said, not meeting the man's eyes.He's my father and very old, as you can see. I laughed inside at theabsurd, easy lie. Old events seem recent to him.     The human nodded, Adam's apple jerking in the angry neon twilight.'Memory Jump,' you mean. All my great-grandfathers have it. ButGreat-great-grandmother Lupos, funny thing, is like a schoolgirl.Sharp, you know. I.... Say, the poor old guy looks sick. Want any help?     I told the human no, thanks, and walked Doc toward the flophouse threedoors down. I hoped we would make it. I didn't know what would happenif we didn't. Doc was liable to say something that might nova Sol, forall I knew.   <doc-sep> Remembering last night, he felt a pang of exasperation, which heinstantly quelled by taking his mind to a higher and dispassionatelevel from which he could look down on the girl and even himself asquaint, clumsy animals. Still, he grumbled silently, Caddy might havehad enough consideration to clear out before he awoke. He wonderedif he shouldn't have used his hypnotic control of the girl to smooththeir relationship last night, and for a moment the word that wouldsend her into deep trance trembled on the tip of his tongue. But no,that special power of his over her was reserved for far more importantpurposes.     Pumping dynamic tension into his 20-year-old muscles and confidenceinto his 60-year-old mind, the 40-year-old Thinker rose from bed.No covers had to be thrown off; the nuclear heating unit made themunnecessary. He stepped into his clothing\u2014the severe tunic, tights andsockassins of the modern business man. Next he glanced at the messagetape beside his phone, washed down with ginger ale a vita-amino-enzymetablet, and walked to the window. There, gazing along the rows of newlyplanted mutant oaks lining Decontamination Avenue, his smooth facebroke into a smile.     It had come to him, the next big move in the intricate game makingup his life\u2014and mankind's.

The buzz-light blinked green and he switched the phone to audio.     The President is waiting to see Maizie, sir, a clear feminine voiceannounced. He has the general staff with him.     Martian peace to him, Jorj Helmuth said. Tell him I'll be down in afew minutes.   <doc-sep> Matheny's finger stabbed in the general direction of Doran's pajamatop. Exactly. And who set it up that way? Earthmen. We Martians arebabes in the desert. What chance do we have to earn dollars on thescale we need them, in competition with corporations which could buyand sell our whole planet before breakfast? Why, we couldn't affordthree seconds of commercial time on a Lullaby Pillow 'cast. What weneed, what we have to hire, is an executive who knows Earth, who's anEarthman himself.

I'm just a college professor at home. How would I even getto see\u2014     It might be arranged, said Doran in a thoughtful tone. It justmight. How much could you pay this fellow?     A hundred megabucks a year, if he'll sign a five-year contract. That'sEarth years, mind you.     I'm sorry to tell you this, Pete, said Doran, but while that is notbad money, it is not what a high-powered sales scientist gets in NewerYork. Plus his retirement benefits, which he would lose if he quitwhere he is now at. And I am sure he would not want to settle on Marspermanently.     I could offer a certain amount of, uh, lagniappe, said Matheny. Thatis, well, I can draw up to a hundred megabucks myself for, uh, expensesand, well ... let me buy you a drink!     Doran's black eyes frogged at him. You might at that, said theEarthman very softly. Yes, you might at that.     Matheny found himself warming. Gus Doran was an authentic bobber. Ahell of a swell chap. He explained modestly that he was a free-lancebusiness consultant and it was barely possible that he could arrangesome contacts....     No, no, no commission, all done in the interest of interplanetaryfriendship ... well, anyhow, let's not talk business now. If you havegot to stick to beer, Pete, make it a chaser to akvavit. What isakvavit? Well, I will just take and show you.     A hell of a good bloke. He knew some very funny stories, too, andhe laughed at Matheny's, though they were probably too rustic for abig-city taste like his.

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in THE MAN OUTSIDE?",
        "Summary_1": "This story follows the life of Martin from a young boy living in a rough neighborhood to an old man dying aboard an unmanned ship. We first see Martin following the disappearance of his mother - and lack of a father - which are commonplace in the neighborhood he grows up in where the kids rarely attend school and their living conditions are poor. Martin is taken in by a young woman, Ninian, who instructs him to call her Aunt Ninian despite being identified as his future descendant. Ninian has traveled back in time to her great-great-grandfather - Martin - in order to protect him from his future son Conrad. Conrad, described as an idealist, is dismayed by the future generations exploitation of Earth and destructive social order that casts out anyone and everything that doesn't encompass the privileged and elite. To correct the wrongdoings of the future, Conrad plans to kill Martin. The rest of Conrad\u2019s cousins intercept this plan and instead, all decide to travel into the past to accompany Martin and protect him from an assassination attempt. \n\nMartin\u2019s formative years are accompanied by Ninian, Raymond and Ives where he picks up art as a career, forms impersonal relationships with his descendants and learns more about the past and future quality of life. As years pass with no threat of Conrad in sight, Martin begins to explore his world alongside Ives on a yacht named The Interregnum. Soon though, the cousins that come and go begin to blur together and Martin picks up a detached view of the world as his interest wanes in his sheltered life. Martin lives to a very old age, and on his deathbed aboard the yacht, he is surrounded by all his descendants besides Ives, who passed of sickness earlier before. It is at this moment that Conrad appears, seemingly to finish his murder plot. However, it is revealed that no action was required to be taken by Conrad, as his fellow cousins have already achieved the mission of erasing their lineage. By containing Martin to a sheltered life, the cousins prevented Martin from living his normal life with a wife and kids, thus removing the possibility of their existence in the past, present and future. Furthermore, it is revealed that Martin had come to the same conclusion years ago, and chose instead to keep quiet out of his disdain for his descendants. With the cousins horrified at the knowledge, Conrad reassures Martin that their inaction resulted in hope, and Martin ponders to wonder if the assurance was genuine as he peacefully dies alone on the boat. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Martin\u2019s mother disappears, but nobody is surprised because mothers usually disappear around these parts. Ninian comes to take care of him, and he has no father because he was born as a war baby. Martin thinks that the story about Ninian being from the future is a gag, and he likes to bait her because she ends up crying. Ninian, however, tells him that she is protecting him from her cousin Conrad who is coming to kill him in the future. His living conditions have improved, but Martin misses his old neighborhood where he could play with the other children. Ninian and her relatives only take care of him as if it is some unpleasant duty; he learns that nobody works with hands anymore in their world because it is all done by machinery. When Martin turns sixteen, Raymond tells him about Conrad and his idealist ideas of making living fairer for the exploited natives on other planets. Conrad blames his great-grandfather for discovering the super drive. Conrad then bribes one of Professor Farka\u2019s assistants to reveal information about a time transmitter, and he plans to go back in time to eliminate the common ancestor. Raymond explains that they got plans from another assistant and a handicrafts enthusiast to build another gadget. They could guard over Martin day and night so Conrad could not attack. Raymond explains that Ninian is leaving, and Martin feels oddly desolate because of their time together. When she leaves, Ninian cries at her inadequacy; Martin and Raymond move to a luxurious mansion in a remote area that protects them from the Second Atomic War. The relatives come back to hold meetings; Martin thinks he wants to be a physicist or engineer, but the relatives insist that he should be a painter. Ives eventually takes over and displays his art in a museum, and he buys a yacht called The Interregnum to go traveling. He lives out the rest of his days on the yacht with the other descendants, but he does not care for them much. Ives explains that the future world is not that much better, and he isn\u2019t even sure if Conrad is wrong. Ives, however, ends up dying from a chill. Eventually, Martin\u2019s work is bought by a museum in Italy; he asks one cousin where Conrad is. He lies dying at one hundred and four as the relatives all come to visit. Conrad comes to visit too, and he explains to the other cousins that they will all disappear because Martin was never allowed to lead a normal life. After realizing that the other man knew all along, Raymond calls Martin a criminal, but Martin does not mind. Conrad tells him that their plan will benefit the future, but Martin is not sure if he is telling the truth or not. As Martin dies, he is the only one left on the ship because everybody else has disappeared. ",
        "Summary_3": "The story describes the life of Martin, a young kid whose mother dies. When this happens, a new woman begins to take care of him. She, called Ninian, tells Martin that she comes from the future, and is there to take care of him. Throughout this, Martin doesn\u2019t question the motives of his caretaker. Later, it is also revealed that she is a descendant of Martin. More and more descendants of Martin come to his time in order to take care of him, taking turns of about 5 years in doing so, and are referred to as cousins. One of the cousins also reveals that the reason that they are protecting him is because one of their cousins wants to kill him. This is because one of Martin\u2019s descendants created a piece of equipment that allowed humans to travel through space, leading to humans taking advantage of native species of other planets for their own economic benefit. Conrad, the descendant who wanted to kill him, wants to stop humans from ever traveling through space. Martin continues this boring life, preparing for the eventual arrival of Conrad who wants to kill him. Throughout his boring and repetitive life, Martin begins to question the actions of his descendants. When eventually Martin is an old man and is going to die, all of his descendants get together to say goodbye. This is where Conrad finally made an appearance, and it is revealed that everything was part of Conrad\u2019s plan, as living his repetitive life Martin never had the chance to have children, therefore stopping his descendant from inventing the equipment necessary for human space travel. ",
        "Summary_4": "The story tells about the life of a boy called Martin. At the beginning, he lives in a poor neighborhood with his mother, who disappears one day. Instead, he is now looked after by Ninian, who claims to be Martin\u2019s descendant from the future who came here to protect him from Conrad - Ninian\u2019s cousin. She hires private tutors for him and soon decides to move to a better neighborhood and live in a big well-furnished house. Occasionally, the other descendants, like Ives or Raymond, also visit them and talk about the future where almost nobody works, and everything is done by machinery. Martin turns sixteen when Raymond finally tells him the full story: Raymond's brother Conrad was disappointed by the fact that the humans of his time exploited the other life forms on the other planets to get food and resources. He decided to eliminate their common ancestor - Martin -  so that no space travel inventions would have existed. The others - cousins as he should call them - went back in time to save him and, consequently, save themselves. Martin also learns about the security system and the collection of weaponry they have to protect him. Soon Ninian leaves, and Martin, together with Raymond, moves into a luxurious mansion in a remote area. They talk about Martin\u2019s future occupation. Though he prefers engineering or physics, they choose art to avoid any accidental premature inventions he can create since he is already familiar with the science of the future. Martin becomes a second-rate artist, and his new guardian - Ives - arrives. He decides to buy a yacht - The Interregnum - and see the rest of the world with Martin. Martin doesn\u2019t develop any special feelings for his ancestors, except for Ives. Martin learns more about the future from him: only an enclave of a couple of million people left on Earth, and representatives of the lower classes got deported to the other planets and are being exploited; several worlds have already been made inhabitable. Ives admits that his brother is not completely wrong, but he still cannot let him destroy his life. \n\nOne winter, Ives rapidly dies from a severe chill in Tierra del Fuego after they stopped there for a bit. Years go by, and Martin loses any interest in life, sometimes painting the sea view from the yacht. They stop in Italy, and he sells two paintings. Wars force them to go to different hemispheres and the Arctic. Eventually, Martin turns a hundred and four when his last illness comes. Finally, Conrad appears. He shocks all the gathered ancestors by explaining that the sheltered life they had created for Martin didn\u2019t allow him to live his own life, or at least, have kids. When he dies, everyone will disappear, too. Martin figured it out years ago. Conrad assures him that his deed leads to a better future because he has been there. Erasing the future all his ancestors came from, Martin peacefully dies on the yacht, which drifts for years about the seas. ",

The man Maitland had seen outside, now clad in gray trunks andsandals, stood across the threshold looking in at him. Maitland stoodup and stared back, conscious suddenly that in his rumpled pajamas hemade an unimpressive figure.     The fellow looked about forty-five. The first details Maitland noticedwere the forehead, which was quite broad, and the calm, clear eyes.The dark hair, white at the temples, was combed back, still damp fromswimming. Below, there was a wide mouth and a firm, rounded chin.     This man was intelligent, Maitland decided, and extremely sure ofhimself.     Somehow, the face didn't go with the rest of him. The man had the headof a thinker, the body of a trained athlete\u2014an unusual combination.     Impassively, the man said, My name is Swarts. You want to know whereyou are. I am not going to tell you. He had an accent, European, butotherwise unidentifiable. Possibly German. Maitland opened his mouthto protest, but Swarts went on, However, you're free to do all theguessing you want. Still there was no suggestion of a smile.     Now, these are the rules. You'll be here for about a week. You'll havethree meals a day, served in this room. You will not be allowed toleave it except when accompanied by myself. You will not be harmed inany way, provided you cooperate. And you can forget the silly idea thatwe want your childish secrets about rocket motors. Maitland's heartjumped.

        "Query": "What kind of connection exists between Martin and Ives in THE MAN OUTSIDE?",
        "Summary_1": "Cousin Ives enters Martin\u2019s life when he is a little older, and is the third descendant to accompany him as his guardian. Out of all his descendants to assume guardianship, Martin forms the closest relationship with Ives. Rather than seeing Martin as a responsibility and duty, Ives sees Martin as an individual and seeks ways to connect and encourage his passions. For one, Ives buys a yacht named The Interregnum to which the pair take upon themselves to explore the current world in. They traveled across the waters and inland to see both the civilized and uncivilized world, with Martin taking it all in. \n\nWhen it was just the two of them, their relationship progressed further. Ives began to open up about the future world that he and his descendants come from and explain the nuances of the social order that rules. Ives is the first to explicitly and honestly describe the feudal and privileged social class that Martin\u2019s descendants take part in, only due to their fortunate ancestry. Additionally, Ives is the only cousin to admit the potential truth in Conrad\u2019s intentions, noting the dilemma between achieving moral good and selfishing maintaining their own good life. Martin even comments his confidence in Ives being able to see the obvious flaw in the cousins\u2019 plans. However, during one winter, Ives fell ill to a severe chill and passed away before his own birth. After Ives\u2019 death, Martin relently voyages across oceans and soon as they and the cousins blur, he begins to live detachedly. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Martin shares a much better relationship with Ives than with the rest of the cousins. He is told to call Ives his cousin because he is older when Ives takes responsibility. Martin begins to paint more, and Ives arranges to have his works shown in a gallery. When there is little interest in his artwork, Ives reassures him that people will grow to enjoy them. Martin also thinks that Ives is the only one who tries to see him as an individual, even arranging a yacht to be bought so they can see the world. Martin likes spending time with Ives, and Ives also tells him about the world of the future. He explains to Martin that there is no poverty because only a couple million elusive and privileged people are left on the planet. Ives also explains that this system had been deliberately planned, leaving the lower class people and other planets\u2019 natives to suffer. He also is not even sure that Conrad\u2019s thinking is wrong, but he cannot bring himself to watch his way of life change. When Ives dies from his chill, Raymond makes a speech about his death not being in vain. Martin, however, disagrees. When Martin\u2019s paintings are bought later by an Italian museum, he thinks back to what Ives had said before and feels uncomfortable. As Martin lies dying, he thinks about how Ives is lucky to have been spared the same tragedy as the young people surrounding him. ",
        "Summary_3": "Ives is one of Martin's descendants who wants to protect him from the eventual arrival of Conrad to kill Martin. Ives and Martin have a very good relationship, as Ives tries to help Martin in his painting career. Ives also tells Martin of everything that has gone on in the future, and why Conrad wants to kill him. Martin would also contemplate life with Ives, and question the actions of the cousins. Ives also takes the effort to connect emotionally with Martin, which is when Ives dies it makes Martin very sad. ",
        "Summary_4": "Ives is the first so-called cousin who respects Martin and sees an individual in him. Ives seems to be smarter than the other cousins and is also more honest with him. He admits that the future is not as ideal as Raymond and Ninian claim. He says Conrad was not completely wrong about the unfairness of the future\u2019s way of life, but Ives himself still lacks the moral courage to be like him. Martin likes Ives, and even after the cousin dies, he thinks about him when he is older. ",
        "Article": "Most of the cousins gasped as the truth began to percolate through.     I knew from the very beginning, Conrad finished, that I didn'thave to do anything at all. I just had to wait and you would destroyyourselves.     I don't understand, Bartholomew protested, searching the faces of thecousins closest to him. What does he mean, we have never existed?We're here, aren't we? What\u2014     Shut up! Raymond snapped. He turned on Martin. You don't seemsurprised.     The old man grinned. I'm not. I figured it all out years ago.     At first, he had wondered what he should do. Would it be better tothrow them into a futile panic by telling them or to do nothing? Hehad decided on the latter; that was the role they had assigned him\u2014towatch and wait and keep out of things\u2014and that was the role he wouldplay.     You knew all the time and you didn't tell us! Raymond spluttered.After we'd been so good to you, making a gentleman out of you insteadof a criminal.... That's right, he snarled, a criminal! An alcoholic,a thief, a derelict! How do you like that?     Sounds like a rich, full life, Martin said wistfully.     What an exciting existence they must have done him out of! But then, hecouldn't help thinking, he\u2014he and Conrad together, of course\u2014had donethem out of      any     kind of existence. It wasn't his responsibility,though; he had done nothing but let matters take whatever course wasdestined for them. If only he could be sure that it was the bettercourse, perhaps he wouldn't feel that nagging sense of guilt insidehim. Strange\u2014where, in his hermetic life, could he possibly havedeveloped such a queer thing as a conscience?     Then we've wasted all this time, Ninian sobbed, all this energy, allthis money, for nothing!     But you were nothing to begin with, Martin told them. And then,after a pause, he added, I only wish I could be sure there had beensome purpose to this.     He didn't know whether it was approaching death that dimmed his sight,or whether the frightened crowd that pressed around him was growingshadowy.     I wish I could feel that some good had been done in letting you bewiped out of existence, he went on voicing his thoughts. But I knowthat the same thing that happened to your worlds and my world willhappen all over again. To other people, in other times, but again. It'sbound to happen. There isn't any hope for humanity.     One man couldn't really change the course of human history, he toldhimself. Two men, that was\u2014one real, one a shadow.     Conrad came close to the old man's bed. He was almost transparent.     No, he said, there is hope. They didn't know the time transmitterworks two ways. I used it for going into the past only once\u2014just thisonce. But I've gone into the future with it many times. And\u2014 hepressed Martin's hand\u2014believe me, what I did\u2014what      we     did, you andI\u2014serves a purpose. It will change things for the better. Everythingis going to be all right.   <doc-sep> Perhaps it was the traditionally bracing effect of sea air\u2014perhaps itwas the sheltered life\u2014but Martin lived to be a very old man. He was ahundred and four when his last illness came. It was a great relief whenthe family doctor, called in again from the future, said there was nohope. Martin didn't think he could have borne another year of life.     All the cousins gathered at the yacht to pay their last respects totheir progenitor. He saw Ninian again, after all these years, andRaymond\u2014all the others, dozens of them, thronging around his bed,spilling out of the cabin and into the passageways and out onto thedeck, making their usual clamor, even though their voices were hushed.     Only Ives was missing. He'd been the lucky one, Martin knew. He hadbeen spared the tragedy that was going to befall these blooming youngpeople\u2014all the same age as when Martin had last seen them and doomednever to grow any older. Underneath their masks of woe, he could seerelief at the thought that at last they were going to be rid of theirresponsibility. And underneath Martin's death mask lay an impersonalpity for those poor, stupid descendants of his who had blundered soirretrievably.       There was only one face which Martin had never seen before. It wasn'ta strange face, however, because Martin had seen one very like it inthe looking glass when he was a young man.     You must be Conrad, Martin called across the cabin in a voice thatwas still clear. I've been looking forward to meeting you for sometime.     The other cousins whirled to face the newcomer.     You're too late, Con, Raymond gloated for the whole generation. He'slived out his life.     But he hasn't lived out his life, Conrad contradicted. He's livedout the life      you     created for him. And for yourselves, too.     For the first time, Martin saw compassion in the eyes of one of hislineage and found it vaguely disturbing. It didn't seem to belong there.     Don't you realize even yet, Conrad went on, that as soon as he goes,you'll go, too\u2014present, past, future, wherever you are, you'll go upin the air like puffs of smoke?     What do you mean? Ninian quavered, her soft, pretty face alarmed.     Martin answered Conrad's rueful smile, but left the explanations up tohim. It was his show, after all.     Because you will never have existed, Conrad said. You have no rightto existence; it was you yourselves who watched him all the time,so he didn't have a chance to lead a normal life, get married,      havechildren     ....   <doc-sep> Martin had, of course, no illusions on that score; he had learned longago that nobody did anything for nothing. But saying so was unwise.     We bribed another set of plans out of another of the professor'sassistants, Raymond continued, as if Martin had answered,and\u2014ah\u2014induced a handicraft enthusiast to build the gadget for us.       Induced     , Martin knew, could have meant anything from blackmail to theuse of the iron maiden.     Then we were all ready to forestall Conrad. If one of us guarded younight and day, he would never be able to carry out his plot. So we madeour counter-plan, set the machine as far back as it would go\u2014and herewe are!     I see, Martin said.     Raymond didn't seem to think he really did. After all, he pointedout defensively, whatever our motives, it has turned into a goodthing for you. Nice home, cultured companions, all the contemporaryconveniences, plus some handy anachronisms\u2014I don't see what more youcould ask for. You're getting the best of all possible worlds. Ofcourse Ninian      was     a ninny to locate in a mercantile suburb where anylittle thing out of the way will cause talk. How thankful I am that ourera has completely disposed of the mercantiles\u2014     What did you do with them? Martin asked.     But Raymond rushed on: Soon as Ninian goes and I'm in full charge,we'll get a more isolated place and run it on a far grander scale.Ostentation\u2014that's the way to live here and now; the richer you are,the more eccentricity you can get away with. And, he added, I mightas well be as comfortable as possible while I suffer through thiswretched historical stint.     So Ninian's going, said Martin, wondering why the news made him feelcuriously desolate. Because, although he supposed he liked her in aremote kind of way, he had no fondness for her\u2014or she, he knew, forhim.     Well, five years is rather a long stretch for any girl to spend inexile, Raymond explained, even though our life spans are a bit longerthan yours. Besides, you're getting too old now to be under petticoatgovernment. He looked inquisitively at Martin. You're not going togo all weepy and make a scene when she leaves, are you?     No.... Martin said hesitantly. Oh, I suppose I will miss her. But wearen't very close, so it won't make a real difference. That was thesad part: he already knew it wouldn't make a difference.     Raymond clapped him on the shoulder. I knew you weren't a sloppysentimentalist like Conrad. Though you do have rather a look of him,you know.     Suddenly that seemed to make Conrad real. Martin felt a vague stirringof alarm. He kept his voice composed, however. How do you plan toprotect me when he comes?     Well, each one of us is armed to the teeth, of course, Raymond saidwith modest pride, displaying something that looked like a child'scombination spaceman's gun and death ray, but which, Martin had nodoubt, was a perfectly genuine\u2014and lethal\u2014weapon. And we've got arather elaborate burglar alarm system.     Martin inspected the system and made one or two changes in the wiringwhich, he felt, would increase its efficiency. But still he wasdubious. Maybe it'll work on someone coming from outside this      house     ,but do you think it will work on someone coming from outside this      time     ?     Never fear\u2014it has a temporal radius, Raymond replied. Factoryguarantee and all that.     Just to be on the safe side, Martin said, I think I'd better haveone of those guns, too.     A splendid idea! enthused Raymond. I was just about to think of thatmyself!  "

        "Query": "What is the significance of the 'cousins' in THE MAN OUTSIDE?",
        "Summary_1": "The \u2018cousins\u2019 featured in this story are all direct descendants of Martin, identified to be great-great-granddaughters and -sons. Instructed to be called Aunts and Uncles by a young Martin and then later cousins by a mature Martin, they have rallied together to travel into the past in order to protect and guard Martin from an assassination attempt by Conrad. Conrad, a fellow cousin, is thought to be an idealist by his fellow cousins and adamantly wrong in his belief that the right thing to do is to erase their lineage in order to correct injustice in their future society. Despite the heroic protection of Martin, we find out that the cousins\u2019 guardianship of Martin is selfish in nature. Aside from Ives, Martin holds largely impersonal relationships with his cousins, who appear to view Martin as a reluctant duty. Because of Conrad as a looming threat over Martin\u2019s livelihood, a rotation of cousins traveling from the future assume guardianship over Martin and dictates his life in his hobbies or the information he knows - all to protect their own livelihood. \n\nAt Martin\u2019s deathbed, we find out that the cousins have had the wrong idea this entire time. In their insistence at protecting Martin and shaping his life to what they created for him, they signed their own death warrant. In all their planning and supposed intelligence and worthiness, the cousins have failed to observe the flaw in the plan: that if Martin had no wife and no children, then their very existence would be naught. Their forced presence in Martin\u2019s life had rid Martin\u2019s potential exciting existence - and in return - Martin\u2019s lackluster existence had rid the cousins of any kind of existence. \n",
        "Summary_2": "The role of the \u2018cousins\u2019 in the story is to protect Martin from Conrad coming to kill him. When Conrad begins to idealize a better world, the \u2018cousins\u2019 realize that this will change their way of life forever. Therefore, they decide to go back in time and protect Martin, so there is no way for Conrad to kill him. They must protect Martin because the \u2018cousins\u2019 are Martin\u2019s descendants from the future. The \u2018cousins\u2019 begin looking after Martin shortly after he is born, and they make him their responsibility to ensure that Conrad fails in his goals. The \u2018cousins\u2019 also use their vast family wealth to move him to a better neighborhood and hire tutors. Later, Raymond uses this money to move them to a remote mansion, where he continues to look after Martin. They even pool their resources to have him become an artist, and Ives later buys The Interregnum to go traveling. The \u2018cousins\u2019 are determined to change Martin\u2019s fate from the future without even realizing that they end up destroying themselves because they have controlled his life for so long. ",
        "Summary_3": "The cousins have a very important role in the story, as they took it upon themselves to save Martin\u2019s life, and stop their other cousin from killing him. By doing this, they end up basically ruining Martin's life, as in their efforts to protect him they stopped him from having a normal and happy life. It can also be said that cousin Conrad was in the right, as he was willing to sacrifice his life in order to stop the disastrous actions of humans in the future. ",
        "Summary_4": "After one of the descendants - Conrad - seemingly pans to go back in time and kill his ancestor - Martin, his other relatives decide to defend him from Conrad. They create a sheltered life for him and start taking care of Martin at the very beginning of the story, changing their shifts after some years. They make Martin move to different houses and then to a yacht, where he spends the rest of his life. They choose a profession for him, explain the future to him, and remind him about Conrad. They completely changed his life, erasing the future he was supposed to have. Simultaneously, they unconsciously ruin their own existence because, as we learn at the end, their overprotection didn\u2019t enable Martin to have a real life or a family with kids. Their unkind attitude towards Martin also doesn\u2019t make him emotionally connected to them. And he doesn\u2019t tell them about the mistake they made, eventually deciding that this version of the future probably should not exist.",
        "Article": "The ceaseless voyaging began again.      The Interregnum     voyaged to everyocean and every sea. Some were blue and some green and some dun. Aftera while, Martin couldn't tell one from another. Cousin after cousincame to watch over him and eventually they were as hard for him to tellapart as the different oceans.       All the cousins were young, for, though they came at different times inhis life, they had all started out from the same time in theirs. Onlythe young ones had been included in the venture; they did not trusttheir elders.     As the years went by, Martin began to lose even his detached interestin the land and its doings. Although the yacht frequently touched portfor fuel or supplies\u2014it was more economical to purchase them in thatera than to have them shipped from the future\u2014he seldom went ashore,and then only at the urging of a newly assigned cousin anxious to seethe sights. Most of the time Martin spent in watching the sea\u2014andsometimes he painted it. There seemed to be a depth to his seascapesthat his other work lacked.     When he was pressed by the current cousin to make a land visitsomewhere, he decided to exhibit a few of his sea paintings. That way,he could fool himself into thinking that there was some purpose to thisjourney. He'd come to believe that perhaps what his life lacked waspurpose, and for a while he kept looking for meaning everywhere, to thecousin's utter disgust.     Eat, drink and be merry, or whatever you Romans say when you do as youdo, the cousin\u2014who was rather woolly in history; the descendants werescraping bottom now\u2014advised.     Martin showed his work in Italy, so that the cousin could bedisillusioned by the current crop of Romans. He found that neitherpurpose nor malice was enough; he was still immeasurably bored.However, a museum bought two of the paintings. Martin thought of Ivesand felt an uncomfortable pang of a sensation he could no longerunderstand.     Where do you suppose Conrad has been all this time? Martin idly askedthe current cousin\u2014who was passing as his nephew by now.     The young man jumped, then glanced around him uncomfortably. Conrad'sa very shrewd fellow, he whispered. He's biding his time\u2014waitinguntil we're off guard. And then\u2014pow!\u2014he'll attack!     Oh, I see, Martin said.     He had often fancied that Conrad would prove to be the most stimulatingmember of the whole generation. But it seemed unlikely that he wouldever have a chance for a conversation with the young man. More than oneconversation, anyhow.     When he does show up, I'll protect you, the cousin vowed, touchinghis ray gun. You haven't a thing to worry about.     Martin smiled with all the charm he'd had nothing to do but acquire. Ihave every confidence in you, he told his descendant. He himself hadgiven up carrying a gun long ago.     There was a war in the Northern Hemisphere and so      The Interregnum     voyaged to southern waters. There was a war in the south and they hidout in the Arctic. All the nations became too drained of power\u2014fueland man and will\u2014to fight, so there was a sterile peace for a longtime.      The Interregnum     roamed the seas restlessly, with her load ofpassengers from the future, plus one bored and aging contemporary. Shebore big guns now, because of the ever-present danger of pirates.   <doc-sep> Cousin Ives\u2014now that Martin was older, he was told to call thedescendants      cousin     \u2014next assumed guardianship. Ives took hisresponsibilities more seriously than the others did. He even arrangedto have Martin's work shown at an art gallery. The paintings receivedcritical approval, but failed to evoke any enthusiasm. The modestsale they enjoyed was mostly to interior decorators. Museums were notinterested.     Takes time, Ives tried to reassure him. One day they'll be buyingyour pictures, Martin. Wait and see.     Ives was the only one of the descendants who seemed to think of Martinas an individual. When his efforts to make contact with the other youngman failed, he got worried and decided that what Martin needed was achange of air and scenery.     'Course you can't go on the Grand Tour. Your son hasn't inventedspace travel yet. But we can go see this world. What's left of it.Tourists always like ruins best, anyway.     So he drew on the family's vast future resources and bought a yacht,which Martin christened      The Interregnum     . They traveled about from seato ocean and from ocean to sea, touching at various ports and makingtrips inland. Martin saw the civilized world\u2014mostly in fragments; thenearly intact semi-civilized world and the uncivilized world, much thesame as it had been for centuries. It was like visiting an enormousmuseum; he couldn't seem to identify with his own time any more.     The other cousins appeared to find the yacht a congenial head-quarters,largely because they could spend so much time far away from thecontemporary inhabitants of the planet and relax and be themselves. Sothey never moved back to land. Martin spent the rest of his life on      The Interregnum     . He felt curiously safer from Conrad there, althoughthere was no valid reason why an ocean should stop a traveler throughtime.     More cousins were in residence at once than ever before, becausethey came for the ocean voyage. They spent most of their time aboardship, giving each other parties and playing an      avant-garde     form ofshuffleboard and gambling on future sporting events. That last usuallyended in a brawl, because one cousin was sure to accuse another ofhaving got advance information about the results.     Martin didn't care much for their company and associated with them onlywhen not to have done so would have been palpably rude. And, thoughthey were gregarious young people for the most part, they didn't courthis society. He suspected that he made them feel uncomfortable.   <doc-sep>    THE MAN OUTSIDE     By EVELYN E. SMITH     Illustrated by DILLON     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Galaxy Science Fiction August 1957.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]        No one, least of all Martin, could dispute       that a man's life should be guarded by his       kin\u2014but by those who hadn't been born yet?        Nobody in the neighborhood was surprised when Martin's motherdisappeared and Ninian came to take care of him. Mothers had a wayof disappearing around those parts and the kids were often betteroff without them. Martin was no exception. He'd never had it thisgood while he was living with his old lady. As for his father, Martinhad never had one. He'd been a war baby, born of one of the tides ofsoldiers\u2014enemies and allies, both\u2014that had engulfed the country insuccessive waves and bought or taken the women. So there was no troublethat way.     Sometimes he wondered who Ninian really was. Obviously that storyabout her coming from the future was just a gag. Besides, if she reallywas his great-great-grand-daughter, as she said, why would she tellhim to call her       Aunt Ninian     ? Maybe he was only eleven, but he'dbeen around and he knew just what the score was. At first he'd thoughtmaybe she was some new kind of social worker, but she acted a littletoo crazy for that.     He loved to bait her, as he had loved to bait his mother. It was saferwith Ninian, though, because when he pushed her too far, she would cryinstead of mopping up the floor with him.     But I can't understand, he would say, keeping his face straight. Whydo you have to come from the future to protect me against your cousinConrad?     Because he's coming to kill you.     Why should he kill me? I ain't done him nothing.     Ninian sighed. He's dissatisfied with the current social order andkilling you is part of an elaborate plan he's formulated to change it.You wouldn't understand.     You're damn right. I      don't     understand. What's it all about instraight gas?     Oh, just don't ask any questions, Ninian said petulantly. When youget older, someone will explain the whole thing to you.  "

        "Query": "How does time play a role in THE MAN OUTSIDE?",
        "Summary_1": "First, time is significant in this story as the main plotline to the cousins' interactions with Martin. With the future having time travel as a reality, characters in this story like Ninian are able to jump back and forth between the past - to bring Martin out of poverty and vulgar background - and the future to her present time. Although the characters in this story utilize time as an unchangeable and linear concept, we find out through hints in the story and at the final moment that time here is fluid and flexible. Anything that occurs in the past will affect the reality of the future. This is a startling pocket of truth that the cousins fail to realize until Martin\u2019s deathbed - where they are horrified to find out that their selfish desire to protect their comfortable reality in the future had actually led to their own demise and ridded their entire existence. \n\nAdditionally, time is used to explore the ruling ideologies of the social class both in present and in future. Despite the cousins proclaiming the future world to be free of poverty and highly privileged, Ives reveals that the realities of both worlds are similar in having wars and want and suffering. Only, with the latter future world dealing with these unsavory characters in exiling them and maintaining a feudal class system. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Time is very significant in this story because it relates to all characters. Conrad uses the time transmitter from Professor Farka to travel to the future to observe different possibilities. He also travels back one last time to see the dying Martin and tell him what they are doing for the universe\u2019s interest. Martin\u2019s descendants travel back in time to protect him from Conrad, but they control most of his life to the point where he has no free will. Martin, however, sees his time as abundant because he spends most of his time with his relatives anyways. They are the only people he ever interacts with, and he finds himself living a purposeless life with all of the free time that he has. However, time is also significant in that it is what eventually erases all of his descendants from the past, present, and future. ",
        "Summary_3": "Time plays a significant role in this story. Time is what allowed Martin's descendant to invent space travel, and is what eventually led to Conrad trying to kill him. Also, the cousins used time travel in order to go back to Martin\u2019s time and to try and protect him from Conrad\u2019s actions. Another important thing about time is that the cousins never aged as they protected Martin, leading to them stuck forever protecting Martin, until Martin dies, after which they never existed. ",
        "Summary_4": "Time in this story becomes a very flexible notion, allowing Martin\u2019s descendants to use time travel to find him in the past and protect Martin from Conrad, who wants to kill him, thus erasing the timeline in which humans use exploitation of other people and life forms. Thanks to time travel, Martin can meet his descendants and learn what the future looks like for humans. Their arrival changes his life, and initially, he becomes anxious and curious but eventually loses interest in everything around him because his sheltered existence deprives him of any real feelings, except for fear of Conrad. Their plan leads to the elimination of the future they came from, showing how changing the past events affects the future. ",
        "Article": "Most of the cousins gasped as the truth began to percolate through.     I knew from the very beginning, Conrad finished, that I didn'thave to do anything at all. I just had to wait and you would destroyyourselves.     I don't understand, Bartholomew protested, searching the faces of thecousins closest to him. What does he mean, we have never existed?We're here, aren't we? What\u2014     Shut up! Raymond snapped. He turned on Martin. You don't seemsurprised.     The old man grinned. I'm not. I figured it all out years ago.     At first, he had wondered what he should do. Would it be better tothrow them into a futile panic by telling them or to do nothing? Hehad decided on the latter; that was the role they had assigned him\u2014towatch and wait and keep out of things\u2014and that was the role he wouldplay.     You knew all the time and you didn't tell us! Raymond spluttered.After we'd been so good to you, making a gentleman out of you insteadof a criminal.... That's right, he snarled, a criminal! An alcoholic,a thief, a derelict! How do you like that?     Sounds like a rich, full life, Martin said wistfully.     What an exciting existence they must have done him out of! But then, hecouldn't help thinking, he\u2014he and Conrad together, of course\u2014had donethem out of      any     kind of existence. It wasn't his responsibility,though; he had done nothing but let matters take whatever course wasdestined for them. If only he could be sure that it was the bettercourse, perhaps he wouldn't feel that nagging sense of guilt insidehim. Strange\u2014where, in his hermetic life, could he possibly havedeveloped such a queer thing as a conscience?     Then we've wasted all this time, Ninian sobbed, all this energy, allthis money, for nothing!     But you were nothing to begin with, Martin told them. And then,after a pause, he added, I only wish I could be sure there had beensome purpose to this.     He didn't know whether it was approaching death that dimmed his sight,or whether the frightened crowd that pressed around him was growingshadowy.     I wish I could feel that some good had been done in letting you bewiped out of existence, he went on voicing his thoughts. But I knowthat the same thing that happened to your worlds and my world willhappen all over again. To other people, in other times, but again. It'sbound to happen. There isn't any hope for humanity.     One man couldn't really change the course of human history, he toldhimself. Two men, that was\u2014one real, one a shadow.     Conrad came close to the old man's bed. He was almost transparent.     No, he said, there is hope. They didn't know the time transmitterworks two ways. I used it for going into the past only once\u2014just thisonce. But I've gone into the future with it many times. And\u2014 hepressed Martin's hand\u2014believe me, what I did\u2014what      we     did, you andI\u2014serves a purpose. It will change things for the better. Everythingis going to be all right.   <doc-sep> She had finished. And now Cyril cleared his throat. Dear friends, wewere honored by your gracious invitation to visit this fair planet, andwe are honored now by the cordial reception you have given to us.     The crowd yoomped politely. After a slight start, Cyril went on,apparently deciding that applause was all that had been intended.     We feel quite sure that we are going to derive both pleasure andprofit from our stay here, and we promise to make our intensiveanalysis of your culture as painless as possible. We wish only to studyyour society, not to tamper with it in any way.       Ha, ha     , Skkiru said to himself.      Ha, ha, ha!       But why is it, Raoul whispered in Terran as he glanced around out ofthe corners of his eyes, that only the beggar wears mudshoes?     Shhh, Cyril hissed back. We'll find out later, when we'veestablished rapport. Don't be so impatient!     Bbulas gave a sickly smile. Skkiru could almost find it in his heartsto feel sorry for the man.     We have prepared our best hut for you, noble sirs, Bbulas said withgreat self-control, and, by happy chance, this very evening a smallbut unusually interesting ceremony will be held outside the temple. Wehope you will be able to attend. It is to be a rain dance.     Rain dance! Raoul pulled his macintosh together more tightly at thethroat. But why do you want rain? My faith, not only does it rain now,but the planet seems to be a veritable sea of mud. Not, of course, headded hurriedly as Cyril's reproachful eye caught his, that it is notattractive mud. Finest mud I have ever seen. Such texture, such color,such aroma!     Cyril nodded three times and gave an appreciative sniff.     But, Raoul went on, one can have too much of even such a good thingas mud....     The smile did not leave Bbulas' smooth face. Yes, of course, honorableTerrestrials. That is why we are holding this ceremony. It is not adance to bring on rain. It is a dance to      stop     rain.     He was pretty quick on the uptake, Skkiru had to concede. However,that was not enough. The man had no genuine organizational ability.In the time he'd had in which to plan and carry out a scheme forthe improvement of Snaddra, surely he could have done better thanthis high-school theocracy. For one thing, he could have apportionedthe various roles so that each person would be making a definitecontribution to the society, instead of creating some positions plums,like the priesthood, and others prunes, like the beggarship.     What kind of life was that for an active, ambitious young man, standingaround begging? And, moreover, from whom was Skkiru going to beg?Only the Earthmen, for the Snaddrath, no matter how much they threwthemselves into the spirit of their roles, could not be so carriedaway that they would give handouts to a young man whom they had beenaccustomed to see basking in the bosom of luxury.   <doc-sep> Commander Eagan said, You'd better find some new way of amusingyourself, Jones. Have you read General Order 17?     Isobar said, I seen it. But if you think\u2014     It says, stated Eagan deliberately, '      In order that work or restperiods of the Dome's staff may not be disturbed, it is hereby orderedthat the playing or practicing of all or any musical instruments mustbe discontinued immediately. By order of the Dome Commander     ,' Thatmeans you, Jones!     But, dingbust it! keened Isobar, it don't disturb nobody for me toplay my bagpipes! I know these lunks around here don't appreciate goodmusic, so I always go in my office and lock the door after me\u2014     But the Dome, pointed out Commander Eagan, has an air-conditioningsystem which can't be shut off. The ungodly moans ofyour\u2014er\u2014so-called musical instrument can be heard through the entirestructure.     He suddenly seemed to gain stature.     No, Jones, this order is final! You cannot disrupt our entireorganization for your own\u2014er\u2014amusement.     But\u2014 said Isobar.     No!     Isobar wriggled desperately. Life on Luna was sorry enough already.If now they took from him the last remaining solace he had, the lastamusement which lightened his moments of freedom\u2014     Look, Commander! he pleaded, I tell you what I'll do. I won't bothernobody. I'll go Outside and play it\u2014     Outside! Eagan stared at him incredulously. Are you mad? How aboutthe Grannies?     Isobar knew all about the Grannies. The only mobile form of lifefound by space-questing man on Earth's satellite, their name was anabbreviation of the descriptive one applied to them by the first Lunarexployers: Granitebacks. This was no exaggeration; if anything, it wasan understatement. For the Grannies, though possessed of certain lowintelligence, had quickly proven themselves a deadly, unyielding andimplacable foe.     Worse yet, they were an enemy almost indestructible! No man had everyet brought to Earth laboratories the carcass of a Grannie; sciencewas completely baffled in its endeavors to explain the composition ofGraniteback physiology\u2014but it was known, from bitter experience, thatthe carapace or exoskeleton of the Grannies was formed of somethingharder than steel, diamond, or battleplate! This flesh could bepenetrated by no weapon known to man; neither by steel nor flame,by electronic nor ionic wave, nor by the lethal, newly discoveredatomo-needle dispenser.     All this Isobar knew about the Grannies. Yet:     They ain't been any Grannies seen around the Dome, he said, fora 'coon's age. Anyhow, if I seen any comin', I could run right backinside\u2014     No! said Commander Eagan flatly. Absolutely,      no     ! I have no timefor such nonsense. You know the orders\u2014obey them! And now, gentlemen,good afternoon!     He left. Sparks turned to Isobar, grinning.     Well, he said, one man's fish\u2014hey, Jonesy? Too bad you can't playyour doodlesack any more, but frankly, I'm just as glad. Of all theawful screeching wails\u2014     But Isobar Jones, generally mild and gentle, was now in a perfectfury. His pale eyes blazed, he stomped his foot on the floor, and fromhis lips poured a stream of such angry invective that Riley lookedstartled. Words that, to Isobar, were the utter dregs of violentprofanity.     Oh, dagnab it! fumed Isobar Jones. Oh, tarnation and dingbust!Oh\u2014      fiddlesticks     !      II     And so, chuckled Riley, he left, bubbling like a kettle on a red-hotoven. But, boy! was he ever mad! Just about ready to bust, he was.     Some minutes had passed since Isobar had left; Riley was talking to Dr.Loesch, head of the Dome's Physics Research Division. The older mannodded commiseratingly.     It is funny, yes, he agreed, but at the same time it is notaltogether amusing. I feel sorry for him. He is a very unhappy man, ourpoor Isobar.     Yeah, I know, said Riley, but, hell, we all get a little bithomesick now and then. He ought to learn to\u2014     Excuse me, my boy, interrupted the aged physicist, his voice gentle,it is not mere homesickness that troubles our friend. It is somethingdeeper, much more vital and serious. It is what my people call:      weltschmertz     . There is no accurate translation in English. It means'world sickness,' or better, 'world weariness'\u2014something like that butintensified a thousandfold.     It is a deeply-rooted mental condition, sometimes a dangerous frameof mind. Under its grip, men do wild things. Hating the world on whichthey find themselves, they rebel in curious ways. Suicide ... mad actsof valor ... deeds of cunning or knavery....     You mean, demanded Sparks anxiously, Isobar ain't got all hisbuttons?     Not that exactly. He is perfectly sane. But he is in a dark morassof despair. He may try      anything     to retrieve his lost happiness, ridhis soul of its dark oppression. His world-sickness is like a cryinghunger\u2014By the way, where is he now?     Below, I guess. In his quarters.     Ah, good! Perhaps he is sleeping. Let us hope so. In slumber he willfind peace and forgetfulness.     But Dr. Loesch would have been far less sanguine had some power thegiftie gi'en him of watching Isobar Jones at that moment.     Isobar was not asleep. Far from it. Wide awake and very much astir, hewas acting in a singularly sinister role: that of a slinking, furtiveculprit.     Returning to his private cubicle after his conversation with DomeCommander Eagan, he had stalked straightway to the cabinet wherein wasencased his precious set of bagpipes. These he had taken from theirpegs, gazed upon defiantly, and fondled with almost parental affection.     So I can't play you, huh? he muttered darkly. It disturbs the peaceo' the dingfounded, dumblasted Dome staff, does it? Well, we'll      see     about that!     And tucking the bag under his arm, he had cautiously slipped from theroom, down little-used corridors, and now he stood before the huge      impervite     gates which were the entrance to the Dome and the doorwayto Outside.     On all save those occasions when a spacecraft landed in the cradleadjacent the gateway, these portals were doubly locked and barred. Buttoday they had been unbolted that the two maintenance men might ventureout. And since it was quite possible that Brown and Roberts might haveto get inside in a hurry, their bolts remained drawn. Sole guardian ofthe entrance was a very bored Junior Patrolman.     Up to this worthy strode Isobar Jones, confident and assured, exudingan aura of propriety.     Very well, Wilkins, he said. I'll take over now. You may go to themeeting.     Wilkins looked at him bewilderedly.     Huh? Whuzzat, Mr. Jones?     Isobar's eyebrows arched.     You mean you haven't been notified?     Notified of      what     ?     Why, the general council of all Patrolmen! Weren't you told that Iwould take your place here while you reported to G.H.Q.?     I ain't, puzzled Wilkins, heard nothing about it. Maybe I ought tocall the office, maybe?     And he moved the wall-audio. But Isobar said swiftly. That\u2014er\u2014won'tbe necessary, Wilkins. My orders were plain enough. Now, you just runalong. I'll watch this entrance for you.     We-e-ell, said Wilkins, if you say so. Orders is orders. But keep asharp eye out, Mister Jones, in case Roberts and Brown should come backsudden-like.     I will, promised Isobar, don't worry.  "

        "Query": "Do Martin's feelings towards his cousins evolve over the course of the narrative, and if so, what prompts this change?",
        "Summary_1": "When Ninian initially arrives, Martin blatantly considers her to be dumb. Dumb to hire a cleaning maid, dumb to freak out over Martin\u2019s absence at school, and dumb to hire a private tutor. Even with them moving to a different and more privileged neighborhood, he considers her dumb to go through all this effort to still remain conspicuous. \n\nAs the reasons behind the cousins\u2019 presence in the past and guardianship over Martin is revealed, his sentiment towards them remains the same. It seems that Martin is able to catch onto the obvious flaw in the cousins\u2019 plans quite early on, and yet with so many cousins slipping in and out, and despite their proclaimed intelligence, none of them are able to pick up on this flaw. The flaw being: with Martin having no children, their very existence becomes an impossibility. This is revealed at the end of the story where Martin is on his deathbed, noting that he had come to this conclusion many years before and had chosen not to say anything. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Martin's attitude towards the cousins does not ever really change throughout the story. Initially, he thinks that Ninian is foolish and fun to bait because she wounds up crying. Although Ninian does her best to care for him, he knows that all of his relatives are only doing it out of their interest. They see him as a rather unpleasant duty, while he does not try to get to know them either. When Raymond talks to him, he looks down on Martin and tries to be superior. Even when they move on to the yacht later, Martin only associates with them to not seem rude. The only cousin he becomes fond of is Ives because Ives is the only one who sees Martin as an individual. Martin becomes used to having them around, but it becomes difficult to tell them apart because there are many. Most of them are only interested in fulfilling their responsibility, so he does not get to know them apart from Ives. Even when the cousins realize from Conrad what they have done by controlling Martin, he is not surprised by how inept his descendants are. He does not seem too regretful about what his descendants have done until the end. ",
        "Summary_3": "At the beginning Martin believed the actions of his cousins, and everything they told him. While he got older and older, he started to see the flaws in the plans of his cousins. He understood that if they continued in that cycle then he would never live his life and have children. Even though he knew the flaws, he always followed what the cousins said, and never pointed out the flaws to them. He decided to follow the role that the cousins wanted him to follow. ",
        "Summary_4": "At the beginning of the story, Martin is curious about Ninian. But as other cousins arrive, he becomes less and less interested in them. They do not seem incredibly bright or eager to get to know him. They show that they are carrying out duty and never bother to be more considerate or show excitement. The only cousin that Martin likes is Ives because he tries to see Martin as an individual and is brighter than his other relatives. Martin\u2019s cousins cut him off from the life he got used to and never allow him to make his own decisions. He is trapped in their plan to save their lives, and they don't try to be respectful or care about his desires. Even when he is dying, their faces show a sign of relief.

I don't understand, Bartholomew protested, searching the faces of thecousins closest to him. What does he mean, we have never existed?We're here, aren't we? What\u2014     Shut up! Raymond snapped. He turned on Martin. You don't seemsurprised.     The old man grinned. I'm not. I figured it all out years ago.     At first, he had wondered what he should do. Would it be better tothrow them into a futile panic by telling them or to do nothing? Hehad decided on the latter; that was the role they had assigned him\u2014towatch and wait and keep out of things\u2014and that was the role he wouldplay.     You knew all the time and you didn't tell us! Raymond spluttered.After we'd been so good to you, making a gentleman out of you insteadof a criminal.... That's right, he snarled, a criminal! An alcoholic,a thief, a derelict! How do you like that?     Sounds like a rich, full life, Martin said wistfully.     What an exciting existence they must have done him out of! But then, hecouldn't help thinking, he\u2014he and Conrad together, of course\u2014had donethem out of      any     kind of existence. It wasn't his responsibility,though; he had done nothing but let matters take whatever course wasdestined for them. If only he could be sure that it was the bettercourse, perhaps he wouldn't feel that nagging sense of guilt insidehim. Strange\u2014where, in his hermetic life, could he possibly havedeveloped such a queer thing as a conscience?     Then we've wasted all this time, Ninian sobbed, all this energy, allthis money, for nothing!     But you were nothing to begin with, Martin told them. And then,after a pause, he added, I only wish I could be sure there had beensome purpose to this.     He didn't know whether it was approaching death that dimmed his sight,or whether the frightened crowd that pressed around him was growingshadowy.     I wish I could feel that some good had been done in letting you bewiped out of existence, he went on voicing his thoughts. But I knowthat the same thing that happened to your worlds and my world willhappen all over again. To other people, in other times, but again. It'sbound to happen. There isn't any hope for humanity.     One man couldn't really change the course of human history, he toldhimself. Two men, that was\u2014one real, one a shadow.     Conrad came close to the old man's bed. He was almost transparent.     No, he said, there is hope. They didn't know the time transmitterworks two ways. I used it for going into the past only once\u2014just thisonce. But I've gone into the future with it many times. And\u2014 hepressed Martin's hand\u2014believe me, what I did\u2014what      we     did, you andI\u2014serves a purpose. It will change things for the better. Everythingis going to be all right.   <doc-sep> When it came time for the parting, it was Ninian who cried\u2014tears ather own inadequacy, Martin knew, not of sorrow. He was getting skillfulat understanding his descendants, far better than they at understandinghim. But then they never really tried. Ninian kissed him wetly on thecheek and said she was sure everything would work out all right andthat she'd come see him again. She never did, though, except at thevery last.     Raymond and Martin moved into a luxurious mansion in a remote area. Thesite proved a well-chosen one; when the Second Atomic War came, half adozen years later, they weren't touched. Martin was never sure whetherthis had been sheer luck or expert planning. Probably luck, because hisdescendants were exceedingly inept planners.     Few people in the world then could afford to live as stylishly asMartin and his guardian. The place not only contained every possibleconvenience and gadget but was crammed with bibelots and antiques,carefully chosen by Raymond and disputed by Martin, for, to the manfrom the future, all available artifacts were antiques. Otherwise,Martin accepted his new surroundings. His sense of wonder had becomedulled by now and the pink pseudo-Spanish castle\u2014architecturallydreadful, of course, Raymond had said, but so hilariouslytypical\u2014impressed him far less than had the suburban split-levelaquarium.     How about a moat? Martin suggested when they first came. It seems togo with a castle.       Do you think a moat could stop Conrad? Raymond asked, amused.     No, Martin smiled, feeling rather silly, but it would make the placeseem safer somehow.     The threat of Conrad was beginning to make him grow more and morenervous. He got Raymond's permission to take two suits of armor thatstood in the front hall and present them to a local museum, becauseseveral times he fancied he saw them move. He also became an adept withthe ray gun and changed the surrounding landscape quite a bit with it,until Raymond warned that this might lead Conrad to them.     During those early years, Martin's tutors were exchanged for thehigher-degreed ones that were now needful. The question inevitablyarose of what the youth's vocation in that life was going to be. Atleast twenty of the cousins came back through time to hold one oftheir vigorous family councils. Martin was still young enough to enjoysuch occasions, finding them vastly superior to all other forms ofentertainment.  "

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in Spawning Ground?",
        "Summary_1": "The Starship Pandora lands on a planet where an exploring ship and a rescue group disappear. Captain Gwayne was ordered to come and inspect the lost ships for a week. They prolong their stay because of a discovery of the carefully buried ship whose parts were exposed by a landslide and detected by a metal locator a few days ago. When two cadets, Kaufman and Pinelli, and one member, Doctor Barker, approach to examine the buried ship, a horde of mysterious creatures come to them. The leader of mysterious creatures, tall and man-like, kidnaps the two cadets with his members and runs away. Captain Gwayne and other crew members ride on jeeps and chase after the monsters. When they catch up to the mysterious leader, the cadets are sitting on each shoulder of the leader without harm. Captain Gwayne and Doctor Barker collaborate to defeat the leader and bring it back to the ship.\n\nAfter bringing back the captive, Captain Gwayne has learned from the creature that he is Hennessy, the missing captain of the buried ship. He reveals that the blobs, a peculiarity on the planet, can change the cells in living creatures to help them adapt to the planet, which has done to Captain Hennessy and his crew members. All the mysterious creatures surrounding the ship are either the original crew members or their descendants. They decided to bury the ship after noticing the changes. After he finished the story, Captain Hennessy went to gather with his people. And now, Captain Gwayne faces the same situation as Captain Hennessy did in the past: either die when they go back to the Earth or stay on the planet to become a different creature, which at least makes humankind survive differently. Captain Gwayne decides to stay, so he discharges all the fuel out to not let the ship live again. He then tells Jane Corey, the Lieutenant, the truth and his decision. They both know that they have to stay for the better strength of the species after generations because humankind needs to have at least one hope to spread their seeds, even in a different shape. They will obliterate all their traces so that the Earth will send no more humans to the planet.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Captain Gwayne is a weary fourty-year old man who captains the starship Pandora, as one of the many colonies traveling around space to find a new planet that can sustain human life like Earth. Accompanied by Lieutenant Jane Corey, he is informed that two of the space cadets snuck outside the ship. Among the outside landscape includes blobs, who are described to be a peculiarity of this particular planet; seemingly harmless but are ugly in looks.\n\nGwayne wishes to study them more thoroughly, but is reminded of his mission in deviating to this planet to search for Captain Hennessey and his men, who had abandoned their ship. As the cadets are heading back to Gwayne\u2019s ship, a herd of blobs disperses in excitement and instead they begin to hover over a singular spot. The cadets turn to find a horde of things heading towards them, described to be vaguely man-like with a distinct leader at eight feet tall, and all of them holding objects like spears or sticks. In a race to reach the cadets before the things did, Gwayne, Jane and other officers raced in Jeeps towards the boys. Noticing the incoming Jeeps, the creatures grabbed the boys and disappeared into the mists, with the officers following fast in pursuit. Plowing through them, Gwayne touches a blob whose shape passes around it. As they confront the eight foot leader, it suddenly drops the boys and Gwayne and Doc Barker knock it out of consciousness. \n\nWith the boys safe, they take the unconscious creature back to the ship to try and see if the creature had anything to do with Hennessey\u2019s disappearance and buried ship. Any information revealed would be pivotal in determining this planet\u2019s habitability, as it is revealed that Earth was threatened with the Sun going nova and hence the human race found themselves in a scramble to find a replacement home. Gwayne and Jane then visit Barker and the now-awake creature, who immediately greets Gwayne in some garbled English. They find out that the leader of the creature is actually Captain Hennessy who had grabbed the kids with the intention of talking to them. It turns out that Hennessey and his crew have physically changed due to the planet, turning them into man-like creatures with an adapted English language. \n\nMore so, it is revealed that blobs enjoy having the humans around, and are subtly changing and adapting the human cells. It is what happened to Hennessy and is already happening to Gwayne because he\u2019s been touched. However, the rest of his crew could go back but are unable to because Gwayne has dumped the fuel. In the end, we find out that Gwayne and Jane consider the answer to finding a new planet to be void, as they only thing they could do is find a new spawning ground, which they would be able to achieve if both crews spawn a new race on this planet and eventually, explore the star lanes once again. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The story is about a ship captain, Gwayne, and his team arriving on a new planet. It is revealed that they were on that planet because two different expeditions had gone there before and neither had returned, so Gwayne and his team were there to see what had happened. It is also revealed that Earth\u2019s sun was going nova, which is why humans were exploring and looking to colonize other planets. The planet is inhabited by blobs, spirit-like alien creatures, who seem harmless. Gwayne sends 2 kids to check the planet, and when they return the ship and the crew are ambushed by a horde of alien-like creatures. When the leader captures the two cadets, Gwayne rushes out and, with the help of another crew member, rescues the kids and captures the leader. When the crew\u2019s doctor checks the leader, they find out that the creature is actually the captain of the previous mission, and Gwayne\u2019s friend. Gwayne realizes that this was the blobs\u2019 doing, and that they can change and adapt the body of human beings. After this is revealed, the crew decides that they should all stay on the planet, and bury the ship. This would allow the humans to create a new colony there with the blobs, and allow them to help each other, as the blobs could in a far future help the changed humans adapt to different planets. ",
        "Summary_4": "The starship Pandora creaks and groans as she settles on an ugly world. The starship is two hundred light-years away from Earth. Captain Gwayne curses and reaches for his boots; he shuffles to the control room where Lieutenant Jane Corey is waiting. Jane reports that a dozen mysterious blobs held a convention north, but they had broken off about an hour ago. She also informs him that the two cadets have snuck out again, to which Gwayne swears because Kaufman and Pinelli have no sense of caution. The Sol-type Sun begins to rise, but there is so much fog everywhere that it is impossible to see. He observes three blobs but knows that there is no time because Earth sent him here to check for any signs of Hennessy\u2019s ship. Suddenly, Jane calls him to say that the two cadets are back. Strange creatures appear, and Gwayne yells at Jane to get the jeeps out. Once they drive, the menacing horde notices the jeeps and begins to run away with the cadets faster. Although the creatures try to stop their pursuers, the jeep goes through and catches a glimpse. Once the creature with the two cadets is in front of him, Gwayne dives to get the cadets back. Doc Barker hits the creature seconds after, and this causes the creature to collapse. The men examine the cadets, while Doc and Gwayne wonder if the creature could be the key to the missing ship. They discuss how the native creatures could have gone undetected, while Gwayne explains that it is time for him to go and get the ship back to Earth. The report from the cadets is enough, but there are still a lot of questions regarding the creatures and the missing crew. However, there needs to be an answer fast because Earth is close to extinction from the Sun. Since nobody would be able to live in the Solar System when that happens, the explorers must go out and find another world. Everybody does their part because the Sun will explode in ten years, while some of the strange planets would give man the opportunity to repopulate. Gwayne receives a call from Doc Barker and goes to see the creature. The creature is Captain Hennessy, and he has forgotten how to speak English because they had to change the language to make the sounds fit. When Gwayne questions the creature, it answers correctly; they listen to Hennessy\u2019s story. Gwayne leads former Hennessy out and goes back to the control room to discharge the ship\u2019s fuel tanks. It is revealed that the blobs can adapt to cells and have no choice but to stay because they are already changed. Jane figures that they have really not been changed yet, but she concludes spawning ground. The fifty men and women can replenish the Earth here, and Gwayne knows that their children would one day find a way to the star lanes again to spread the children of men further. ",
        "Article": "Back in the control room, Gwayne found the emergency release levers,set the combinations and pressed the studs. There was a hiss and gurgleas the great tanks of fuel discharged their contents out onto theground where no ingenuity could ever recover it to bring life to theship again.     He'd have to tell the men and women of the crew later, after he'd hadtime to organize things and present it all in a way they could accept,however much they might hate it at first. But there was no putting offgiving the gist of it to Jane.     It was the blobs, he summarized it. They seem to be amused by men.They don't require anything from us, but they like us around. Hennessydoesn't know why. They can change our cells, adapt us. Before men came,all life here had twelve legs. Now they're changing that, as we've seen.     And they don't have to be close to do it. We've all been outside thehull. It doesn't show yet\u2014but we're changed. In another month, Earthfood would kill us. We've got to stay here. We'll bury the ships deeperthis time, and Earth won't find us. They can't risk trying a colonywhere three ships vanish, so we'll just disappear. And they'll neverknow.     Nobody would know. Their children\u2014odd children who matured in eightyears\u2014would be primitive savages in three generations. The Earthtools would be useless, impossible for the hands so radically changed.Nothing from the ship would last. Books could never be read by the neweyes. And in time, Earth wouldn't even be a memory to this world.     She was silent a long time, staring out of the port toward what mustnow be her home. Then she sighed. You'll need practice, but the othersdon't know you as well as I do, Bob. I guess we can fix it so they'llbelieve it all. And it's too late now. But we haven't really beenchanged yet, have we?     No, he admitted. Damn his voice! He'd never been good at lying. No.They have to touch us. I've been touched, but the rest could go back.     She nodded. He waited for the condemnation, but there was onlypuzzlement in her face. Why?     And then, before he could answer, her own intelligence gave her thesame answer he had found for himself. The spawning ground!     It was the only thing they could do. Earth needed a place to plant herseed, but no world other than Earth could ever be trusted to preservethat seed for generation after generation. Some worlds already werebecoming uncertain.     Here, though, the blobs had adapted men to the alien world instead ofmen having to adapt the whole planet to their needs. Here, the strangechildren of man's race could grow, develop and begin the long trek backto civilization. The gadgets would be lost for a time. But perhapssome of the attitudes of civilized man would remain to make the nextrise to culture a better one.     We're needed here, he told her, his voice pleading for theunderstanding he couldn't yet fully give himself. These people needas rich a set of bloodlines as possible to give the new race strength.The fifty men and women on this ship will be needed to start them witha decent chance. We can't go to Earth, where nobody would believe oraccept the idea\u2014or even let us come back. We have to stay here.     She smiled then and moved toward him, groping for his strength. Befruitful, she whispered. Be fruitful and spawn and replenish anearth.     No, he told her. Replenish the stars.     But she was no longer listening, and that part of his idea could wait.     Some day, though, their children would find a way to the starlanesagain, looking for other worlds. With the blobs to help them, theycould adapt to most worlds. The unchanged spirit would lead themthrough all space, and the changing bodies would claim worlds beyondnumbering.     Some day, the whole universe would be a spawning ground for thechildren of men!   <doc-sep> What is it you wish? he barked. I understood in my discussions withthe other ... ah ... civilian there'd be no further need for theseirritating conferences.     I've just learned you're placing more students abroad, Mr. Gulver. Howmany this time?     Two thousand.     And where will they be going?     Croanie. It's all in the application form I've handed in. Your job isto provide transportation.     Will there be any other students embarking this season?     Why ... perhaps. That's Boge's business. Gulver looked at Retief withpursed lips. As a matter of fact, we had in mind dispatching anothertwo thousand to Featherweight.     Another under-populated world\u2014and in the same cluster, I believe,Retief said. Your people must be unusually interested in that regionof space.     If that's all you wanted to know, I'll be on my way. I have matters ofimportance to see to.     After Gulver left, Retief called Miss Furkle in. I'd like to have abreak-out of all the student movements that have been planned under thepresent program, he said. And see if you can get a summary of whatMEDDLE has been shipping lately.     Miss Furkle compressed her lips. If Mr. Magnan were here, I'm surehe wouldn't dream of interfering in the work of other departments.I ... overheard your conversation with the gentleman from the CroanieLegation\u2014     The lists, Miss Furkle.     I'm not accustomed, Miss Furkle said, to intruding in mattersoutside our interest cluster.     That's worse than listening in on phone conversations, eh? But nevermind. I need the information, Miss Furkle.     Loyalty to my Chief\u2014     Loyalty to your pay-check should send you scuttling for the materialI've asked for, Retief said. I'm taking full responsibility. Nowscat.     The buzzer sounded. Retief flipped a key. MUDDLE, Retief speaking....     Arapoulous's brown face appeared on the desk screen.     How-do, Retief. Okay if I come up?     Sure, Hank. I want to talk to you.     In the office, Arapoulous took a chair. Sorry if I'm rushing you,Retief, he said. But have you got anything for me?     Retief waved at the wine bottles. What do you know about Croanie?     Croanie? Not much of a place. Mostly ocean. All right if you likefish, I guess. We import our seafood from there. Nice prawns in monsoontime. Over a foot long.     You on good terms with them?     Sure, I guess so. Course, they're pretty thick with Boge.     So?     Didn't I tell you? Boge was the bunch that tried to take us over herea dozen years back. They'd've made it too, if they hadn't had a lot ofbad luck. Their armor went in the drink, and without armor they're easygame.     Miss Furkle buzzed. I have your lists, she said shortly.     Bring them in, please.   <doc-sep>    Spawning Ground     By LESTER DEL REY     They weren't human.

[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Worlds of If Science Fiction, September 1961.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      The Starship      Pandora     creaked and groaned as her landing pads settledunevenly in the mucky surface of the ugly world outside. She seemed tobe restless to end her fool's errand here, two hundred light years fromthe waiting hordes on Earth. Straining metal plates twanged and echoedthrough her hallways.     Captain Gwayne cursed and rolled over, reaching for his boots. He wasa big, rawboned man, barely forty; but ten years of responsibilityhad pressed down his shoulders and put age-feigning hollows under hisreddened eyes. The starlanes between Earth and her potential colonieswere rough on the men who traveled them now. He shuffled toward thecontrol room, grumbling at the heavy gravity.     Lieutenant Jane Corey looked up, nodding a blonde head at him as hemoved toward the ever-waiting pot of murky coffee. Morning, Bob. Youneed a shave.     Yeah. He swallowed the hot coffee without tasting it, then ran ahand across the dark stubble on his chin. It could wait. Anything newduring the night?     About a dozen blobs held something like a convention a little waysnorth of us. They broke up about an hour ago and streaked off into theclouds. The blobs were a peculiarity of this planet about which nobodyknew anything. They looked like overgrown fireballs, but seemed to havean almost sentient curiosity about anything moving on the ground. Andour two cadets sneaked out again. Barker followed them, but lost themin the murk. I've kept a signal going to guide them back.     Gwayne swore softly to himself. Earth couldn't turn out enough starmenin the schools, so promising kids were being shipped out for trainingas cadets on their twelfth birthday. The two he'd drawn, Kaufman andPinelli, seemed to be totally devoid of any sense of caution.     Of course there was no obvious need for caution here. The blobs hadn'tseemed dangerous, and the local animals were apparently all herbivorousand harmless. They were ugly enough, looking like insects in spite oftheir internal skeletons, with anywhere from four to twelve legs eachon their segmented bodies. None acted like dangerous beasts.     But      something     had happened to the exploration party fifteen yearsback, and to the more recent ship under Hennessy that was sent to checkup.  "

Earth couldn't turn out enough starmenin the schools, so promising kids were being shipped out for trainingas cadets on their twelfth birthday. The two he'd drawn, Kaufman andPinelli, seemed to be totally devoid of any sense of caution.     Of course there was no obvious need for caution here. The blobs hadn'tseemed dangerous, and the local animals were apparently all herbivorousand harmless. They were ugly enough, looking like insects in spite oftheir internal skeletons, with anywhere from four to twelve legs eachon their segmented bodies. None acted like dangerous beasts.     But      something     had happened to the exploration party fifteen yearsback, and to the more recent ship under Hennessy that was sent to checkup.   <doc-sep> The arms were thin and grotesque below the massively distortedshoulders, but amazingly strong. Gwayne felt them wrench at him as hishands locked on the thick throat. A stench of alien flesh was in hisnose as the thing fell backwards. Doc Barker had hit it seconds afterthe captain's attack. Its head hit rocky ground with a dull, heavysound, and it collapsed. Gwayne eased back slowly, but it made nofurther move, though it was still breathing.     Another jeep had drawn up, and men were examining the cadets. Pinelliwas either laughing or crying, and Kaufman was trying to break free tokick at the monster. But neither had been harmed. The two were loadedonto a jeep while men helped Barker and Gwayne stow the bound monsteron another before heading back.     No sign of skull fracture. My God, what a tough brute! Barker shookhis own head, as if feeling the shock of the monster's landing.     I hope so, Gwayne told him. I want that thing to live\u2014and you'redetailed to save it and revive it. Find out if it can make signlanguage or draw pictures. I want to know what happened to Hennessyand why that ship was buried against detection. This thing may be theanswer.     Barker nodded grimly. I'll try, though I can't risk drugs on an alienmetabolism. He sucked in on the cigarette he'd dug out, then spatsickly. Smoke and this air made a foul combination. Bob, it stillmakes no sense. We've scoured this planet by infra-red, and there wasno sign of native villages or culture. We should have found some.     Troglodytes, maybe, Gwayne guessed. Anyhow, send for me when you getanything. I've got to get this ship back to Earth. We're overstayingour time here already.     The reports from the cadets were satisfactory enough. They'd beenpicked up and carried, but no harm had been done them. Now they werebusy being little heroes. Gwayne sentenced them to quarters as soonas he could, knowing their stories would only get wilder and lessinformative with retelling.     If they could get any story from the captured creature, they might savetime and be better off than trying to dig through Hennessy's ship. Thatwas almost certainly spoorless by now. The only possible answer seemedto be that the exploring expedition and Hennessy's rescue group hadbeen overcome by the aliens.     It was an answer, but it left a lot of questions. How could theprimitives have gotten to the men inside Hennessy's ship? Why was itsfuel dumped? Only men would have known how to do that. And who toldthese creatures that a space ship's metal finders could be fooled by alittle more than a hundred feet of solid rock? They'd buried the shipcunningly, and only the accidental slippage had undone their work.     Maybe there would never be a full answer, but he had to findsomething\u2014and find it fast. Earth needed every world she could makeremotely habitable, or mankind was probably doomed to extinction.  "

She also gets the jeeps out when Captain Gwayne tries to catch up with the mysterious creatures who captured the cadets. In addition, after Captain Gwayne learns the truth from Hennessy, the leader of the mysterious creature, and discharges the fuel from the ship, he tells Jane about his decision.

She is a good partner for Captain Gwayne.",
        "Summary_2": "Jane Corey is a Lieutenant aboard the ship, Pandora, and is Captain Gwayne\u2019s right hand woman. She is described to be highly intelligent and organized, as she is the first to inform Gwayne of the young cadet\u2019s escapades as well as the first to observe the blobs\u2019 change in behavior, hence alerting them to the kids\u2019 presence in danger. \n\nHer intelligence is further highlighted after she, Gwayne and the Doc speak with the changed Hennessy. When Gwayne gives the gist of the situation to Jane, she is able to see through his lie and come to the conclusion herself the dire reality of the situation: that she and the crew are to remain on this planet in spite of turning into the creatures. This is because the planet is to be their spawning ground, in which the future bloodlines need to be as rich and fruitful in order to give the new human race a chance - and in the future - once again explore and adapt to other worlds. After this realization, she smiles and understands this reality to be fruitful and eventually, spawn to replenish Earth. \n",

Jane later holds a cup of murky coffee in her hand and tells Gwayne that he can see more primitive spears outside if he enjoys its design so much. She instantly catches on when he tells her about the blobs, concluding that they have to be the ones who set up a spawning ground. She knows Gwayne better than the other crew members, and she silently agrees to stay on the planet. However, she also knows that they have not really been changed yet.

He'd have to tell the men and women of the crew later, after he'd hadtime to organize things and present it all in a way they could accept,however much they might hate it at first. But there was no putting offgiving the gist of it to Jane.     It was the blobs, he summarized it. They seem to be amused by men.They don't require anything from us, but they like us around. Hennessydoesn't know why. They can change our cells, adapt us. Before men came,all life here had twelve legs. Now they're changing that, as we've seen.     And they don't have to be close to do it. We've all been outside thehull. It doesn't show yet\u2014but we're changed. In another month, Earthfood would kill us. We've got to stay here. We'll bury the ships deeperthis time, and Earth won't find us. They can't risk trying a colonywhere three ships vanish, so we'll just disappear. And they'll neverknow.     Nobody would know. Their children\u2014odd children who matured in eightyears\u2014would be primitive savages in three generations. The Earthtools would be useless, impossible for the hands so radically changed.Nothing from the ship would last. Books could never be read by the neweyes. And in time, Earth wouldn't even be a memory to this world.     She was silent a long time, staring out of the port toward what mustnow be her home. Then she sighed. You'll need practice, but the othersdon't know you as well as I do, Bob. I guess we can fix it so they'llbelieve it all. And it's too late now. But we haven't really beenchanged yet, have we?     No, he admitted. Damn his voice! He'd never been good at lying. No.They have to touch us. I've been touched, but the rest could go back.     She nodded. He waited for the condemnation, but there was onlypuzzlement in her face. Why?     And then, before he could answer, her own intelligence gave her thesame answer he had found for himself. The spawning ground!     It was the only thing they could do. Earth needed a place to plant herseed, but no world other than Earth could ever be trusted to preservethat seed for generation after generation. Some worlds already werebecoming uncertain.     Here, though, the blobs had adapted men to the alien world instead ofmen having to adapt the whole planet to their needs. Here, the strangechildren of man's race could grow, develop and begin the long trek backto civilization. The gadgets would be lost for a time. But perhapssome of the attitudes of civilized man would remain to make the nextrise to culture a better one.     We're needed here, he told her, his voice pleading for theunderstanding he couldn't yet fully give himself. These people needas rich a set of bloodlines as possible to give the new race strength.The fifty men and women on this ship will be needed to start them witha decent chance. We can't go to Earth, where nobody would believe oraccept the idea\u2014or even let us come back. We have to stay here.     She smiled then and moved toward him, groping for his strength. Befruitful, she whispered. Be fruitful and spawn and replenish anearth.     No, he told her. Replenish the stars.     But she was no longer listening, and that part of his idea could wait.     Some day, though, their children would find a way to the starlanesagain, looking for other worlds. With the blobs to help them, theycould adapt to most worlds. The unchanged spirit would lead themthrough all space, and the changing bodies would claim worlds beyondnumbering.     Some day, the whole universe would be a spawning ground for thechildren of men!   <doc-sep> He turned to the port to stare out at the planet. The Sol-type sunmust be rising, since there was a dim light. But the thick clouds thatwrapped the entire world diffused its rays into a haze. For a change,it wasn't raining, though the ground was covered by thick swirls offog. In the distance, the tops of shrubs that made a scrub forestglowed yellow-green. Motions around them suggested a herd of feedinganimals. Details were impossible to see through the haze. Even thedeep gorge where they'd found Hennessy's carefully buried ship wascompletely hidden by the fog.     There were three of the blobs dancing about over the grazing animalsnow, as they often seemed to do. Gwayne stared at them for a minute,trying to read sense into the things. If he had time to study them....     But there was no time.     Earth had ordered him to detour here, after leaving his load ofdeep-sleep stored colonists on Official World 71, to check on any signof Hennessy. He'd been here a week longer than he should have stayedalready. If there was no sign in another day or so of what had happenedto the men who'd deserted their ship and its equipment, he'd have toreport back.     He would have left before, if a recent landslip hadn't exposed enoughof the buried ship for his metal locators to spot from the air byluck. It had obviously been hidden deep enough to foil the detectorsoriginally.     Bob! Jane Corey's voice cut through his pondering. Bob, there arethe kids!     Before he could swing to follow her pointing finger, movement caughthis eye.     The blobs had left the herd. Now the three were streaking at fantasticspeed to a spot near the ship, to hover excitedly above something thatmoved there.     He saw the two cadets then, heading back to the waiting ship, justbeyond the movement he'd seen through the mist.     Whatever was making the fog swirl must have reached higher ground.Something began to heave upwards. It was too far to see clearly, butGwayne grabbed the microphone, yelling into the radio toward the cadets.     They must have seen whatever it was just as the call reached them.Young Kaufman grabbed at Pinelli, and they swung around together.     Then the mists cleared.     Under the dancing blobs, a horde of things was heading for the cadets.Shaggy heads, brute bodies vaguely man-like! One seemed to be almosteight feet tall, leading the others directly toward the spacesuitedcadets. Some of the horde were carrying spears or sticks. There was amomentary halt, and then the leader lifted one arm, as if motioning theothers forward.  "

        "Query": "What is the importance of the blobs in Spawning Ground?",
        "Summary_1": "The blobs are insect-like creatures with skeletons inside with four to twelve legs on their bodies. They are harmless. They are curious about any moving objects on the ground. They can change the cells in any living thing to adapt to the planet. They like humans, so they change their cells to let them stay on the planet.\n\nThe blobs are the main reason why Captain Hennessy and Gwayne decide to stay on the planet. They choose to stay because the blobs make them able to survive on the planet without having to change the whole planet to do so. Without the blobs, they may leave to search for other planets that can let humans survive. But with the blobs, someday in the future, humans may be able to seek out more possibilities in other worlds where the blobs will help them adapt to the new environments. In addition, the blobs also change their shape from only a twelve-leg body to having a four-leg form, which is also evidence of how they like human beings.\n",
        "Summary_2": "The blobs are the native inhabitants of this peculiar planet that the characters are exploring in this story. Observed as seemingly harmless and curious, the blobs aren\u2019t given too much caution in the beginning of the story. However, the behavior of the blobs seem to indicate the presence of humans or creatures and as the story continues, are revealed to play a role in the latter. \n\nIt turns out that the blobs have adaptive capabilities to them - and have already used these capabilities to change the cell structure of Hennessy and his crew - changing them from humans to man-like creatures. While they are no longer like Earth humans, these man-like creatures are able to survive on this planet. This is significant because this story details man\u2019s mission in searching for a habitable planet and the survival of the human race  - and through the blob\u2019s amusement of man and adaptive capabilities - have discovered this form of survival. Rather than humans colonizing the planet like we may assume, the blobs indicate the planet changing the humans and signify the new reality for Captain Gwayne and his crew. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The blobs are the inhabitants of the new planet that are described as spirit-like. The crew believes that the blobs are harmless. After they find Hennessy, the crew realizes that the blobs can affect the humans, and adapt their bodies to different environments. Because of the impending explosion of the sun, humans are desperately looking for different planets where humans can live. Gwayne realizes that the blobs could be very important for the survival of the human species, because if the humans stay on the planet, the blobs could help the humans adapt to different planetary conditions in the future. ",
        "Summary_4": "The blobs are a peculiarity on the planet and look like overgrown fireballs. They are initially very curious about humans, but they are not harmless. These blobs, however, later prove to be significant because they are capable of changing human cells to better adapt to the alien environment. The blobs find people amusing and like having them around. Gwayne mentions that life before man came used to have twelve legs, but the blobs have changed that. Another reason why the blobs are significant is that they have adapted man to the alien world instead of the other way around. Since men usually have to adapt the planet to their needs, being touched by a blob does the opposite and brings a human further away from human society. ",

Gwayne yelled at Jane. He yanked the door ofthe little officers' lift open and jabbed the down button. It wasagonizingly slow, but faster than climbing down. He ripped the doorback at the exit deck. Men were dashing in, stumbling around inconfusion. But someone was taking over now\u2014one of the crew women. Thejeeps were lining up. One, at the front, was stuttering into life, andGwayne dashed for it as the exit port slid back.     There was no time for suits or helmets. The air on the planet wasirritating and vile smelling, but it could be breathed. He leaped tothe seat, to see that the driver was Doctor Barker. At a gesture, thejeep rolled down the ramp, grinding its gears into second as it pickedup speed. The other two followed.     There was no sign of the cadets at first. Then Gwayne spotted them;surrounded by the menacing horde. Seen from here, the things lookedhorrible in a travesty of manhood.     The huge leader suddenly waved and pointed toward the jeeps that wereracing toward him. He made a fantastic leap backwards. Others swungabout, two of them grabbing up the cadets. The jeep was doing twentymiles an hour now, but the horde began to increase the distance, inspite of the load of the two struggling boys! The creatures diveddownward into lower ground, beginning to disappear into the mists.     Follow the blobs, Gwayne yelled. He realized now he'd been a fool toleave his suit; the radio would have let him keep in contact with thekids. But it was too late to go back.     The blobs danced after the horde. Barker bounced the jeep downward intoa gorge. Somewhere the man had learned to drive superlatively; but hehad to slow as the fog thickened lower down.     Then it cleared to show the mob of creatures doubling back on their owntrail to confuse the pursuers.     There was no time to stop. The jeep plowed through them. Gwayne had aglimpse of five-foot bodies tumbling out of the way. Monstrously coarsefaces were half hidden by thick hair. A spear crunched against thewindshield from behind, and Gwayne caught it before it could foul thesteering wheel. It had a wickedly beautiful point of stone.     The creatures vanished as Barker fought to turn to follow them. Theother jeeps were coming up, by the sound of their motors, but too lateto help. They'd have to get to the group with the cadets in a hurry orthe horde would all vanish in the uneven ground, hidden by the fog.     A blob dropped down, almost touching Gwayne.     He threw up an instinctive hand. There was a tingling as the creatureseemed to pass around it. It lifted a few inches and drifted off.     Abruptly, Barker's foot ground at the brake. Gwayne jolted forwardagainst the windshield, just as he made out the form of the eight-footleader. The thing was standing directly ahead of him, a cadet on eachshoulder.     The wheels locked and the jeep slid protestingly forward. The creatureleaped back. But Gwayne was out of the jeep before it stopped, divingfor the figure. It dropped the boys with a surprised grunt.

        "Query": "What is the fate of humanity on Earth in Spawning Ground?",
        "Summary_1": "After the invention of atomic weapons, humans maintained peace for nearly two centuries. However, four decades ago, observation revealed that the sun would soon go nova, which would make the whole solar system uninhabitable for millennia. Since then, humans have been searching for habitable planets in other solar systems. They send many starships carrying deep-sleep stored people to different worlds, hoping they could be the colonies for the human race in the future, but none has promised to be safe for generations. So the exploring teams are sent continuously. Yet the situation is challenging. The training schools cannot export enough astronauts, so promising young candidates are trained as cadets on starships. Humans do not have enough time to find another Earth to live on for generations.",
        "Summary_2": "On Earth, the human race is threatened by the Sun\u2019s imminent reality of going nova. Despite surviving the discovery of atomic weapons and preventing an interplanetary war, the Sun going nova meant that humans had to find another world to inhabit and colonize in order to continue to survive, as even the Solar System would be uninhabitable for a while. \nAs such, explorers like Captain Gwayne and Hennessy were sent out to discover new worlds that may be habitable for humans with deep-sleeping colonizers while teams of terraformers did their best. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The human race on Earth is facing probable extinction. This is because they found out that the sun is going nova, which means that the Sun is going to explode soon, leading to the extinction of the human race. This has caused the human race to search different planets where they could live and colonize. This whole process is what set up the arrival of Gwayne\u2019s crew on the planet to search for Hennessy. Hennessy\u2019s ship was sent to the planet to scout and see if humans could live there. ",
        "Summary_4": "The human race on Earth will be destroyed when the sun goes nova. Since this event will render the entire Solar System uninhabitable for millenia, people will have to colonize other planets. There is a team of explorers going out to find a world in desperation, terraforming teams, and big starships are also sent out with colonists in a deep sleep to conserve space. By the time they go to the new planet, the sun will explode in ten years and kill the entire human race on Earth. Even though humans enjoy their life on Earth, they know that they must find a new place to adapt to because the world will become destroyed. The human race might also go to these new planets to spawn and spread the same seeds that they did on Earth. ",
        "Article": "Back in the control room, Gwayne found the emergency release levers,set the combinations and pressed the studs. There was a hiss and gurgleas the great tanks of fuel discharged their contents out onto theground where no ingenuity could ever recover it to bring life to theship again.     He'd have to tell the men and women of the crew later, after he'd hadtime to organize things and present it all in a way they could accept,however much they might hate it at first. But there was no putting offgiving the gist of it to Jane.     It was the blobs, he summarized it. They seem to be amused by men.They don't require anything from us, but they like us around. Hennessydoesn't know why. They can change our cells, adapt us. Before men came,all life here had twelve legs. Now they're changing that, as we've seen.     And they don't have to be close to do it. We've all been outside thehull. It doesn't show yet\u2014but we're changed. In another month, Earthfood would kill us. We've got to stay here. We'll bury the ships deeperthis time, and Earth won't find us. They can't risk trying a colonywhere three ships vanish, so we'll just disappear. And they'll neverknow.     Nobody would know. Their children\u2014odd children who matured in eightyears\u2014would be primitive savages in three generations. The Earthtools would be useless, impossible for the hands so radically changed.Nothing from the ship would last. Books could never be read by the neweyes. And in time, Earth wouldn't even be a memory to this world.     She was silent a long time, staring out of the port toward what mustnow be her home. Then she sighed. You'll need practice, but the othersdon't know you as well as I do, Bob. I guess we can fix it so they'llbelieve it all. And it's too late now. But we haven't really beenchanged yet, have we?     No, he admitted. Damn his voice! He'd never been good at lying. No.They have to touch us. I've been touched, but the rest could go back.     She nodded. He waited for the condemnation, but there was onlypuzzlement in her face. Why?     And then, before he could answer, her own intelligence gave her thesame answer he had found for himself. The spawning ground!     It was the only thing they could do. Earth needed a place to plant herseed, but no world other than Earth could ever be trusted to preservethat seed for generation after generation. Some worlds already werebecoming uncertain.     Here, though, the blobs had adapted men to the alien world instead ofmen having to adapt the whole planet to their needs. Here, the strangechildren of man's race could grow, develop and begin the long trek backto civilization. The gadgets would be lost for a time. But perhapssome of the attitudes of civilized man would remain to make the nextrise to culture a better one.     We're needed here, he told her, his voice pleading for theunderstanding he couldn't yet fully give himself. These people needas rich a set of bloodlines as possible to give the new race strength.The fifty men and women on this ship will be needed to start them witha decent chance. We can't go to Earth, where nobody would believe oraccept the idea\u2014or even let us come back. We have to stay here.     She smiled then and moved toward him, groping for his strength. Befruitful, she whispered. Be fruitful and spawn and replenish anearth.     No, he told her. Replenish the stars.     But she was no longer listening, and that part of his idea could wait.     Some day, though, their children would find a way to the starlanesagain, looking for other worlds. With the blobs to help them, theycould adapt to most worlds. The unchanged spirit would lead themthrough all space, and the changing bodies would claim worlds beyondnumbering.     Some day, the whole universe would be a spawning ground for thechildren of men!   <doc-sep>    Spawning Ground     By LESTER DEL REY     They weren't human.

She seemed tobe restless to end her fool's errand here, two hundred light years fromthe waiting hordes on Earth. Straining metal plates twanged and echoedthrough her hallways.     Captain Gwayne cursed and rolled over, reaching for his boots. He wasa big, rawboned man, barely forty; but ten years of responsibilityhad pressed down his shoulders and put age-feigning hollows under hisreddened eyes. The starlanes between Earth and her potential colonieswere rough on the men who traveled them now. He shuffled toward thecontrol room, grumbling at the heavy gravity.     Lieutenant Jane Corey looked up, nodding a blonde head at him as hemoved toward the ever-waiting pot of murky coffee. Morning, Bob. Youneed a shave.     Yeah. He swallowed the hot coffee without tasting it, then ran ahand across the dark stubble on his chin. It could wait. Anything newduring the night?     About a dozen blobs held something like a convention a little waysnorth of us. They broke up about an hour ago and streaked off into theclouds. The blobs were a peculiarity of this planet about which nobodyknew anything. They looked like overgrown fireballs, but seemed to havean almost sentient curiosity about anything moving on the ground. Andour two cadets sneaked out again. Barker followed them, but lost themin the murk. I've kept a signal going to guide them back.     Gwayne swore softly to himself. Earth couldn't turn out enough starmenin the schools, so promising kids were being shipped out for trainingas cadets on their twelfth birthday. The two he'd drawn, Kaufman andPinelli, seemed to be totally devoid of any sense of caution.     Of course there was no obvious need for caution here. The blobs hadn'tseemed dangerous, and the local animals were apparently all herbivorousand harmless. They were ugly enough, looking like insects in spite oftheir internal skeletons, with anywhere from four to twelve legs eachon their segmented bodies. None acted like dangerous beasts.     But      something     had happened to the exploration party fifteen yearsback, and to the more recent ship under Hennessy that was sent to checkup.   <doc-sep> The race had blundered safely through its discovery of atomic weaponsinto a peace that had lasted two hundred years. It had managed toprevent an interplanetary war with the Venus colonists. It had founda drive that led to the stars, and hadn't even found intelligent lifethere to be dangerous on the few worlds that had cultures of their own.     But forty years ago, observations from beyond the Solar System hadfinally proved that the sun was going to go nova.     It wouldn't be much of an explosion, as such things go\u2014but it wouldrender the whole Solar System uninhabitable for millenia. To survive,man had to colonize.     And there were no worlds perfect for him, as Earth had been. Theexplorers went out in desperation to find what they could; theterraforming teams did what they could. And then the big starshipsbegan filling worlds with colonists, carried in deep sleep to conservespace.     Almost eighty worlds. The nearest a four month journey from Earth andfour more months back.     In another ten years, the sun would explode, leaving man only on thefootholds he was trying to dig among other solar systems. Maybe someof the strange worlds would let men spread his seed again. Maybe nonewould be spawning grounds for mankind in spite of the efforts. Each wasprecious as a haven for the race.     If this world could be used, it would be nearer than most. If not, asit now seemed, no more time could be wasted here.     Primitives could be overcome, maybe. It would be ruthless and unfair tostrip them of their world, but the first law was survival.     But how could primitives do what these must have done?     He studied the spear he had salvaged. It was on a staff made ofcemented bits of smaller wood from the scrub growth, skillfullylaminated. The point was of delicately chipped flint, done as no humanhand had been able to do for centuries.     Beautiful primitive work, he muttered.     Jane pulled the coffee cup away from her lips and snorted. You cansee a lot more of it out there, she suggested.     He went to the port and glanced out. About sixty of the things weresquatting in the clearing fog, holding lances and staring at the ship.They were perhaps a thousand yards away, waiting patiently. For what?For the return of their leader\u2014or for something that would give theship to them?     Gwayne grabbed the phone and called Barker. How's the captive coming?     Barker's voice sounded odd.     Physically fine. You can see him. But\u2014     Gwayne dropped the phone and headed for the little sick bay. He sworeat Doc for not calling him at once, and then at himself for notchecking up sooner. Then he stopped at the sound of voices.     There was the end of a question from Barker and a thick, harsh growlingsound that lifted the hair along the nape of Gwayne's neck. Barkerseemed to understand, and was making a comment as the captain dashed in.     The captive was sitting on the bunk, unbound and oddly unmenacing. Thethick features were relaxed and yet somehow intent. He seemed to makesome kind of a salute as he saw Gwayne enter, and his eyes burned upunerringly toward the device on the officer's cap.     Haarroo, Cabbaan! the thing said.  "

        "Summary_1": "The story is about a family man - Henry Devers - returning to his hometown after a unique adventure. He was participating in an experimental flight that ended in an explosion. But he managed to survive thanks to regenerative technologies that helped rebuild his body and make him breathe again. The story starts with a grandiose tour around his town where the mayor, the National Guard, the Fire Department bands, and many other people participate though they all seem a little distant and scared to Devers. The official car lets him off at his house that, as he notices, has changed a little. Edith, his wife, and Ralphie, his ten-year-old son, meet him at the door. Later, in the living room, they have an awkward conversation about Ralphie\u2019s school grades, his son quickly leaves for a baseball game, and soon Devers goes to sleep in his separate twin bed that his wife bought while he was away. He looks at his scars before going to bed, thinking about how people\u2019s behavior changed because they believe Henry has changed.  \nIn the evening, Henry\u2019s mother, uncle Joe, and aunt Lucille come for dinner. Again everyone seems aloof: Henry\u2019s overly affectionate mother now barely touches him and even cries for several minutes, his aunt and uncle cannot talk about casual things - no one looks him in the eyes. After all, Devers gets infuriated and screams at the guests, they leave, and his son once again tries to leave instead of spending time with the parents. Later in the evening, Edith wakes her husband because his good friends Phil and Rhona came - they all go to bowling alleys and then to a tavern. Even Devers\u2019 close friends seem stiff and cautious while talking to him, dancing with him, being around him. On their way back, Phil tries to make a joke about a cemetery but stops himself from finishing it - this upsets Henry even more, completely ruining the evening. When they get home Edith tries to apologize to her husband and admits that she\u2019s frightened. In reply, he says that soon such regenerative technologies and processes will be an ordinary thing, and his captain, for example, who died together with Devers, will soon leave the hospital, too. She asks him to be patient with everybody. \n\n",

His Honor\u2019s handclasp is somewhat moist and cold, with eyes holding traces of remoteness. Henry Devers is still honored, and there is a tour up Main street to where the mayor waits alongside a young homecoming queen. Hank looks out to the crowd, and there is a lot of national interest because he is the First One. He is glad that the official greeting is over, and all he wants to do is see his family again. When Hank goes back to 45 Roosevelt Street, the house has changed for the better. He is glad not to have to deal with more strangers and is surprised by having to use the ornamental knocker on the new door. Edith opens the door with their son Ralphie in her arms, and the family shares a sweet moment. Edith hesitates to take a seat next to him. When Hank asks about Ralphie, the boy says that it is now summer vacation. However, Edith says that he has been doing excellent in school. He remembers back to their farewells at the experimental flight station in the Aleutians. Ralphie suddenly says he must go to pitch for the Inter-Town Little League; Hank tells Edith that he is tired. She leads him upstairs, where there are two twin beds in entirely new furniture. Hank assumes that Edith has created this barrier between them because he has changed too much. When she leaves, Hank goes to look at his scars. He hopes Edith does not have to see them, even though he did not consider the scars when he left the Walter Reed Hospital. As Hank dozes off, he thinks about wishing to regain his old relationships. His mother, Uncle Joe, and Aunt Lucille all come when dinner approaches. Hank tries to compliment his mother over grapefruit, and she bursts into tears. Uncle Joe and Aunt Lucille make little to no attempts to talk either, making Hank angry because nobody treats him like a human being. Hank falls asleep, but Phil and Rhona come to take everyone to a bowling alley. Hank agrees to Phil\u2019s request to drink and continues to do so in Manfred\u2019s Tavern. He tries to dance with Rhona, who looks as if she will be sick, and even his wife is reluctant to dance with him. When the entire party drives back, Hank jokes about a cemetery and wonders if he should just lie in an open grave. Edith tries to apologize to him and says that they all need some time to get used to him being back when he should have died. Hank tells her that the government is doing everything they can and that he has not seen anything in the six and half months. However, when he lays in his bed, he thinks back to the monsters and is glad to be in his own house. ",

He still gets a big welcome from the nation and his family, but it is not the same anymore. He feels the awkward silence in the ceremony and parade when it was once lively and welcoming. His family no longer touches him as they did before because they are now afraid of him. Things have changed after he left, and it is not the same anymore. He feels uneasy and angry. He wants the old normality and urges to be accepted by his family and close friends, but people are too scared to act normally to him. They treat him as some monster. Henry knows that it takes time for people to accept him, but it is also true that people like him will become normal in the future, and there must be a time when his family takes him as an ordinary person again.

When he arrived at his house, his cold reception continued, as his wife and his son also seemed nervous and weird around him. His mother even cried when she saw him, and couldn\u2019t spend time with him. This trend continued throughout, as even his mother, aunt and uncle were sad when they saw him. Throughout the story, Henry only wanted everyone to treat him normally, like before he left. He then decides to go out with his wife and best friends.

Manet just didn't know when to stop!      William Manet was alone.     In the beginning, he had seen many advantages to being alone. It wouldgive him an unprecedented opportunity to once and for all correlateloneliness to the point of madness, to see how long it would take himto start slavering and clawing the pin-ups from the magazines, to beginteaching himself classes in philosophy consisting of interminablelectures to a bored and captive audience of one.     He would be able to measure the qualities of peace and decide whetherit was really better than war, he would be able to get as fat and asdirty as he liked, he would be able to live more like an animal andthink more like a god than any man for generations.     But after a shorter time than he expected, it all got to be a tearingbore. Even the waiting to go crazy part of it.     Not that he was going to have any great long wait of it. He was alreadytalking to himself, making verbal notes for his lectures, and he hadcut out a picture of Annie Oakley from an old book. He tacked it up andwinked at it whenever he passed that way.     Lately she was winking back at him.     Loneliness was a physical weight on his skull. It peeled the flesh fromhis arms and legs and sandpapered his self-pity to a fine sensitivity.     No one on Earth was as lonely as William Manet, and even William Manetcould only be this lonely on Mars.     Manet was Atmosphere Seeder Station 131-47's own human.     All Manet had to do was sit in the beating aluminum heart in the middleof the chalk desert and stare out, chin cupped in hands, at the flat,flat pavement of dirty talcum, at the stars gleaming as hard in theblack sky as a starlet's capped teeth ... stars two of which were moonsand one of which was Earth. He had to do nothing else. The wholegimcrack was cybernetically controlled, entirely automatic. No one wasneeded here\u2014no human being, at least.     The Workers' Union was a pretty small pressure group, but it didn'ttake much to pressure the Assembly. Featherbedding had been carefullyspecified, including an Overseer for each of the Seeders to honeycombMars, to prepare its atmosphere for colonization.     They didn't give tests to find well-balanced, well-integrated peoplefor the job. Well-balanced, well-integrated men weren't going toisolate themselves in a useless job. They got, instead, William Manetand his fellows.     The Overseers were to stay as long as the job required. Passenger fareto Mars was about one billion dollars. They weren't providing commuterservice for night shifts. They weren't providing accommodationsfor couples when the law specified only one occupant. They weren'tproviding fuel (at fifty million dollars a gallon) for visits betweenthe various Overseers. They weren't very providential.     But it was two hundred thousand a year in salary, and it offeredwonderful opportunities.     It gave William Manet an opportunity to think he saw a spaceship makinga tailfirst landing on the table of the desert, its tail burning asbright as envy.  "

As he returns to his hometown, he is accompanied by some U.S. army members, and meets with the town\u2019s mayor. This makes it seem as if he was an astronaut, military member, or something similar. He gets a very cold reception from everyone in the town, including his own wife and son. This seems to bother him as he hopes everything will be back to normal. It is also revealed that he was in an accident that left his body scarred during his journey. As Henry reconnects with his mother, she also has a very bad reaction to seeing him, as she starts crying and can't seem to be close to him. All of these reactions make Henry very angry. When he gets the chance to go out with his childhood friends, he is very excited as he believes that they will treat him normally. This isn\u2019t the case and after going with them and passing through a graveyard, we realize that what had happened to Henry is that he had died. After he died, Henry was put through a regenerative procedure to revive him, which is where his scars come from, and why everyone was so weird around him. He ends up fighting with his wife, but he realizes that time is needed for everyone to go back to normal and accept this new technology. ",
        "Article": "Dinner was at seven  p.m.  His mother came; his Uncle Joe and Aunt Lucillecame. Together with Edith, Ralphie and himself, they made six, and atein the dining room at the big table.     Before he'd become the First One, it would have been a noisy affair. Hisfamily had never been noted for a lack of ebullience, a lack oftalkativeness, and Ralphie had always chosen mealtimes\u2014especially withcompany present\u2014to describe everything and anything that had happenedto him during the day. And Edith herself had always chatted, especiallywith his mother, though they didn't agree about much. Still, it had beengood-natured; the general tone of their lives had been good-natured.     This wasn't good-natured. Exactly what it was he wasn't sure. Stiffwas perhaps the word.     They began with grapefruit, Edith and Mother serving quickly,efficiently from the kitchen, then sitting down at the table. He lookedat Mother as he raised his first spoonful of chilled fruit, and said,Younger than ever. It was nothing new; he'd said it many many timesbefore, but his mother had always reacted with a bright smile and a quipsomething like, Young for the Golden Age Center, you mean. This timeshe burst into tears. It shocked him. But what shocked him even more wasthe fact that no one looked up, commented, made any attempt to comforther; no one indicated in any way that a woman was sobbing at the table.     He was sitting directly across from Mother, and reached out and touchedher left hand which lay limply beside the silverware. She didn't moveit\u2014she hadn't touched him once beyond that first, quick, strangely-coolembrace at the door\u2014then a few seconds later she withdrew it and let itdrop out of sight.     So there he was, Henry Devers, at home with the family. So there he was,the hero returned, waiting to be treated as a human being.     The grapefruit shells were cleaned away and the soup served. Uncle Joebegan to talk. The greatest little development of circular uniformhouses you ever did see, he boomed in his powerful salesman's voice.Still going like sixty. We'll sell out before\u2014 At that point helooked at Hank, and Hank nodded encouragement, desperately interested inthis normalcy, and Joe's voice died away. He looked down at his plate,mumbled, Soup's getting cold, and began to eat. His hand shook alittle; his ruddy face was not quite as ruddy as Hank remembered it.     Aunt Lucille made a few quavering statements about the Ladies' TuesdayGarden Club, and Hank looked across the table to where she sat betweenJoe and Mother\u2014his wife and son bracketed him, and yet he feltalone\u2014and said, I've missed fooling around with the lawn and the rosebushes. Here it is August and I haven't had my hand to a mower ortrowel.     Aunt Lucille smiled, if you could call it that\u2014a pitiful twitching ofthe lips\u2014and nodded. She threw her eyes in his direction, and past him,and then down to her plate. Mother, who was still sniffling, said, Ihave a dismal headache. I'm going to lie down in the guest room awhile. She touched his shoulder in passing\u2014his affectionate, effusivemother who would kiss stray dogs and strange children, who had oftenirritated him with an excess of physical and verbal caresses\u2014she barelytouched his shoulder and fled.     So now five of them sat at the table. The meat was served\u2014thin, rareslices of beef, the pink blood-juice oozing warmly from the center. Hecut into it and raised a forkful to his mouth, then glanced at Ralphieand said, Looks fresh enough to have been killed in the back yard.Ralphie said, Yeah, Dad. Aunt Lucille put down her knife and fork andmurmured something to her husband. Joe cleared his throat and saidLucille was rapidly becoming a vegetarian and he guessed she was goinginto the living room for a while. She'll be back for dessert, ofcourse, he said, his laugh sounding forced.     Hank looked at Edith; Edith was busy with her plate. Hank looked atRalphie; Ralphie was busy with his plate. Hank looked at Joe; Joe waschewing, gazing out over their heads to the kitchen. Hank looked atLucille; she was disappearing into the living room.     He brought his fist down on the table. The settings jumped; a glassoverturned, spilling water. He brought it down again and again. Theywere all standing now. He sat there and pounded the table with his bigright fist\u2014Henry Devers, who would never have thought of making such ascene before, but who was now so sick and tired of being treated as theFirst One, of being stood back from, looked at in awe of, felt in fearof, that he could have smashed more than a table.     Edith said, Hank!     He said, voice hoarse, Shut up. Go away. Let me eat alone. I'm sick ofthe lot of you.   <doc-sep> She led him upstairs and along the foyer past Ralphie's room and pastthe small guest room to their bedroom. This, too, had changed. It wasnewly painted and it had new furniture. He saw twin beds separated by anornate little table with an ornate little lamp, and this looked moreominous a barrier to him than the twelve-foot concrete-and-barbed-wirefence around the experimental station.     Which one is mine, he asked, and tried to smile.     She also tried to smile. The one near the window. You always liked thefresh air, the sunshine in the morning. You always said it helped youto get up on time when you were stationed at the base outside of town.You always said it reminded you\u2014being able to see the sky\u2014that youwere going to go up in it, and that you were going to come down from itto this bed again.     Not this bed, he murmured, and was a little sorry afterward.     No, not this bed, she said quickly. Your lodge donated the bedroomset and I really didn't know\u2014 She waved her hand, her face white.     He was sure then that she      had     known, and that the beds and the barrierbetween them were her own choice, if only an unconscious choice. He wentto the bed near the window, stripped off his Air Force blue jacket,began to take off his shirt, but then remembered that some arm scarsstill showed. He waited for her to leave the room.     She said, Well then, rest up, dear, and went out.     He took off his shirt and saw himself in the mirror on the oppositewall; and then took off his under-shirt. The body scars were faint, thescars running in long lines, one dissecting his chest, the other slicingdiagonally across his upper abdomen to disappear under his trousers.There were several more on his back, and one on his right thigh. They'dbeen treated properly and would soon disappear. But she had never seenthem.     Perhaps she never would. Perhaps pajamas and robes and dark rooms wouldkeep them from her until they were gone.     Which was not what he'd considered at all important on leaving WalterReed Hospital early this morning; which was something he founddistasteful, something he felt beneath them both. And, at the same time,he began to understand that there would be many things, previouslybeneath them both, which would have to be considered. She had changed;Ralphie had changed; all the people he knew had probablychanged\u2014because they thought      he     had changed.     He was tired of thinking. He lay down and closed his eyes. He lethimself taste bitterness, unhappiness, a loneliness he had never knownbefore.     But sometime later, as he was dozing off, a sense of reassurance beganfiltering into his mind. After all, he was still Henry Devers, the sameman who had left home eleven months ago, with a love for family andfriends which was, if anything, stronger than before. Once he couldcommunicate this, the strangeness would disappear and the First Onewould again become good old Hank. It was little enough to ask for\u2014areturn to old values, old relationships, the normalcies of the backwashinstead of the freneticisms of the lime-light. It would certainly begranted to him.     He slept.   <doc-sep> Most of the cousins gasped as the truth began to percolate through.     I knew from the very beginning, Conrad finished, that I didn'thave to do anything at all. I just had to wait and you would destroyyourselves.     I don't understand, Bartholomew protested, searching the faces of thecousins closest to him. What does he mean, we have never existed?We're here, aren't we? What\u2014     Shut up! Raymond snapped. He turned on Martin. You don't seemsurprised.     The old man grinned. I'm not. I figured it all out years ago.     At first, he had wondered what he should do. Would it be better tothrow them into a futile panic by telling them or to do nothing? Hehad decided on the latter; that was the role they had assigned him\u2014towatch and wait and keep out of things\u2014and that was the role he wouldplay.     You knew all the time and you didn't tell us! Raymond spluttered.After we'd been so good to you, making a gentleman out of you insteadof a criminal.... That's right, he snarled, a criminal! An alcoholic,a thief, a derelict! How do you like that?     Sounds like a rich, full life, Martin said wistfully.     What an exciting existence they must have done him out of! But then, hecouldn't help thinking, he\u2014he and Conrad together, of course\u2014had donethem out of      any     kind of existence. It wasn't his responsibility,though; he had done nothing but let matters take whatever course wasdestined for them. If only he could be sure that it was the bettercourse, perhaps he wouldn't feel that nagging sense of guilt insidehim. Strange\u2014where, in his hermetic life, could he possibly havedeveloped such a queer thing as a conscience?     Then we've wasted all this time, Ninian sobbed, all this energy, allthis money, for nothing!     But you were nothing to begin with, Martin told them. And then,after a pause, he added, I only wish I could be sure there had beensome purpose to this.     He didn't know whether it was approaching death that dimmed his sight,or whether the frightened crowd that pressed around him was growingshadowy.     I wish I could feel that some good had been done in letting you bewiped out of existence, he went on voicing his thoughts. But I knowthat the same thing that happened to your worlds and my world willhappen all over again. To other people, in other times, but again. It'sbound to happen. There isn't any hope for humanity.     One man couldn't really change the course of human history, he toldhimself. Two men, that was\u2014one real, one a shadow.     Conrad came close to the old man's bed. He was almost transparent.     No, he said, there is hope. They didn't know the time transmitterworks two ways. I used it for going into the past only once\u2014just thisonce. But I've gone into the future with it many times. And\u2014 hepressed Martin's hand\u2014believe me, what I did\u2014what      we     did, you andI\u2014serves a purpose. It will change things for the better. Everythingis going to be all right.  "

        "Summary_1": "The main character - Henry Devers - is the first man to have been saved by regenerative technologies. After leaving the hospital, he goes on a grandiose tour around the town, but he can see that the crowds are quiet. At home, his wife Edith seems overly hesitant and restrained, his son Ralphie quickly leaves them. Later in the evening, during dinner, his mother, aunt, and uncle also seem stiff and anxious, infuriating him. After that, he meets with his close friends hoping for them to treat him as before, but all their actions show that they are not comfortable with Devers either. He realizes that everyone he knows doesn't know how to behave around him, they cannot look him in the eyes and are scared. The First One status makes everyone terrified of him, which his wife later admits. But Devers assures her that soon this kind of technology will be ubiquitous, and the old superstitions will die, people like him will be ordinary citizens. ",
        "Summary_2": "The regenerative technology allows the men who have gone beyond the Great Frontier to return home safely. Without this technology, Hank would not have been able to return to his family. When Hank speaks to Edith, he tells her that he knows of eight men in the regenerative tanks right now. Even the people who died, such as Captain Davidson, will return home as a result of the technology. The regenerative technology can regenerate a brain and organ for any of the young men who lose their lives by accident. This technology is also very significant because it can bring people back to life from the dead. Even though reviving someone from death should be impossible, regenerative technology has made it possible.",

It uses a tank to regenerate brains and organs for anyone who dies from violence, accident, and who can recover, to save the life of the dead ones. It is a technology that the government plans to use in the future to save as many lives as they can. This technology also brings Henry Devers alive again, which is the one that makes Henry Devers become the First One to regain life from death. However, as Henry returns to his hometown from his death, he is treated by people fearfully because he is reborn. Therefore, as the cause for Henry Devers being treated abnormally by everyone, regenerative technology is the leading cause for the whole story to proceed.",

At the beginning of the story, it is revealed that Henry was \u201cThe First One\u201d to go through a journey, but his journey is never elaborated further until the end. At the end we realize that Henry and his team had died, but the regenerative technology allowed them to continue living, which is why everyone was acting weirdly around him.

This is a little personal, but ... you don't lookaltogether like the Norwegians of my time.     His fear that she would be offended proved to be completelyunjustified. She merely laughed and said, There has been muchhistory since 1950. Five hundred years ago, Europe was overrun byPan-Orientals. Today you could not find anywhere a 'pure' Europeanor Asiatic. She giggled. Swarts' ancestors from your time must becursing in their graves. His family is Afrikander all the way back, butone of his great-grandfathers was pure-blooded Bantu. His full name isLassisi Swarts.     Maitland wrinkled his brow. Afrikander?     The South Africans. Something strange came into her eyes. It mighthave been awe, or even hatred; he could not tell. The Pan-Orientalseventually conquered all the world, except for North America\u2014thelast remnant of the American World Empire\u2014and southern Africa. TheAfrikanders had been partly isolated for several centuries then, andthey had developed technology while the rest of the world lost it. Theyhad a tradition of white supremacy, and in addition they were terrifiedof being encircled. She sighed. They ruled the next world empire andit was founded on the slaughter of one and a half billion human beings.That went into the history books as the War of Annihilation.     So many? How?     They were clever with machines, the Afrikanders. They made armiesof them. Armies of invincible killing-machines, produced in robotfactories from robot-mined ores.... Very clever. She gave a littleshudder.     And yet they founded modern civilization, she added. The grandsonsof the technicians who built the Machine Army set up our robotproduction system, and today no human being has to dirty his handsraising food or manufacturing things. It could never have been done,either, before the population was\u2014reduced to three hundred million.     Then the Afrikanders are still on top? Still the masters?   <doc-sep> The first contact Man had ever had with an intelligent alien raceoccurred out on the perimeter in a small quiet place a long way fromhome. Late in the year 2360\u2014the exact date remains unknown\u2014an alienforce attacked and destroyed the colony at Lupus V. The wreckage andthe dead were found by a mailship which flashed off screaming for thearmy.     When the army came it found this: Of the seventy registered colonists,thirty-one were dead. The rest, including some women and children,were missing. All technical equipment, all radios, guns, machines,even books, were also missing. The buildings had been burned, so werethe bodies. Apparently the aliens had a heat ray. What else they had,nobody knew. After a few days of walking around in the ash, one soldierfinally stumbled on something.     For security reasons, there was a detonator in one of the mainbuildings. In case of enemy attack, Security had provided a bomb to beburied in the center of each colony, because it was important to blowa whole village to hell and gone rather than let a hostile alien learnvital facts about human technology and body chemistry. There was a bombat Lupus V too, and though it had been detonated it had not blown. Thedetonating wire had been cut.     In the heart of the camp, hidden from view under twelve inches ofearth, the wire had been dug up and cut.     The army could not understand it and had no time to try. After fivehundred years of peace and anti-war conditioning the army was small,weak and without respect. Therefore, the army did nothing but spreadthe news, and Man began to fall back.     In a thickening, hastening stream he came back from the hard-wonstars, blowing up his homes behind him, stunned and cursing. Most ofthe colonists got out in time. A few, the farthest and loneliest, diedin fire before the army ships could reach them. And the men in thoseships, drinkers and gamblers and veterans of nothing, the dregs of asociety which had grown beyond them, were for a long while the onlydefense Earth had.     This was the message Captain Dylan had brought, come out from Earthwith a bottle on his hip.   <doc-sep> Hank, Edith whispered from the guest room doorway, I'm so sorry\u2014     There's nothing to be sorry about. It's just a matter of time. It'llall work out in time.     Yes, she said quickly, that's it. I need a little time. We all need alittle time. Because it's so strange, Hank. Because it's so frightening.I should have told you that the moment you walked in. I think I've hurtyou terribly, we've all hurt you terribly, by trying to hide that we'refrightened.     I'm going to stay in the guest room, he said, for as long asnecessary. For good if need be.     How could it be for good? How, Hank?     That question was perhaps the first firm basis for hope he'd had sincereturning. And there was something else; what Carlisle had told him,even as Carlisle himself had reacted as all men did.     There are others coming, Edith. Eight that I know of in the tanks rightnow. My superior, Captain Davidson, who died at the same moment Idid\u2014seven months ago next Wednesday\u2014he's going to be next. He wassmashed up worse than I was, so it took a little longer, but he's almostready. And there'll be many more, Edith. The government is going to saveall they possibly can from now on. Every time a young and healthy manloses his life by accident, by violence, and his body can be recovered,he'll go into the tanks and they'll start the regenerative brain andorgan process\u2014the process that made it all possible. So people have toget used to us. And the old stories, the old terrors, the ugly oldsuperstitions have to die, because in time each place will have some ofus; because in time it'll be an ordinary thing.     Edith said, Yes, and I'm so grateful that you're here, Hank. Pleasebelieve that. Please be patient with me and Ralphie and\u2014 She paused.There's one question.     He knew what the question was. It had been the first asked him byeveryone from the president of the United States on down.     I saw nothing, he said. It was as if I slept those six and a halfmonths\u2014slept without dreaming.     She came to him and touched his face with her lips, and he wassatisfied.     Later, half asleep, he heard a dog howling, and remembered stories ofhow they announced death and the presence of monsters. He shivered andpulled the covers closer to him and luxuriated in being safe in his ownhome.     THE END  "

But ever sincethe engines somewhere in the rear of the world had changed their tone,from the steady whining Rikud had heard all twenty-five years of hislife, to the sullen roar that came to his ears now, the feelings hadgrown.     If anyone else had noticed the change, he failed to mention it. Thisdisturbed Rikud, although he could not tell why.

She was looking at him with palpable curiosity and something likeexpectancy. Maitland sighed and said, Hello, then glanced downself-consciously at his wrinkled green pajamas.       She smiled, put the tray of food on the table, and swept out, her cloakbillowing behind her. Maitland remained standing, staring at the closeddoor for a minute after she was gone.     Later, when he had finished the steak and corn on the cob and shreddedcarrots, and a feeling of warm well-being was diffusing from hisstomach to his extremities, he sat down on the bed to watch the sunsetand to think.     There were three questions for which he required answers before hecould formulate any plan or policy.     Where was he?     Who was Swarts?     What was the purpose of the tests he was being given?     It was possible, of course, that this was all an elaborate schemefor getting military secrets, despite Swarts' protestations to thecontrary. Maitland frowned. This place certainly didn't have theappearance of a military establishment, and so far there had beennothing to suggest the kind of interrogation to be expected fromforeign intelligence officers.     It might be better to tackle the first question first. He looked atthe Sun, a red spheroid already half below the horizon, and tried tothink of a region that had this kind of terrain. That prairie out therewas unique. Almost anywhere in the world, land like that would becultivated, not allowed to go to grass.     This might be somewhere in Africa....     He shook his head, puzzled. The Sun disappeared and its blood-huedglow began to fade from the sky. Maitland sat there, trying to gethold of the problem from an angle where it wouldn't just slip away.After a while the western sky became a screen of clear luminous blue,a backdrop for a pure white brilliant star. As always at that sight,Maitland felt his worry drain away, leaving an almost mystical sense ofpeace and an undefinable longing.     Venus, the most beautiful of the planets.     Maitland kept track of them all in their majestic paths through theconstellations, but Venus was his favorite. Time and time again hehad watched its steady climb higher and higher in the western sky,its transient rule there as evening star, its progression toward thehorizon, and loved it equally in its      alter ego     of morning star. Venuswas an old friend. An old friend....     Something icy settled on the back of his neck, ran down his spine, anddiffused into his body. He stared at the planet unbelievingly, fistsclenched, forgetting to breathe.     Last night Venus hadn't been there.     Venus was a morning star just now....       Just now!       He realized the truth in that moment.  "

        "Article": "Edith was leading him into the living room, her hand lying still in his,a cool, dead bird lying still in his. He sat down on the couch, she satdown beside him\u2014but she had hesitated. He      wasn't     being sensitive; shehad hesitated. His wife had hesitated before sitting down beside him.     Carlisle had said his position was analogous to Columbus', to Vasco DeGama's, to Preshoff's when the Russian returned from the Moon\u2014but moreso. Carlisle had said lots of things, but even Carlisle who had workedwith him all the way, who had engineered the entire fantasticjourney\u2014even Carlisle the Nobel prize winner, the multi-degreed geniusin uniform, had not actually spoken to him as one man to another.       The eyes. It always showed in their eyes.       He looked across the room at Ralphie, standing in the doorway, a boyalready tall, already widening in the shoulders, already large offeature. It was like looking into the mirror and seeing himselftwenty-five years ago. But Ralphie's face was drawn, was worried in away that few ten-year-old faces are.     How's it going in school? he asked.     Gee, Dad, it's the second month of summer vacation.     Well, then, before summer vacation?     Pretty good.     Edith said, He made top forum the six-month period before vacation, andhe made top forum the six-month period you went away, Hank.     He nodded, remembering that, remembering everything, remembering thewarmth of her farewell, the warmth of Ralphie's farewell, their tears ashe left for the experimental flight station in the Aleutians. They hadfeared for him, having read of the many launchings gone wrong even incontinent-to-continent experimental flight.     They had been right to worry. He had suffered much after that blow-up.But now they should be rejoicing, because he had survived and made thelong journey. Ralphie suddenly said, I got to go, Dad. I promised Waltand the others I'd pitch. It's Inter-Town Little League, you know. It'sHarmon, you know. I got to keep my word. Without waiting for an answer,he waved his hand\u2014it shook; a ten-year-old boy's hand that shook\u2014andran from the room and from the house.     He and Edith sat beside each other, and he wanted badly to take her inhis arms, and yet he didn't want to oppress her. He stood up. I'm verytired. I'd like to lie down a while. Which wasn't true, because he'dbeen lying down all the months of the way back.     She said, Of course. How stupid of me, expecting you to sit around andmake small talk and pick up just where you left off.     He nodded. But that was exactly what he wanted to do\u2014make small talkand pick up just where he'd left off. But they didn't expect it of him;they wouldn't let him; they felt he had changed too much.   <doc-sep> It didn't turn out that way. He was disappointed; but then again, he'dalso expected it. This entire first day at home had conditioned him toexpect nothing good. They went to the bowling alleys, and Phil soundedvery much the way he always had\u2014soft spoken and full of laughter andfull of jokes. He patted Edith on the head the way he always had, andclapped Hank on the shoulder (but not the way he always had\u2014so muchmore gently, almost remotely), and insisted they all drink more than wasgood for them as he always had. And for once, Hank was ready to go alongon the drinking. For once, he matched Phil shot for shot, beer for beer.     They didn't bowl very long. At ten o'clock they crossed the road toManfred's Tavern, where Phil and the girls ordered sandwiches and coffeeand Hank went right on drinking. Edith said something to him, but hemerely smiled and waved his hand and gulped another ounce of nirvana.     There was dancing to a juke box in Manfred's Tavern. He'd been theremany times before, and he was sure several of the couples recognizedhim. But except for a few abortive glances in his direction, it was asif he were a stranger in a city halfway around the world.     At midnight, he was still drinking. The others wanted to leave, but hesaid, I haven't danced with my girl Rhona. His tongue was thick, hismind was blurred, and yet he could read the strange expression on herface\u2014pretty Rhona, who'd always flirted with him, who'd made a ritualof flirting with him. Pretty Rhona, who now looked as if she were goingto be sick.     So let's rock, he said and stood up.     They were on the dance floor. He held her close, and hummed and chatted.And through the alcoholic haze saw she was a stiff-smiled, stiff-bodied,mechanical dancing doll.     The number finished; they walked back to the booth. Phil said,Beddy-bye time.     Hank said, First one dance with my loving wife.     He and Edith danced. He didn't hold her close as he had Rhona. He waitedfor her to come close on her own, and she did, and yet she didn't.Because while she put herself against him, there was something in herface\u2014no, in her eyes; it always showed in the eyes\u2014that made him knowshe was trying to be the old Edith and not succeeding. This time whenthe music ended, he was ready to go home.     They rode back to town along Route Nine, he and Edith in the rear ofPhil's car, Rhona driving because Phil had drunk just a little too much,Phil singing and telling an occasional bad joke, and somehow not his oldself. No one was his old self. No one would ever be his old self withthe First One.     They turned left, to take the short cut along Hallowed Hill Road, andPhil finished a story about a Martian and a Hollywood sex queen andlooked at his wife and then past her at the long, cast-iron fenceparalleling the road. Hey, he said, pointing, do you know why that'sthe most popular place on earth?     Rhona glanced to the left, and so did Hank and Edith. Rhona made alittle sound, and Edith seemed to stop breathing, but Phil went on awhile longer, not yet aware of his supposed      faux pas     .     You know why? he repeated, turning to the back seat, the laughterrumbling up from his chest. You know why, folks?     Rhona said, Did you notice Carl Braken and his wife at\u2014     Hank said, No, Phil, why is it the most popular place on earth?     Phil said, Because people are\u2014 And then he caught himself and wavedhis hand and muttered, I forgot the punch line.     Because people are dying to get in, Hank said, and looked through thewindow, past the iron fence, into the large cemetery at the fleetingtombstones.     The car was filled with horrified silence when there should have beennothing but laughter, or irritation at a too-old joke. Maybe you shouldlet me out right here, Hank said. I'm home\u2014or that's what everyoneseems to think. Maybe I should lie down in an open grave. Maybe thatwould satisfy people. Maybe that's the only way to act, like Dracula oranother monster from the movies.     Edith said, Oh, Hank, don't, don't!     The car raced along the road, crossed a macadam highway, went fourblocks and pulled to a stop. He didn't bother saying good night. Hedidn't wait for Edith. He just got out and walked up the flagstone pathand entered the house.   <doc-sep> Hank, Edith whispered from the guest room doorway, I'm so sorry\u2014     There's nothing to be sorry about. It's just a matter of time. It'llall work out in time.     Yes, she said quickly, that's it. I need a little time. We all need alittle time. Because it's so strange, Hank. Because it's so frightening.I should have told you that the moment you walked in. I think I've hurtyou terribly, we've all hurt you terribly, by trying to hide that we'refrightened.     I'm going to stay in the guest room, he said, for as long asnecessary. For good if need be.     How could it be for good? How, Hank?     That question was perhaps the first firm basis for hope he'd had sincereturning. And there was something else; what Carlisle had told him,even as Carlisle himself had reacted as all men did.     There are others coming, Edith. Eight that I know of in the tanks rightnow. My superior, Captain Davidson, who died at the same moment Idid\u2014seven months ago next Wednesday\u2014he's going to be next. He wassmashed up worse than I was, so it took a little longer, but he's almostready. And there'll be many more, Edith. The government is going to saveall they possibly can from now on. Every time a young and healthy manloses his life by accident, by violence, and his body can be recovered,he'll go into the tanks and they'll start the regenerative brain andorgan process\u2014the process that made it all possible. So people have toget used to us. And the old stories, the old terrors, the ugly oldsuperstitions have to die, because in time each place will have some ofus; because in time it'll be an ordinary thing.     Edith said, Yes, and I'm so grateful that you're here, Hank. Pleasebelieve that. Please be patient with me and Ralphie and\u2014 She paused.There's one question.     He knew what the question was. It had been the first asked him byeveryone from the president of the United States on down.     I saw nothing, he said. It was as if I slept those six and a halfmonths\u2014slept without dreaming.     She came to him and touched his face with her lips, and he wassatisfied.     Later, half asleep, he heard a dog howling, and remembered stories ofhow they announced death and the presence of monsters. He shivered andpulled the covers closer to him and luxuriated in being safe in his ownhome.     THE END  "

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in DOUBLECROSS?",
        "Summary_1": "Svan, a leader of members in the Council on Venus, plots to revolt against the Earthman delegations who are going to bring back the news of the habitability of Venus. Initially, he eavesdrops on the conversation between the Office of the Deck and the Executive Officer, which is about the untrustworthiness of Venusians, the descendants of the first generation of Earthman who migrated to Venus. Svan then initiates a revolting plan against the Earthman.\n\nBy showing this conversation to the group, Svan convinces the members to conduct his plan of not letting the Earthman ship go back to the Earth. In his plan, they will drive near the ship, five people will cause some chaos to attract the guards, and one person will put the delayed-action atomite bomb on the ship. They draw lots to determine when they decide who will put the bomb. However, Svan finds that no one admits to being the one, so he draws a cross on his slip, pretending to be the one who has terrible luck. \n\nAfter assigning the tasks to each person, Svan and his members drive to cross the border, where Svan brings down a native guard. When they separate to let one group cause the commotion and let Svan put the bomb, Svan takes out one bomb and leaves another one in the car. He knows that the bomb on the car will explode and attract the Earthman guards, which is unknown by the other members. He sees the car leave and turns to wait for the explosion. But the car comes back because the native guards found the rifle left by the murdered guard. The members in the car try to pick up Svan to flee from the search of the Earthman when Svan tries his best to run away. The explosion happens. Svan is on the verge of death when the Office of the Deck and the Executive Officer come to see him. They find a slip with a cross drawn on both sides in his hand.\n",
        "Summary_2": "The story follows two different groups of people. One of these is a crew of humans from earth that arrived on venus with the purpose of scouting and of negotiating with the venus natives to prepare for the arrival of more humans. These natives were in fact the descendants of the first group of humans that arrived on venus. Even though they are humans, their physical appearance has adapted to the venusian atmosphere. When the humans arrive, a group of natives called \u201cThe Council\u201d decided to bomb the ship of the humans. To decide the person who would sneak on the ship to plant the bomb, the natives marked a slip with an X and randomly picked slips. When no one came forward, the leader of the natives, Svan, decided to do it himself. Because the person with the X didn\u2019t come forward, Svan didn\u2019t trust his group anymore. Therefore, after the group sneaked past a guard, Svan decided to blow up both the car with his team and the ship. Svan and his team split up, and just as the car\u2019s bomb was going to explode, they returned to Svan because they were caught. This led to all of them getting blown up. When the crew of the human ship found the bodies, they saw that Svan had in fact a slip with X\u2019s on both sides. ",
        "Summary_3": "Approximately 4-5 generations ago the first expedition landed on Venus, the descendants of these explorers are called the native Venusians. A delegation from Earth just arrived on Venus, and everyone wonders what is going to happen next now that people know Venus is habitable. \n\nThe Executive Officer - the Exec - and the Officer of the Deck - Lowry -  talk in the Earth-ship\u2019s open lock. The Exec doubts the natives\u2019 friendliness and does not consider them human anymore. Lowry tries to explain that their appearance doesn't affect their amiability. He also tells the Exec that some natives are afraid of the possible wave of immigration from Earth because it can ruin their regular way of life, and some underground group is spreading the word that the consequences will be even worse. Lowry adds that it\u2019s possible but is interrupted by a loud voice notifying them about a spy ray focused on their lock. The Exec alerts their guards and the delegation. \n\nThe ray was used by Svan and five other representatives of the Council - an underground organization fighting against any partnerships with humans. They hear Lowry\u2019s words, and Svan becomes infuriated. He persuades everyone, including Ingra who initially hesitates, that they can\u2019t let the delegation come back to Earth. Svan plans to plant a bomb in the ship, it will detonate on the delegation\u2019s way back, killing everyone. Others are uncertain, so Svan decides to randomly pick the one who will plant the bomb. When he sees that his slip is blank, he thinks that someone is afraid to admit that they had the slip with the cross. So Svan quickly marks his slip and pretends to be the one who was initially chosen. He explains the specifics of their plan: while he will be near the ship, the others will fake a car accident to draw some guards which will allow Svan to get in. Their car is stopped by the State Guard who realizes that Svan is the reason the state of danger was declared. Svan kills the guard and hides the body. He takes one bomb and leaves another one in the car, hoping that the explosion will draw enough attention and punish the five people he now considers fearful traitors. Before the car takes off, Ingra kisses Svan. He waits near the ship fumbling with his slip and wondering who the coward was. Suddenly, he hears the car is driving back. Ingra screams that they were chased, but got away and came back for Svan. He starts running from the car, realizing the bomb inside it is supposed to detonate. The explosion wave knocks him out. Later, he wakes up near a surgeon, who calmly declares that Svan will soon die from the wounds, and shocked Lowry. The surgeon is confused by a paper slip with a cross marked on both sides he found clenched in Svan\u2019s hand. ",
        "Summary_4": "In James Mac Creigh's short story Doublecross, the actions revolve around two opposing sides of the storyline of the planet Venus. The Officer of the Deck on the Earth spaceship reports to The Executive Officer about a pathetic underground group of dissidents who spread the rumor that immigrants will kill the indigenous Venusians, descendants of the first expedition. During their arrogant conversation, the ship receives news of an attempted attack.\n\tAn underground organization controlled by an indigenous Venusian, Svan, overhears the ship's delegation's conversation about their contemptuous attitude towards the natives. Svan is determined not to let the Earth colonizers leave Venus and destroy the ship before its departure. The council informs the Venusians that only they had the right to decide the course of action. The underground organization agrees that if the Earth ship returned, it would mean disaster for Venus. Therefore, it should not return. Svan plans to sneak aboard at night and attach the Atomit magnetic time bomb to the ship. However, the commander faces the problem of betrayal, indecision, and cowardice among his renegade team. Svan suggests that the operation draws lots to decide who will be honored to perform the most critical part of the plan - the attachment of the bomb. He draws a small cross on one of the random papers in the bowl for the draw. After distributing the pieces of paper, Svan realizes that none of the team members agrees to reveal the brave one, fulfilling his duty to the people of Venus. The current political situation scares the six conspirators to attempt their expedition. After a fight with the guard, Svan and his team successfully make their way to the ship, but a second bomb turns out to be in Svan's possession and put into the car of his subordinates. Not only does Svan plan to explode the colonizers' ship, but also to take out revenge on his crew. As soon as he thinks of killing two birds with one stone: the Earth colonizers and five traitors, one of the team members Ingra, kisses Svan before going on board and wishes him good luck. Svan is thrown into a shudder, realizing that he is making a fatal mistake. As a result of his confusion, both bombs explode: in his pocket and the car of his accomplices. \nDying on the table of an Earth surgeon on the ship he was trying to destroy, Svan overhears a conversation between the Watch assistant Lowry and the doctor. While examining his clothes, he finds a piece of paper with two marked crosses as a symbol that Svan framed himself because of his fiery and distrustful temper.",

Each ofthese men carried one or more, plainly visible. But he was thinking ofthe girl's spasticizer\u2014a paralyzing weapon. He took a hair-brainedchance, jerked the spasticizer from the girl's holster and yelled atQueazy. Queazy got the idea, urged his immense body into motion. Hehurled straight at Billy Saylor, lifted him straight off the asteroidand threw him away, into space. He yelled with triumph.     At the same time, the spasticizer Bob held was shot cleanly out of hishand by Wally Saylor. Bob roared, started toward Wally Saylor, knockedthe smoking gun from his hand with a sweeping arm. Then somethingcrushing seemed to hit him in the stomach, grabbing at his solarplexus. He doubled up, gurgling with agony. He fell over on his back,and his boots were wrenched loose from their magnetic grip. Vaguely,before the flickering points of light in his brain subsided to completedarkness, he heard the girl's scream of rage\u2014then a scream of pain.     What had happened to Queazy he didn't know. He felt so horribly sick,he didn't care. Then\u2014lights out.  "

She initially objects to Svan\u2019s plan, a plan to destroy the Earthman ship with an atomite bomb, but when she sees other people agree with Svan, who is the leader of the revolting group, she takes back her objection. She hands the bowl to Svan, letting him put six slips inside to determine their futures, which is that one of them will put the bomb on the ship. She is also the first one to pick a slip. \n\nWhen the conspirators conduct their plans, she is the one who drives the car. She listens to Svan whenever he orders her to do something, and she kisses him when they separate to conduct different missions. After leaving Svan alone, she drives the car in the opposite direction to Svan, trying to cause a commotion. However, the Earthman guards are searching for them due to the discovery of the left rifle from the murdered Venusian, the native guard Svan killed.

        "Article": "Most of the cousins gasped as the truth began to percolate through.     I knew from the very beginning, Conrad finished, that I didn'thave to do anything at all. I just had to wait and you would destroyyourselves.     I don't understand, Bartholomew protested, searching the faces of thecousins closest to him. What does he mean, we have never existed?We're here, aren't we? What\u2014     Shut up! Raymond snapped. He turned on Martin. You don't seemsurprised.     The old man grinned. I'm not. I figured it all out years ago.     At first, he had wondered what he should do. Would it be better tothrow them into a futile panic by telling them or to do nothing? Hehad decided on the latter; that was the role they had assigned him\u2014towatch and wait and keep out of things\u2014and that was the role he wouldplay.     You knew all the time and you didn't tell us! Raymond spluttered.After we'd been so good to you, making a gentleman out of you insteadof a criminal.... That's right, he snarled, a criminal! An alcoholic,a thief, a derelict! How do you like that?     Sounds like a rich, full life, Martin said wistfully.     What an exciting existence they must have done him out of! But then, hecouldn't help thinking, he\u2014he and Conrad together, of course\u2014had donethem out of      any     kind of existence. It wasn't his responsibility,though; he had done nothing but let matters take whatever course wasdestined for them. If only he could be sure that it was the bettercourse, perhaps he wouldn't feel that nagging sense of guilt insidehim. Strange\u2014where, in his hermetic life, could he possibly havedeveloped such a queer thing as a conscience?     Then we've wasted all this time, Ninian sobbed, all this energy, allthis money, for nothing!     But you were nothing to begin with, Martin told them. And then,after a pause, he added, I only wish I could be sure there had beensome purpose to this.     He didn't know whether it was approaching death that dimmed his sight,or whether the frightened crowd that pressed around him was growingshadowy.     I wish I could feel that some good had been done in letting you bewiped out of existence, he went on voicing his thoughts. But I knowthat the same thing that happened to your worlds and my world willhappen all over again. To other people, in other times, but again. It'sbound to happen. There isn't any hope for humanity.     One man couldn't really change the course of human history, he toldhimself. Two men, that was\u2014one real, one a shadow.     Conrad came close to the old man's bed. He was almost transparent.     No, he said, there is hope. They didn't know the time transmitterworks two ways. I used it for going into the past only once\u2014just thisonce. But I've gone into the future with it many times. And\u2014 hepressed Martin's hand\u2014believe me, what I did\u2014what      we     did, you andI\u2014serves a purpose. It will change things for the better. Everythingis going to be all right.   <doc-sep> Svan hesitated only a fraction of a second after the girl turned thelights out and stopped the car. Then he reached in the compartmentunder the seat. If he took a little longer than seemed necessary to getthe atomite bomb out of the compartment, none of the others noticed.Certainly it did not occur to them that there had been      two     bombs inthe compartment, though Svan's hand emerged with only one.     He got out of the car, holding the sphere. This will do for me, hesaid. They won't be expecting anyone to come from behind the ship\u2014wewere wise to circle around. Now, you know what you must do?     Ingra nodded, while the others remained mute. We must circle backagain, she parroted. We are to wait five minutes, then drive the carinto the swamp. We will create a commotion, attract the guards.     Svan, listening, thought:      It's not much of a plan. The guards wouldnot be drawn away. I am glad I can't trust these five any more. Ifthey must be destroyed, it is good that their destruction will serve apurpose.       Aloud, he said, You understand. If I get through, I will return to thecity on foot. No one will suspect anything if I am not caught, becausethe bomb will not explode until the ship is far out in space. Remember,you are in no danger from the guards.       From the guards     , his mind echoed. He smiled. At least, they wouldfeel no pain, never know what happened. With the amount of atomite inthat bomb in the compartment, they would merely be obliterated in aground-shaking crash.     Abruptly he swallowed, reminded of the bomb that was silently countingoff the seconds. Go ahead, he ordered. I will wait here.     Svan. The girl, Ingra, leaned over to him. Impulsively she reachedfor him, kissed him. Good luck to you, Svan, she said.     Good luck, repeated the others. Then silently the electric motor ofthe car took hold. Skilfully the girl backed it up, turned it around,sent it lumbering back down the road. Only after she had traveled a fewhundred feet by the feel of the road did she turn the lights on again.     Svan looked after them. The kiss had surprised him. What did it mean?Was it an error that the girl should die with the others?     There was an instant of doubt in his steel-shackled mind, then it wasdriven away. Perhaps she was loyal, yet certainly she was weak. Andsince he could not know which was the one who had received the markedslip, and feared to admit it, it was better they all should die.     He advanced along the midnight road to where the ground rose and thejungle plants thinned out. Ahead, on an elevation, were the rain-dimmedlights of the Earth-ship, set down in the center of a clearing made byits own fierce rockets. Svan's mist-trained eyes spotted the circlingfigures of sentries, and knew that these would be the ship's own.They would not be as easily overcome as the natives, not with thoseslim-shafted blasters they carried. Only deceit could get him to theside of the ship.     Svan settled himself at the side of the road, waiting for his chance.He had perhaps three minutes to wait; he reckoned. His fingers wentabsently to the pouch in his wide belt, closed on the slip of paper. Heturned it over without looking at it, wondering who had drawn the firstcross, and been a coward. Ingra? One of the men?   <doc-sep> The six conspirators in Svan's old ground car moved slowly along themain street of the native town. Two Earth-ship sailors, unarmed exceptfor deceptively flimsy-looking pistols at their hips, stood before theentrance to the town's Hall of Justice.     Good, said Svan, observing them. The delegation is still here. Wehave ample time.     He half turned in the broad front seat next to the driver, searchingthe faces of the others in the car. Which was the coward? he wondered.Ingra? Her aunt? One of the men?     The right answer leaped up at him.      They all are     , he thought.      Not oneof them understands what this means. They're afraid.       He clamped his lips. Go faster, Ingra, he ordered the girl who wasdriving. Let's get this done with.     She looked at him, and he was surprised to find compassion in hereyes. Silently she nodded, advanced the fuel-handle so that the clumsycar jolted a trace more rapidly over the corduroy road. It was quitedark now. The car's driving light flared yellowishly in front of them,illuminating the narrow road and the pale, distorted vegetation of thejungle that surrounded them. Svan noticed it was raining a little. Thepresent shower would deepen and intensify until midnight, then fall offagain, to halt before morning. But before then they would be done.     A proton-bolt lanced across the road in front of them. In the silencethat followed its thunderous crash, a man's voice bellowed: Halt!     The girl, Ingra, gasped something indistinguishable, slammed on thebrakes. A Venusian in the trappings of the State Guard advanced on themfrom the side of the road, proton-rifle held ready to fire again.     Where are you going? he growled.     Svan spoke up. We want to look at the Earth-ship, he said. He openedthe door beside him and stepped out, careless of the drizzle. We heardit was leaving tonight, he continued, and we have not seen it. Isthat not permitted?     The guard shook his head sourly. No one is allowed near the ship. Theorder was just issued. It is thought there is danger.     Svan stepped closer, his teeth bared in what passed for a smile. Itis urgent, he purred. His right hand flashed across his chest in acomplicated gesture. Do you understand?     Confusion furrowed the guard's hairless brows, then was replaced bya sudden flare of understanding\u2014and fear. The Council! he roared.By heaven, yes, I understand! You are the swine that caused this\u2014He strove instinctively to bring the clumsy rifle up, but Svan wasfaster. His gamble had failed; there was only one course remaining.He hurled his gross white bulk at the guard, bowled him over againstthe splintery logs of the road. The proton-rifle went flying, and Svansavagely tore at the throat of the guard. Knees, elbows and claw-likenails\u2014Svan battered at the astonished man with every ounce of strengthin his body. The guard was as big as Svan, but Svan had the initialadvantage ... and it was only a matter of seconds before the guardlay unconscious, his skull a mass of gore at the back where Svan hadruthlessly pounded it against the road.        Svan grunted as his fingers constricted brutally.        Svan rose, panting, stared around. No one else was in sight, save thepetrified five and the ground car. Svan glared at them contemptuously,then reached down and heaved on the senseless body of the guard. Overthe shoulder of the road the body went, onto the damp swampland of thejungle. Even while Svan watched the body began to sink. There would beno trace.     Svan strode back to the car. Hurry up, he gasped to the girl. Nowthere is danger for all of us, if they discover he is missing. And keepa watch for other guards.  "

Still, he also believes that there may be some fights between Earthmen and Venusians when Earthmen land more colonists on Venus.\n\nWhen Svan, the leader of a rebellious group, and his members drive the car coming towards the ship to plant the bomb, Lowry sees the car light. He is talking to the Executive Officer by then about this secret group called the Council against the Earthman colonies.

        "Summary_3": "Lowry is the Officer of the Deck. At the beginning, he talks to the Executive Officer and tries to convince him that the natives are friendly. Lowry also mentions that they are afraid of a possible wave of immigration from Earth which can disrupt their life processes or significantly worsen their quality of life, as some underground group says. He admits that this outcome is possible but gets interrupted by a signal stating that a spy ray is focused on the ship\u2019s main lock - someone heard their conversation.

Lowry obeys all the orders of his commander but is skeptical of The Exec\u2019s point of view about the Venusians. The Executive articulates with intensity that Venusians are less of people than humans due to their transformation following Venus climate over the past generations. He believes that the natives have lost their right to being considered equal to humans after their ancestors\u2019 acclimatization to their new planet. Lowry emphasizes that the natives are not so naive, having a potential fear of colonizers from Earth. Immediately after his remark, an alarm lights up on the ship that the Earthlings are under the scope of a spy ray, proving Lowry\u2019s point about the natives\u2019 naivete.

The Executive Officer was moodily smoking a cigarette in the openlock, staring out over the dank Venusian terrain at the native town. Heturned.     Everything shipshape, I take it! he commented.     The OD nodded. I'll have a blank log if this keeps up, he said.Every man accounted for except the delegation, cargo stowed, driversready to lift as soon as they come back.     The Exec tossed away his cigarette.       If     they come back.     Is there any question?     The Exec shrugged. I don't know, Lowry, he said. This is a funnyplace. I don't trust the natives.     Lowry lifted his eyebrows. Oh? But after all, they're human beings,just like us\u2014     Not any more. Four or five generations ago they were. Lord, they don'teven look human any more. Those white, flabby skins\u2014I don't like them.     Acclimation, Lowry said scientifically. They had to acclimatethemselves to Venus's climate. They're friendly enough.     The Exec shrugged again. He stared at the wooden shacks that were theoutskirts of the native city, dimly visible through the ever-presentVenusian mist. The native guard of honor, posted a hundred yards fromthe Earth-ship, stood stolidly at attention with their old-fashionedproton-rifles slung over their backs. A few natives were gazingwonderingly at the great ship, but made no move to pass the line ofguards.     Of course, Lowry said suddenly, there's a minority who are afraidof us. I was in town yesterday, and I talked with some of the natives.They think there will be hordes of immigrants from Earth, now that weknow Venus is habitable. And there's some sort of a paltry undergroundgroup that is spreading the word that the immigrants will drive thenative Venusians\u2014the descendants of the first expedition, thatis\u2014right down into the mud.

Instrumentsreports a spy ray focused on the main lock!     Lowry, interrupted in the middle of a word, jerked his head back andstared unbelievingly at the tell-tale next to the annunciator. Sureenough, it was glowing red\u2014might have been glowing for minutes. Hesnatched at the hand-phone dangling from the wall, shouted into it.Set up a screen! Notify the delegation! Alert a landing party! Buteven while he was giving orders, the warning light flickered suddenlyand went out. Stricken, Lowry turned to the Exec.     The Executive Officer nodded gloomily. He said, You see!   <doc-sep> Venus has no moon, and no star can shine through its vast cloud layer.Ensign Lowry, staring anxiously out through the astro-dome in the bowof the Earth-ship, cursed the blackness.     Can't see a thing, he complained to the Exec, steadily writing awayat the computer's table. Look\u2014are those lights over there?     The Exec looked up wearily. He shrugged. Probably the guards. Ofcourse, you can't tell. Might be a raiding party.     Lowry, stung, looked to see if the Exec was smiling, but found noanswer in his stolid face. Don't joke about it, he said. Supposesomething happens to the delegation?     Then we're in the soup, the Exec said philosophically. I told youthe natives were dangerous. Spy-rays! They've been prohibited for thelast three hundred years.     It isn't all the natives, Lowry said. Look how they've doubled theguard around us. The administration is co-operating every way theyknow how. You heard the delegation's report on the intercom. It's thissecret group they call the Council.     And how do you know the guards themselves don't belong to it? theExec retorted. They're all the same to me.... Look, your light's goneout now. Must have been the guard. They're on the wrong side to becoming from the town, anyhow....   <doc-sep> He became abruptly conscious of a commotion behind him. A ground carwas racing along the road. He spun around and was caught in the glareof its blinding driving-light, as it bumped to a slithering stop.     Paralyzed, he heard the girl's voice. Svan! They're coming! They foundthe guard's rifle, and they're looking for us! Thirty Earthmen, Svan,with those frightful guns. They fired at us, but we got away and camefor you. We must flee!     He stared unseeingly at the light. Go away! he croaked unbelievingly.Then his muscles jerked into action. The time was almost up\u2014the bombin the car\u2014     Go away! he shrieked, and turned to run. His fists clenched andswinging at his side, he made a dozen floundering steps beforesomething immense pounded at him from behind. He felt himself liftedfrom the road, sailing, swooping, dropping with annihilating forceonto the hard, charred earth of the clearing. Only then did he hear thesound of the explosion, and as the immense echoes died away he began tofeel the pain seeping into him from his hideously racked body....     The Flight Surgeon rose from beside him. He's still alive, he saidcallously to Lowry, who had just come up. It won't last long, though.What've you got there?     Lowry, a bewildered expression on his beardless face, held out the twohalves of a metallic sphere. Dangling ends of wires showed where aconnection had been broken. He had a bomb, he said. A magnetic-type,delayed-action atomite bomb. There must have been another in the car,and it went off. They\u2014they were planning to bomb us.     Amazing, the surgeon said dryly. Well, they won't do any bombingnow.     Lowry was staring at the huddled, mutilated form of Svan. He shuddered.The surgeon, seeing the shudder, grasped his shoulder.     Better them than us, he said. It's poetic justice if I ever saw it.They had it coming.... He paused thoughtfully, staring at a piece ofpaper between his fingers. This is the only part I don't get, he said.     What's that? Lowry craned his neck. A piece of paper with a cross onit? What about it?     The surgeon shrugged. He had it clenched in his hand, he said. Hadthe devil of a time getting it loose from him. He turned it overslowly, displayed the other side. Now what in the world would he bedoing carrying a scrap of paper with a cross marked on both sides?   "

There is a secret Venusian group called the Council, where the members fear that the future Earthmen colonies will harm them and deprive them of their living spaces.

The planet also has a swamp, which is where the natives were supposed to drop their car after dropping off Svan. The planet doesn\u2019t have a moon, which allows for perfect darkness for the natives to attack the ship. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The story is set in the future. All characters are on Venus, where a delegation from Earth recently landed. At the beginning, two officers talk in the ship\u2019s lock. The Exec claims that the Venusians - the descendants of the first expedition that came here approximately a century ago - are not particularly friendly or fully human. Lowry - the Officer of the Deck - explains that many of them are scared of what immigrants from Earth can do with them, admitting that a negative outcome is possible. His speech is interrupted by a voice that tells them a spy ray is focused on the main lock. They are being listened to by six members of an underground group called the Council, who decide to plant a bomb in the ship to kill the delegation on its way back. They drive along the main street of the native town and eventually get stopped by a State Guard. Svan kills him, and they continue driving. At the same time, the two officers are at the bow of the ship, discussing the situation. Soon, when Ingra and the others drive off and then quickly come back for Svan, the car explodes. Its five passengers die, and Svan loses consciousness. The story ends with the surgeon examining Svan\u2019s wounds that turn out to be lethal. He also shows Lowry, who just deactivated the second bomb he had taken from Svan, a slip with two crosses, which he finds puzzling.  ",
        "Summary_4": "The story unfolds on Venus after humans settled on the planet many generations ago. As a result, these humans have transformed to fit Venus' volatile climate, changing their appearance. The setting opens on the Earthling colonizer spaceship. One may recognize the wooden shacks on the town's outskirts visible from the deck. While dusk was gathering and the underground organization was preparing for an attack, fog covered the swampy area of Venus. Rows of guards lined up around the Earth ship. They were keeping the machine safe from a hundred-yard distance away from it, scaring local onlookers with old-fashioned rifles, who came to be surprised by the ship. As soon as dusk deepened and a misty haze fell on the planet, six oppositionists moved towards the anticipated battle. They were illuminating the narrow and pale road with the yellowish headlights of the trailer. They noticed the twisted vegetation of the surrounding jungle. As they moved, the rain intensified, but the downpour was supposed to subside before midnight. The rain was still drizzling over the marshy area, but this did not prevent Svan from putting his plan into action despite Ingra's persuasions to drown the car in the swamp and create a commotion. As Svan headed toward the midnight road, the ground rose, and the jungle thinned. Looking into the distance, the bright lights of an Earth ship flickered in the rainclouds, landing in the center of a clearing created by its ferocious rockets. Seeing the whirling figures of the sentries, Svan realized they were the ship's guards. Despite their thin-shaft blasters, they wouldn't be as easy to defeat as the natives. He could only board by deception.",

His blackeyes were fastened hungrily on the lump of yellow metal on the table.He needed no explanation to tell him what it was, and it seemed to methat his very soul reached out for the stuff, so sharp and clear wasthe meaning of the expression on his heavy face.     Mister Spinelli! I snapped, In the future knock before entering myquarters!     Reluctantly his eyes left the lump of gold and met mine. From thederelict, Captain? There was an imperceptible pause between the lasttwo words.     I ignored his question and made a mental note to keep a close hand onthe rein with him. Spinelli was big and dangerous.     Speak your piece, Mister, I ordered sharply.     Mister Cohn reports the derelict ready to take aboard the prizecrew ... sir, he said slowly. I'd like to volunteer for that detail.     I might have let him go under ordinary circumstances, for he was afirst class spaceman and the handling of a jury-rigged hulk wouldneed good men. But the gold-hunger I had seen in his eyes warned meto beware. I shook my head. You will stay on board the Maid with me,Spinelli. Cohn and Zaleski will handle the starship.     Stark suspicion leaped into his eyes. I could see the wheels turningslowly in his mind. Somehow, he was thinking, I was planning to cheathim of his rightful share of the derelict treasure ship.     We will say nothing to the rest of the crew about the gold, MisterSpinelli, I said deliberately, Or you'll go to Callisto in irons. Isthat clear?     Aye, sir, murmured Spinelli. The black expression had left his faceand there was a faintly scornful smile playing about his mouth as heturned away. I began wondering then what he had in mind. It wasn't likehim to let it go at that.     Suddenly I became conscious of being very tired. My mind wasn'tfunctioning quite clearly. And my arm and hand ached painfully. Irubbed the fingers to get some life back into them, still wonderingabout Spinelli.     Spinelli talked. I saw him murmuring something to big Zaleski, andafter that there was tension in the air. Distrust.     For a few moments I pondered the advisability of making good my threatto clap Spinelli into irons, but I decided against it. In the firstplace I couldn't prove he had told Zaleski about the gold and in thesecond place I needed Spinelli to help run the Maid.     I felt that the Third Officer and Zaleski were planning something, andI was just as sure that Spinelli was watching Zaleski to see to it thatthere was no double-cross.     I figured that I could handle the Third Officer alone so I assigned therest, Marvin and Chelly, to accompany Cohn and Zaleski onto the hulk.That way Zaleski would be outnumbered if he tried to skip with thetreasure ship. But, of course, I couldn't risk telling them that theywere to be handling a vessel practically made of gold.     I was in agony. I didn't want to let anyone get out of my sight withthat starship, and at the same time I couldn't leave the Maid. FinallyI had to let Cohn take command of the prize crew, but not before I hadset the radar finder on the Maid's prow squarely on the derelict.   <doc-sep>   DOUBLECROSS     by JAMES Mac CREIGH     Revolt was brewing on Venus, led by the     descendant of the first Earthmen to     land. Svan was the leader making the final     plans\u2014plotting them a bit too well.     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Planet Stories Winter 1944.

The Executive Officer was moodily smoking a cigarette in the openlock, staring out over the dank Venusian terrain at the native town. Heturned.     Everything shipshape, I take it! he commented.     The OD nodded. I'll have a blank log if this keeps up, he said.Every man accounted for except the delegation, cargo stowed, driversready to lift as soon as they come back.     The Exec tossed away his cigarette.       If     they come back.     Is there any question?     The Exec shrugged. I don't know, Lowry, he said. This is a funnyplace. I don't trust the natives.     Lowry lifted his eyebrows. Oh? But after all, they're human beings,just like us\u2014     Not any more. Four or five generations ago they were. Lord, they don'teven look human any more. Those white, flabby skins\u2014I don't like them.     Acclimation, Lowry said scientifically. They had to acclimatethemselves to Venus's climate. They're friendly enough.     The Exec shrugged again. He stared at the wooden shacks that were theoutskirts of the native city, dimly visible through the ever-presentVenusian mist. The native guard of honor, posted a hundred yards fromthe Earth-ship, stood stolidly at attention with their old-fashionedproton-rifles slung over their backs. A few natives were gazingwonderingly at the great ship, but made no move to pass the line ofguards.     Of course, Lowry said suddenly, there's a minority who are afraidof us. I was in town yesterday, and I talked with some of the natives.They think there will be hordes of immigrants from Earth, now that weknow Venus is habitable. And there's some sort of a paltry undergroundgroup that is spreading the word that the immigrants will drive thenative Venusians\u2014the descendants of the first expedition, thatis\u2014right down into the mud. Well\u2014 he laughed\u2014maybe they will.After all, the fittest survive. That's a basic law of\u2014     The annunciator over the open lock clanged vigorously, and a metallicvoice rasped: Officer of the Deck! Post Number One! Instrumentsreports a spy ray focused on the main lock!     Lowry, interrupted in the middle of a word, jerked his head back andstared unbelievingly at the tell-tale next to the annunciator. Sureenough, it was glowing red\u2014might have been glowing for minutes. Hesnatched at the hand-phone dangling from the wall, shouted into it.Set up a screen! Notify the delegation! Alert a landing party! Buteven while he was giving orders, the warning light flickered suddenlyand went out. Stricken, Lowry turned to the Exec.     The Executive Officer nodded gloomily. He said, You see!   <doc-sep> Bob Parker didn't answer. The big ship had landed, and little bluesparks crackled between the hull and the asteroid as the magneticclamps took hold. A few seconds later, the airlocks swung down, andfive men let themselves down to the asteroid's surface and stoodsurveying the three who faced them.     The two men in the lead stood with their hands on their hips; theirdarkish, twin faces were grinning broadly.     A pleasure, drawled Wally Saylor, looking at the girl. What do youthink of this situation Billy?     It's obvious, drawled Billy Saylor, rocking back and forth on hisheels, that Bob Parker and company have double-crossed us. We'll haveto take steps.     The three men behind the Saylor twins broke into rough, chucklinglaughter.     Bob Parker's gorge rose. Scram, he said coldly. We've got anethergram direct from Andrew S. Burnside ordering this asteroid.     So have we, Wally Saylor smiled\u2014and his smile remained fixed,dangerous. He started moving forward, and the three men in back cameabreast, forming a semi-circle which slowly closed in. Bob Parker gaveback a step, as he saw their intentions.     We got here first, he snapped harshly. Try any funny stuff and we'llreport you to the Interplanetary Commission!     It was Bob Parker's misfortune that he didn't carry a weapon. Each ofthese men carried one or more, plainly visible. But he was thinking ofthe girl's spasticizer\u2014a paralyzing weapon. He took a hair-brainedchance, jerked the spasticizer from the girl's holster and yelled atQueazy. Queazy got the idea, urged his immense body into motion. Hehurled straight at Billy Saylor, lifted him straight off the asteroidand threw him away, into space. He yelled with triumph.     At the same time, the spasticizer Bob held was shot cleanly out of hishand by Wally Saylor. Bob roared, started toward Wally Saylor, knockedthe smoking gun from his hand with a sweeping arm. Then somethingcrushing seemed to hit him in the stomach, grabbing at his solarplexus. He doubled up, gurgling with agony. He fell over on his back,and his boots were wrenched loose from their magnetic grip. Vaguely,before the flickering points of light in his brain subsided to completedarkness, he heard the girl's scream of rage\u2014then a scream of pain.     What had happened to Queazy he didn't know. He felt so horribly sick,he didn't care. Then\u2014lights out.  "

        "Query": "What significance does the cross on the slip hold in DOUBLECROSS?",
        "Summary_1": "The slip with a cross is used to determine who will be the one to plant the bomb on the ship when Svan, the leader of a rebellious group, assign tasks to each person. However, during the process of drawing lots, when the person who gets the slip with a cross on it should reveal oneself to accept the task, no one admits because Svan, who receives the slip, didn\u2019t see the cross on the other side of the paper. As a result, he mistakenly thinks that the person who received the slip is a coward that does not want to do the task, so he secretly marks another cross on his paper and accepts the mission.\n\nThis misunderstanding of no one accepting the task drives Svan to suspect all the other members as disloyal and cowardly, leading him to decide to put one bomb on the car. He is so furious that he wants them to die for their disloyalty and cowardice while serving as an attraction to the guards. However, when the plan does not go well, and the members come back to seek him, he unavoidably suffers from his deed. The paper is later found to have a cross on both sides, which forms an irony of Svan's behaviors. Ironically, Svan\u2019s suspicion of other people causes their death when he is the real traitor.",
        "Summary_2": "The slip with the cross is very important for the development of the story. When the natives decide to attack the ship, they need one person to get inside and plant the bomb. To choose, they write an X on one of the slips and take turns choosing slips, and the person with the X slip would go. When no one goes forward, Svan volunteers by writing an X on his blank paper, but realizes that there is a coward in the team. This leads to Svan plotting to doublecross his team, and when his plan backfires they all end up dying. When the humans discover the bodies, it is revealed that Svan had a paper with an X on both sides, showing that he was in fact double crossing his team for no reason. ",
        "Summary_3": "Svan decides to choose who will plant a bomb in the Earth-ship by taking out paper slips, one of them marked with a cross. When no one admits that their slip is not blank and Svan doesn\u2019t see a cross on his piece of paper, he becomes angry. He thinks that there might be a coward on the team, and eventually, he decides that everyone on the team is fearful and useless. He decides to kill them and later leaves another bomb in a seat compartment of the car when they drive off. When he waits for the car to explode and distract the ship\u2019s guards, he tries to understand who could lie about the slip. When Ingra and others drive back to get Svan and flee, the car explodes, killing the passengers and wounding him. He wakes up near one of the ship\u2019s officers - Lowry - who just deactivated the second bomb and a surgeon who wonders why Svan would be holding a slip with a cross on both sides. Nobody from the team lied to him, and his suspicion ruined the operation. ",
        "Summary_4": "he slip with the cross represents Svan's anticipation and feelings about his team and the cause they are fighting for together. His trust and strength stem from teamwork. Developing a plan, he hopes for cooperation and courage from each participant. Being the leader, he allows fate to make a choice rather than himself. He puts himself on the same level as his teammates, thus not shifting the responsibility and burden onto someone specific. Not finding a small cross, he is convinced of the idea of being surrounded by traitors and cowards who cannot complete his cunning operation. Enraged, he sees no better solution than revenge. He feels resentment and betrayal, yet his feelings are crossed out with a kiss for good luck from Ingra. After discovering the lost cross, he tries to correct his quick judgment, but it turns out that it's too late. The lost slip symbolizes all the wrong acts of misjudgments in human nature that lead to an insolvable disaster. ",
        "Article": "Svan hesitated only a fraction of a second after the girl turned thelights out and stopped the car. Then he reached in the compartmentunder the seat. If he took a little longer than seemed necessary to getthe atomite bomb out of the compartment, none of the others noticed.Certainly it did not occur to them that there had been      two     bombs inthe compartment, though Svan's hand emerged with only one.     He got out of the car, holding the sphere. This will do for me, hesaid. They won't be expecting anyone to come from behind the ship\u2014wewere wise to circle around. Now, you know what you must do?     Ingra nodded, while the others remained mute. We must circle backagain, she parroted. We are to wait five minutes, then drive the carinto the swamp. We will create a commotion, attract the guards.     Svan, listening, thought:      It's not much of a plan. The guards wouldnot be drawn away. I am glad I can't trust these five any more. Ifthey must be destroyed, it is good that their destruction will serve apurpose.       Aloud, he said, You understand. If I get through, I will return to thecity on foot. No one will suspect anything if I am not caught, becausethe bomb will not explode until the ship is far out in space. Remember,you are in no danger from the guards.       From the guards     , his mind echoed. He smiled. At least, they wouldfeel no pain, never know what happened. With the amount of atomite inthat bomb in the compartment, they would merely be obliterated in aground-shaking crash.     Abruptly he swallowed, reminded of the bomb that was silently countingoff the seconds. Go ahead, he ordered. I will wait here.     Svan. The girl, Ingra, leaned over to him. Impulsively she reachedfor him, kissed him. Good luck to you, Svan, she said.     Good luck, repeated the others. Then silently the electric motor ofthe car took hold. Skilfully the girl backed it up, turned it around,sent it lumbering back down the road. Only after she had traveled a fewhundred feet by the feel of the road did she turn the lights on again.     Svan looked after them. The kiss had surprised him. What did it mean?Was it an error that the girl should die with the others?     There was an instant of doubt in his steel-shackled mind, then it wasdriven away. Perhaps she was loyal, yet certainly she was weak. Andsince he could not know which was the one who had received the markedslip, and feared to admit it, it was better they all should die.     He advanced along the midnight road to where the ground rose and thejungle plants thinned out. Ahead, on an elevation, were the rain-dimmedlights of the Earth-ship, set down in the center of a clearing made byits own fierce rockets. Svan's mist-trained eyes spotted the circlingfigures of sentries, and knew that these would be the ship's own.They would not be as easily overcome as the natives, not with thoseslim-shafted blasters they carried. Only deceit could get him to theside of the ship.     Svan settled himself at the side of the road, waiting for his chance.He had perhaps three minutes to wait; he reckoned. His fingers wentabsently to the pouch in his wide belt, closed on the slip of paper. Heturned it over without looking at it, wondering who had drawn the firstcross, and been a coward. Ingra? One of the men?   <doc-sep> Bob Parker didn't answer. The big ship had landed, and little bluesparks crackled between the hull and the asteroid as the magneticclamps took hold.

He strodeunder a sign reading      Public Youth Center No. 947     and walked casuallyto the reception desk, where a thin man with sergeant's stripes and apansy haircut looked out of a pile of paperwork.     Where you think you're going, my pretty lad?     Wayne grinned down. Higher I hope than a typewriter jockey.     Well, the sergeant said. How tough we are this evening. You have apass, killer?     Wayne Seton. Draft call.     Oh. The sergeant checked his name off a roster and nodded. He wroteon a slip of paper, handed the pass to Wayne. Go to the Armory andcheck out whatever your lusting little heart desires. Then report toCaptain Jack, room 307.     Thanks, sarge dear, Wayne said and took the elevator up to the Armory.     A tired fat corporal with a naked head blinked up at tall Wayne.Finally he said, So make up your mind, bud. Think you're the only kidbreaking out tonight?     Hold your teeth, pop, Wayne said, coolly and slowly lighting acigarette. I've decided.     The corporal's little eyes studied Wayne with malicious amusement.Take it from a vet, bud. Sooner you go the better. It's a big city andyou're starting late. You can get a cat, not a mouse, and some babesare clever hellcats in a dark alley.     You must be a genius, Wayne said. A corporal with no hair and stilla counterboy. I'm impressed. I'm all ears, Dad.     The corporal sighed wearily. You can get that balloon headventilated, bud, and good.     Wayne's mouth twitched. He leaned across the counter toward theshelves and racks of weapons. I'll remember that crack when I getmy commission. He blew smoke in the corporal's face. Bring me aSmith and Wesson .38, shoulder holster with spring-clip. And throw ina Skelly switchblade for kicks\u2014the six-inch disguised job with thedouble springs.     The corporal waddled back with the revolver and the switchbladedisguised in a leather comb case. He checked them on a receipt ledger,while Wayne examined the weapons, broke open the revolver, twirled thecylinder and pushed cartridges into the waiting chamber. He slippedthe knife from the comb case, flicked open the blade and stared at itsgleam in the buttery light as his mouth went dry and the refractedincandescence of it trickled on his brain like melted ice, exciting andscary.     He removed his leather jacket. He slung the holster under his leftarmpit and tested the spring clip release several times, feeling theway the serrated butt dropped into his wet palm. He put his jacketback on and the switchblade case in his pocket. He walked toward theelevator and didn't look back as the corporal said, Good luck, tiger.     Captain Jack moved massively. The big stone-walled office, alive withstuffed lion and tiger and gunracks, seemed to grow smaller. CaptainJack crossed black-booted legs and whacked a cane at the floor. It hada head shaped like a grinning bear.     Wayne felt the assured smile die on his face. Something seemed toshrink him. If he didn't watch himself he'd begin feeling like a peaamong bowling balls.     Contemptuously amused little eyes glittered at Wayne from a shaggyhead. Shoulders hunched like stuffed sea-bags.     Wayne Seton, said Captain Jack as if he were discussing somethingin a bug collection. Well, well, you're really fired up aren't you?Really going out to eat 'em. Right, punk?     Yes, sir, Wayne said. He ran wet hands down the sides of his chinos.His legs seemed sheathed in lead as he bit inwardly at shrinking fearthe way a dog snaps at a wound. You big overblown son, he thought, I'llshow you but good who is a punk. They made a guy wait and sweat untilhe screamed. They kept a guy on the fire until desire leaped in him,ran and billowed and roared until his brain was filled with it. Butthat wasn't enough. If this muscle-bound creep was such a big boy,what was he doing holding down a desk?     Well, this is it, punk. You go the distance or start a butterflycollection.     The cane darted up. A blade snicked from the end and stopped an inchfrom Wayne's nose. He jerked up a shaky hand involuntarily and clampeda knuckle-ridged gag to his gasping mouth.     Captain Jack chuckled. All right, superboy. He handed Wayne hispasscard. Curfew's off, punk, for 6 hours. You got 6 hours to makeout.     Yes, sir.     Your beast is primed and waiting at the Four Aces Club on the WestSide. Know where that is, punk?     No, sir, but I'll find it fast.     Sure you will, punk, smiled Captain Jack. She'll be wearing yellowslacks and a red shirt. Black hair, a cute trick. She's with a heftypsycho who eats punks for breakfast. He's butchered five people.They're both on top of the Undesirable list, Seton. They got to go andthey're your key to the stars.     Yes, sir, Wayne said.     So run along and make out, punk, grinned Captain Jack.  "

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in GOURMET?",
        "Summary_1": "The story first begins discussing how food is a central topic for men on ships. The Marsmen are called Slimeheads, honoring in their title the Chlorella and Scenedesmus algae that open the road to the wider space without by filling the spaces within. The Ship\u2019s Cook is described to be the most vital man on a spacer because he is the one who turns offal into eatables. There are also instances described where the cooks have messed up and created disasters for fellow crew members, such as poisoning them. Paul Vilanova, the narrator, goes on to tell what happened on the Charles Partlow Sale. The ship is to take a low-energy route and carries various seeds of plantlife. There are the Registry minimum of six men and three officers aboard, including Paul the surgeon, Willy Winkelmann the captain, and Robert Bailey the cook. The cook is responsible for the livelihood of all the men on the ship, and the algae also helped feed the men in a way where they cannot afford the luxury of squeamishness. Although Paul is the surgeon, he rarely lifts a knife in space because his duties are more in line with serving as a morale officer and wailing-wall. Captain Winkelman is described to have a heart of helium ice and is extremely unpopular. Bailey is often his target, but he tries his best as the Ship Cook to feed everybody in a way that makes the algae somewhat appetizing. Paul admits that he does not like the Captain much, but he tells Bailey that his cooking is what keeps the captain retaining his plump figure. Bailey cooks them a luxurious meal the next day, but the captain only criticizes him. Bailey tries to ask what Captain Winkelman wants from him, and even Paul says that he is going to crack from being driven so hard. The Captain tells him that he is simply trying to widen Bailey\u2019s horizons in terms of cooking. Bailey tries to avoid the Captain during meal time after, and Paul believes that he is the finest cook to go into the Hohmann orbit. Even though everybody is impressed by his dishes, Winkelmann still refuses to compliment him despite gaining weight from eating. When Bailey tries to convince the Captain of his food again, Winkelmann takes out a bottle of ketchup to eat with his meal. Bailey is furious, while Paul tries to cheer him up over some fifty cc\u2019s of rye. After the therapeutic drinking, Bailey begins to cook awful looking and tasting dishes. Winkelman, ironically, tells Bailey that he is improving even though the other crew members complain. When Paul goes to visit Bailey again later, one of the crew members exclaims that the cook has managed to make the algae taste similar to real food. Paul tells him that this is the result of the Captain\u2019s continuous pushing; he answers that he does like the Captain when Bailey asks him again. ",
        "Summary_2": "This story follows several men aboard the Ship, specifically focused on the Ship\u2019s Cook Bailey, the Captain Willy Winkelmann and the narrator of the story, the Ship\u2019s Surgeon Paul Vilanova. The story chronicles the importance of food in space, in particular, the trials of the Ship\u2019s Cook in making delectable food out of ship-offal, which all food is made out of. \n\nThe Ship\u2019s Cook, Bailey, is introduced to us as someone who feeds his shipmates by groundside standards. He hides the synthetic and off-putting tastes of the algal repasts with spices like oregano and thyme, and uses his culinary techniques to shape and reuse the offals into mock-meats and other familiar meals. His fellow ship mates are satisfied with the tastes and creativeness of the meals - with none of them losing the typical weight aboard a ship and their Captain Winkelmann, actually, gaining more weight instead. Despite this, the Captain verbalizes his dissatisfaction and criticizes each meal. Every time Bailey ups the ante in the tastes or creativeness of a meal prepared, the Captain\u2019s critique only increases further. The story\u2019s narrator aids the Cook's support and reassures him of the delicious quality of the food he prepares, second to none of the narrator\u2019s past ship experiences. As part of his role in crew morale, the narrator tries to reason with the Captain in driving Bailey too hard, but to no avail. \n\nAt his breaking point, Bailey prepares the ship and the Captain an exquisite steak meal, mimicking its real texture, only to be insulted by the Captain bringing out ketchup and declaring it palpable only with the condiment. Respectfully telling off the Captain, the narrator brings Bailey back to his bunkers and reaches for alcohol as a healing power of nature, again reassuring him and commending him for taking the pressure. The next morning, the crew is served a disgusting pottage of the algae and finally, Bailey receives the Captain\u2019s approval. The narrator is proud, willing to take the bad meals for the rest of the trip in exchange for Bailey overcoming the Captain and gaining his psychic defenses. After a day, the crew mates are rewarded by Bailey\u2019s newest concoction: a barbecued steak that is complimented to actually taste of food and be delicious. The narrator reveals that the Captain\u2019s relentless critique was actually to improve Bailey\u2019s culinary skills and for the good of the ship, and is rewarded with another piece of the artificial steak. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The story is about the crew of a spaceship that is making their way to Mars. At the beginning, the main character, Paul Vilanova, relates the importance of food in these trips. He says that the cook in a ship has the power to either make a trip or break a trip. On this particular trip, the cook is Robert Bailey. He is very talented, but the captain of the trip believes that he isn't. Throughout the story, the Captain continuously berates Bailey for the lack of quality in his cooking, even though Paul and the rest of the ship are really impressed with the food. Bailey is forced to cook with algae, as it allows for long trips and gives men all the necessary nutrients that they need. When the Captain begins to put ketchup on Bailey\u2019s delicacies, he takes this as the last straw and begins to lower the quality of the cooking severely. Lastly, Bailey gives a steak that seemed to be perfect, perfectly cooked and a perfect replica of a real steak. It is hinted that this steak is actually human meat, and that Bailey killed the Captain. \n",
        "Summary_4": "The story talks about the future in which people are traveling between different planets. The ones that do that are called the spacers. They spend a lot of time in space, and, thus, need to eat a lot. The solution of this future is algae that feed the men and help keep the ship a sustainable system. The narrator of the story is Paul Vilanova, a spacer. Sometime in the past, he traveled to Mars on a ship called The Sale. He was the board surgeon, the captain was Willy Winkelmann - a very unapproachable man. Their cook - the most important person on the ship because he had to apply biochemistry and dietetics to cook nourishing food from Chlorella algae - was called Robert Bailey, he was originally from Ohio. Vilanova describes a very tense relationship between the cook and the captain: Willy Winkelmann, an unpleasant person he was, was always mispronouncing the cook's name and criticizing his dishes. \n\nHe served a three-course dinner and the crew thanked him, but the captain found his food disgusting and left the dinner with a small scandal. Later, Bailey talked to the surgeon about the captain and complained about his insulting remarks. Paul assured him that no one could make Winkelmann happy and that the food was way above average. The next day the captain made an offensive comment about Bailey's cooking abilities again. Paul tried to talk to Winkelmann about his harsh attitude towards Bailey, and the captain said that he believed this attitude would make the cook improvise and experiment more. Paul disagreed but was soon told to leave. Bailey started avoiding the captain but was still called from the kitchen almost every time. The other crew members enjoyed this conflict since it made Bailey cook in a more creative way. One day Paul even learned that instead of taking anything meaningful on the board Winkelmann had just brought a box of ketchup to help him eat the spacers\u2019 food and humiliate Bailey even more. After another offensive monologue from the captain, the cook became angry and started talking back, but Winkelmann quickly excused him and Paul, who had tried to defend Bailey. Later Paul gave the cook some rye and listened to him cursing and insulting the captain. The next morning Bailey cooked something unusually disgusting, and the captain realized he had lost and decided to give the cook a word of praise. Sometime later, Bailey managed to make the best dish he had made so far - the steaks tasted like real food, not the algae. After a small chat, Paul and Bailey both agreed that Winkelmann had significantly contributed to Bailey's success by criticizing his food and driving the cook more eager to prove himself. ",

I want to talk to you.     In the office, Arapoulous took a chair. Sorry if I'm rushing you,Retief, he said. But have you got anything for me?     Retief waved at the wine bottles. What do you know about Croanie?     Croanie? Not much of a place. Mostly ocean. All right if you likefish, I guess. We import our seafood from there. Nice prawns in monsoontime. Over a foot long.     You on good terms with them?     Sure, I guess so. Course, they're pretty thick with Boge.     So?     Didn't I tell you? Boge was the bunch that tried to take us over herea dozen years back. They'd've made it too, if they hadn't had a lot ofbad luck. Their armor went in the drink, and without armor they're easygame.     Miss Furkle buzzed. I have your lists, she said shortly.

        "Query": "What are the meals that Bailey prepares for the team on board?",
        "Summary_1": "One of the first-mentioned dishes that Bailey cooks is hamburger. He tries to create this out of the algae, seasoning the food to hide the flavors. He also serves a fudge for dessert that is compounded from the dextrose-paste of the carbohydrate recycler. After speaking with Paul initially, Bailey serves a dish of hamburger steak again. There is an individual head of lettuce served, along with a steak drenched in gravy. Later, he serves them a hot turkey supreme. The cheese-sauce is very believable, whereas the turkey is white and tender even though it is made from Chlorella. When Captain Winkelmann pushes Bailey too far, he begins to create disgusting foods. One of the first dishes he serves is boiled Chlorella vulgaris that resembles vomit. The coffee at noon also tastes of salt. However, at the very end of the story, Bailey succeeds in making his Chlorella steak actually taste like food.",
        "Summary_2": "The dishes Bailey cooks for the crew varies greatly, ranging from artificial vegetables to mock-meats. One dish that he makes is a mock-meat hamburger, with the pressed Chlorella tinted pink and seasoned by oregano and thyme. The dish is accompanied by dessert - a fudge made from dextrose-paste. More mock-meat dishes include a hamburger steak covered in a rich, meaty gravy lavishly seasoned with garlic. \n\nAnother dish includes a mock individual head of lettuce dressed with vinegar and oil. The lettuce was made by Bailey constructing each synthetic lettuce leaf, with the narrator guessing the process to be out of pressing, rolling and shaping a green Chlorella paste. \n\nIn contrast to some of the delicious dishes that Bailey makes, the Cook also delivers some less tasty meals in response to the Captain\u2019s critiques. These included boiled Chlorella vulgaris in some soup and subpar algaeburgers. \n\nBailey\u2019s final dish in the story - and the best one yet - is an artificial steak that greets the crew with a barbecue smell. It is drenched with gravy and seasoned with a peppery and garlicy taste, and as the crew eats it, they find that the usually pond-scum taste that accompanies each repurposed chlorella meal is gone and instead, the taste and texture reflects actual steak. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Throughout their trip, Bailey does the best he can in order to replicate traditional food using the Algae. To impress the Captain, Bailey cooks a wide variety of foods including algae burgers, fudge, Steak with gravy and a head of lettuce, Hot turkey with cornbread and butter sauce, and medium rare steak. None of these foods impressed the Captain, so Bailey went back to cooking unappealing food such as a porridge-like broth and bad coffee. At the end, Bailey serves a new type of steak, which is hinted to be human steak from the Captain.",
        "Summary_4": "Bailey made a lot of different dishes while working on the Sale ship. He cooked a hamburger and a fudge. He made a steak with rich meat gravy and lettuce, vinegar, and oil. An ersatz hot turkey supreme with a cheese sauce, cornbread, and a pottage was also served at some point. All of these were criticized by Captain Winkelmann. Mostly Bailey was working on the taste of steak, which at the end of the story, he managed to perfect to a certain extent, partly thanks to the captain\u2019s constant remarks. ",
        "Article": "Bailey grew more silent as we threaded our way along the ellipticalpath to Mars. Each meal he prepared was a fresh attempt to propitiatethe appetite of our splenetic Captain. Each such offering was condemnedby that heartless man. Bailey began to try avoiding the Captain atmealtimes, but was frustrated by Winkelmann's orders. Convey mycompliments to the Chef, please, the Captain would instruct one ofthe crew, and ask him to step down here a moment. And the Cook wouldcheerlessly appear in the dining-cubby, to have his culinary geniusacidly called in question again.     I myself do not doubt that Bailey was the finest Cook ever to gointo Hohmann orbit. His every meal established a higher benchmark inbrilliant galleymanship. We were served, for instance, an      ersatz     hotturkey supreme. The cheese-sauce was almost believable, the Chlorellaturkey-flesh was white and tender. Bailey served with this delicacya grainy and delicious cornbread, and had extracted from his algaea lipid butter-substitute that soaked into the hot bread with agenuinely dairy smell. Splendid, Bailey, I said.     We are not amused, said Captain Winkelmann, accepting a secondhelping of the pseudo-turkey. You are improving, Belly-Robber, butonly arithmetically. Your first efforts were so hideous as to requirea geometric progression of improving excellence to raise them to mereedibility. By the time we are halfway 'round the Sun, I trust you willhave learned to cook with the competence of a freshman Home Economicsstudent. That will be all, Bailey.     The crew and my fellow-officers were amused by Winkelmann's riding ofBailey; they were in addition gratified that the battle between theirCaptain and their Cook served to feed them so well. Most spacers embarkon an outward voyage somewhat plump, having eaten enough on their lastfew days aground to smuggle several hundred calories of fat and manymemories of good food aboard with them. This trip, none of the men hadlost weight during the first four months in space. Winkelmann, indeed,seemed to have gained. His uniform was taut over his plump backside,and he puffed a bit up the ladders. I was considering suggesting to ourCaptain that he curtail his diet for reasons of health, a bit of advicethat would have stood unique in the annals of space medicine, whenWinkelmann produced his supreme insult to our Cook.   <doc-sep> Bailey and I climbed from the mess compartment together. I steered himto my quarters, where the medical supplies were stored. He sat on mybunk and exploded into weeping, banging his fists against the metalbulkhead. You'll have that drink now, I said.     No, dammit! he shouted.     Orders, I said. I poured us each some fifty cc's of rye. This istherapy, Bailey, I told him. He poured the fiery stuff down his throatlike water and silently held out his glass for a second. I provided it.     After a few minutes Bailey's sobbing ceased. Sorry, Doc, he said.     You've taken more pressure than most men would, I said. Nothing tobe ashamed of.     He's crazy. What sane man would expect me to dip Wiener schnitzeland sauerkraut and      Backhahndl nach suddeutscher Art     out of an algaetank? I've got nothing but microscopic weeds to cook for him! Worn-outmolecules reclaimed from the head; packaged amino acid additives. Andhe expects meals that would take the blue ribbon at the annual banquetof the Friends of Escoffier!     Yours is an ancient plaint, Bailey, I said. You've worked yourfingers to the bone, slaving over a hot stove, and you're notappreciated. But you're not married to Winkelmann, remember. A yearfrom now you'll be home in Ohio, fifty grand richer, set to start thatrestaurant of yours and forget about our fat Flying Dutchman.     I hate him, Bailey said with the simplicity of true emotion. Hereached for the bottle. I let him have it. Sometimes alcohol can bean apt confederate of      vis medicatrix naturae     , the healing power ofnature. Half an hour later I strapped Bailey into his bunk to sleep itoff. That therapeutic drunk seemed to be just what he'd needed.     For morning mess the next day we had a broth remarkable inhorribleness, a pottage or boiled      Chlorella vulgaris     that lookedand tasted like the vomit of some bottom-feeding sea-beast. Bailey,red-eyed and a-tremble, made no apology, and stared at Winkelmann asthough daring him to comment. The Captain lifted a spoonful of thedisgusting stuff to his lips, smacked and said, Belly-Robber, you'reimproving a little at last.     Bailey nodded and smiled. Thank you, Sir, he said.     I smiled, too. Bailey had conquered himself. His psychic defenses werenow strong enough to withstand the Captain's fiercest assaults ofirony. Our food would likely be bad the rest of this trip, but that wasa price I was willing to pay for seeing destroyed the Willy Winkelmanntheory of forcing a Cook to make bricks without straw. The Captainhad pushed too hard. He'd need that ketchup for the meals to come, Ithought.     Noon mess was nearly as awful as breakfast had been. The coffee tastedof salt, and went largely undrunk. The men in the mess compartment werevehement in their protests, blaming the Captain, in his absence, forthe decline in culinary standards. Bailey seemed not to care. He servedthe algaeburgers with half a mind, and hurried back into his galleyoblivious of the taunts of his crewmates.   <doc-sep> There being only three seats in the      Sale's     mess compartment, we ateour meals in three shifts. That evening, going down the ladder tosupper, my nose was met with a spine-tingling barbecue tang, a smellto make a man think of gray charcoal glowing in a picnic brazier,of cicadas chirping and green grass underfoot, of the pop and hissof canned beer being church-keyed. He's done it, Doc! one of thefirst-shift diners said. It actually tastes of food!     Then he's beat the Captain at his game, I said.     The Dutchman won't want to mess ketchup on these steaks, the crewmansaid.     I sat, unfolded my napkin, and looked with hope to the electricwarming-pan at the center of the table. Bailey served the three ofus with the small steaks. Each contained about a pound of driedChlorella, I judged, teasing mine with my fork. But they were drenchedin a gravy rich as the stuff grandma used to make in her black ironskillet, peppery and seasoned with courageous bits of garlic. I cuta bit from my steak and chewed it. Too tender, of course; there arelimits to art. But the pond-scum taste was gone. Bailey appeared in thegalley door. I gestured for him to join me. You've done it, Bailey,I said. Every Slimehead in orbit will thank you for this. This isactually      good     .     Thanks, Doc, Bailey said.     I smiled and took another bite. You may not realize it, Bailey; butthis is a victory for the Captain, too. He drove you to this triumph;you couldn't have done it without him.     You mean he was just whipping me on, trying to make me do better?Bailey asked.     He was driving you to do the impossible, I said; and you did it. OurCaptain may be a hard man, Bailey; but he did know how to coax maximumperformance out of his Ship's Cook.     Bailey stood up. Do you like Captain Winkelmann, Doctor? he asked.     I thought about his question a moment. Winkelmann was good at his job.He persuaded his men by foul means, true; but it was all for the goodof the ship and his crew. Do I like Captain Winkelmann? I asked,spearing another piece of my artificial steak. Bailey, I'm afraid I'llhave to admit that I do.     Bailey smiled and lifted a second steak from the warming-pan onto myplate. Then have another piece, he said.    "

        "Summary_1": "Robert Bailey is the cook of the ship; he is considered to have one of the most important roles on the ship because he is the one who must feed all of the crew members. Bailey works very hard to try and please Captain Winkelmann, even though the captain constantly berates him on his efforts. He takes pride in his cooking, which is why he constantly tries to improve in order to gain the Captain\u2019s approval. Paul considers him to be the best cook in the entire orbit, especially when he is shown to be capable of creating algae food that tastes realistic at the end of the story. Apart from the Captain, Bailey is very respectful towards his fellow crew members, especially Paul. Bailey dedicates himself to his food entirely, trying to cook up the best meal he can out of the Chlorella algae. He also plans to open a restaurant once he returns to Ohio. ",
        "Summary_2": "Robert Bailey is the ship\u2019s Cook, who is earnest and passionate about delivering tasty meals to the rest of his crew mates to the best of his ability. He is described as being quite successful in his pursuit as complimented by the crew and the narrator in having some of the best dishes compared to their past experiences on other ships. He is creative and experimental, choosing to use the necessary chlorella algae off-cuts and recycled pastes of the ship in inventive ways to come up with mock-meats, vegetables, and even desserts. He is dedicated to the cause, even so far as using space in his own personal affects to bring spices, whereas other crewmates may have brought books or the like. \n\nHe is also described as tenacious and hardworking - especially when being constantly ridiculed by the Captain - he consistently works hard everyday to better his dishes and eventually, is able to come up on the other side with a stronger psychic defense against the Captain and the best tasting meal he\u2019s served all journey. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Robert Bailey is the cook of the crew. He is very talented in his profession, providing his crew with delicious and nutritious meals derived from algae. Unfortunately, the Captain doesn\u2019t like him or the food. Bailey is very sensitive to these reactions, and frequently breaks down in front of Paul. Bailey shows a lot of determination, as even though the captain frequently berates him in front of the crew, he continues trying to impress the captain. Bailey also seems to be very humble, as he wishes to take his salary and move back to his hometown in Ohio and open a restaurant there. Lastly, Bailey shows a violent side, with it being hinted that he murdered and cooked the captain for the crew. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Robert Bailey was the cook of the Sale ship that was flying to Mars. He had many altercations with Winkelmann, the captain of the Sale ship, because of the way the latter criticized Bailey\u2019s food made from the Chlorella algae. Robert was a talented cook who tried to be as meticulous as possible. He was fond of his passion but was also sensitive. Bailey managed to handle the harsh attitude of the captain for some time, but then his anger overwhelmed him. Still, he was a confident and determined professional, and, in the end, it helped him create the best version of steak and satisfy Winkelmann. \n",

Captain Willy Winkelmannwas the sort of man who, if he had to go into space at all, had best doso alone. If the Prussians had a Marine Corps, Winkelmann would havedone splendidly as Drill Instructor for their boot camp. His heartwas a chip of helium ice, his voice dripped sarcastic acid.

And it wasCaptain Willy Winkelmann who never referred to the ship's head by anyother name than The Kitchen Cabinet.     Bailey tried to feed us by groundside standards. He hid the tasteof synthetic methionine\u2014an essential amino acid not synthesized byChlorella\u2014by seasoning our algaeal repasts with pinches of oreganoand thyme. He tinted the pale-green dollops of pressed Chlorella pink,textured the mass to the consistency of hamburger and toasted theslabs to a delicate brown in a forlorn attempt to make mock-meat.For dessert, he served a fudge compounded from the dextrose-paste ofthe carbohydrate recycler. The crew thanked him. The Captain did not.Belly-Robber, he said, his tone icy as winter wind off the North Sea,you had best cycle this mess through the tanks again.

        "Summary_2": "This story takes place aboard a ship called the Charles Partlow Sale, which took off from the Brady Station on a low-energy route to Mars, taking about a journey\u2019s time of about 9 months before arrival.\n\nThe setting mainly occurs in the mess hall as the backdrop to the crew\u2019s meal times as they dig into the prepared dishes by the Cook. It is also here where the interactions between the Cook and the Captain take place, often with the Captain ridiculing the Cook\u2019s culinary prowess. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The story is set in a spaceship, but the spaceship seems to have very traditional attributes of a sea ship. It has different levels of decks, as well as different rooms that allow for different day to day activities. Most of the story is recounted on the dining table, where Bailey serves the food that he cooks in order for the crew to enjoy. This is also where the Captain berates Bailey constantly for his lack of cooking skill, and where Bailey sits there taking the criticism. The story also takes place in the medbay, where Bailey and Doc share their dislike of the captain. ",
        "Summary_4": "The story is set in the future where interplanetary trips are normal and regular, specifically, the narrator tells about what was happening on the spaceship called the Sale that had left the Brady Station and was on its way to Mars. Most of the conversations and events of the story happened in the mess, the dining area of the ship. Captain Winkelmann criticized Bailey\u2019s food many times while eating there. Paul, the narrator and the ship\u2019s doctor, and Bailey also went to the medical quarters after they both had a conflict with the captain after he had called the meal a failure. Here they had an emotional talk about the captain, and the next day Bailey cooked a disgusting pottage that proved that Bailey had overcome the captain\u2019s criticism. Sometime later, Paul and Bailey met at the dining area again after the cook had made the best version of steak with a real taste of meat. ",

        "Query": "What role does the Chlorella algae play in the GOURMET story?",
        "Summary_1": "The Chlorella algae is what keeps all of the crew members alive for the duration of the journey. Since twelve tons of water, oxygen, and food would have filled the compartment to bursting, Chlorella algae is the solution to this. It can work over used food, air, and effluvia, three tons of metabolites that would see them through the entire round trip. Everything the crew recycles is fed to the algae, which feeds the crew members in return. The waste is used to fertilize the liquid fields. Even their stubble from 2,600 shaves and clipping from 666 haircuts is used to feed the algae because human hair is rich in essential amino acids. The algae is their food, as well as the water and air that keeps the crew members going. ",
        "Summary_2": "The chlorella algae is integral to the story as well as the shipmen. On each ship, a colony of chlorella algae is introduced in order to recycle through the used air, water and other effluvia that the crewmates both used and wasted. Everything that couldn\u2019t feed the crew like molecules of fat, minerals, carbohydrates etc were used to feed the algae, and in return, the Cook would use the algae offcuts and pastes to feed the crew. It served its purpose both as the key sustenance for the crewmates as well as an important part of the recycling process aboard the ship. \n\nThroughout the story, it also serves as an important piece of the Cook overcoming the challenge of working with algae. In every dish, despite his creativity and seasonings, the taste and look of algae - tasting like pond-scum and green - will be present in some way. By the end of the story, however, the Cook has been able to tenderize and shape the algae\u2019s texture in such a way that it mimics real meat. \n\n",
        "Summary_3": "The Chlorella algae is what the cook uses to make his food. The algae works over the air that the crew doesn\u2019t use, and is also fed with waste from the ship, including hair and human waste as fertilizer. The algae was then cooked by the chef to feed the crew and create a cycle that allows the ship to do long voyages. The algae tastes very bad, and requires a lot of cooking effort to make it somewhat edible, which is what Bailey did. Bailey managed to replicate traditional dishes very well using the algae, but it wasn\u2019t enough to satisfy the Captain. ",
        "Summary_4": "Chlorella algae were important because they allowed the spaceship and its crew members to get to their destination without bringing tons of food and gear with them. It worked over the used air, the crew\u2019s water, other effluvia, and types of waste; and extracted different proteins, minerals, and fat from it, feeding itself. And the algae, on the other hand, served as the main food ingredient for the spacers that spent months on a spaceship. The algae - served in different ways and with various dressings - were practically the main dish every day. Water and oxygen were recycled, too.\n",

The first amenity of groundside existence to be abandoned was decentfood. The earliest men into the vacuum swallowed protein squeezingsfrom aluminum tubes, and were glad enough to drop back to thegroundsman's diet of steak and fried potatoes.   <doc-sep> Long before I was a boy in Med School, itching to look at black skythrough a view-port, galley science had fulfilled the disgustingexordium of      Isaiah     36:12, to feed the Slimeheads for breakfast todaywhat was day-before-yesterday's table-scraps and jakes-water.     The Ship's Cook, the man who accomplishes the daily miracle of turningoffal into eatables, is in many ways the most vital man aboard aspacer. He can make morale or foment a mutiny. His power is paramount.Slimeheads remember the H. M. S.      Ajax     fiasco, for example, in which agalleyman leveled his Chlorella tanks with heavy water from the ship'sshielding. Four officers and twenty-one Other Ranks were rescued fromthe      Ajax     in deep space, half dead from deuterium poisoning. We thinkof the      Benjo Maru     incident, too, caused by a Ship's Cook who allowedhis algaeal staff-of-life to become contaminated with a fast-growing      Saccharomycodes     yeast. The Japanese vessel staggered to her pad atPiano West after a twenty-week drunk: the alien yeast had got intothe stomach of every man aboard, where it fermented each subsequentbite he ate to a superior grade of      sake     . And for a third footnote tothe ancient observation, God sends food, and the Devil sends cooks,Marsmen will recall what happened aboard my ship the      Charles PartlowSale     .     The      Sale     blasted off from Brady Station in the middle of August, duein at Piano West in early May. In no special hurry, we were takingthe low-energy route to Mars, a pathway about as long in time as thehuman period of gestation. Our cargo consisted mostly of Tien-Shen firseedlings and some tons of an arctic grass-seed\u2014these to be plantedin the      maria     to squeeze out the native blue bugberry vines. We hadaboard the Registry minimum of six men and three officers. Ship'sSurgeon was myself, Paul Vilanova. Our Captain was Willy Winkelmann,the hardest man in space and very likely the fattest. Ship's Cook wasRobert Bailey.     Cooking aboard a spacer is a job combining the more frustratingtensions of biochemistry, applied mycology, high-speed farming,dietetics and sewage engineering. It's the Cook's responsibility tosee that each man aboard gets each day no less than five pounds ofwater, two pounds of oxygen, and one-and-a-half pounds of dry food.This isn't just a paragraph from the Spacer Union Contract. It's astatement of the least fuel a man can run on.     Twelve tons of water, oxygen, and food would have filled the cargocompartments to bursting, and left a small ship like the      C. P. Sale     no reason to reach for Mars. By allowing a colony of Chlorella algae towork over our used air, water and other effluvia, though, three tonsof metabolites would see us through from Brady Station to Piano Westand back. Recycling was the answer. The molecule of carbohydrate, fat,protein or mineral that didn't feed the crew fed the algae. And thealgae fed us.     All waste was used to fertilize our liquid fields. Even the stubblefrom our 2,680 shaves and the clippings from our 666 haircuts en routeand back would be fed into the Chlorella tanks. Human hair is rich inessential amino acids.     The algae\u2014dried by the Cook, bleached with methyl alcohol to kill thesmell and make the residue more digestible, disguised and seasoned in ahundred ways\u2014served as a sort of meat-and-potatoes that never quitewore out. Our air and water were equally immortal. Each molecule ofoxygen would be conversant with the alveoli of every man aboard by theend of our trip. Every drop of water would have been intimate with theglomeruli of each kidney on the ship before we grounded in. Groundlingpoliticians are right enough when they say that we spacers are abreed apart. We're the one race of men who can't afford the luxury ofsqueamishness.   <doc-sep> Bailey grew more silent as we threaded our way along the ellipticalpath to Mars. Each meal he prepared was a fresh attempt to propitiatethe appetite of our splenetic Captain. Each such offering was condemnedby that heartless man. Bailey began to try avoiding the Captain atmealtimes, but was frustrated by Winkelmann's orders. Convey mycompliments to the Chef, please, the Captain would instruct one ofthe crew, and ask him to step down here a moment. And the Cook wouldcheerlessly appear in the dining-cubby, to have his culinary geniusacidly called in question again.     I myself do not doubt that Bailey was the finest Cook ever to gointo Hohmann orbit. His every meal established a higher benchmark inbrilliant galleymanship. We were served, for instance, an      ersatz     hotturkey supreme. The cheese-sauce was almost believable, the Chlorellaturkey-flesh was white and tender. Bailey served with this delicacya grainy and delicious cornbread, and had extracted from his algaea lipid butter-substitute that soaked into the hot bread with agenuinely dairy smell. Splendid, Bailey, I said.     We are not amused, said Captain Winkelmann, accepting a secondhelping of the pseudo-turkey. You are improving, Belly-Robber, butonly arithmetically. Your first efforts were so hideous as to requirea geometric progression of improving excellence to raise them to mereedibility. By the time we are halfway 'round the Sun, I trust you willhave learned to cook with the competence of a freshman Home Economicsstudent. That will be all, Bailey.     The crew and my fellow-officers were amused by Winkelmann's riding ofBailey; they were in addition gratified that the battle between theirCaptain and their Cook served to feed them so well. Most spacers embarkon an outward voyage somewhat plump, having eaten enough on their lastfew days aground to smuggle several hundred calories of fat and manymemories of good food aboard with them. This trip, none of the men hadlost weight during the first four months in space. Winkelmann, indeed,seemed to have gained. His uniform was taut over his plump backside,and he puffed a bit up the ladders. I was considering suggesting to ourCaptain that he curtail his diet for reasons of health, a bit of advicethat would have stood unique in the annals of space medicine, whenWinkelmann produced his supreme insult to our Cook.

        "Summary_1": "Simon goes to his desk as Betty remarks that he is late. He tells her that he needs a vacation, but she asks him where the funds will come from and her weekly salary. Suddenly, the door knocks, and a man named Mr. Oyster comes in. Despite having never met before, he is impressed that Simon knows him and asks the other man if he believes in time travel. Betty says it is impossible, and Mr. Oyster questions her about why. Simon then asks why he came, to which the potential client responds that he wants them to hunt up some time travelers. He asks Betty some more about science fiction and explains that he is willing to gamble his fortune to investigate the presence of time travelers in the current era. Mr. Oyster further says that these time travelers will be at the Oktoberfest in Munich, which is considered the greatest festival globally. Simon says that he is not interested in taking up the case. Betty is surprised, and Mr. Oyster tries to offer him a substantial amount of money. Simon then tells them a story where he accepts Mr. Oyster\u2019s offer. Simon thinks about how much fun he will have and a fake report to generate for Mr. Oyster. He then goes on to be suspicious about how five million people can appear to attend a festival in a remote part of southern Germany, especially considering the population of Munich is less than one million. There is no hotel space in Munch, so Simon must go to Bahnhof to apply for hotel service. It is suspicious how the five million attendees are accommodated for this festival. The circus-like tents represent the seven major brewers of the Munich area, and many people are going around. Simon finds a space at one of the tables; he notes that the crowd is made up of both tourists and Germans. A bald-headed person and he both drink beer. The bald man accidentally reveals that his pencil is Venusian and tells Simon that his dream is to sample each of the seven best beer brands. The man then introduces himself as Arth and tells Simon that he is from a strange location. Arth offers to take him to his hotel later, and Simon goes with him. Arth gives him a box of pills for his hangover, and the scene cuts to them drinking at the festival again. Simon feels that something is off and decides to go back to New York. He returns to the office, where Mr. Oyster tells him that Betty has just finished the receipt. They are both confused and say that he has only been gone for about three minutes. Mr. Oyster is furious and leaves, while Betty asks why he didn\u2019t just take the money. Simon tells her that he experienced the trip three times and says that he will not be dealing with a fourth hangover on top of the three already-present ones. ",
        "Summary_2": "One day, Mr. Oyster comes to Simon\u2019s office and tries to assign a mission of finding a time traveler in a huge festival, Oktoberfest, in Munich and bring back the secret of eternal youth. However, Simon refuses his request. While Mr. Oyster is confused about why Simon rejects such a large amount of money and a chance to go on a vacation, Simon tells him a story.\n\nIn the story, Simon accepts Mr. Oyster\u2019s request and goes to Oktoberfest. When he gets to Munich, he cannot find a hotel to stay in since there are too many people to be accommodated. While drinking in the big tent held by the local brewery, Simon meets a guy who wants to try all the beer. He then accompanies him to drink. When they get drunk, Simon tells the guy that he doesn\u2019t have anywhere to stay, and the guy invites him to his place. While they talk in the guy\u2019s place, the guy carelessly leaks information about where he comes from, which seems like a time traveler. On the following day, when the time traveler realizes what he did last night, he tells Simon not to move and goes into the bathroom. After he comes out, he gives Simon a pill and lets him go. When Simon takes the flight back to his office, the time seems to be reset to when he just left the office to catch the flight to Munich.\n\nMr. Oyster thinks that Simon tries to ridicule him through his story, so he angrily leaves. Betty, Simon\u2019s clerk, asks Simon why he didn\u2019t want to accept the request, and Simon tells her that the story is what truly happened. Moreover, it has already happened three times, but they never believe him as they cannot sense the time reset. In the end, Betty cannot understand what Simon is trying to say, and Simon is also too tired to explain it. The only thing sure is that he will not make the whole trip again.\n",
        "Summary_3": "This story follows Simon and Betty, his assistant, who are two investigators. As Simon nurses a headache and Betty laments over making enough for a week\u2019s salary, a new client enters, an old man wearing an expensive suit. Identifying the old man by name - Mr. Oyster - he details his desire to investigate time travel. Insisting that time travel is possible and real, with all the paradoxes explained away, Mr. Oyster passionately hypothesizes that time travelers often congregate at events like Oktoberfest and propose for Simon and Betty to attend the festival and nab a time traveler. Simon expands on the latter\u2019s desire as to him wanting the investigators to exhort from the time traveler some secret of eternal youth, and hence be willing to pay a premium rate of upwards of fifty thousand dollars. Despite this generous amount, Simon declines, and instead tells the pair a story. \n\nThe story goes: he took a thousand dollars from Mr. Oyster as an advance and departed on the first flight out to Germany. When he arrived at the festival, Simon found an available space in a brewers tent. He sat down across a bald-headed man who appeared to be noting down the various beers being tried. Introducing himself as Arth, Simon and Arth end up traversing the rest of the festival\u2019s breweries together, getting more and more inebriated with each one. After a while, both of them head back to Arth\u2019s hotel and pass out. The next morning, Arth is surprised to find Simon and gives him a pill to help with Simon\u2019s hangover. In the next scene, Simon finds them the next day back at the festival, nursing another mug of beer. With a terrible hangover and not remembering the details of the previous night, Simon says his goodbyes and heads to pick up his luggage, only to find it lost. He decided to head to the airport and fly out without it, found himself with a momentary bump with a ticketing error, and went directly to his office after landing. At the office, Simon is surprised to find Mr. Oyster there, surmising that he is eager to get the report. However, as Betty expresses that she just met Mr. Oyster that morning, he soon realizes that he somehow indeed time traveled. \n\nWhen Simon finished telling his story, Mr. Oyster is in disbelief and believes that he is being ridiculed and storms out of the office, leaving behind fifty dollars for the investigator's time. Betty comments that he is surprised he didn\u2019t take the offer. Simon reveals that he did, actually, three times. It turns out that Mr. Oyster\u2019s hypothesis on time travelers\u2019 existence and their congregation at Oktoberfest was correct. However, these time travelers - like Arth - will immediately reset the track if the space-time continuum was threatened - like they did to Simon. Nursing several hangovers, Simon implores Betty to let it go.\n",

They have a little disagreement, but it ends when a new client arrives. The client is Mr. Oyster, an old and rich man who is looking to find time travelers and is willing to pay handsomely. After the 3 of them go back and forth debating about the existence of time travel, Simon starts to tell a story about him going to Oktoberfest, and how an entanglement with a time traveler could go. The story starts with Simon arriving at the festival, and immediately becomes friends with a time traveler, Arth. After drinking together, they end up going to Arth\u2019s hotel. When Simon wakes up, he is in a very futuristic room. When Arth notices him, he gives him a pill and then Simon wakes up in the Oktoberfest again. Arth tells him it is the day after, but Simon ends up going back to New York. When he gets there, he arrives not 10 minutes later after he left. After the story ends, he rejects Mr. Oyster\u2019s proposal and it is revealed the story was real, and that Simon had in fact gone to the future with Arth, and had found time travelers. ",

You on good terms with them?     Sure, I guess so. Course, they're pretty thick with Boge.     So?     Didn't I tell you? Boge was the bunch that tried to take us over herea dozen years back. They'd've made it too, if they hadn't had a lot ofbad luck. Their armor went in the drink, and without armor they're easygame.     Miss Furkle buzzed. I have your lists, she said shortly.     Bring them in, please.   <doc-sep> Untrimmed sumacs threw late-afternoon shadows on the discolored stuccofacade of the Elsby Public Library. Inside, Tremaine followed apaper-dry woman of indeterminate age to a rack of yellowed newsprint.     You'll find back to nineteen-forty here, the librarian said. Theolder are there in the shelves.     I want nineteen-oh-one, if they go back that far.     The woman darted a suspicious look at Tremaine. You have to handlethese old papers carefully.     I'll be extremely careful. The woman sniffed, opened a drawer, leafedthrough it, muttering.     What date was it you wanted?     Nineteen-oh-one; the week of May nineteenth.     The librarian pulled out a folded paper, placed it on the table,adjusted her glasses, squinted at the front page. That's it, shesaid. These papers keep pretty well, provided they're stored in thedark. But they're still flimsy, mind you.     I'll remember. The woman stood by as Tremaine looked over the frontpage. The lead article concerned the opening of the Pan-AmericanExposition at Buffalo. Vice-President Roosevelt had made a speech.Tremaine leafed over, reading slowly.     On page four, under a column headed      County Notes     he saw the name Bram:     Mr. Bram has purchased a quarter section of fine grazing land,north of town, together with a sturdy house, from J. P. Spivey ofElsby. Mr. Bram will occupy the home and will continue to graze afew head of stock. Mr. Bram, who is a newcomer to the county, hasbeen a resident of Mrs. Stoate's Guest Home in Elsby for the pastmonths.     May I see some earlier issues; from about the first of the year?     The librarian produced the papers. Tremaine turned the pages, read theheads, skimmed an article here and there. The librarian went back toher desk. An hour later, in the issue for July 7, 1900, an item caughthis eye:     A Severe Thunderstorm. Citizens of Elsby and the country were muchalarmed by a violent cloudburst, accompanied by lightning andthunder, during the night of the fifth. A fire set in the pinewoods north of Spivey's farm destroyed a considerable amount oftimber and threatened the house before burning itself out alongthe river.     The librarian was at Tremaine's side. I have to close the library now.You'll have to come back tomorrow.     Outside, the sky was sallow in the west: lights were coming on inwindows along the side streets. Tremaine turned up his collar against acold wind that had risen, started along the street toward the hotel.     A block away a black late-model sedan rounded a corner with a faintsqueal of tires and gunned past him, a heavy antenna mounted forwardof the left rear tail fin whipping in the slipstream. Tremaine stoppedshort, stared after the car.     Damn! he said aloud. An elderly man veered, eyeing him sharply.Tremaine set off at a run, covered the two blocks to the hotel, yankedopen the door to his car, slid into the seat, made a U-turn, and headednorth after the police car.

        "Query": "What is the portrayal of Oktoberfest in UNBORN TOMORROW?",
        "Summary_1": "Oktoberfest, as described by Mr. Oyster, is held in Munich. It is the greatest festival the world has ever seen; each brewery opens a tremendous tent on the fairgrounds, holding five thousand customers apiece. There are millions of liters of beer, hundreds of thousands of barbecued chickens, oxen roasted over spits, millions of pairs of weisswurst sausage, and millions of pretzels. Since there are many people at Oktoberfest, it is perfect for strange people to blend in since nobody will notice. Oktoberfest is also mentioned to start on a Friday and continues for sixteen days. In Simon\u2019s story, the seven major brewers of the Munich area are all represented by circus-like tents. Each tent contains benches and tables that can seat up to five thousand people. There is a tremendous bandstand in the tent's center, where the musicians are lederhosen-clad. The music is described to be Bavarian as well. It is described that there are many desperate waitresses as well, scrambling around and handing people masses of beer. In terms of people, it is extremely loud and crowded; tourists and German natives are all present and try to squeeze into the tents. ",
        "Summary_2": "Oktoberfest is an annual festival held in Munich, the biggest one that has ever been seen. Five million people attend annually. It originates from celebrating a wedding of some local princes about a century and a half ago. Since then, Bavarians have maintained such a tradition. The Munich breweries will have a special beer called Marzenbr\u00e4u. Each brewery will set up a circus-like tent that allows five thousand customers to stay. Each tent contains benches and tables, and there will be a music band in each tent. A tremendous amount of beer, barbecued chicken, and pretzels will be provided. Foods like weisswurst, a special sausage, and roasted oxen will also be in plenty. The whole event usually lasts for sixteen days. People will drink beers and enjoy the food from one tent to another.",
        "Summary_3": "Oktoberfest is a famed beer festival that takes place in Southern Germany, beginning on September 21st and running for sixteen consecutive days. As described by Mr. Oyster, its historical origins began as a celebration of the wedding of a local prince centuries ago, and have since continued as a great time. Each year, many Munich breweries will brew a special batch - Marzenbrau beer - and will erect tents that can hold up to five thousand people. \n\nIn Simon\u2019s own experience, Oktoberfest just like Mr. Oyster described. Simon marvels - and questions - at the fact that five million people come to attend Oktoberfest, when the population of Munich itself does not go over a million. Because of the large number of event attendees, Simon is unable to find hotel space in Munich and has to go to Bahnhof and be put on the waitlist for a room. He finds seven major brewers in the Munich area, arranged in circus-like tents as described, with Bavarian musicians playing. Alongside the mugs of beer, fellow festival go-ers are also enjoying platters of chicken, sausage, kraut and pretzels. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Oktoberfest is described as the greatest festival in the world. It is said that over 5 million people attend the festival in southern Germany yearly, which Simon considers to be weird, as he wonders where those many people come from. The festival has different tents and is full of food and loud music where people get drunk and have a good time. The festival is also described as super packed, as Simon and Arth had a lot of trouble finding chairs in the tents. ",
        "Article": "  UNBORN     TOMORROW     BY MACK REYNOLDS   Unfortunately , there was onlyone thing he could bring backfrom the wonderful future ...and though he didn't want to... nevertheless he did....    Illustrated by Freas     Betty  looked up fromher magazine. She saidmildly, You're late.     Don't yell at me, Ifeel awful, Simon toldher. He sat down at his desk, passedhis tongue over his teeth in distaste,groaned, fumbled in a drawer for theaspirin bottle.     He looked over at Betty and said,almost as though reciting, What Ineed is a vacation.     What, Betty said, are you goingto use for money?     Providence, Simon told herwhilst fiddling with the aspirin bottle,will provide.     Hm-m-m. But before providingvacations it'd be nice if Providenceturned up a missing jewel deal, say.Something where you could deducethat actually the ruby ring had gonedown the drain and was caught in theelbow. Something that would netabout fifty dollars.     Simon said, mournful of tone,Fifty dollars? Why not make it fivehundred?     I'm not selfish, Betty said. AllI want is enough to pay me thisweek's salary.     Money, Simon said. When youtook this job you said it was the romancethat appealed to you.     Hm-m-m. I didn't know mostsleuthing amounted to snoopingaround department stores to check onthe clerks knocking down.     Simon said, enigmatically, Nowit comes.  <doc-sep>   Mr. Oyster went on. I've beenconsidering the matter for some timeand\u2014     Simon held up a hand. There'sno use prolonging this. As I understandit, you're an elderly gentlemanwith a considerable fortune and yourealize that thus far nobody has succeededin taking it with him.     Mr. Oyster returned his glasses totheir perch, bug-eyed Simon, but thennodded.     Simon said, You want to hire meto find a time traveler and in somemanner or other\u2014any manner willdo\u2014exhort from him the secret ofeternal life and youth, which you figurethe future will have discovered.You're willing to pony up a part ofthis fortune of yours, if I can delivera bona fide time traveler.     Right!     Betty had been looking from oneto the other. Now she said, plaintively,But where are you going to findone of these characters\u2014especially ifthey're interested in keeping hid?     The old boy was the center again.I told you I'd been considering itfor some time. The      Oktoberfest     ,that's where they'd be! He seemedelated.     Betty and Simon waited.     The      Oktoberfest     , he repeated.The greatest festival the world hasever seen, the carnival,      feria     ,      fiesta     to beat them all. Every year it's heldin Munich. Makes the New OrleansMardi gras look like a quiltingparty. He began to swing into thespirit of his description. It originallystarted in celebration of the weddingof some local prince a centuryand a half ago and the Bavarians hadsuch a bang-up time they've beenholding it every year since. TheMunich breweries do up a specialbeer,      Marzenbr\u00e4u     they call it, andeach brewery opens a tremendous tenton the fair grounds which will holdfive thousand customers apiece. Millionsof liters of beer are put away,hundreds of thousands of barbecuedchickens, a small herd of oxen areroasted whole over spits, millions ofpair of      weisswurst     , a very specialsausage, millions upon millions ofpretzels\u2014     All right, Simon said. We'll acceptit. The      Oktoberfest     is one whaleof a wingding.  <doc-sep>   Well, the old boy pursued, intohis subject now, that's where they'dbe, places like the      Oktoberfest     . Forone thing, a time traveler wouldn'tbe conspicuous. At a festival like thissomebody with a strange accent, orwho didn't know exactly how to wearhis clothes correctly, or was off theordinary in any of a dozen otherways, wouldn't be noticed. You couldbe a four-armed space traveler fromMars, and you still wouldn't be conspicuousat the      Oktoberfest     . Peoplewould figure they had D.T.'s.     But why would a time travelerwant to go to a\u2014 Betty began.     Why not! What better opportunityto study a people than when theyare in their cups? If      you     could goback a few thousand years, the thingsyou would wish to see would be aRoman Triumph, perhaps the Ritesof Dionysus, or one of Alexander'sorgies. You wouldn't want to wanderup and down the streets of, say,Athens while nothing was going on,particularly when you might be revealedas a suspicious character notbeing able to speak the language, notknowing how to wear the clothes andnot familiar with the city's layout.He took a deep breath. No ma'am,you'd have to stick to some greatevent, both for the sake of actualinterest and for protection against beingunmasked.     The old boy wound it up. Well,that's the story. What are your rates?The      Oktoberfest     starts on Friday andcontinues for sixteen days. You cantake the plane to Munich, spend aweek there and\u2014     Simon was shaking his head. Notinterested.     As soon as Betty had got her jawback into place, she glared unbelievinglyat him.     Mr. Oyster was taken aback himself.See here, young man, I realizethis isn't an ordinary assignment,however, as I said, I am willing torisk a considerable portion of myfortune\u2014     Sorry, Simon said. Can't bedone.     A hundred dollars a day plus expenses,Mr. Oyster said quietly. Ilike the fact that you already seemto have some interest and knowledgeof the matter. I liked the way youknew my name when I walked in thedoor; my picture doesn't appear oftenin the papers.     No go, Simon said, a sad qualityin his voice.     A fifty thousand dollar bonus ifyou bring me a time traveler.     Out of the question, Simonsaid.     But      why     ? Betty wailed.     Just for laughs, Simon told thetwo of them sourly, suppose I tellyou a funny story. It goes likethis:      I got a thousand dollars from Mr.Oyster (Simon began) in the wayof an advance, and leaving him withBetty who was making out a receipt,I hustled back to the apartment andpacked a bag. Hell, I'd wanted a vacationanyway, this was a natural. Onthe way to Idlewild I stopped off atthe Germany Information Offices forsome tourist literature.     It takes roughly three and a halfhours to get to Gander from Idlewild.I spent the time planning thefun I was going to have.     It takes roughly seven and a halfhours from Gander to Shannon andI spent that time dreaming up materialI could put into my reports toMr. Oyster. I was going to have togive him some kind of report for hismoney. Time travel yet! What alaugh!     Between Shannon and Munich afaint suspicion began to simmer inmy mind. These statistics I read onthe      Oktoberfest     in the Munich touristpamphlets. Five million peopleattended annually.     Where did five million peoplecome from to attend an overgrownfestival in comparatively remoteSouthern Germany? The tourist seasonis over before September 21st,first day of the gigantic beer bust.Nor could the Germans account forany such number. Munich itself hasa population of less than a million,counting children.     And those millions of gallons ofbeer, the hundreds of thousands ofchickens, the herds of oxen. Whoponied up all the money for such expenditures?How could the averageGerman, with his twenty-five dollarsa week salary?     In Munich there was no hotelspace available. I went to the Bahnhofwhere they have a hotel serviceand applied. They put my namedown, pocketed the husky bribe,showed me where I could check mybag, told me they'd do what theycould, and to report back in a fewhours.     I had another suspicious twinge.If five million people attended thisbeer bout, how were they accommodated?     The      Theresienwiese     , the fairground, was only a few blocksaway. I was stiff from the plane rideso I walked. "

        "Query": "What are the defining traits of Arth, and who is he?",
        "Summary_1": "Arth is a bald man at Oktoberfest. He is first introduced as a bald-headed drunk who sits across from Simon. They share a beer together and toast. After, Arth makes a note to write down the name engraved on his mug in a small notebook with a pencil. When Simon asks if he is German, Arth accidentally responds that his pencil is Venusian. Arth is very determined to fulfill his pilgrimage of trying every single beer at Oktoberfest, but he is disappointed that he will never make it. Simon asks him where he is from when they go to another tent, and Arth responds that he is from 2183 South St in New Albuquerque; it is situated right across Old Albuquerque. Arth also has a kind side to him, as he offers to take Simon to his hotel to rest for the night. He even offers Simon a box of pills to help with his hangover. When they go back to drinking again, he looks at Simon cautiously when the latter does not remember where he spent the night. Arth looks at Simon strangely as he goes back, even though he is initially portrayed as a friendly and kind bald man. ",
        "Summary_2": "According to Simon's story, Arth is a time traveler that Simon meets in Oktoberfest. He is bald. He has a small notebook and a Venusian pencil in his pocket. He is from 2183 South Street, New Albuquerque. He is a vegetarian. He meets Simon, a detective who comes to Oktoberfest to search for time travelers, in a tent in Oktoberfest. He invites Simon to go to his place when he knows that Simon has no place to stay. He resets the time when he wakes up the following morning and realizes that he may leak information about his identity to Simon. He gives Simon a pill and sends him out after resetting the time.",
        "Summary_3": "Arth is a fellow Oktoberfest go-er that Simon meets at one the brewery tents, who is on a pilgrimage to try every beer from the seven best brands, but has only made it so far as the Lowenbrau beer. He and Simon set off together as a pair to try the rest of the beers. In making conversation, we find out that Arth often slips in what he says. For example, when writing down the beers he is trying, Simon inquires about the odd type of pencil he is using and assumes it is German, but Arth corrects him and says that it is Venusian. As an afterthought, Arth says that he should not have said that. Similarly, when Simon asks where Arth is from, Arth simply says \u20182183\u2019 before correcting it to a supposed street address in New Albuquerque. \n\nAfter a couple more beers, Arth brings Simon back to his hotel room as Simon has yet to find one himself. The next morning, Arth expresses regret and stupidity towards himself for bringing Simon back and hands him a pill - supposedly aspirin - for Simon\u2019s hangover. The next day, as Simon continues nursing his hangover, Arth details the memories of last night cautiously to Simon and they end up saying their goodbyes. Overall, Arth appears to marvel at Oktoberfest in an odd way. He also seems to be cautious - oftentimes slipping up with revealing too much or a certain information and regrettably having to correct it. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Arth is described as a bald man, who seems to be very drunk when Simon befriends him at the festival. Throughout the story, it becomes clearer and clearer that Arth is a time traveler. He said he is from 2183, probably referring to his year, as well as referring to his pen as being \u201cvenusian\u201d. Arth is on a pilgrimage to complete the 7 tents within the festival, as he wanted to experience the greatest festival ever. He ends up taking Simon to the future with him, but when he realizes his mistake sends Simon back to the present using a pill. ",
        "Article": "  Somewhere along in here the fogrolled in. When it rolled out again,I found myself closing one eye thebetter to read the lettering on myearthenware mug. It read Augustinerbr\u00e4u.Somehow we'd evidentlynavigated from one tent to another.     Arth was saying, Where's yourhotel?     That seemed like a good question.I thought about it for a while. FinallyI said, Haven't got one. Town'sjam packed. Left my bag at the Bahnhof.I don't think we'll ever makeit, Arth. How many we got togo?     Lost track, Arth said. You cancome home with me.     We drank to that and the fog rolledin again.     When the fog rolled out, it wasdaylight. Bright, glaring, awful daylight.I was sprawled, complete withclothes, on one of twin beds. On theother bed, also completely clothed,was Arth.     That sun was too much. I stumbledup from the bed, staggered tothe window and fumbled around fora blind or curtain. There was none.     Behind me a voice said in horror,Who ... how ... oh,      Wodo     ,where'd you come from?     I got a quick impression, lookingout the window, that the Germanswere certainly the most modern, futuristicpeople in the world. But Icouldn't stand the light. Where'sthe shade, I moaned.     Arth did something and the windowwent opaque.     That's quite a gadget, I groaned.If I didn't feel so lousy, I'dappreciate it.     Arth was sitting on the edge ofthe bed holding his bald head in hishands. I remember now, he sorrowed.You didn't have a hotel.What a stupidity. I'll be phased.Phased all the way down.     You haven't got a handful ofaspirin, have you? I asked him.     Just a minute, Arth said, staggeringerect and heading for whatundoubtedly was a bathroom. Staywhere you are. Don't move. Don'ttouch anything.     All right, I told him plaintively.I'm clean. I won't mess up theplace. All I've got is a hangover, notlice.     Arth was gone. He came back intwo or three minutes, box of pills inhand. Here, take one of these.     I took the pill, followed it with aglass of water.  <doc-sep>   And went out like a light.     Arth was shaking my arm. Wantanother      mass     ?     The band was blaring, and fivethousand half-swacked voices wereroaring accompaniment.     In Muenchen steht ein Hofbr\u00e4uhaus!      Eins, Zwei, G'sufa!      At the      G'sufa     everybody uppedwith their king-size mugs and drankeach other's health.     My head was killing me. This iswhere I came in, or something, Igroaned.     Arth said, That was last night.He looked at me over the rim of hisbeer mug.     Something, somewhere, waswrong. But I didn't care. I finishedmy      mass     and then remembered. I'vegot to get my bag. Oh, my head.Where did we spend last night?     Arth said, and his voice soundedcautious, At my hotel, don't you remember?     Not very well, I admitted. Ifeel lousy. I must have dimmed out.I've got to go to the Bahnhof andget my luggage.     Arth didn't put up an argumenton that. We said good-by and I couldfeel him watching after me as I pushedthrough the tables on the wayout.     At the Bahnhof they could do meno good. There were no hotel roomsavailable in Munich. The head wasgetting worse by the minute. Thefact that they'd somehow managedto lose my bag didn't help. I workedon that project for at least a coupleof hours. Not only wasn't the bagat the luggage checking station, butthe attendant there evidently couldn'tmake heads nor tails of the checkreceipt. He didn't speak English andmy high school German was inadequate,especially accompanied by ablockbusting hangover.     I didn't get anywhere tearing myhair and complaining from one endof the Bahnhof to the other. I drewa blank on the bag.     And the head was getting worseby the minute. I was bleeding todeath through the eyes and insteadof butterflies I had bats in my stomach.Believe me,      nobody     should drinka gallon or more of Marzenbr\u00e4u.  <doc-sep>   There are seven major brewers inthe Munich area, each of them representedby one of the circuslike tentsthat Mr. Oyster mentioned. Each tentcontained benches and tables forabout five thousand persons and fromsix to ten thousands pack themselvesin, competing for room. In the centeris a tremendous bandstand, themusicians all      lederhosen     clad, themusic as Bavarian as any to be foundin a Bavarian beer hall. Hundreds ofpeasant garbed      fr\u00e4uleins     darted aboutthe tables with quart sized earthenwaremugs, platters of chicken, sausage,kraut and pretzels.     I found a place finally at a tablewhich had space for twenty-odd beerbibbers. Odd is right. As weird anassortment of Germans and foreigntourists as could have been dreamedup, ranging from a seventy- oreighty-year-old couple in Bavariancostume, to the bald-headed drunkacross the table from me.     A desperate waitress bearing sixmugs of beer in each hand scurriedpast. They call them      masses     , by theway, not mugs. The bald-headedcharacter and I both held up a fingerand she slid two of the      masses     overto us and then hustled on.     Down the hatch, the other said,holding up his      mass     in toast.     To the ladies, I told him. Beforesipping, I said, You know, thetourist pamphlets say this stuff iseighteen per cent. That's nonsense.No beer is that strong. I took a longpull.     He looked at me, waiting.     I came up. Mistaken, I admitted.     A      mass     or two apiece later he lookedcarefully at the name engraved onhis earthenware mug. L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u,he said. He took a small notebookfrom his pocket and a pencil, noteddown the word and returned thethings.     That's a queer looking pencil youhave there, I told him. German?     Venusian, he said. Oops, sorry.Shouldn't have said that.     I had never heard of the brand soI skipped it.     Next is the Hofbr\u00e4u, he said.     Next what? Baldy's conversationdidn't seem to hang together verywell.     My pilgrimage, he told me. Allmy life I've been wanting to go backto an      Oktoberfest     and sample everyone of the seven brands of the bestbeer the world has ever known. I'monly as far as L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u. I'm afraidI'll never make it.     I finished my      mass     . I'll helpyou, I told him. Very noble endeavor.Name is Simon.     Arth, he said. How could youhelp?     I'm still fresh\u2014comparatively.I'll navigate you around. There areseven beer tents. How many have yougot through, so far?     Two, counting this one, Arthsaid.     I looked at him. It's going to bea chore, I said. You've already gota nice edge on.     Outside, as we made our way tothe next tent, the fair looked likeevery big State-Fair ever seen, exceptit was bigger. Games, souvenirstands, sausage stands, rides, sideshows, and people, people, people.     The Hofbr\u00e4u tent was as overflowingas the last but we managed tofind two seats.     The band was blaring, and fivethousand half-swacked voices wereroaring accompaniment.     In Muenchen steht ein Hofbr\u00e4uhaus!      Eins, Zwei, G'sufa!      At the      G'sufa     everybody uppedwith the mugs and drank each other'shealth.     This is what I call a real beerbust, I said approvingly.     Arth was waving to a waitress. Asin the L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u tent, a full quartwas the smallest amount obtainable.     A beer later I said, I don't knowif you'll make it or not, Arth.     Make what?     All seven tents.     Oh.     A waitress was on her way by,mugs foaming over their rims. I gesturedto her for refills.     Where are you from, Arth? Iasked him, in the way of makingconversation.     2183.     2183 where?     He looked at me, closing one eyeto focus better. Oh, he said. Well,2183 South Street, ah, New Albuquerque.     New Albuquerque? Where'sthat?     Arth thought about it. Took anotherlong pull at the beer. Rightacross the way from old Albuquerque,he said finally. Maybe weought to be getting on to thePschorrbr\u00e4u tent.     Maybe we ought to eat somethingfirst, I said. I'm beginning to feelthis. We could get some of that barbecuedox.     Arth closed his eyes in pain.Vegetarian, he said. Couldn't possiblyeat meat. Barbarous. Ugh.     Well, we need some nourishment,I said.     There's supposed to be considerablenourishment in beer.     That made sense. I yelled,       Fr\u00e4ulein!Zwei neu bier!      "

He is invited to the time traveler\u2019s home, and the next day, he is sent out after taking a pill. After leaving the time traveler\u2019s house, he cannot find his bag in the hotel since there is no check receipt to show that his bag has been stored there.

He tries to tell other people that he has the same experience as the story, but no one believes him.",
        "Summary_3": "Simon, the protagonist, is an investigator alongside his assistant, Betty. He is recruited by Mr. Oyster to further investigate and locate a time traveler in Oktoberfest, and exhort a time traveler\u2019s secrets to eternal life in return for a generous sum. Initially described as someone looking to make money, it is surprising that he turns down the opportunity. \n\nHowever, it is revealed through the story that he did initially take the offer. Simon\u2019s disbelief at Mr. Oyster\u2019s insistence of time travelers is attributed as whilst on the plane, Simon plans to embellish and dream up the material in Mr. Oyster\u2019s report. However, he soon begins to have suspicions about the feasibility of such time travelers, as facts like the vast number of people attending Oktoberfest and cost of expenditure in contrast to the location and timing of the festival do not appear to make sense to Simon. \n\nSimon is also described as friendly and open, as he instantly makes conversation with Arth and makes casual conversation with him about his time at Oktoberfest, where he\u2019s from, etc. The two of them fall into an easy companionship and set off to try the rest of the beers together. He is also smart and pragmatic, choosing to cut his losses at Oktoberfest and head back home early. Whilst at the office in discovering that it was the same day as he had supposedly left for Oktoberfest, he demonstrates his intelligence in being able to suss out what had happened to him.  \n",
        "Summary_4": "Simon is a private investigator. He seems to be a very pragmatic person, as he knew exactly what he needed to do in order to get his client happy and comfortable. He also knew how to manage Betty\u2019s expectations, as she wanted him to pay him but he knew what to say in order to make her happy. He also learns from his mistakes, as he already tried to find a time traveler, but he refuses to try again because of the situation that he suffered the first time. \n",

Thereought to be some very quick, positive,definite answer. She said, Well,for one thing, paradox.

Some, Betty admitted.     Then you'll realize that there area dozen explanations of the paradoxesof time travel. Every writer inthe field worth his salt has explainedthem away. But to get on. It's mycontention that within a century orso man will have solved the problemsof immortality and eternal youth, andit's also my suspicion that he willeventually be able to travel in time.So convinced am I of these possibilitiesthat I am willing to gamble aportion of my fortune to investigatethe presence in our era of such timetravelers.     Simon seemed incapable of carryingthe ball this morning, so Bettysaid, But ... Mr. Oyster, if thefuture has developed time travel whydon't we ever meet such travelers?     Simon put in a word. The usualexplanation, Betty, is that they can'tafford to allow the space-time continuumtrack to be altered. If, say, atime traveler returned to a period oftwenty-five years ago and shot Hitler,then all subsequent history would bechanged. In that case, the time travelerhimself might never be born.

He sat down at his desk, passedhis tongue over his teeth in distaste,groaned, fumbled in a drawer for theaspirin bottle.     He looked over at Betty and said,almost as though reciting, What Ineed is a vacation.     What, Betty said, are you goingto use for money?

But before providingvacations it'd be nice if Providenceturned up a missing jewel deal, say.Something where you could deducethat actually the ruby ring had gonedown the drain and was caught in theelbow. Something that would netabout fifty dollars.     Simon said, mournful of tone,Fifty dollars? Why not make it fivehundred?     I'm not selfish, Betty said. AllI want is enough to pay me thisweek's salary.     Money, Simon said. When youtook this job you said it was the romancethat appealed to you.     Hm-m-m.

        "Query": "In what way is Mr. Oyster's original request to find time travelers connected to the story that Simon shares in UNBORN TOMORROW?",
        "Summary_1": "The story that Simon tells relates back to Mr. Oyster\u2019s initial request about time travelers because he is the one who time traveled. Although he calls it a funny story, the sequence of events he describes is all actual events he experiences. The entire purpose of Mr. Oyster\u2019s request and his desire to spend a portion of his fortune is to find a time traveler and come to a conclusion that they exist. However, he fails to realize that the very person he is asking has time traveled. Since the events were repeated three times, Simon\u2019s refusal now changes the flow of events in the near future to avoid a fourth hangover. Even though Mr. Oyster leaves angrily, Simon\u2019s story serves as a true report of time traveling and fulfills Mr. Oyster\u2019s request. ",
        "Summary_2": "Mr. Oyster\u2019s initial request is to find the time traveler in the Oktoberfest in Munich and bring back the secret of eternal youth from them. On the other hand, Simon tells the story about what will happen after accepting the requests and going to Oktoberfest. Simon will not be able to find his accommodation in Munich as there will be too many people to be accommodated. Simon will meet a time traveler and have fun with him. Since they are both drunk, the time traveler will take Simon back to his place and leak some information about the future. On the following day, once the time traveler realizes what he did last night, he will reset the time to where Simon starts and send Simon back. When Simon is back, it will only be him remembering the whole thing. And if Simon tries to tell Mr. Oyster and his clerk about what happened, they will only consider him as ridiculing them since they do not believe the time has been reset. Therefore, the story Simon tells reveals that even if Simon accepts Mr. Oyster\u2019s request and meets a time traveler, he will not be able to bring back the secret of eternal youth but only a severe hangover because the space-time continuum track is not allowed to be changed.",
        "Summary_3": "Simon\u2019s story relates back to Mr. Oyster\u2019s initial request to find time travelers because it confirms Mr. Oyster\u2019s theory: that time travelers exist and they do attend Oktoberfest. To us as readers, the meeting between Mr. Oyster and Simon and Betty in the beginning of the story marks the first time all three of them meet. However, Simon\u2019s story tells us the opposite, that it is actually the second or third time Simon has met Mr. Oyster and completed his request, each time nursing a hangover. \n\nWe find out through Simon that while Mr. Oyster was correct in his insistence at the existence of time travelers, he was wrong in thinking that time travelers would give up the secrets of eternal life and threaten the space-time continuum. In fact, we can see from the interactions between Simon and Arth that time travelers will do whatever it takes to reset the timeline and prevent the space-time continuum from being threatened. It is clear through Simon\u2019s repeat experiences with the same meeting, same day, and same hangover that Simon had investigated a little too closely to the time travelers, and as a consequence, returned back to his office on a reset day, with only his hangover and change from the initial thousand dollars as the only witness to the alternate reality. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Simon\u2019s story begins simply as a story of a trip to Germany to the Oktoberfest. Simon recounts his story of how he met a friend, Arth. In the end, we realize that in fact Arth was a time traveler, and that when Simon went to Arth\u2019s hotel it was in fact the future. We learn that at the time of recounting the story to Mr. Oyster, Simon had already gone to the future with Arth. ",

We'll acceptit. The      Oktoberfest     is one whaleof a wingding.  <doc-sep>   I decided the hell with it. I tooka cab to the airport, presented my returnticket, told them I wanted toleave on the first obtainable plane toNew York. I'd spent two days at the      Oktoberfest     , and I'd had it.     I got more guff there. Somethingwas wrong with the ticket, wrongdate or some such. But they fixedthat up. I never was clear on whatwas fouled up, some clerk's error,evidently.     The trip back was as uninterestingas the one over. As the hangover beganto wear off\u2014a little\u2014I was almostsorry I hadn't been able to stay.If I'd only been able to get a room I      would     have stayed, I told myself.     From Idlewild, I came directly tothe office rather than going to myapartment. I figured I might as wellcheck in with Betty.     I opened the door and there Ifound Mr. Oyster sitting in the chairhe had been occupying four\u2014or wasit five\u2014days before when I'd left.I'd lost track of the time.     I said to him, Glad you're here,sir. I can report. Ah, what was ityou came for? Impatient to hear ifI'd had any results? My mind wasspinning like a whirling dervish ina revolving door. I'd spent a wad ofhis money and had nothing I couldthink of to show for it; nothing butthe last stages of a grand-daddyhangover.     Came for? Mr. Oyster snorted.I'm merely waiting for your girl tomake out my receipt. I thought youhad already left.     You'll miss your plane, Bettysaid.     There was suddenly a double dipof ice cream in my stomach. I walkedover to my desk and looked down atthe calendar.     Mr. Oyster was saying somethingto the effect that if I didn't leave today,it would have to be tomorrow,that he hadn't ponied up that thousanddollars advance for anythingless than immediate service. Stuffinghis receipt in his wallet, he fussedhis way out the door.     I said to Betty hopefully, I supposeyou haven't changed this calendarsince I left.     Betty said, What's the matterwith you? You look funny. How didyour clothes get so mussed? You torethe top sheet off that calendar yourself,not half an hour ago, just beforethis marble-missing client camein. She added, irrelevantly, Timetravelers yet.     I tried just once more. Uh, whendid you first see this Mr. Oyster?     Never saw him before in mylife, she said. Not until he camein this morning.     This morning, I said weakly.     While Betty stared at me as thoughit was      me     that needed candling by ahead shrinker preparatory to beingsent off to a pressure cooker, I fishedin my pocket for my wallet, countedthe contents and winced at thepathetic remains of the thousand.I said pleadingly, Betty, listen,how long ago did I go out that door\u2014onthe way to the airport?     You've been acting sick all morning.You went out that door aboutten minutes ago, were gone aboutthree minutes, and then came back.      See here, Mr. Oyster said (interruptingSimon's story), did yousay this was supposed to be amusing,young man? I don't find it so. Infact, I believe I am being ridiculed.     Simon shrugged, put one hand tohis forehead and said, That's onlythe first chapter. There are twomore.     I'm not interested in more, Mr.Oyster said. I suppose your pointwas to show me how ridiculous thewhole idea actually is. Very well,you've done it. Confound it. However,I suppose your time, even whenspent in this manner, has some value.Here is fifty dollars. And good day,sir!     He slammed the door after himas he left.     Simon winced at the noise, tookthe aspirin bottle from its drawer,took two, washed them down withwater from the desk carafe.     Betty looked at him admiringly.Came to her feet, crossed over andtook up the fifty dollars. Week'swages, she said. I suppose that'sone way of taking care of a crackpot.But I'm surprised you didn'ttake his money and enjoy that vacationyou've been yearning about.     I did, Simon groaned. Threetimes.     Betty stared at him. You mean\u2014     Simon nodded, miserably.     She said, But      Simon     . Fifty thousanddollars bonus. If that story wastrue, you should have gone backagain to Munich. If there was onetime traveler, there might havebeen\u2014     I keep telling you, Simon saidbitterly, I went back there threetimes. There were hundreds of them.Probably thousands. He took a deepbreath. Listen, we're just going tohave to forget about it. They're notgoing to stand for the space-timecontinuum track being altered. Ifsomething comes up that looks likeit might result in the track beingchanged, they set you right back atthe beginning and let things start\u2014foryou\u2014all over again. They justcan't allow anything to come backfrom the future and change thepast.     You mean, Betty was suddenlyfurious at him, you've given up!Why this is the biggest thing\u2014 Whythe fifty thousand dollars is nothing.The future! Just think!     Simon said wearily, There's justone thing you can bring back withyou from the future, a hangover compoundedof a gallon or so of Marzenbr\u00e4u.What's more you can pileone on top of the other, and anotheron top of that!     He shuddered. If you think I'mgoing to take another crack at thismerry-go-round and pile a fourthhangover on the three I'm alreadynursing, all at once, you can thinkagain.

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in A FALL OF GLASS?",
        "Summary_1": "Mr. Humphrey Fownes has been pickpocketed eleven times despite the weather being good. This is because he is an uncommonly preoccupied individual and has constantly been thinking about the weather for the entire day. The first person who pickpockets him is a bogus postman who jostles him while pretending to read a postal card. The next person who pickpockets him is a pretty girl who collides with him. The next people are two men who pretend to be in a heated argument. Humphrey continuously thinks about the weather outside; this allows the police to maintain tight surveillance of him. Lanfierre is one of the people in the orange car and thinks about Humphrey Fownes being unique. He tells Lieutenant MacBride that Fownes\u2019 house sometimes shakes, which makes the other man frown. Lanfierre considers MacBride to be a barbarian because he is cynical and cannot appreciate the peculiar nature of Fownes. He goes on to tell him that the windows all close at the same time in the house. MacBride refuses to believe him and tells him to take a rest, but all of the windows close, and the house suddenly begins to shake. They continue to observe the man; Fownes goes into his house and begins to think about his dinner with Mrs. Deshazaway. The house begins to shake more, and he decides that repairs are a must. During his dinner, Mrs. Deshazaway explains how she will never marry again. The widow is a passionate woman, and she passionately tells him he forgot salt on his potatoes during the explanation of why they cannot marry because of the air. When she continues to refuse him, Fownes brings up the idea of leaving the dome city for freedom. She tells him that if they can leave, then she will let him call her by her first name. After the date, he goes to the library, where the old librarian tries to test him with old library cards. The story then cuts to a movement meeting, where the members discuss how the old society failed and the lack of a sound foreign policy. Fownes impatiently explains that he and his future wife must leave now, to which the leader explains that it is impossible because there is no sound foreign policy. When Fownes returns to the house, he finds MacBride in the doorway with dripping hair. MacBride yells that these are not optimum dome conditions, explaining that Lanfierre is in the upstairs bedroom. The entire dome air supply is going through his bedroom, and a strange black cloud appears. Fownes recognizes this as a Kansas twister and runs towards the next house for Mrs. Deshazaway. The dome glass has begun to fall, destroying the artificial sun and optimum temperature. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story is set in a nameless domed city in the future: it has perfect temperature conditions, its citizens never leave the city's borders and must be conformists, i.e lack any signs of aberration. Mr. Humphrey Fownes is a rather eccentric citizen that caught the attention of the police lieutenants whose job is to maintain normality within the dome\u2019s society. Lanfierre, Dome\u2019s police lieutenant, has been following Fownes for months and is truly impressed by his queerness and eccentricity. \nAt the beginning, together with lieutenant MacBride he collects personal information about Fownes, his parameters, the content of his pockets, etc. While sitting in a car parked near Fownes\u2019 house, Lanfierre tells MacBride about the other strange things that he has witnessed while studying Fownes\u2019 life, for example, that his house is shaking occasionally or that his windows always close at the same moment. MacBride is skeptical but unexpectedly all the windows actually slam shut in one second and the walls start wobbling. At the same time, Fownes is inside the house: after closing the windows he goes down to his closet mechanism that creates an illusion of a sunset with flowers, then adding the rain and wind - the things he believed ancients had. Using that mechanism, he wants to seduce Mrs. Deshazaway, a widow whose four ex-husbands died. During their supper, she states that she won\u2019t marry Mr.Fownes but hints at changing her mind if he gets them both outside the dome. Later, he goes to a library meeting of people that criticize the existence of the dome but they cannot provide Fownes with any useful information regarding leaving the city and going outside. \n\nWhile Fownes is away, the police lieutenants decide to enter his house, and  Lanfierre out of curiosity turns the wheel that switches the closet mechanism and opens the valve of the bootleg pipe connected to the dome air system. Walking back, Fownes sees his house shaking. Desperate, MacBride and Lanfierre ask him if they can stop the wind but Humphrey realizes that there is nothing they can do to stop the entire dome air supply from coming through his room. The wind blows off the roof and creates a twister. MacBride orders Humphrey to stop everything immediately, but Fownes leaves the shocked police and runs happily to Mrs. Deshazaway, screaming and asking for her hand, hoping the twister will get them to the outside world, just like it did in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.\n",
        "Summary_3": "The story follows an eccentric man named Humphrey Fownes that lives inside of a domed city. As Fownes is walking around the neighborhood, it is revealed that he is being tracked by the police for his eccentric nature. The police sent undercover people to pickpocket him and steal anything they could find in his pockets. After this walk and while the police wait outside his car, it is revealed that Fownes built a machine that creates different environments inside his house. Fownes then meets with his neighbor and it is said that he is in love with her, and the environments created in his house are meant to replicate romantic scenarios and get her to marry him. After she says that she will only marry Fownes if they leave the dome together, he goes to the library to find ways to escape the dome. There, he meets with members of the Movement, a group of people that got together in order to protest the reality in which they lived. Here he finds an old book jacket of The Wizard of Oz, which had a twister on the front. After going home, he finds that his house is shaking and his machine is creating a storm of water and wind. He realizes that in his absence the police had entered and broken his machines. After rescuing the two policemen, the storm gets worse and worse and eventually turns into a twister. Fownes realizes that the twister is destroying the dome and eagerly calls to his neighbor to join him in following the twister outside the dome. ",
        "Summary_4": "Humphrey Fownes has been pick-pocketed by the police disguised as the ordinary. He does not notice all the intended bumping because he is weirdly preoccupied with the question of the always optimum weather in the dome. The police target him because his house often shakes heavily, and he is considered a weird person. \n\nHis house shakes because he connects pipes between the dome blower system and his cellar, letting the winds build up in his house, which causes the dancing of the house. He never notices the phenomenon of his home because it always happens when he is in the place and preoccupied with his plan of getting Mrs. Deshazaway, a widow, to marry him. He builds all this mechanism to create an illusion of imaginary ancient romance, hoping to get a slight chance to let Mrs. Deshazaway nod her head. But he constantly fails because she is so scared that the fifth man will die in the marriage with her. Nonetheless, when Humphrey tells her his plan of leaving the dome, she promises him that she will marry him if they can go and live somewhere else with fresher air.\n\nHumphrey goes to the Movement, an organization that wants to protest the lack of a sound foreign policy in the dome. This organization informs members of the goodness of living in the Open Country. Humphrey tries to know how to leave the dome through the Movement, but the leader disappoints him. When he returns home, he sees his house shaking. The two officials are in his place, and one of them turns on the wheel in the bedroom, which leads to the constant winds blowing from the blower system. The winds build up to a certain point that it becomes a twister, which eventually breaks the dome apart. Humphrey\u2019s dream has come true. He runs away to find Mrs. Deshazaway because he can finally marry her.\n",
        "Article": "What is it you wish? he barked. I understood in my discussions withthe other ... ah ... civilian there'd be no further need for theseirritating conferences.     I've just learned you're placing more students abroad, Mr. Gulver. Howmany this time?     Two thousand.     And where will they be going?     Croanie. It's all in the application form I've handed in. Your job isto provide transportation.     Will there be any other students embarking this season?     Why ... perhaps. That's Boge's business. Gulver looked at Retief withpursed lips. As a matter of fact, we had in mind dispatching anothertwo thousand to Featherweight.     Another under-populated world\u2014and in the same cluster, I believe,Retief said. Your people must be unusually interested in that regionof space.     If that's all you wanted to know, I'll be on my way. I have matters ofimportance to see to.     After Gulver left, Retief called Miss Furkle in. I'd like to have abreak-out of all the student movements that have been planned under thepresent program, he said. And see if you can get a summary of whatMEDDLE has been shipping lately.     Miss Furkle compressed her lips. If Mr. Magnan were here, I'm surehe wouldn't dream of interfering in the work of other departments.I ... overheard your conversation with the gentleman from the CroanieLegation\u2014     The lists, Miss Furkle.     I'm not accustomed, Miss Furkle said, to intruding in mattersoutside our interest cluster.     That's worse than listening in on phone conversations, eh? But nevermind. I need the information, Miss Furkle.     Loyalty to my Chief\u2014     Loyalty to your pay-check should send you scuttling for the materialI've asked for, Retief said. I'm taking full responsibility. Nowscat.     The buzzer sounded. Retief flipped a key. MUDDLE, Retief speaking....     Arapoulous's brown face appeared on the desk screen.     How-do, Retief. Okay if I come up?     Sure, Hank. I want to talk to you.     In the office, Arapoulous took a chair. Sorry if I'm rushing you,Retief, he said. But have you got anything for me?     Retief waved at the wine bottles. What do you know about Croanie?     Croanie? Not much of a place. Mostly ocean. All right if you likefish, I guess. We import our seafood from there. Nice prawns in monsoontime. Over a foot long.     You on good terms with them?     Sure, I guess so. Course, they're pretty thick with Boge.     So?     Didn't I tell you? Boge was the bunch that tried to take us over herea dozen years back. They'd've made it too, if they hadn't had a lot ofbad luck. Their armor went in the drink, and without armor they're easygame.     Miss Furkle buzzed. I have your lists, she said shortly.     Bring them in, please.   <doc-sep>   Transcriber's Note:   This etext was produced from Analog March 1962.

By RANDALL GARRETT      I'd been in Ravenhurst's office on the mountain-sized planetoid calledRaven's Rest only twice before. The third time was no better; ShalimarRavenhurst was one of the smartest operators in the Belt, but when itcame to personal relationships, he was utterly incompetent. He couldmake anyone dislike him without trying.     When I entered the office, he was  [3]  sitting behind his mahogany desk,his eyes focused on the operation he was going through with a wineglassand a decanter. He didn't look up at me as he said:     Sit down, Mr. Oak. Will you have some Madeira?     I decided I might as well observe the pleasantries. There was no pointin my getting nasty until he did. Thank you, Mr. Ravenhurst, I will.     He kept his eyes focused on his work: It isn't easy to pour wine on aplanetoid where the gee-pull is measured in fractions of a centimeterper second squared. It moves slowly, like ropy molasses, but you haveto be careful not to be fooled by that. The viscosity is just as lowas ever, and if you pour it from any great height, it will go scootingright out of the glass  [4]  again. The momentum it builds up is enough tomake it splash right out again in a slow-motion gush which gets it allover the place.     Besides which, even if it didn't splash, it would take it so long tofall a few inches that you'd die of thirst waiting for it.     Ravenhurst had evolved a technique from long years of practice.He tilted the glass and the bottle toward each other, their edgestouching, like you do when you're trying to pour beer without putting ahead on it. As soon as the wine wet the glass, the adhesive forces atwork would pull more wine into the wine glass. To get capillary actionon a low-gee asteroid, you don't need a capillary, by any means. Thenegative meniscus on the wine was something to see; the first timeyou see it, you get the eerie feeling that the glass is spinning andthrowing the wine up against the walls by centrifugal force.     I took the glass he offered me (Careful! Don't slosh!) and sipped atit. Using squirt tubes would have been a hell of a lot easier andneater, but Ravenhurst liked to do things his way.     He put the stopper back in the decanter, picked up his own glass andsipped appreciatively. Not until he put it back down on the desk againdid he raise his eyes and look at me for the first time since I'd comein.     Mr. Oak, you have caused me considerable trouble.     I thought we'd hashed all that out, Mr. Ravenhurst, I said, keepingmy voice level.     [5]     So had I. But it appears that there were more ramifications to youraction than we had at first supposed. His voice had the texture ofheavy linseed oil.     He waited, as if he expected me to make some reply to that. WhenI didn't, he sighed slightly and went on. I fear that you haveinadvertently sabotaged McGuire. You were commissioned to preventsabotage, Mr. Oak, and I'm afraid that you abrogated your contract.     I just continued to keep my voice calm. If you are trying to get backthe fee you gave me, we can always take it to court. I don't thinkyou'd win.     Mr. Oak, he said heavily, I am not a fool, regardless of what yourown impression may be. If I were trying to get back that fee, I wouldhardly offer to pay you another one.     I didn't think he was a fool. You don't get into the managerialbusiness and climb to the top and stay there unless you have brains.Ravenhurst was smart, all right; it was just that, when it came topersonal relationships, he wasn't very wise.     Then stop all this yak about an abrogated contract and get to thepoint, I told him.     I shall. I was merely trying to point out to you that it is throughyour own actions that I find myself in a very trying position, and thatyour sense of honor and ethics should induce you to rectify the damage.     My honor and ethics are in fine shape, I said, but my interpretationof the concepts might not be quite  [6]  the same as yours. Get to thepoint.     He took another sip of Madeira.

        "Summary_1": "Mrs. Agnes Deshazaway is a widow who had previously married four men. All of her four husbands died; she claims that she will never marry again. However, she is also considered to be a passionate woman who does everything passionately. Whether it be talking, cooking, dressing, everything about her is passionate. She also has uncontrollable dynamism, and Fownes remarks that he has never known anyone like her. Despite her passion, she is also self-conscious of what other people think of her, telling Fownes that there is a rumor that she is a cannibal. She blames her husbands\u2019 deaths on the air and gets angry when Fownes says that he does not mind. Despite how reluctant she is to marry Fownes, Mrs. Deshazaway also has a hopeful side to her. She is quite attentive when Fownes tells her the possibility of leaving the dome, telling him that she will allow him to marry her if the both of them can leave. ",
        "Summary_2": "Mrs. Deshazaway is a citizen of the domed city and a widow whose four ex-husbands died while being married to her. She\u2019s the love interest of Mr. Humphrey Fownes - he tries to seduce her by making a mechanism that recreates the outside world and later by promising her to get them both outside the dome. She\u2019s a passionate woman who doesn\u2019t like when people gossip about her, fearing that if Humphrey marries her and dies the neighbors will resent her even more. She\u2019s dreaming of going to the open world and breathing fresh air that will allow her new husband to live long",
        "Summary_3": "Mrs. Deshazaway is Fownes' neighbor and love interest. They have supper every night together at her house. She is a widow of 4 husbands, who she believes all died due to the bad quality of air inside the dome. Because of this, she rejects Fownes\u2019 various proposals, and ultimately says that they will only get married if Fownes finds a way to get them out of the dome. She is described as a very passionate and practical woman. She is a very smart woman and she knows of the love that Fownes has for her. ",
        "Summary_4": "Mrs. Deshazaway is a widow who lost her four husbands: Andrew, Curt, Norman, and Alphonse. She is a passionate woman who talks, cooks, and does everything passionately. She is always energetic. She keeps refusing Humphrey Fownes's proposal, a man who falls in love with her ardently. All of her husbands died, and their deaths are blamed on her by the rumors. She believes the cause of their deaths is the bad air in the dome. But she told Humphrey that she refused him because of the ancient custom, which is a lie. The reason is the rumor, not the ancient traditions. She finds out about Humphrey's secret closet of the Master Mechanism, and she is afraid that the official will come to inspect her because of it. When Humphrey told her his plan of leaving the dome with her, she promised him that if he could make it comes true, she would marry him and let him call her \"Agnes.\"",

You see, we're both a bit queer.     I hadn't thought of that, Fownes said quietly.     Oh, it doesn't really matter. I'll join Andrew, Curt, Norman\u2014     That won't be necessary, Fownes said with unusual force. With alldue respect to Andrew, Curt, Norman and Alphonse, I might as well statehere and now I have other plans for you, Mrs. Deshazaway.     But my dear Mr. Fownes, she said, leaning across the table. We'relost, you and I.     Not if we could leave the dome, Fownes said quietly.     That's impossible! How?     In no hurry, now that he had the widow's complete attention, Fownesleaned across the table and whispered: Fresh air, Mrs. Deshazaway?Space? Miles and miles of space where the real-estate monopoly hasno control whatever? Where the      wind     blows across      prairies     ; or isit the other way around? No matter. How would you like      that     , Mrs.Deshazaway?     Breathing somewhat faster than usual, the widow rested her chin on hertwo hands. Pray continue, she said.     Endless vistas of moonlight and roses? April showers, Mrs. Deshazaway.And June, which as you may know follows directly upon April and issupposed to be the month of brides, of marrying. June also lies beyondthe dome.     I see.           And     , Mr. Fownes added, his voice a honeyed whisper, they saythat somewhere out in the space and the roses and the moonlight,the sleeping equinox yawns and rises because on a certain day it's      vernal     and that's when it roams the Open Country where geigers nolonger scintillate.           My.      Mrs. Deshazaway rose, paced slowly to the window and then cameback to the table, standing directly over Fownes. If you can get usoutside the dome, she said, out where a man stays      warm     long enoughfor his wife to get to know him ... if you can do that, Mr. Fownes ...you may call me Agnes.   <doc-sep>   Transcriber's Note:   This etext was produced from Analog March 1962.

        "Query": "What is the backdrop of the story \"A FALL OF GLASS\"?",
        "Summary_1": "The story is set inside a dome city with an artificial sun and optimal weather conditions. Fownes first strolls down a quiet residential avenue lined with private houses. Although the weather is generally cloudless, there are light showers that make small geysers of shiny mist. His house is also noted to be located right next to Mrs. Deshazaway\u2019s house. Inside of an orange car, Lanfierre and MacBride watch him. Fownes\u2019 house has a porch and a bootleg pipe connected into the dome blower system. His downstairs closet contains the Master Mechanism. The illusion he sees is of a red sun setting brightly, marred by an occasional arcover that leaves the scent of ozone. There is a garden outside as well, and a gigantic moon hidden in a large area of the sky. Neon large roses are found in the garden, and their colors change from red to violet. Inside of his bedroom closet upstairs, there is a rainmaker. The outside world that Fownes describes to Mrs. Deshazaway, outside of the dome, is one with miles and miles of space. The real-estate monopoly has no control, and the windows blow across prairies. When Fownes goes to the library, the place is described as a shattered and depressing place. It is used very infrequently, filled with given over government publications and censored old books with holes in them. The librarian's desk has ancient library cards that are almost impossible to read. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story takes place in the future where people live in a domed city. It has perfect climate conditions and its citizens are required to have regulated, non-aberrative lives - this order is maintained by the police. The story starts from a short walk that Mr. Humphrey, an eccentric citizen, takes while coming back to his house. There he again looks at his mechanism, parts of which are connected to the water and air systems of the dome, that creates an illusion of a sunset, strong wind, or rain. He leaves for dinner with Mrs. Deshazaway, a widow with a bad reputation - Humphrey created the mechanism to seduce and marry her. Later, he goes to a meeting of some nonconformists in a library where they talk about the prehistory of the domed society. Walking back, he notices that his building is shaking and soon learns that while he was away the police decided to search his house and one of them switched on the mechanism letting all the dome air supply go through his bedroom. Realizing that nothing can be done and seeing his roof fly off, Humphrey runs to Mrs. Deshazaway, hoping that the appearing twister will take them outside the dome, to some unique new world, like it did in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. \n\n",
        "Summary_3": "The story is set in a dystopian city, where everything seems to be controlled perfectly, including the weather. The city is also inside of a large, glass dome that has robots that constantly fix it as pieces of class constantly fall onto the city below. Fownes\u2019 home is located on a very quiet and residential street, but his house was everything but that. His home is described as an old and large house, with a machine that can change the environment of the house and constantly makes it shake. Part of the story also takes place in a library, which is old and unkempt. ",
        "Summary_4": "People live in the dome where the weather is always optimum, with 59 degrees and 47% humidity. Everyone who lives in the dome must be normal and not act weird. Otherwise, the officials will inspect the queerness and conduct some necessary actions to protect the normality in the dome. A sound foreign policy cannot be formed before, resulting in a confined dome society with no foreign policy. The dome citizens cannot go outside of the dome due to the lack of a sound foreign policy.",

        "Summary_1": "Humphrey Fownes is an interesting man who always seems to be preoccupied with the weather. Despite it being optimal conditions, he does not seem to notice anything around him even when he is being pickpocketed. He owns an assortment of machinery, capable of creating his ideal illusions and even affecting the weather outside. It is revealed that most of this is part of his plan to leave the dome. Fownes is a very persistent person as well, trying his very hardest to convince Mrs. Deshazaway to marry him even after she rejects his offer. He is stubborn, too, especially when the leader of The Movement explains that they cannot just leave the dome without a sound foreign policy. No matter what, he is determined to leave the dome and marry the widow. However, his plans seem to finally come together when MacBride and Lanfierre mess with the wheel in his house. When the dome begins to break, Fownes sees this as an opportunity and becomes excited at the thought of finally leaving this dome and living in the outside world with his future wife. ",

He\u2019s in love with a widow, Mrs. Deshazaway, who has a peculiar reputation, and builds a complex mechanism, which can recreate wind, rain, and smells, in his closet to impress and seduce her. Police lieutenants are watching him because his queer, nonconforming behavior goes against the rules of the dome. He is happy to see a twister that is appearing near his house after the wind and rain mechanisms in his closet go out of control, not realizing its danger and meaning.

He is always in his thoughts, but he is very smart as he was able to make a machine that harnesses water and wind from the city inside his home. He is motivated by his love for his neighbor, and is looking to find ways to get her to marry him.

        "Summary_4": "Humphrey Fownes is a weird man targeted by the officials in the dome. He never sees the weather that is different from the dome\u2019s optimum one, but he admires it. He never perceives the roses and twisters, but he wants to see them in real life. He is weirdly attracted to April in ancient customs because it has thirty days. He wants to marry Mrs. Deshazaway, a widow refusing his proposal because of her four dead husbands. Humphrey is so uncommonly preoccupied that he cannot notice the change and nonnormality of his surroundings even when he has been pick-pocketed many times on the street. He is so weirdly passionate about ancient life that he often goes to the library to study them. He thinks the ancient people are strange as he digs into their lives and customs. Humphrey fiercely falls in love with Mrs. Deshazaway. He creates all the possible romantic settings he can imagine from the ancient documents to marry her. He is also a member of Movement, an organization that gathers people who want to leave the dome.",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]        The weatherman was always right:       Temperature, 59; humidity, 47%;       occasional light showers\u2014but of what?        The pockets of Mr. Humphrey Fownes were being picked outrageously.     It was a splendid day. The temperature was a crisp 59 degrees, thehumidity a mildly dessicated 47%. The sun was a flaming orange ball ina cloudless blue sky.     His pockets were picked eleven times.     It should have been difficult. Under the circumstances it was amasterpiece of pocket picking. What made it possible was HumphreyFownes' abstraction; he was an uncommonly preoccupied individual. Hewas strolling along a quiet residential avenue: small private houses,one after another, a place of little traffic and minimum distractions.But he was thinking about weather, which was an unusual subject tobegin with for a person living in a domed city. He was thinking sodeeply about it that it never occurred to him that entirely too manypeople were bumping into him. He was thinking about Optimum DomeConditions (a crisp 59 degrees, a mildly dessicated 47%) when a boguspostman, who pretended to be reading a postal card, jostled him. In theconfusion of spilled letters and apologies from both sides, the postmanrifled Fownes's handkerchief and inside jacket pockets.  "

        "Query": "What is the importance of the Master Mechanism located in Fownes' downstairs closet and what are its characteristics?",
        "Summary_1": "The Master Mechanism in the downstairs closet is similar to a watch being inside of a great watch case. There is a profusion of wheels surrounding it, and the Mechanism itself is a miniature see-saw that goes back and forth 365-1/4 times an hour. The wheels are salvaged from grandfather\u2019s clocks and music boxes, going around in graceful circles at a rate of 30 to 31 times an hour. However, there is one eccentric cam that goes between 28 and 29. Fownes also sets the time to seven o\u2019clock on April 7th of any year. This Master Mechanism is significant because it is capable of showing the ideal illusion to Fownes. He uses this Mechanism to envision his ideal life outside of the dome, and it gives him the home that he hopes to see instead of the one that he is currently living inside of the dome. These illusions also motivate him to try and find a way to leave the dome with the widow. The Master Mechanism serves as a motivator for Fownes, and it allows him to envision his dreams into a form of reality. ",
        "Summary_2": "Humphrey Fownes has a complex Master Mechanism in his downstairs closet. It consists of various wheels surrounding a miniature see-saw and allows him to choose a date and a time of the day and experience the weather conditions at this very moment. Together with the bedroom wheels, he can create an illusion of a rainy, windy April evening, he can smell roses and listen to a romantic song about love. He wants to use this mechanism to make Mrs. Deshazaway, a passionate widow living next door, fall in love with him and get married. At the end of the story, when the police officer unknowingly switches the mechanism, making the wind and water work in the full-power mode, which soon makes the wind currents uncontrollable, this mechanism destroys Fownes\u2019 roof and creates a twister that jeopardizes the infrastructure of the entire city and the dome\u2019s integrity. ",
        "Summary_3": "The Master Mechanism is a machine inside of Fownes\u2019 house. The machine was made by Fownes himself, and is made from wheels, gears and tubes. The machines allow Fownes to harness the water and wind from the city and create different environments inside of the house. Fownes made this machine in order to create romantic scenarios and get Mrs. Deshazaway to marry him. At the end, the two policemen destroy the machine and it ends up destroying Fownes\u2019 home by creating a twister. This twister also ends up destroying the dome and allows Fownes and Mrs. Deshazaway a way out. ",
        "Summary_4": "The closet is like a big watch case. Many wheels inside surround a miniature see-saw that goes back and forth 365-4/1 times an hour, the Master Mechanism. The wheels are old, coming from old grandfather\u2019s clocks or music boxes and moving gracefully at the same speed, except for one that moves eccentrically slower than the others. This machine enables Fownes to create an illusion that depicts his imaginary ancient nature. In addition, this closet connects to a pipe in the bedroom, equipped with a wheel that adjusts the flow of winds from the dome blower system. So whenever he turns on the wheel in the bedroom upstairs, the winds will blow through the pipes towards the downstairs closet, building up the air pressure in the room. This connection between the wheel mechanism and the dome blower system is the cause of the house shaking, which eventually creates an artificial twister that breaks the dome, enabling Fownes to go outside of the dome, which has been his wish from the beginning of the story.",
        "Article": "Fownes stopped on the porch to brush the plaster of paris off hisshoes. He hadn't seen the patrol car and this intense preoccupationof his was also responsible for the dancing house\u2014he simply hadn'tnoticed. There was a certain amount of vibration, of course. Hehad a bootleg pipe connected into the dome blower system, and thehigh-pressure air caused some buffeting against the thin walls of thehouse. At least, he called it buffeting; he'd never thought to watchfrom outside.     He went in and threw his jacket on the sofa, there being no roomleft in the closets. Crossing the living room he stopped to twist adraw-pull.     Every window slammed shut.     Tight as a kite, he thought, satisfied. He continued on toward thecloset at the foot of the stairs and then stopped again. Was thatright? No,      snug as a hug in a rug     . He went on, thinking:      The olddevils.       The downstairs closet was like a great watch case, a profusion ofwheels surrounding the Master Mechanism, which was a miniature see-sawthat went back and forth 365-1/4 times an hour. The wheels had acurious stateliness about them.

Hewatched as they spun and flashed in the darkness, and then set them forseven o'clock in the evening, April seventh, any year.     Outside, the domed city vanished.     It was replaced by an illusion. Or, as Fownes hoped it might appear,the illusion of the domed city vanished and was replaced by a moresatisfactory, and, for his specific purpose, more functional, illusion.Looking through the window he saw only a garden.     Instead of an orange sun at perpetual high noon, there was a red sunsetting brilliantly, marred only by an occasional arcover which leftthe smell of ozone in the air. There was also a gigantic moon. It hid ahuge area of sky, and it sang. The sun and moon both looked down upon agarden that was itself scintillant, composed largely of neon roses.     Moonlight, he thought, and roses. Satisfactory.      And cocktails fortwo.     Blast, he'd never be able to figure that one out! He watched asthe moon played,      Oh, You Beautiful Doll     and the neon roses flashedslowly from red to violet, then went back to the closet and turned onthe scent. The house began to smell like an immensely concentrated roseas the moon shifted to      People Will Say We're In Love     .   <doc-sep> Verana snapped her fingers. So that's why the aliens read Marie'smind! They wanted to learn our language so they could talk to us!     Kane whirled in a complete circle, glaring at each of the four walls.Where are you?      Who     are you?     I'm located in a part of the ship you can't reach. I'm a machine.     Is anyone else aboard besides ourselves?     No. I control the ship. Although the voice spoke without stiltedphrases, the tone was cold and mechanical.     What are your\u2014your masters going to do with us? Marie askedanxiously.     You won't be harmed. My masters merely wish to question and examineyou. Thousands of years ago, they wondered what your race would be likewhen it developed to the space-flight stage. They left this ship onyour Moon only because they were curious. My masters have no animositytoward your race, only compassion and curiosity.     I remembered the way antigravity rays had shoved Miller from the shipand asked the machine, Why didn't you let our fifth member board theship?     The trip to my makers' planet will take six months. There are food,oxygen and living facilities for four only of your race. I had toprevent the fifth from entering the ship.     Come on, Kane ordered. We'll search this ship room by room and we'llfind some way to make it take us back to Earth.     It's useless, the ship warned us.     For five hours, we minutely examined every room. We had no tools toforce our way through solid metal walls to the engine or control rooms.The only things in the ship that could be lifted and carried about werethe containers of food and alien games. None were sufficiently heavy orhard enough to put even a scratch in the heavy metal.   <doc-sep> He rubbed his chin critically. It      seemed     all right. A dreamy sunset,an enchanted moon, flowers, scent.     They were all purely speculative of course. He had no idea how a rosereally smelled\u2014or looked for that matter. Not to mention a moon. Butthen, neither did the widow. He'd have to be confident, assertive.      Insist     on it. I tell you, my dear, this is a genuine realisticromantic moon. Now, does it do anything to your pulse? Do you feel icyfingers marching up and down your spine?     His own spine didn't seem to be affected. But then he hadn't read thatbook on ancient mores and courtship customs.     How really odd the ancients were. Seduction seemed to be an incrediblylong and drawn-out process, accompanied by a considerable amountof falsification. Communication seemed virtually impossible. Nomeant any number of things, depending on the tone of voice and thecircumstances. It could mean yes, it could mean ask me again later onthis evening.     He went up the stairs to the bedroom closet and tried the rain-maker,thinking roguishly:      Thou shalt not inundate.     The risks he was taking!A shower fell gently on the garden and a male chorus began to chant      Singing in the Rain     . Undiminished, the yellow moon and the red suncontinued to be brilliant, although the sun occasionally arced over anddemolished several of the neon roses.     The last wheel in the bedroom closet was a rather elegant steeringwheel from an old 1995 Studebaker. This was on the bootleg pipe; hegingerly turned it.     Far below in the cellar there was a rumble and then the soft whistle ofwinds came to him.     He went downstairs to watch out the living room window. This wasimportant; the window had a really fixed attitude about air currents.The neon roses bent and tinkled against each other as the wind rose andthe moon shook a trifle as it whispered      Cuddle Up a Little Closer     .     He watched with folded arms, considering how he would start.      My dearMrs. Deshazaway.     Too formal. They'd be looking out at the romanticgarden; time to be a bit forward.      My very dear Mrs. Deshazaway.     No.Contrived. How about a simple,      Dear Mrs. Deshazaway     . That might beit.      I was wondering, seeing as how it's so late, if you wouldn'trather stay over instead of going home....       Preoccupied, he hadn't noticed the winds building up, didn't hear theshaking and rattling of the pipes. There were attic pipes connectedto wall pipes and wall pipes connected to cellar pipes, and they madeone gigantic skeleton that began to rattle its bones and dance ashigh-pressure air from the dome blower rushed in, slowly opening theStudebaker valve wider and wider....     The neon roses thrashed about, extinguishing each other. The red sunshot off a mass of sparks and then quickly sank out of sight. The moonfell on the garden and rolled ponderously along, crooning      When theBlue of the Night Meets the Gold of the Day     .     The shaking house finally woke him up. He scrambled upstairs to theStudebaker wheel and shut it off.     At the window again, he sighed. Repairs were in order. And it wasn'tthe first time the winds got out of line.     Why didn't she marry him and save all this bother? He shut it all downand went out the front door, wondering about the rhyme of the months,about stately August and eccentric February and romantic April. April.Its days were thirty and it followed September.      And all the rest havethirty-one.     What a strange people, the ancients!     He still didn't see the orange car parked down the street.  "

He hurries to mark an X on a tree for his position and heads back to the clearing of the temporary camp site. This place is home to the only eleven humans, with Alan, on the planet of Waiamea. Once Alan returns to the site, he observes the killer robots and praises Pete for getting them to work. However, when the robots turn on him, he realizes that the robots must have been programmed to pick up human brain waves. He thinks back to Penny, a girl he married three weeks ago who will be arriving with the rest of the colonists tomorrow. This becomes his reason to live against the killer robots, and he observes the killer robots. He fires into the undergrowth and berates himself for not loading fresh cells in the morning as the robot gets louder. He is injured by one and cries out as he feels himself dying. As the robot comes towards him again, he understands what it means to live and forces himself to keep walking. Alan then hugs the bank as pure electricity arches over him, sliding slowly and away from the machine above. The robot trembles and suddenly falls; this gives Alan an opportunity to tackle it. The two struggle, but Alan takes a hunting knife out and jams it into the robot. He wonders how Pete managed to create these robots so perfectly. Suddenly, he hears an approaching robot and realizes that they communicate with each other even if one of them is jammed. Alan decides to run towards the camp because he realizes that\u2019s where the brain of the robots is located. Shortly after running, he finds himself lost because the camp has not appeared in sight yet. He tries to think back to where the camp could be and narrowly misses getting blasted by one of the killer robots. When he fires the pocket blaster, it cancels out the radio transmission from the computer to the robot; Alan sees this as an opportunity to go towards the headquarters building. His blaster suddenly quits, but he manages to hurl a pile of dirt and insects at the robots. He goes into the room quickly as the robot continues to blast. The robot aims point blank at him as he hurls himself towards the red-clad safety switch. Everything then fades to black.

After walking back, he realizes that the killer robots, that his friend was building and whose main goal was to pick up animals\u2019 and dangerous predators\u2019 brain activity and kill them, have been programmed in a wrong way, and now they are aiming at every living creature, including humans. He sees that the other colonists in the camp were already killed, and Alan himself is accidentally saved by a predator who attacks the robot aiming at him. The metal killers are now moving around the territory, guarding it, and trying to pick up somebody\u2019s brain waves. Remembering his wife Peggy and everyone else who was going to land on the next day, Alan decides to at least try to fight the robots and prevent them from killing everybody on this approaching ship. He runs through the jungle, bruising his arms and legs, getting bitten by insects, and manages to temporarily disable the robot by half-drowning him in the river and stabbing his metal corpus with a knife. When he hears the other robots approaching the river he realizes that they must be connected by radio and, thus, are controlled by the main computer in the camp\u2019s headquarters. He runs back to the camp, firing with his blaster which slows down the robots a little bit. Thinking about the importance of the human species and overcoming excruciating throbbing pain in his limbs, Alan gets to the camp. He runs out of blaster cells but makes his way to the computer room. With a robot aiming right at him Alan jumps towards the safety switch and instantly loses consciousness. Three days later Alan finally wakes up with agonizing pain.

If Mr. Magnan were here, I'm surehe wouldn't dream of interfering in the work of other departments.I ... overheard your conversation with the gentleman from the CroanieLegation\u2014     The lists, Miss Furkle.     I'm not accustomed, Miss Furkle said, to intruding in mattersoutside our interest cluster.     That's worse than listening in on phone conversations, eh? But nevermind. I need the information, Miss Furkle.     Loyalty to my Chief\u2014     Loyalty to your pay-check should send you scuttling for the materialI've asked for, Retief said. I'm taking full responsibility. Nowscat.     The buzzer sounded. Retief flipped a key. MUDDLE, Retief speaking....     Arapoulous's brown face appeared on the desk screen.     How-do, Retief. Okay if I come up?     Sure, Hank. I want to talk to you.     In the office, Arapoulous took a chair. Sorry if I'm rushing you,Retief, he said. But have you got anything for me?     Retief waved at the wine bottles. What do you know about Croanie?     Croanie? Not much of a place. Mostly ocean. All right if you likefish, I guess. We import our seafood from there. Nice prawns in monsoontime. Over a foot long.     You on good terms with them?     Sure, I guess so. Course, they're pretty thick with Boge.     So?     Didn't I tell you? Boge was the bunch that tried to take us over herea dozen years back. They'd've made it too, if they hadn't had a lot ofbad luck. Their armor went in the drink, and without armor they're easygame.     Miss Furkle buzzed. I have your lists, she said shortly.     Bring them in, please.   <doc-sep> I can't take the time to explain it all. I have too much to do. Justthree of us\u2014myself and my two sons. My wife lost her mind. I shouldhave helped her as I'm helping you.     I don't understand, Harry said. I remember people, and things, andwhere are they now? Dead? People can die, but farms, cities....     I haven't the time, the doctor repeated, voice rising. I have to runa world. Three of us, to run a world! I built it as best I could, buthow large could I make it? The money. The years and years of work. Thepeople calling me insane when they found out ... but a few giving memore money, and the work going on. And those few caught like everyoneelse, unprepared when the holocaust started, unprepared and unable toreach my world. So they died. As I knew they would. As they should haveknown they would.     Harry felt the rumbling beneath him. Engines?     You survived, the doctor said. Your wife. A few hundred others inthe rural areas. One other family in your area. I survived becauseI lived for survival, like a mole deep in the earth, expecting thecatastrophe every minute. I survived because I gave up living tosurvive. He laughed, high and thin.     His son said, Please, Dad....     No! I want to talk to someone      sane     ! You and Petey and I\u2014we're allinsane, you know. Three years now, playing God, waiting for some land,any land, to become habitable. And knowing everything, and surroundedby people who are sane only because I made sure they would knownothing. He stepped forward, glaring at Harry. Now do you understand?I went across the country, picking up a few of the few left alive. Mostwere farmers, and even where some weren't I picked the farmers anyway.Because farmers are what we'll need, and all the rest can evolve later.I put you and the others, eighty-six all told, from every section ofthe country, on my world, the only uncontaminated land left. I gaveyou back your old lives. I couldn't give you big crops because wedon't need big crops. We would only exhaust our limited soil with bigcrops. But I gave you vegetable gardens and livestock and, best of all,      sanity     ! I wiped the insane moments from your minds. I gave you peaceand consigned myself, my sons, my own wife....     He choked and stopped.     Stan ran across the room to the switch. Harry watched him, and hisbrain struggled with an impossible concept. He heard the engines andremembered the ocean on two sides; on four sides had he bothered tocheck south and east; on      all     sides if that fence continued to curveinward. Ocean, and there was no ocean in Iowa.     And this wasn't Iowa.       The explosions had ripped the world, and he'd tried to get to town tosave Davie, and there'd been no town and there'd been no people andthere'd been only death and poison in the air and even those few peopleleft had begun to die, and then the truck with the huge trailer hadcome, the gleaming trailer with the little man and his trembling wifeand his two sons....

        "Query": "What are the characteristics of Alan, and who is he?",
        "Summary_1": "Alan is one of the men who have arrived on Waiamea. He ventures around the jungle planet but goes on the run after a programming error with Pete\u2019s robots. Alan is thirty years old, and he married a woman named Peggy three weeks earlier. Initially, he is very afraid of death and tries to protect himself from the robots. However, he does realize his love for Peggy and sees it as a motivation to continue living. He understands what it means to live for the first time in his life, and he becomes a lot more courageous. Instead of giving up, Alan chooses to find a way to defeat the robots. He also shows himself to be intelligent, figuring out that the robots are being controlled by radio transmissions via a computer in the headquarters building. Furthermore, he is capable of using his pocket blaster and knife to defeat one of the robots, even though it could instantly kill him with a single blast. Alan is very resilient as well; he is injured and continues to run around and fight against the robots. Even when the odds are against him, his desire to be with his wife gives him the strength to continue heading towards the headquarters building and flip off the switch. ",
        "Summary_2": "Alan is a thirty-year-old scientist and technician, who arrives on Waimea on a scout-ship with eleven colleagues. During his solo exploration, the reader learns about Alan's behavior, ingenuity, and will for survival. Although he faces numerous challenges, including attacks from carnivores, dangers of the jungle and its poisonous insects, as well as human-built robot exterminators, he perseveres. Alan's mission is to rid Waiamea of potential threats in the face of predators and other creatures to provide the planet with the safety of the life of the arriving colonizers. Throughout the story, the reader learns about the young and beautiful Peggy, Alan's wife, who should soon arrive on Waiamea. Alan, unconsciously in love with his wife, is motivated to stop the attack of robots at any cost, ensuring the safety of incoming people. His unwavering thirst for survival and endurance help the reader to recognize the weight of responsibility lying on Alan\u2019s shoulders and empathize with the main character throughout his tedious and dangerous journey.",
        "Summary_3": "Alan is the main character of the story, and is part of a scouting mission sent to a new planet to test if humans could live there. When the robots that were made to help them kill his crew, he has to find a way to shut them off while fighting them. Throughout the story Alan shows a lot of resilience and pain-tolerance. Even though he is very badly hurt by the robots, he continues fighting in order to save the incoming settlers and see his wife again. He is also very intelligent, using his knowledge to defeat a robot in a mud trap.",
        "Summary_4": "Alan is one of the first 11 colonists that came to the jungle planet Waiamea to explore it and get prepared for the arrival of all the other people. When the killer robots murder his colleagues and become a real danger to every human who is going to step out in the jungle on the next day, he has to think and act quickly. Being fairly intelligent, Alan realizes all the risks, understands the basic working mechanisms of the robots, and even manages to destroy one of them by ensnaring the robot in a trap on a bank and disabling him with a knife. He also understands that the only solution to the problem is switching off the main camp computer that controls all the robots. He is very devoted, brave, and rational, too. Both his love for his wife and realization of his responsibility for the future of humanity push him forward and enable him to overcome pain and save everyone from being killed by robots. ",
        "Article": "  There  was a sudden crashthat hung sharply in the air,as if a tree had been hit bylightning some distance away.Then another. Alan stopped,puzzled. Two more blasts, quicklytogether, and the sound of ascream faintly.     Frowning, worrying about thesounds, Alan momentarily forgotto watch his step until his footsuddenly plunged into an anthill, throwing him to the junglefloor. Damn! He cursed again,for the tenth time, and stooduncertainly in the dimness.From tall, moss-shrouded trees,wrist-thick vines hung quietly,scraping the spongy ground likethe tentacles of some monstroustree-bound octopus. Fitful littleplants grew straggly in theshadows of the mossy trunks,forming a dense underbrush thatmade walking difficult. At middaysome few of the blue sun'srays filtered through to thejungle floor, but now, late afternoonon the planet, the shadowswere long and gloomy.     Alan peered around him at thevine-draped shadows, listeningto the soft rustlings and fainttwig-snappings of life in thejungle. Two short, poppingsounds echoed across the stillness,drowned out almost immediatelyand silenced by anexplosive crash. Alan started,Blaster fighting! But it can'tbe!     Suddenly anxious, he slasheda hurried X in one of the treesto mark his position then turnedto follow a line of similar marksback through the jungle. Hetried to run, but vines blockedhis way and woody shrubscaught at his legs, tripping himand holding him back. Then,through the trees he saw theclearing of the camp site, thetemporary home for the scoutship and the eleven men who,with Alan, were the only humanson the jungle planet, Waiamea.      Stepping through the lowshrubbery at the edge of thesite, he looked across the openarea to the two temporary structures,the camp headquarterswhere the power supplies andthe computer were; and thesleeping quarters. Beyond, nosehigh, stood the silver scout shipthat had brought the advanceexploratory party of scientistsand technicians to Waiameathree days before. Except for afew of the killer robots rollingslowly around the camp site ontheir quiet treads, there was noone about.     So, they've finally got thosethings working. Alan smiledslightly. Guess that means Iowe Pete a bourbon-and-sodafor sure. Anybody who canbuild a robot that hunts by homingin on animals' mind impulses ...He stepped forwardjust as a roar of blue flame dissolvedthe branches of a tree,barely above his head.     Without pausing to think,Alan leaped back, and fellsprawling over a bush just asone of the robots rolled silentlyup from the right, lowering itsblaster barrel to aim directly athis head. Alan froze. My God,Pete built those things wrong!     Suddenly a screeching whirlwindof claws and teeth hurleditself from the smolderingbranches and crashed against therobot, clawing insanely at theantenna and blaster barrel.With an awkward jerk the robotswung around and fired its blaster,completely dissolving thelower half of the cat creaturewhich had clung across the barrel.But the back pressure of thecat's body overloaded the dischargecircuits. The robot startedto shake, then clicked sharplyas an overload relay snappedand shorted the blaster cells.The killer turned and rolled backtowards the camp, leaving Alanalone.     Shakily, Alan crawled a fewfeet back into the undergrowthwhere he could lie and watch thecamp, but not himself be seen.Though visibility didn't makeany difference to the robots, hefelt safer, somehow, hidden. Heknew now what the shootingsounds had been and why therehadn't been anyone around thecamp site. A charred blob lyingin the grass of the clearing confirmedhis hypothesis. His stomachfelt sick.     I suppose, he muttered tohimself, that Pete assembledthese robots in a batch and thenactivated them all at once, probablynever living to realize thatthey're tuned to pick up humanbrain waves, too. Damn!Damn! His eyes blurred andhe slammed his fist into the softearth.     When he raised his eyes againthe jungle was perceptibly darker.Stealthy rustlings in theshadows grew louder with thesetting sun. Branches snappedunaccountably in the trees overheadand every now and thenleaves or a twig fell softly to theground, close to where he lay.Reaching into his jacket, Alanfingered his pocket blaster. Hepulled it out and held it in hisright hand. This pop gunwouldn't even singe a robot, butit just might stop one of thosepumas.     They said the blast with your name on it would findyou anywhere. This looked like Alan's blast.     Slowly Alan looked around,sizing up his situation. Behindhim the dark jungle rustled forbiddingly.He shuddered. Not avery healthy spot to spend thenight. On the other hand, I certainlycan't get to the camp witha pack of mind-activated mechanicalkillers running around.If I can just hold out until morning,when the big ship arrives ...The big ship! GoodLord, Peggy! He turned white;oily sweat punctuated his forehead.Peggy, arriving tomorrowwith the other colonists, thewives and kids! The metal killers,tuned to blast any livingflesh, would murder them theinstant they stepped from theship!      A pretty girl, Peggy, the girlhe'd married just three weeksago. He still couldn't believe it.It was crazy, he supposed, tomarry a girl and then take offfor an unknown planet, with herto follow, to try to create a homein a jungle clearing. Crazy maybe,but Peggy and her green eyesthat changed color with thelight, with her soft brown hair,and her happy smile, had endedthirty years of loneliness andhad, at last, given him a reasonfor living. Not to be killed!Alan unclenched his fists andwiped his palms, bloody wherehis fingernails had dug into theflesh.     There was a slight creak abovehim like the protesting of abranch too heavily laden. Blasterready, Alan rolled over onto hisback. In the movement, his elbowstruck the top of a smallearthy mound and he was instantlyengulfed in a swarm oflocust-like insects that beat disgustinglyagainst his eyes andmouth. Fagh! Waving hisarms before his face he jumpedup and backwards, away fromthe bugs. As he did so, a darkshapeless thing plopped fromthe trees onto the spot where hehad been lying stretched out.Then, like an ambient fungus,it slithered off into the jungleundergrowth.     For a split second the junglestood frozen in a brilliant blueflash, followed by the sharp reportof a blaster. Then another.Alan whirled, startled. Theplanet's double moon had risenand he could see a robot rollingslowly across the clearing in hisgeneral direction, blasting indiscriminatelyat whatever mindimpulses came within its pickuprange, birds, insects, anything.Six or seven others also left thecamp headquarters area andheaded for the jungle, each to aslightly different spot.     Apparently the robot hadn'tsensed him yet, but Alan didn'tknow what the effective rangeof its pickup devices was. Hebegan to slide back into thejungle. Minutes later, lookingback he saw that the machine,though several hundred yardsaway, had altered its course andwas now headed directly forhim.     His stomach tightened. Panic.The dank, musty smell of thejungle seemed for an instant tothicken and choke in his throat.Then he thought of the big shiplanding in the morning, settlingdown slowly after a lonely two-weekvoyage. He thought of abrown-haired girl crowding withthe others to the gangway, eagerto embrace the new planet, andthe next instant a charred nothing,unrecognizable, the victimof a design error or a misplacedwire in a machine. I have totry, he said aloud. I have totry. He moved into the blackness.     Powerful as a small tank, thekiller robot was equipped tocrush, slash, and burn its waythrough undergrowth. Nevertheless,it was slowed by thelarger trees and the thick, clingingvines, and Alan found thathe could manage to keep aheadof it, barely out of blaster range.Only, the robot didn't get tired.Alan did.     The twin moons cast pale, deceptiveshadows that waveredand danced across the junglefloor, hiding debris that trippedhim and often sent him sprawlinginto the dark. Sharp-edgedgrowths tore at his face andclothes, and insects attracted bythe blood matted against hispants and shirt. Behind, the robotcrashed imperturbably afterhim, lighting the night with fitfulblaster flashes as somewinged or legged life came withinits range.     There was movement also, inthe darkness beside him, scrapingsand rustlings and an occasionallow, throaty sound like anangry cat. Alan's fingers tensedon his pocket blaster. Swiftshadowy forms moved quickly inthe shrubs and the growling becamesuddenly louder. He firedtwice, blindly, into the undergrowth.Sharp screams punctuatedthe electric blue discharge asa pack of small feline creaturesleaped snarling and clawingback into the night.      Mentally, Alan tried to figurethe charge remaining in his blaster.There wouldn't be much.Enough for a few more shots,maybe. Why the devil didn't Iload in fresh cells this morning!     The robot crashed on, loudernow, gaining on the tired human.Legs aching and bruised,stinging from insect bites, Alantried to force himself to runholding his hands in front ofhim like a child in the dark. Hisfoot tripped on a barely visibleinsect hill and a winged swarmexploded around him. Startled,Alan jerked sideways, crashinghis head against a tree. Heclutched at the bark for a second,dazed, then his kneesbuckled. His blaster fell into theshadows.     The robot crashed loudly behindhim now. Without stoppingto think, Alan fumbled along theground after his gun, straininghis eyes in the darkness. Hefound it just a couple of feet toone side, against the base of asmall bush. Just as his fingersclosed upon the barrel his otherhand slipped into somethingsticky that splashed over hisforearm. He screamed in painand leaped back, trying franticallyto wipe the clinging,burning blackness off his arm.Patches of black scraped off ontobranches and vines, but the restspread slowly over his arm asagonizing as hot acid, or as fleshbeing ripped away layer bylayer.     Almost blinded by pain, whimpering,Alan stumbled forward.Sharp muscle spasms shot fromhis shoulder across his back andchest. Tears streamed across hischeeks.     A blue arc slashed at the treesa mere hundred yards behind.He screamed at the blast. Damnyou, Pete! Damn your robots!Damn, damn ... Oh, Peggy!He stepped into emptiness.     Coolness. Wet. Slowly, washedby the water, the pain began tofall away. He wanted to lie thereforever in the dark, cool, wetness.For ever, and ever, and ...The air thundered.     In the dim light he could seethe banks of the stream, higherthan a man, muddy and loose.Growing right to the edge of thebanks, the jungle reached outwith hairy, disjointed arms asif to snag even the dirty littlestream that passed so timidlythrough its domain.     Alan, lying in the mud of thestream bed, felt the earth shakeas the heavy little robot rolledslowly and inexorably towardshim. The Lord High Executioner,he thought, in battledress. He tried to stand but hislegs were almost too weak andhis arm felt numb. I'll drownhim, he said aloud. I'll drownthe Lord High Executioner. Helaughed. Then his mind cleared.He remembered where he was.      Alan trembled. For the firsttime in his life he understoodwhat it was to live, because forthe first time he realized that hewould sometime die. In othertimes and circumstances hemight put it off for a while, formonths or years, but eventually,as now, he would have to watch,still and helpless, while deathcame creeping. Then, at thirty,Alan became a man.     Dammit, no law says I haveto flame-out      now     ! He forcedhimself to rise, forced his legsto stand, struggling painfully inthe shin-deep ooze. He workedhis way to the bank and began todig frenziedly, chest high, abouttwo feet below the edge.     His arm where the black thinghad been was swollen and tender,but he forced his hands to dig,dig, dig, cursing and crying tohide the pain, and biting hislips, ignoring the salty taste ofblood. The soft earth crumbledunder his hands until he had asmall cave about three feet deepin the bank. Beyond that thesoil was held too tightly by theroots from above and he had tostop.      The air crackled blue and atree crashed heavily past Alaninto the stream. Above him onthe bank, silhouetting againstthe moons, the killer robot stoppedand its blaster swivelledslowly down. Frantically, Alanhugged the bank as a shaft ofpure electricity arced over him,sliced into the water, and explodedin a cloud of steam. Therobot shook for a second, itsblaster muzzle lifted erraticallyand for an instant it seemed almostout of control, then itquieted and the muzzle againpointed down.     Pressing with all his might,Alan slid slowly along the bankinches at a time, away from themachine above. Its muzzle turnedto follow him but the edge ofthe bank blocked its aim. Grindingforward a couple of feet,slightly overhanging the bank,the robot fired again. For a splitsecond Alan seemed engulfed inflame; the heat of hell singed hishead and back, and mud boiledin the bank by his arm.     Again the robot trembled. Itjerked forward a foot and itsblaster swung slightly away. Butonly for a moment. Then the gunswung back again.     Suddenly, as if sensing somethingwrong, its tracks slammedinto reverse. It stood poised fora second, its treads spinningcrazily as the earth collapsed underneathit, where Alan haddug, then it fell with a heavysplash into the mud, ten feetfrom where Alan stood.     Without hesitation Alanthrew himself across the blasterhousing, frantically locking hisarms around the barrel as therobot's treads churned furiouslyin the sticky mud, causing it tobuck and plunge like a Brahmabull. The treads stopped and theblaster jerked upwards wrenchingAlan's arms, then slammeddown. Then the whole housingwhirled around and around, tiltingalternately up and down likea steel-skinned water monstertrying to dislodge a tenaciouscrab, while Alan, arms and legswrapped tightly around the blasterbarrel and housing, pressedfiercely against the robot's metalskin.     Slowly, trying to anticipateand shift his weight with thespinning plunges, Alan workedhis hand down to his right hip.He fumbled for the sheath clippedto his belt, found it, and extracteda stubby hunting knife.Sweat and blood in his eyes,hardly able to move on the wildlyswinging turret, he felt downthe sides to the thin crack betweenthe revolving housing andthe stationary portion of the robot.With a quick prayer hejammed in the knife blade\u2014andwas whipped headlong into themud as the turret literally snappedto a stop.     The earth, jungle and moonsspun in a pinwheeled blur,slowed, and settled to their properplaces. Standing in the sticky,sweet-smelling ooze, Alan eyedthe robot apprehensively. Halfburied in mud, it stood quiet inthe shadowy light except for anoccasional, almost spasmodicjerk of its blaster barrel. Forthe first time that night Alanallowed himself a slight smile.A blade in the old gear box,eh? How does that feel, boy?     He turned. Well, I'd betterget out of here before the knifeslips or the monster cooks upsome more tricks with whateverit's got for a brain. Digginglittle footholds in the soft bank,he climbed up and stood onceagain in the rustling jungledarkness.     I wonder, he thought, howPete could cram enough braininto one of those things to makeit hunt and track so perfectly.He tried to visualize the computingcircuits needed for theoperation of its tracking mechanismalone. There just isn'troom for the electronics. You'dneed a computer as big as theone at camp headquarters.      In the distance the sky blazedas a blaster roared in the jungle.Then Alan heard the approachingrobot, crunching and snappingits way through the undergrowthlike an onrushing forestfire. He froze. Good Lord!They communicate with eachother! The one I jammed mustbe calling others to help.     He began to move along thebank, away from the crashingsounds. Suddenly he stopped, hiseyes widened. Of course! Radio!I'll bet anything they'reautomatically controlled by thecamp computer. That's wheretheir brain is! He paused.Then, if that were put out ofcommission ... He jerked awayfrom the bank and half ran, halfpulled himself through the undergrowthtowards the camp.     Trees exploded to his left asanother robot fired in his direction,too far away to be effectivebut churning towards himthrough the blackness.     Alan changed direction slightlyto follow a line between thetwo robots coming up fromeither side, behind him. His eyeswere well accustomed to the darknow, and he managed to dodgemost of the shadowy vines andbranches before they could snagor trip him. Even so, he stumbledin the wiry underbrush andhis legs were a mass of stingingslashes from ankle to thigh.     The crashing rumble of thekiller robots shook the night behindhim, nearer sometimes,then falling slightly back, butfollowing constantly, moreunshakable than bloodhoundsbecause a man can sometimes covera scent, but no man can stop histhoughts. Intermittently, likephotographers' strobes, blueflashes would light the jungleabout him. Then, for secondsafterwards his eyes would seedancing streaks of yellow andsharp multi-colored pinwheelsthat alternately shrunk and expandedas if in a surrealist'snightmare. Alan would have topause and squeeze his eyelidstight shut before he could seeagain, and the robots wouldmove a little closer.     To his right the trees silhouettedbriefly against brilliance asa third robot slowly moved upin the distance. Without thinking,Alan turned slightly to theleft, then froze in momentarypanic. I should be at the campnow. Damn, what direction amI going? He tried to thinkback, to visualize the twists andturns he'd taken in the jungle.All I need is to get lost.     He pictured the camp computerwith no one to stop it, automaticallysending its robots inwider and wider forays, slowlywiping every trace of life fromthe planet. Technologically advancedmachines doing the jobfor which they were built, completely,thoroughly, without feeling,and without human mastersto separate sense from futility.Finally parts would wear out,circuits would short, and one byone the killers would crunch toa halt. A few birds would stillfly then, but a unique animallife, rare in the universe, wouldexist no more. And the bones ofchildren, eager girls, and theirmen would also lie, beside arusty hulk, beneath the aliensun.     Peggy!     As if in answer, a tree besidehim breathed fire, then exploded.In the brief flash of theblaster shot, Alan saw the steelglint of a robot only a hundredyards away, much nearer thanhe had thought. Thank heavenfor trees! He stepped back, felthis foot catch in something,clutched futilely at some leavesand fell heavily.     Pain danced up his leg as hegrabbed his ankle. Quickly hefelt the throbbing flesh. Damnthe rotten luck, anyway! Heblinked the pain tears from hiseyes and looked up\u2014into a robot'sblaster, jutting out of thefoliage, thirty yards away.      Instinctively, in one motionAlan grabbed his pocket blasterand fired. To his amazement therobot jerked back, its gun wobbledand started to tilt away.Then, getting itself under control,it swung back again to faceAlan. He fired again, and againthe robot reacted. It seemed familiarsomehow. Then he rememberedthe robot on the riverbank, jiggling and swaying forseconds after each shot. Ofcourse! He cursed himself formissing the obvious. The blasterstatic blanks out radiotransmission from the computerfor a few seconds. They even doit to themselves!     Firing intermittently, hepulled himself upright and hobbledahead through the bush.The robot shook spasmodicallywith each shot, its gun tilted upwardat an awkward angle.     Then, unexpectedly, Alan sawstars, real stars brilliant in thenight sky, and half dragging hisswelling leg he stumbled out ofthe jungle into the camp clearing.Ahead, across fifty yards ofgrass stood the headquartersbuilding, housing the robot-controllingcomputer. Still firing atshort intervals he started acrossthe clearing, gritting his teethat every step.     Straining every muscle inspite of the agonizing pain, Alanforced himself to a limping runacross the uneven ground, carefullyavoiding the insect hillsthat jutted up through the grass.From the corner of his eye hesaw another of the robots standingshakily in the dark edge ofthe jungle waiting, it seemed,for his small blaster to run dry.     Be damned! You can't winnow! Alan yelled between blastershots, almost irrational fromthe pain that ripped jaggedlythrough his leg. Then it happened.A few feet from thebuilding's door his blaster quit.A click. A faint hiss when hefrantically jerked the triggeragain and again, and the spentcells released themselves fromthe device, falling in the grassat his feet. He dropped the uselessgun.     No! He threw himself onthe ground as a new robot suddenlyappeared around the edgeof the building a few feet away,aimed, and fired. Air burnedover Alan's back and ozone tingledin his nostrils.     Blinding itself for a few secondswith its own blaster static,the robot paused momentarily,jiggling in place. In thisinstant, Alan jammed his handsinto an insect hill and hurled thepile of dirt and insects directlyat the robot's antenna. In a flash,hundreds of the winged thingserupted angrily from the hole ina swarming cloud, each part ofwhich was a speck of lifetransmitting mental energy to therobot's pickup devices.     Confused by the sudden dispersionof mind impulses, therobot fired erratically as Alancrouched and raced painfully forthe door. It fired again, closer,as he fumbled with the lockrelease. Jagged bits of plastic andstone ripped past him, torn looseby the blast.     Frantically, Alan slammedopen the door as the robot, sensinghim strongly now, aimedpoint blank. He saw nothing, hismind thought of nothing but thered-clad safety switch mountedbeside the computer. Time stopped.There was nothing else inthe world. He half-jumped, half-felltowards it, slowly, in tenthsof seconds that seemed measuredout in years.     The universe went black.     Later. Brilliance pressed uponhis eyes. Then pain returned, amulti-hurting thing that crawledthrough his body and draggedragged tentacles across hisbrain. He moaned.     A voice spoke hollowly in thedistance. He's waking. Call hiswife.     Alan opened his eyes in awhite room; a white light hungover his head. Beside him, lookingdown with a rueful smile,stood a young man wearingspace medical insignia. Yes,he acknowledged the question inAlan's eyes, you hit the switch.That was three days ago. Whenyou're up again we'd all like tothank you.     Suddenly a sobbing-laughinggreen-eyed girl was pressedtightly against him. Neither ofthem spoke. They couldn't. Therewas too much to say.

For this was the thinking machine beside which the Marks and Eniacs andManiacs and Maddidas and Minervas and Mimirs were less than Morons.This was the machine with a million times as many synapses as the humanbrain, the machine that remembered by cutting delicate notches in therims of molecules (instead of kindergarten paper-punching or the ConeyIsland shimmying of columns of mercury). This was the machine that hadgiven instructions on building the last three-quarters of itself. Thiswas the goal, perhaps, toward which fallible human reasoning and biasedhuman judgment and feeble human ambition had evolved.       This was the machine that really thought\u2014a million-plus!       This was the machine that the timid cyberneticists and stuffyprofessional scientists had said could not be built. Yet this was themachine that the Thinkers, with characteristic Yankee push,      had     built. And nicknamed, with characteristic Yankee irreverence andgirl-fondness, Maizie.     Gazing up at it, the President of the United States felt a chordplucked within him that hadn't been sounded for decades, the dark andshivery organ chord of his Baptist childhood. Here, in a strange sense,although his reason rejected it, he felt he stood face to face withthe living God: infinitely stern with the sternness of reality, yetinfinitely just. No tiniest error or wilful misstep could ever escapethe scrutiny of this vast mentality. He shivered.   <doc-sep>    PRIME DIFFERENCE     By ALAN E.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]        Being two men rolled out of one would solve       my problems\u2014but which one would I be?        I suppose that every guy reaches a point once in his lifetime when hegets one hundred and forty per cent fed up with his wife.     Understand now\u2014I've got nothing against marriage or any thinglike that. Marriage is great. It's a good old red-blooded AmericanInstitution. Except that it's got one defect in it big enough to throwa cat through, especially when you happen to be married to a womanlike Marge\u2014     It's so      permanent     .     Oh, I'd have divorced Marge in a minute if we'd been living in theBlissful 'Fifties\u2014but with the Family Solidarity Amendment of 1968,and all the divorce taxes we have these days since the women gottheir teeth into politics, to say nothing of the Aggrieved SpouseCompensation Act, I'd have been a pauper for the rest of my life ifI'd tried it. That's aside from the social repercussions involved.     You can't really blame me for looking for another way out. But a manhas to be desperate to try to buy himself an Ego Prime.     So, all right, I was desperate. I'd spent eight years trying to keepMarge happy, which was exactly seven and a half years too long.     Marge was a dream to look at, with her tawny hair and her sulky eyesand a shape that could set your teeth chattering\u2014but that was wherethe dream stopped.     She had a tongue like a #10 wood rasp and a list of grievances longenough to paper the bedroom wall. When she wasn't complaining, she wascrying, and when she wasn't crying, she was pointing out in chillingdetail exactly where George Faircloth fell short as a model husband,which happened to be everywhere. Half of the time she had a beastlyheadache (for which I was personally responsible) and the other halfshe was sore about something, so ninety-nine per cent of the time wegot along like a couple of tomcats in a packing case.

        "Query": "What capabilities do the deadly robots possess in SURVIVAL TACTICS?",
        "Summary_1": "The killer robots work by homing in on the mind of animals\u2019 impulses. However, due to mass production, robots are also capable of picking up human brain waves. The robots are also capable of firing beams from its blaster, as one had dissolved a cat creature\u2019s entire lower half when it clung onto the robot. The blaster aim is almost always perfect unless the robot\u2019s radio wave or discharge circuit is interrupted. One of its features is also a pickup device. The robots can move around quietly, too, as their original purpose was to guard the campsite. When Alan continues to escape from them, it is revealed that the robots can communicate with each other and the camp computer. The communication works by using radio waves, but it is possible to interrupt these waves using a pocket blaster. ",
        "Summary_2": "Killer robots are the invention of one of the scientists from Alan's team. Their fundamental feature is the elimination of the particularly dangerous living creatures to ensure the safe residence of people on an unknown planet. They respond to brain impulses and shoot towards a live target. Although the scientists believed that robots were programmed to kill only animals, birds, and insects that lived in the jungle and carried an immediate danger to humans, Alan understands from his own experience that robots are defective. Armed with electric blasters, small exterminators move on quiet tracks for better contact with the ground, the killer robots immediately becoming the main danger for people living there. When one of their fighters falls, they can communicate via radio transmitters. Wirelessly, the robots summon new robots to the battlefield for assistance. However, during the fight, Alan deduces that the robots need a few seconds to reset the sight and debug the direction of the shot. Moreover, Alan throws a handful of dirt with swarming insects at the robot, which confuses the robot's settings, making it adjust its aim in the direction of its primary target, winning Alan a few seconds to retreat and save the planet. ",
        "Summary_3": "The killer robots are robots that were made by the exploration crew in order to have them hunt and kill the native animals of the planet. These robots don\u2019t rely on a camera for vision, instead they sense live creatures using their heartbeats and other types of characteristics. They can also communicate with each other, which is how Alan was found by the other robots after defeating the first one. They hold large blasters and are controlled by the ship\u2019s main computer. Alan was able to defeat them by shutting down the computer of the ship. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Alan\u2019s colleague, Pete,  has been assembling killer robots that would hunt animals by picking up their brain waves and quickly locating the animal. Apparently, he hasn\u2019t excluded humans\u2019 brain activity from the robots\u2019 targets. Now, these metal killers are taught to kill all living flesh, including people. They have blaster barrels, move around on quiet treads, can communicate via radio, and are automatically controlled by the main camp computer. The radio transmission is disrupted by blaster static blanks which disables the robots for a few seconds. The only way to turn them off is to disconnect them from the computer or switch off the computer itself. ",

He felt in thecontainer of his helmet, extracted a couple of food tablets, and poppedthem into his mouth.     They would take care of his needs, but they didn't satisfy his hunger.No food tablets for him after this! Steaks, wines, souffles.... Hismouth began to water at the very thought.     And then the robot rolled on soundless wheels into the room. Symewhirled and saw it only when it was almost upon him. The thing wasremarkably lifelike, and for a moment he was startled.     But it was not alive. It was only a Martian feeding-machine, kept inrepair all these millennia by other robots. It was not intelligent,and so it did not know that its masters would never return. It did notknow, either, that Syme was not a Martian, or that he wanted a steak,and not the distilled liquor of the      xopa     fungus, which still grew inthe subterranean gardens of Kal-Jmar. It was capable only of receivingthe mental impulse of hunger, and of responding to that impulse.     And so when Syme saw it and opened his mouth in startlement, therobot acted as it had done with its degenerate, slothful masters. Itsflexible feeding tube darted out and half down the man's gullet beforehe could move to avoid it. And down Syme Rector's throat poured a floodof      xopa     -juice, nectar to Martians, but swift, terrible death to humanbeings....     Outside, the last doorway to Kal-Jmar closed forever, across from thecold body of Tate.    <doc-sep> It took three tries before I got through to a hurried-looking femalereceptionist My name is Rice! I bellowed. Edmund Rice! I live on thehundred and fifty-third floor! I just rang for the elevator and\u2014\u2014     The-elevator-is-disconnected. She said it very rapidly, as though shewere growing very used to saying it.     It only stopped me for a second. Disconnected? What do you meandisconnected? Elevators don't      get     disconnected! I told her.     We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible, she rattled. My bellowingwas bouncing off her like radiation off the Project force-screen.     I changed tactics. First I inhaled, making a production out of it,giving myself a chance to calm down a bit. And then I asked, asrationally as you could please, Would you mind terribly telling me      why     the elevator is disconnected?     I-am-sorry-sir-but-that\u2014\u2014     Stop, I said. I said it quietly, too, but she stopped. I saw herlooking at me. She hadn't done that before, she'd merely gazed blanklyat her screen and parroted her responses.     But now she was actually looking at      me     .     I took advantage of the fact. Calmly, rationally, I said to her, Iwould like to tell you something, Miss. I would like to tell you justwhat you people have done to me by disconnecting the elevator. You haveruined my life.     She blinked, open-mouthed. Ruined your life?     Precisely. I found it necessary to inhale again, even more slowlythan before. I was on my way, I explained, to propose to a girl whomI dearly love. In every way but one, she is the perfect woman. Do youunderstand me?     She nodded, wide-eyed. I had stumbled on a romantic, though I was toopreoccupied to notice it at the time.     In every way but one, I continued. She has one small imperfection,a fixation about punctuality. And I was supposed to meet her at teno'clock.      I'm late!      I shook my fist at the screen. Do you realizewhat you've      done     , disconnecting the elevator? Not only won't shemarry me, she won't even      speak     to me! Not now! Not after this!     Sir, she said tremulously, please don't shout.     I'm not shouting!     Sir, I'm terribly sorry. I understand your\u2014     You      understand     ? I trembled with speechless fury.     She looked all about her, and then leaned closer to the screen,revealing a cleavage that I was too distraught at the moment to payany attention to. We're not supposed to give this information out,sir, she said, her voice low, but I'm going to tell you, so you'llunderstand why we had to do it. I think it's perfectly awful that ithad to ruin things for you this way. But the fact of the matter is\u2014she leaned even closer to the screen\u2014there's a spy in the elevator.      II     It was my turn to be stunned.     I just gaped at her. A\u2014a what?     A spy. He was discovered on the hundred forty-seventh floor, andmanaged to get into the elevator before the Army could catch him. Hejammed it between floors. But the Army is doing everything it can thinkof to get him out.     Well\u2014but why should there be any problem about getting him out?     He plugged in the manual controls. We can't control the elevator fromoutside at all. And when anyone tries to get into the shaft, he aimsthe elevator at them.     That sounded impossible. He      aims     the elevator?     He runs it up and down the shaft, she explained, trying to crushanybody who goes after him.     Oh, I said. So it might take a while.     She leaned so close this time that even I, distracted as I was, couldhardly help but take note of her cleavage. She whispered, They'reafraid they'll have to starve him out.     Oh, no!     She nodded solemnly. I'm terribly sorry, sir, she said. Then sheglanced to her right, suddenly straightened up again, and said,We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible. Click. Blank screen.     For a minute or two, all I could do was sit and absorb what I'd beentold. A spy in the elevator! A spy who had managed to work his way allthe way up to the hundred forty-seventh floor before being unmasked!     What in the world was the matter with the Army? If things were gettingthat lax, the Project was doomed, force-screen or no. Who knew how manymore spies there were in the Project, still unsuspected?     Until that moment, the state of siege in which we all lived had hadno reality for me. The Project, after all, was self-sufficient andcompletely enclosed. No one ever left, no one ever entered. Under ourroof, we were a nation, two hundred stories high. The ever-presentthreat of other projects had never been more for me\u2014or for most otherpeople either, I suspected\u2014than occasional ore-sleds that didn'treturn, occasional spies shot down as they tried to sneak into thebuilding, occasional spies of our own leaving the Project in tinyradiation-proof cars, hoping to get safely within another project andbring back news of any immediate threats and dangers that project mightbe planning for us. Most spies didn't return; most ore-sleds did. Andwithin the Project life was full, the knowledge of external dangersmerely lurking at the backs of our minds. After all, those externaldangers had been no more than potential for decades, since what Dr.Kilbillie called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War.     Dr. Kilbillie\u2014Intermediate Project History, when I was fifteen yearsold\u2014had private names for every major war of the twentieth century.There was the Ignoble Nobleman's War, the Racial Non-Racial War, andthe Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, known to the textbooks of course asWorld Wars One, Two, and Three.     The rise of the Projects, according to Dr. Kilbillie, was the result ofmany many factors, but two of the most important were the populationexplosion and the Treaty of Oslo. The population explosion, of course,meant that there was continuously more and more people but never anymore space. So that housing, in the historically short time of onecentury, made a complete transformation from horizontal expansion tovertical. Before 1900, the vast majority of human beings lived intiny huts of from one to five stories. By 2000,      everybody     lived inProjects. From the very beginning, small attempts were made to makethese Projects more than dwelling places. By mid-century, Projects(also called apartments and co-ops) already included restaurants,shopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners and a host ofother adjuncts. By the end of the century, the Projects were completelyself-sufficient, with food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements,separate floors set aside for schools and churches and factories, robotore-sleds capable of seeking out raw materials unavailable within theProjects themselves and so on. And all because of, among other things,the population explosion.     And the Treaty of Oslo.     It seems there was a power-struggle between two sets of then-existingnations (they were something like Projects, only horizontal instead ofvertical) and both sets were equipped with atomic weapons. The Treatyof Oslo began by stating that atomic war was unthinkable, and addedthat just in case anyone happened to think of it only      tactical     atomicweapons could be used. No      strategic     atomic weapons. (A tacticalweapon is something you use on the soldiers, and a strategic weapons issomething you use on the folks at home.) Oddly enough, when somebodydid think of the war, both sides adhered to the Treaty of Oslo, whichmeant that no Projects were bombed.     Of course, they made up for this as best they could by using tacticalatomic weapons all over the place. After the war almost the wholeworld was quite dangerously radioactive. Except for the Projects. Orat least those of them which had in time installed the force screenswhich had been invented on the very eve of battle, and which deflectedradioactive particles.     However, what with all of the      other     treaties which were broken duringthe Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, by the time it was finished nobodywas quite sure any more who was on whose side. That project over thereon the horizon might be an ally. And then again it might not. Sincethey weren't sure either, it was risky to expose yourself in order toask.     And so life went on, with little to remind us of the dangers lurkingOutside. The basic policy of Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparednesswas left to the Army. The rest of us simply lived our lives and let itgo at that.  "

        "Query": "What is the backdrop of the story SURVIVAL TACTICS?",
        "Summary_1": "The story is set on the jungle planet of Waiamea. There are tall moss-shrouded trees and wrist-thick vines that hang similar to a monstrous tree-bound octopus. Fitful little plants grow straggly in the shadows of the mossy trunks, and the sun is blue. The campsite that Alan goes to houses power supplies, one central computer, and sleeping quarters. There are also a variety of animals that live on the planet. Some of these animals include feline creatures and insects attracted by the scent of blood. The planet also has a double moon when it becomes night time. When Alan escapes from the robot, he ends up in a stream of water and mud. As he runs towards the headquarters building, there is a small insect pile that he takes advantage of against the robot. Inside of the headquarters building, there is a red-clad safety switch mounted beside the computer. During Alan\u2019s recovery, he is in a white room with a white light hanging over him. ",
        "Summary_2": "The action of the story takes place on the jungle planet Waimea. Upon the arrival of the research ship, scientist Alan finds himself in the depths of the dark vines. Alan looks around at the shadows entwined with vines, listening to the quiet rustle and faint crackling of the branches of life in the jungle. As he made his way into the tropical forest at noon, the sun filtered through the branches. As the planet approached evening, the shadows were long and gloomy. As the planet's double moon is visible, Alan sees how the jungle flashed bright blue and then hazes in the blink of an eye. The twin moons cast pale shadows, faintly conveying what was under Alan's feet. He stumbled over hidden debris, and sharp-edged growths tore at his face and clothes while insects attracted by blood clung to his pants and shirt. His arm slipped into something sticky that spread over his forearm, causing him to scream in agony. Black spots scraped off the branches and vines, but the rest slowly spread over his arm, painfully, like hot burning acid. Retreating, Alan stumbled upon the bank of a stream in the dim light of the moons. The banks were loose and muddy. The jungle growing along the edges of the water seemed to be one shaggy whole, complementing the picture with the unknown. As Alan flees from the attacking robots, he notices stars in the distance as a sign that a campsite is nearby. After about fifty yards of grass, there was the headquarters building. Alan wakes up in a bright white room, surrounded by familiar faces.",
        "Summary_3": "The story is located on a planet that humans want to settle on. The planet has a very large jungle, filled with very tall trees and insects. The planet is full of these insects, with Alan using them to his advantage and distracting a Robot. The jungle has a large clearing, which is where the exploration party landed their ship, and where the robots seem to be clustered. The jungle also has a lot of bushes and ferns that have sharp edges, and hurt Alan.",
        "Summary_4": "The story is set in the future where people are moving to another planet called Waiamea. It\u2019s covered in jungle forest and that\u2019s where Alan - one of the first 11 colonists that already landed -  is when he hears some strange blaster noise. After noticing the killing robots at the camp and realizing what situation he is in, Alan runs through the jungle while being chased by a robot and ends up on a stream bank where he manages to disable the metal killer. Then he tries to get back to the camp where he can turn off the main computer controlling these robots. He overcomes different jungle obstacles and fires at robots while trying to get to the computer room. Finally, he jumps towards the switch right before losing consciousness. At the end, three days later, Alan wakes up in a hospital-like white room where he finally hugs his crying wife Peggy after learning from the doctor that he did hit the switch and, thus, the robots are not a danger anymore. \n",

Dr. Kilbillie\u2014Intermediate Project History, when I was fifteen yearsold\u2014had private names for every major war of the twentieth century.There was the Ignoble Nobleman's War, the Racial Non-Racial War, andthe Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, known to the textbooks of course asWorld Wars One, Two, and Three.     The rise of the Projects, according to Dr. Kilbillie, was the result ofmany many factors, but two of the most important were the populationexplosion and the Treaty of Oslo. The population explosion, of course,meant that there was continuously more and more people but never anymore space. So that housing, in the historically short time of onecentury, made a complete transformation from horizontal expansion tovertical. Before 1900, the vast majority of human beings lived intiny huts of from one to five stories. By 2000,      everybody     lived inProjects. From the very beginning, small attempts were made to makethese Projects more than dwelling places. By mid-century, Projects(also called apartments and co-ops) already included restaurants,shopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners and a host ofother adjuncts. By the end of the century, the Projects were completelyself-sufficient, with food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements,separate floors set aside for schools and churches and factories, robotore-sleds capable of seeking out raw materials unavailable within theProjects themselves and so on. And all because of, among other things,the population explosion.     And the Treaty of Oslo.     It seems there was a power-struggle between two sets of then-existingnations (they were something like Projects, only horizontal instead ofvertical) and both sets were equipped with atomic weapons. The Treatyof Oslo began by stating that atomic war was unthinkable, and addedthat just in case anyone happened to think of it only      tactical     atomicweapons could be used. No      strategic     atomic weapons. (A tacticalweapon is something you use on the soldiers, and a strategic weapons issomething you use on the folks at home.) Oddly enough, when somebodydid think of the war, both sides adhered to the Treaty of Oslo, whichmeant that no Projects were bombed.     Of course, they made up for this as best they could by using tacticalatomic weapons all over the place. After the war almost the wholeworld was quite dangerously radioactive. Except for the Projects. Orat least those of them which had in time installed the force screenswhich had been invented on the very eve of battle, and which deflectedradioactive particles.     However, what with all of the      other     treaties which were broken duringthe Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, by the time it was finished nobodywas quite sure any more who was on whose side. That project over thereon the horizon might be an ally. And then again it might not. Sincethey weren't sure either, it was risky to expose yourself in order toask.     And so life went on, with little to remind us of the dangers lurkingOutside. The basic policy of Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparednesswas left to the Army. The rest of us simply lived our lives and let itgo at that.  "

        "Query": "What does Alan's understanding that he needs to keep living signify?",
        "Summary_1": "Alan\u2019s realization that he must continue to live makes him become a man at thirty. Not only does it fill him with determination, but it is also what fuels him to stop the robots and end up saving everybody. He declares that no law says he has to flame-out at this age, so he continues to work his way through the jungle and against the robots. Without this realization, he would not have been motivated to use his pocket blaster against the robots and knife. Alan would also not have lived long enough to figure out the control of the robots as the computer in the headquarters building. This, itself, also lets him actually choose to go back to the area at the risk of death to find the safety button. Finally, his will to live lets him put aside his fear and goes to push the button, which ends up saving everybody. ",
        "Summary_2": "For Alan, nothing is more important than to continue his struggle throughout the work. The researcher faces insurmountable obstacles such as fights with a puma, a sticky unknown that burns through his skin, escape from killer robots, and the difficulty of making his way through the thick jungle. Although the reader points out that it takes traits like perseverance, bravery, strength, and endurance to survive in the relentless tropical forest, Alan\u2019s character is not the only condition keeping him motivated. The main character realizes that the overwhelming responsibility lies on his shoulders, realizing that the lives of children and women depend on his actions and tactics. Furthermore, Alan obtains a second wind when reminiscing about his loving wife Peggy; he shares that Peggy has brought light into his dark world, giving him the willpower to push through and fight for a better future. Even at the end, when his strength leaves his body, he decides to fight through the pain and stop the inevitable nightmare, clearing the jungle out of killer robots.",
        "Summary_3": "Before reaching the ship, Alan fought that he was going to die, and that he wasn\u2019t going to be able to shut off the killer robots. He accepts this death, but just as the robot was going to kill him he thinks about his wife. He realizes that if he dies, the robots would kill the settlers when they arrive. This pushes him to continue fighting, and when he does the defeats the robots and saves the settlers.",
        "Summary_4": "As one of the first colonists of the planet, Alan realizes that he must continue to live to save his beloved wife and all the other people traveling with her on the ship right now because they are the only humans left in this world. When pain clouds his rational judgment, and he cannot walk anymore, the feelings of love and responsibility enable him to move further. He disables one robot and, after all, switches off the computer that controls all the other ones. Even though his body is in agonizing pain, his realization makes him move forward and practically save everyone who is to land on the planet on the next day, save humanity in a sense.\n\n",
        "Article": "  There  was a sudden crashthat hung sharply in the air,as if a tree had been hit bylightning some distance away.Then another. Alan stopped,puzzled. Two more blasts, quicklytogether, and the sound of ascream faintly.     Frowning, worrying about thesounds, Alan momentarily forgotto watch his step until his footsuddenly plunged into an anthill, throwing him to the junglefloor. Damn! He cursed again,for the tenth time, and stooduncertainly in the dimness.From tall, moss-shrouded trees,wrist-thick vines hung quietly,scraping the spongy ground likethe tentacles of some monstroustree-bound octopus. Fitful littleplants grew straggly in theshadows of the mossy trunks,forming a dense underbrush thatmade walking difficult. At middaysome few of the blue sun'srays filtered through to thejungle floor, but now, late afternoonon the planet, the shadowswere long and gloomy.     Alan peered around him at thevine-draped shadows, listeningto the soft rustlings and fainttwig-snappings of life in thejungle. Two short, poppingsounds echoed across the stillness,drowned out almost immediatelyand silenced by anexplosive crash. Alan started,Blaster fighting! But it can'tbe!     Suddenly anxious, he slasheda hurried X in one of the treesto mark his position then turnedto follow a line of similar marksback through the jungle. Hetried to run, but vines blockedhis way and woody shrubscaught at his legs, tripping himand holding him back. Then,through the trees he saw theclearing of the camp site, thetemporary home for the scoutship and the eleven men who,with Alan, were the only humanson the jungle planet, Waiamea.      Stepping through the lowshrubbery at the edge of thesite, he looked across the openarea to the two temporary structures,the camp headquarterswhere the power supplies andthe computer were; and thesleeping quarters. Beyond, nosehigh, stood the silver scout shipthat had brought the advanceexploratory party of scientistsand technicians to Waiameathree days before. Except for afew of the killer robots rollingslowly around the camp site ontheir quiet treads, there was noone about.     So, they've finally got thosethings working. Alan smiledslightly. Guess that means Iowe Pete a bourbon-and-sodafor sure. Anybody who canbuild a robot that hunts by homingin on animals' mind impulses ...He stepped forwardjust as a roar of blue flame dissolvedthe branches of a tree,barely above his head.     Without pausing to think,Alan leaped back, and fellsprawling over a bush just asone of the robots rolled silentlyup from the right, lowering itsblaster barrel to aim directly athis head. Alan froze. My God,Pete built those things wrong!     Suddenly a screeching whirlwindof claws and teeth hurleditself from the smolderingbranches and crashed against therobot, clawing insanely at theantenna and blaster barrel.With an awkward jerk the robotswung around and fired its blaster,completely dissolving thelower half of the cat creaturewhich had clung across the barrel.But the back pressure of thecat's body overloaded the dischargecircuits. The robot startedto shake, then clicked sharplyas an overload relay snappedand shorted the blaster cells.The killer turned and rolled backtowards the camp, leaving Alanalone.     Shakily, Alan crawled a fewfeet back into the undergrowthwhere he could lie and watch thecamp, but not himself be seen.Though visibility didn't makeany difference to the robots, hefelt safer, somehow, hidden. Heknew now what the shootingsounds had been and why therehadn't been anyone around thecamp site. A charred blob lyingin the grass of the clearing confirmedhis hypothesis. His stomachfelt sick.     I suppose, he muttered tohimself, that Pete assembledthese robots in a batch and thenactivated them all at once, probablynever living to realize thatthey're tuned to pick up humanbrain waves, too. Damn!Damn! His eyes blurred andhe slammed his fist into the softearth.     When he raised his eyes againthe jungle was perceptibly darker.Stealthy rustlings in theshadows grew louder with thesetting sun. Branches snappedunaccountably in the trees overheadand every now and thenleaves or a twig fell softly to theground, close to where he lay.Reaching into his jacket, Alanfingered his pocket blaster. Hepulled it out and held it in hisright hand. This pop gunwouldn't even singe a robot, butit just might stop one of thosepumas.     They said the blast with your name on it would findyou anywhere. This looked like Alan's blast.     Slowly Alan looked around,sizing up his situation. Behindhim the dark jungle rustled forbiddingly.He shuddered. Not avery healthy spot to spend thenight. On the other hand, I certainlycan't get to the camp witha pack of mind-activated mechanicalkillers running around.If I can just hold out until morning,when the big ship arrives ...The big ship! GoodLord, Peggy! He turned white;oily sweat punctuated his forehead.Peggy, arriving tomorrowwith the other colonists, thewives and kids! The metal killers,tuned to blast any livingflesh, would murder them theinstant they stepped from theship!      A pretty girl, Peggy, the girlhe'd married just three weeksago. He still couldn't believe it.It was crazy, he supposed, tomarry a girl and then take offfor an unknown planet, with herto follow, to try to create a homein a jungle clearing. Crazy maybe,but Peggy and her green eyesthat changed color with thelight, with her soft brown hair,and her happy smile, had endedthirty years of loneliness andhad, at last, given him a reasonfor living. Not to be killed!Alan unclenched his fists andwiped his palms, bloody wherehis fingernails had dug into theflesh.     There was a slight creak abovehim like the protesting of abranch too heavily laden. Blasterready, Alan rolled over onto hisback. In the movement, his elbowstruck the top of a smallearthy mound and he was instantlyengulfed in a swarm oflocust-like insects that beat disgustinglyagainst his eyes andmouth. Fagh! Waving hisarms before his face he jumpedup and backwards, away fromthe bugs. As he did so, a darkshapeless thing plopped fromthe trees onto the spot where hehad been lying stretched out.Then, like an ambient fungus,it slithered off into the jungleundergrowth.     For a split second the junglestood frozen in a brilliant blueflash, followed by the sharp reportof a blaster. Then another.Alan whirled, startled. Theplanet's double moon had risenand he could see a robot rollingslowly across the clearing in hisgeneral direction, blasting indiscriminatelyat whatever mindimpulses came within its pickuprange, birds, insects, anything.Six or seven others also left thecamp headquarters area andheaded for the jungle, each to aslightly different spot.     Apparently the robot hadn'tsensed him yet, but Alan didn'tknow what the effective rangeof its pickup devices was. Hebegan to slide back into thejungle. Minutes later, lookingback he saw that the machine,though several hundred yardsaway, had altered its course andwas now headed directly forhim.     His stomach tightened. Panic.The dank, musty smell of thejungle seemed for an instant tothicken and choke in his throat.Then he thought of the big shiplanding in the morning, settlingdown slowly after a lonely two-weekvoyage. He thought of abrown-haired girl crowding withthe others to the gangway, eagerto embrace the new planet, andthe next instant a charred nothing,unrecognizable, the victimof a design error or a misplacedwire in a machine. I have totry, he said aloud. I have totry. He moved into the blackness.     Powerful as a small tank, thekiller robot was equipped tocrush, slash, and burn its waythrough undergrowth. Nevertheless,it was slowed by thelarger trees and the thick, clingingvines, and Alan found thathe could manage to keep aheadof it, barely out of blaster range.Only, the robot didn't get tired.Alan did.     The twin moons cast pale, deceptiveshadows that waveredand danced across the junglefloor, hiding debris that trippedhim and often sent him sprawlinginto the dark. Sharp-edgedgrowths tore at his face andclothes, and insects attracted bythe blood matted against hispants and shirt. Behind, the robotcrashed imperturbably afterhim, lighting the night with fitfulblaster flashes as somewinged or legged life came withinits range.     There was movement also, inthe darkness beside him, scrapingsand rustlings and an occasionallow, throaty sound like anangry cat. Alan's fingers tensedon his pocket blaster. Swiftshadowy forms moved quickly inthe shrubs and the growling becamesuddenly louder. He firedtwice, blindly, into the undergrowth.Sharp screams punctuatedthe electric blue discharge asa pack of small feline creaturesleaped snarling and clawingback into the night.      Mentally, Alan tried to figurethe charge remaining in his blaster.There wouldn't be much.Enough for a few more shots,maybe. Why the devil didn't Iload in fresh cells this morning!     The robot crashed on, loudernow, gaining on the tired human.Legs aching and bruised,stinging from insect bites, Alantried to force himself to runholding his hands in front ofhim like a child in the dark. Hisfoot tripped on a barely visibleinsect hill and a winged swarmexploded around him. Startled,Alan jerked sideways, crashinghis head against a tree. Heclutched at the bark for a second,dazed, then his kneesbuckled. His blaster fell into theshadows.     The robot crashed loudly behindhim now. Without stoppingto think, Alan fumbled along theground after his gun, straininghis eyes in the darkness. Hefound it just a couple of feet toone side, against the base of asmall bush. Just as his fingersclosed upon the barrel his otherhand slipped into somethingsticky that splashed over hisforearm. He screamed in painand leaped back, trying franticallyto wipe the clinging,burning blackness off his arm.Patches of black scraped off ontobranches and vines, but the restspread slowly over his arm asagonizing as hot acid, or as fleshbeing ripped away layer bylayer.     Almost blinded by pain, whimpering,Alan stumbled forward.Sharp muscle spasms shot fromhis shoulder across his back andchest. Tears streamed across hischeeks.     A blue arc slashed at the treesa mere hundred yards behind.He screamed at the blast. Damnyou, Pete! Damn your robots!Damn, damn ... Oh, Peggy!He stepped into emptiness.     Coolness. Wet. Slowly, washedby the water, the pain began tofall away. He wanted to lie thereforever in the dark, cool, wetness.For ever, and ever, and ...The air thundered.     In the dim light he could seethe banks of the stream, higherthan a man, muddy and loose.Growing right to the edge of thebanks, the jungle reached outwith hairy, disjointed arms asif to snag even the dirty littlestream that passed so timidlythrough its domain.     Alan, lying in the mud of thestream bed, felt the earth shakeas the heavy little robot rolledslowly and inexorably towardshim. The Lord High Executioner,he thought, in battledress. He tried to stand but hislegs were almost too weak andhis arm felt numb. I'll drownhim, he said aloud. I'll drownthe Lord High Executioner. Helaughed. Then his mind cleared.He remembered where he was.      Alan trembled. For the firsttime in his life he understoodwhat it was to live, because forthe first time he realized that hewould sometime die. In othertimes and circumstances hemight put it off for a while, formonths or years, but eventually,as now, he would have to watch,still and helpless, while deathcame creeping. Then, at thirty,Alan became a man.     Dammit, no law says I haveto flame-out      now     ! He forcedhimself to rise, forced his legsto stand, struggling painfully inthe shin-deep ooze. He workedhis way to the bank and began todig frenziedly, chest high, abouttwo feet below the edge.     His arm where the black thinghad been was swollen and tender,but he forced his hands to dig,dig, dig, cursing and crying tohide the pain, and biting hislips, ignoring the salty taste ofblood. The soft earth crumbledunder his hands until he had asmall cave about three feet deepin the bank. Beyond that thesoil was held too tightly by theroots from above and he had tostop.      The air crackled blue and atree crashed heavily past Alaninto the stream. Above him onthe bank, silhouetting againstthe moons, the killer robot stoppedand its blaster swivelledslowly down. Frantically, Alanhugged the bank as a shaft ofpure electricity arced over him,sliced into the water, and explodedin a cloud of steam. Therobot shook for a second, itsblaster muzzle lifted erraticallyand for an instant it seemed almostout of control, then itquieted and the muzzle againpointed down.     Pressing with all his might,Alan slid slowly along the bankinches at a time, away from themachine above. Its muzzle turnedto follow him but the edge ofthe bank blocked its aim. Grindingforward a couple of feet,slightly overhanging the bank,the robot fired again. For a splitsecond Alan seemed engulfed inflame; the heat of hell singed hishead and back, and mud boiledin the bank by his arm.     Again the robot trembled. Itjerked forward a foot and itsblaster swung slightly away. Butonly for a moment. Then the gunswung back again.     Suddenly, as if sensing somethingwrong, its tracks slammedinto reverse. It stood poised fora second, its treads spinningcrazily as the earth collapsed underneathit, where Alan haddug, then it fell with a heavysplash into the mud, ten feetfrom where Alan stood.     Without hesitation Alanthrew himself across the blasterhousing, frantically locking hisarms around the barrel as therobot's treads churned furiouslyin the sticky mud, causing it tobuck and plunge like a Brahmabull. The treads stopped and theblaster jerked upwards wrenchingAlan's arms, then slammeddown. Then the whole housingwhirled around and around, tiltingalternately up and down likea steel-skinned water monstertrying to dislodge a tenaciouscrab, while Alan, arms and legswrapped tightly around the blasterbarrel and housing, pressedfiercely against the robot's metalskin.     Slowly, trying to anticipateand shift his weight with thespinning plunges, Alan workedhis hand down to his right hip.He fumbled for the sheath clippedto his belt, found it, and extracteda stubby hunting knife.Sweat and blood in his eyes,hardly able to move on the wildlyswinging turret, he felt downthe sides to the thin crack betweenthe revolving housing andthe stationary portion of the robot.With a quick prayer hejammed in the knife blade\u2014andwas whipped headlong into themud as the turret literally snappedto a stop.     The earth, jungle and moonsspun in a pinwheeled blur,slowed, and settled to their properplaces. Standing in the sticky,sweet-smelling ooze, Alan eyedthe robot apprehensively. Halfburied in mud, it stood quiet inthe shadowy light except for anoccasional, almost spasmodicjerk of its blaster barrel. Forthe first time that night Alanallowed himself a slight smile.A blade in the old gear box,eh? How does that feel, boy?     He turned. Well, I'd betterget out of here before the knifeslips or the monster cooks upsome more tricks with whateverit's got for a brain. Digginglittle footholds in the soft bank,he climbed up and stood onceagain in the rustling jungledarkness.     I wonder, he thought, howPete could cram enough braininto one of those things to makeit hunt and track so perfectly.He tried to visualize the computingcircuits needed for theoperation of its tracking mechanismalone. There just isn'troom for the electronics. You'dneed a computer as big as theone at camp headquarters.      In the distance the sky blazedas a blaster roared in the jungle.Then Alan heard the approachingrobot, crunching and snappingits way through the undergrowthlike an onrushing forestfire. He froze. Good Lord!They communicate with eachother! The one I jammed mustbe calling others to help.     He began to move along thebank, away from the crashingsounds. Suddenly he stopped, hiseyes widened. Of course! Radio!I'll bet anything they'reautomatically controlled by thecamp computer. That's wheretheir brain is! He paused.Then, if that were put out ofcommission ... He jerked awayfrom the bank and half ran, halfpulled himself through the undergrowthtowards the camp.     Trees exploded to his left asanother robot fired in his direction,too far away to be effectivebut churning towards himthrough the blackness.     Alan changed direction slightlyto follow a line between thetwo robots coming up fromeither side, behind him. His eyeswere well accustomed to the darknow, and he managed to dodgemost of the shadowy vines andbranches before they could snagor trip him. Even so, he stumbledin the wiry underbrush andhis legs were a mass of stingingslashes from ankle to thigh.     The crashing rumble of thekiller robots shook the night behindhim, nearer sometimes,then falling slightly back, butfollowing constantly, moreunshakable than bloodhoundsbecause a man can sometimes covera scent, but no man can stop histhoughts. Intermittently, likephotographers' strobes, blueflashes would light the jungleabout him. Then, for secondsafterwards his eyes would seedancing streaks of yellow andsharp multi-colored pinwheelsthat alternately shrunk and expandedas if in a surrealist'snightmare. Alan would have topause and squeeze his eyelidstight shut before he could seeagain, and the robots wouldmove a little closer.     To his right the trees silhouettedbriefly against brilliance asa third robot slowly moved upin the distance. Without thinking,Alan turned slightly to theleft, then froze in momentarypanic. I should be at the campnow. Damn, what direction amI going? He tried to thinkback, to visualize the twists andturns he'd taken in the jungle.All I need is to get lost.     He pictured the camp computerwith no one to stop it, automaticallysending its robots inwider and wider forays, slowlywiping every trace of life fromthe planet. Technologically advancedmachines doing the jobfor which they were built, completely,thoroughly, without feeling,and without human mastersto separate sense from futility.Finally parts would wear out,circuits would short, and one byone the killers would crunch toa halt. A few birds would stillfly then, but a unique animallife, rare in the universe, wouldexist no more. And the bones ofchildren, eager girls, and theirmen would also lie, beside arusty hulk, beneath the aliensun.     Peggy!     As if in answer, a tree besidehim breathed fire, then exploded.In the brief flash of theblaster shot, Alan saw the steelglint of a robot only a hundredyards away, much nearer thanhe had thought. Thank heavenfor trees! He stepped back, felthis foot catch in something,clutched futilely at some leavesand fell heavily.     Pain danced up his leg as hegrabbed his ankle. Quickly hefelt the throbbing flesh. Damnthe rotten luck, anyway! Heblinked the pain tears from hiseyes and looked up\u2014into a robot'sblaster, jutting out of thefoliage, thirty yards away.      Instinctively, in one motionAlan grabbed his pocket blasterand fired. To his amazement therobot jerked back, its gun wobbledand started to tilt away.Then, getting itself under control,it swung back again to faceAlan. He fired again, and againthe robot reacted. It seemed familiarsomehow. Then he rememberedthe robot on the riverbank, jiggling and swaying forseconds after each shot. Ofcourse! He cursed himself formissing the obvious. The blasterstatic blanks out radiotransmission from the computerfor a few seconds. They even doit to themselves!     Firing intermittently, hepulled himself upright and hobbledahead through the bush.The robot shook spasmodicallywith each shot, its gun tilted upwardat an awkward angle.     Then, unexpectedly, Alan sawstars, real stars brilliant in thenight sky, and half dragging hisswelling leg he stumbled out ofthe jungle into the camp clearing.Ahead, across fifty yards ofgrass stood the headquartersbuilding, housing the robot-controllingcomputer. Still firing atshort intervals he started acrossthe clearing, gritting his teethat every step.     Straining every muscle inspite of the agonizing pain, Alanforced himself to a limping runacross the uneven ground, carefullyavoiding the insect hillsthat jutted up through the grass.From the corner of his eye hesaw another of the robots standingshakily in the dark edge ofthe jungle waiting, it seemed,for his small blaster to run dry.     Be damned! You can't winnow! Alan yelled between blastershots, almost irrational fromthe pain that ripped jaggedlythrough his leg. Then it happened.A few feet from thebuilding's door his blaster quit.A click. A faint hiss when hefrantically jerked the triggeragain and again, and the spentcells released themselves fromthe device, falling in the grassat his feet. He dropped the uselessgun.     No! He threw himself onthe ground as a new robot suddenlyappeared around the edgeof the building a few feet away,aimed, and fired. Air burnedover Alan's back and ozone tingledin his nostrils.     Blinding itself for a few secondswith its own blaster static,the robot paused momentarily,jiggling in place. In thisinstant, Alan jammed his handsinto an insect hill and hurled thepile of dirt and insects directlyat the robot's antenna. In a flash,hundreds of the winged thingserupted angrily from the hole ina swarming cloud, each part ofwhich was a speck of lifetransmitting mental energy to therobot's pickup devices.     Confused by the sudden dispersionof mind impulses, therobot fired erratically as Alancrouched and raced painfully forthe door. It fired again, closer,as he fumbled with the lockrelease. Jagged bits of plastic andstone ripped past him, torn looseby the blast.     Frantically, Alan slammedopen the door as the robot, sensinghim strongly now, aimedpoint blank. He saw nothing, hismind thought of nothing but thered-clad safety switch mountedbeside the computer. Time stopped.There was nothing else inthe world. He half-jumped, half-felltowards it, slowly, in tenthsof seconds that seemed measuredout in years.     The universe went black.     Later. Brilliance pressed uponhis eyes. Then pain returned, amulti-hurting thing that crawledthrough his body and draggedragged tentacles across hisbrain. He moaned.     A voice spoke hollowly in thedistance. He's waking. Call hiswife.     Alan opened his eyes in awhite room; a white light hungover his head. Beside him, lookingdown with a rueful smile,stood a young man wearingspace medical insignia. Yes,he acknowledged the question inAlan's eyes, you hit the switch.That was three days ago. Whenyou're up again we'd all like tothank you.     Suddenly a sobbing-laughinggreen-eyed girl was pressedtightly against him. Neither ofthem spoke. They couldn't. Therewas too much to say.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]        Being two men rolled out of one would solve       my problems\u2014but which one would I be?        I suppose that every guy reaches a point once in his lifetime when hegets one hundred and forty per cent fed up with his wife.     Understand now\u2014I've got nothing against marriage or any thinglike that. Marriage is great. It's a good old red-blooded AmericanInstitution. Except that it's got one defect in it big enough to throwa cat through, especially when you happen to be married to a womanlike Marge\u2014     It's so      permanent     .     Oh, I'd have divorced Marge in a minute if we'd been living in theBlissful 'Fifties\u2014but with the Family Solidarity Amendment of 1968,and all the divorce taxes we have these days since the women gottheir teeth into politics, to say nothing of the Aggrieved SpouseCompensation Act, I'd have been a pauper for the rest of my life ifI'd tried it. That's aside from the social repercussions involved.     You can't really blame me for looking for another way out. But a manhas to be desperate to try to buy himself an Ego Prime.     So, all right, I was desperate. I'd spent eight years trying to keepMarge happy, which was exactly seven and a half years too long.     Marge was a dream to look at, with her tawny hair and her sulky eyesand a shape that could set your teeth chattering\u2014but that was wherethe dream stopped.     She had a tongue like a #10 wood rasp and a list of grievances longenough to paper the bedroom wall. When she wasn't complaining, she wascrying, and when she wasn't crying, she was pointing out in chillingdetail exactly where George Faircloth fell short as a model husband,which happened to be everywhere. Half of the time she had a beastlyheadache (for which I was personally responsible) and the other halfshe was sore about something, so ninety-nine per cent of the time wegot along like a couple of tomcats in a packing case.   <doc-sep>    Brightside     Crossing   by Alan E. Nourse    JAMES BARON was not pleased to hear that he had hada visitor when he reached the Red Lion that evening. Hehad no stomach for mysteries, vast or trifling, and therewere pressing things to think about at this time. Yet the doormanhad flagged him as he came in from the street: \u201cA thousandpardons, Mr. Baron. The gentleman\u2014he would leave noname. He said you\u2019d want to see him. He will be back byeight.\u201d     Now Baron drummed his fingers on the table top, staringabout the quiet lounge. Street trade was discouraged at theRed Lion, gently but persuasively; the patrons were few innumber. Across to the right was a group that Baron knewvaguely\u2014Andean climbers, or at least two of them were. Overnear the door he recognized old Balmer, who had mappedthe first passage to the core of Vulcan Crater on Venus. Baronreturned his smile with a nod. Then he settled back andwaited impatiently for the intruder who demanded his timewithout justifying it.     Presently a small, grizzled man crossed the room and satdown at Baron\u2019s table. He was short and wiry. His face heldno key to his age\u2014he might have been thirty or a thousand\u2014buthe looked weary and immensely ugly. His cheeks andforehead were twisted and brown, with scars that were stillhealing.     The stranger said, \u201cI\u2019m glad you waited. I\u2019ve heard you\u2019replanning to attempt the Brightside.\u201d     Baron stared at the man for a moment. \u201cI see you can readtelecasts,\u201d he said coldly. \u201cThe news was correct. We are goingto make a Brightside Crossing.\u201d     \u201cAt perihelion?\u201d     \u201cOf course. When else?\u201d     The grizzled man searched Baron\u2019s face for a momentwithout expression. Then he said slowly, \u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019renot going to make the Crossing.\u201d     \u201cSay, who are you, if you don\u2019t mind?\u201d Baron demanded.     \u201cThe name is Claney,\u201d said the stranger.     There was a silence. Then: \u201cClaney?      Peter     Claney?\u201d     \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d     Baron\u2019s eyes were wide with excitement, all trace of angergone. \u201cGreat balls of fire, man\u2014      where have you been hiding?     We\u2019ve been trying to contact you for months!\u201d     \u201cI know. I was hoping you\u2019d quit looking and chuck thewhole idea.\u201d     \u201cQuit looking!\u201d Baron bent forward over the table. \u201cMyfriend, we\u2019d given up hope, but we\u2019ve never quit looking.Here, have a drink. There\u2019s so much you can tell us.\u201d Hisfingers were trembling.     Peter Claney shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you anything youwant to hear.\u201d     \u201cBut you\u2019ve      got     to. You\u2019re the only man on Earth who\u2019sattempted a Brightside Crossing and lived through it! And thestory you cleared for the news\u2014it was nothing. We need      details     . Where did your equipment fall down? Where did youmiscalculate? What were the trouble spots?\u201d Baron jabbed afinger at Claney\u2019s face. \u201cThat, for instance\u2014epithelioma?Why? What was wrong with your glass? Your filters? We\u2019vegot to know those things. If you can tell us, we can makeit across where your attempt failed\u2014\u201d     \u201cYou want to know why we failed?\u201d asked Claney.     \u201cOf course we want to know. We      have     to know.\u201d     \u201cIt\u2019s simple. We failed because it can\u2019t be done. We couldn\u2019tdo it and neither can you. No human beings will ever crossthe Brightside alive, not if they try for centuries.\u201d     \u201cNonsense,\u201d Baron declared. \u201cWe will.\u201d     Claney shrugged. \u201cI was there. I know what I\u2019m saying. Youcan blame the equipment or the men\u2014there were flaws inboth quarters\u2014but we just didn\u2019t know what we were fighting.It was the      planet     that whipped us, that and the      Sun     . They\u2019llwhip you, too, if you try it.\u201d     \u201cNever,\u201d said Baron.     \u201cLet me tell you,\u201d Peter Claney said.  "

        "Query": "Can you provide a summary of the storyline in THE LITTLE RED BAG?",
        "Summary_1": "On a seemingly normal flight from San Francisco to Los Angeles sits our protagonist, on his way to complete a printing order. In his initial musings, we find out that his curiosity and intuition about his fellow passengers come out of his extrasensory ability to see inside objects and human beings. The protagonist is also revealed to be able to manipulate time by stopping clocks, which he uses to his benefit with early wake-up calls. Despite his unique abilities, he laments that it renders largely useless and mundane as it often ruins surprises like Christmas gifts, requires a bit of guessing, and fails to work as gimmicks in manipulating games like Vegas slot machines. \n\nAnd so with his seemingly useless but curious gaze, the protagonist ponders about his seat-mate\u2019s purse, Amos Magaffey the purchasing agent, and rifling through luggages and identifying his own. All of sudden, his musings are halted by the discovery of a bomb in one of the luggages, with a countdown timer ticking with 10 minutes or less. The flight is still 40 minutes away from its destination and so with great effort and increasing suspicion from his seat-mate, the protagonist uses his ability to stop the ticking bomb. The flight lands safely with the bomb remaining inactivated, but the protgaonist now worries between alerting authorities - which may cast suspicion upon himself - or follow the luggage and identify who picks it up. With no one initially picking up the luggage with the bomb - the little red bag - it is delivered by the flight attendant to the rear room. Soon, a young lady arrives to pick it up. It is then that the protagonist hurries over to her in hopes of warning her of the ticking time bomb. It turns out that the likely culprit of planting the bomb is the young lady\u2019s - Julia Claremont - husband, whose motives are unknown but nevertheless unhinged. Armed with this information and a false story about the bag\u2019s suspicion, the pair decides to approach an airport policeman and inform them of the bomb. However, as they return to where they left their bags, they find that both his and Julia\u2019s luggages have been stolen by a strange man entering his grey vehicle. Turning to the airport policeman in reporting this stolen luggage, they are interrupted by an explosion in a grey vehicle. Shocked and somber, Julia and the protagonist inform the policeman that they no longer wish to report the stolen luggage, and the two begin to walk away from the airport. \n",
        "Summary_2": "The protagonist and narrator of the story is a man who long ago discovered that he had an extraordinary ability: sensing the contents of different objects, like boxes and bags, and moving light things, like feathers or a watch balance wheel, without touching them. He got in trouble for naively using his gift in the fourth grade and has kept quiet about it ever since. At the beginning of the story, he is on a plane from San Francisco to Los Angeles for a business meeting with an amusement chain owner. After studying the passengers around him, checking the window view, and mentally looking through the purse of a woman next to him, he decides to find his suitcase in the luggage compartment of the plane. The narrator is going through the content of other people\u2019s suitcases when he feels something resembling a bomb. It seems to be inside a small woman\u2019s bag and is about to go off in ten minutes, but the plane is supposed to land only in forty. Anxious and hectic, he refuses the cup of coffee from a stewardess and decides that he has to stop the clock mechanism, at least for the duration of the flight. He does it every morning with his alarm, so it doesn\u2019t seem impossible. After temporarily stopping it, his thoughts race ahead to the landing, realizing that he wouldn\u2019t be able to control the mechanism forever or tell the truth to the police. But his thinking process is disturbed by turbulence - he realizes that the balance wheel is moving again. After some tugging, pulling, and shoving, it finally becomes immovable. When the plane lands, the protagonist goes to the baggage claim and tries to find the owner of the bag. After picking up his suitcase and watching how the claim employees take the bag with the bomb to the storage room, he finally sees a blond woman called Julia Claremont - he saw her on the flight - approaching the counter. He convinces her to put the bag down and pretends that he is speaking to someone in a telephone booth while deactivating the mechanism once again. When she asks for an explanation, he invites her to an airport coffee shop and tells her everything. At the end of his monologue, she starts crying and says that her husband Joe probably put it in her bag after she had finished packing the day before. That trip was Joe\u2019s idea, but she doesn\u2019t know why her husband would do something like that. They go back to the gate to realize that the bags they had left there are gone. The protagonist sees the thief throw their bags into his car\u2019s rear seat and rapidly drive off. When they are ready to go to the police office to file a report, a loud explosion occurs somewhere near the airport. Julia and the narrator don\u2019t report luggage theft and walk away. \n\n\n",
        "Summary_3": "The protagonist finishes reading the Chronicle an hour into his flight when he sees a sea of clouds where the San Joaquin Valley should be. He observes a few passengers and sees a familiar blonde from the gate. He thinks about the printing order in Los Angeles and begins exploring the old lady\u2019s purse next to them. The protagonist's powers allow him to explore the inside of anything, but he remarks that it is not any fun because all he does is feel the shapes and guess. He goes through the lady\u2019s belongings and becomes disappointed when nothing is of interest. The scene cuts to the fourth-grade protagonist eating lunch with Miss Winters for a minor infraction. Miss Winters leaves for a moment and tells the protagonist to erase the blackboard. She cannot find her favorite mechanical pencil when she comes back, and the protagonist probes her purse to find it. He generally keeps quiet about their special gift but can move certain objects. The old lady wakes up again, and the protagonist begins to think about securing a printing deal with Amos Magaffey. He probes through belongings and finds a bomb in a woman\u2019s bag. He begins to panic and thinks about what to do when a stewardess offers him a tray full of food; the protagonist cannot bring himself to accept it. The lady next to him is concerned, but he insists that he is okay and asks for a cup of coffee. The protagonist has temporarily stopped the timer, and he thinks about what will happen once the luggage begins to move because the timer will start again. As he concentrates, the old woman notices again and asks if he is sleeping. Once the plane stops, the protagonist leaves and observes the baggage being transported from the plane to find the bag with the bomb. Once the protagonist claims his baggage, he waits to see who will claim the bag with the bomb. Although he should be meeting with Amos Magaffey, he knows that he will be unable to live with himself if he lets the bomb explode. The blonde from earlier appears to claim her bag, and the protagonist stops her by saying that he has something important to tell her. He manages to stop the bomb timer again by pretending to dial a number in the telephone booth. He and the woman then go grab a coffee, where he explains the situation; she is horrified to realize that her husband Joe is the one who put the bomb in. She introduces herself as Julia Claremont, and the both of them pay the tab to leave. They realize that their bags are stolen by the dumpy man from earlier in the lobby. The redcap tells them to tell the policeman, while a loud explosion suddenly happens. The two of them decide to forego their luggage because of the bomb and walk down the street arm in arm. ",
        "Summary_4": "A man with extrasensory ability finds a bomb on the plane. He doesn\u2019t want to tell the stewardess that there is a bomb because he cannot explain how he knows it without exposing his ability. His unwillingness to reveal his ability also originates from his childhood memory that his teacher doubts him as a thief when he tells her where her pencil is. During the whole flight, he uses his ability to move the wheel in the bomb not to let it count down to explosion. \n\nAfter the plane lands, he goes to pick up his baggage. When he grabs his bag, he also sees the one with a bomb in the baggage claim area in the airport. He waits and hesitates to tell the truth to the airport officer. When he sees the baggage claim attendant trying to move the bag with the bomb to the rear room in the airport, he almost tells the truth, but he sees a woman come and try to find her bag. After the woman takes the bag, he approaches the woman, tells her to put the bag away, and goes to grab a coffee with her. He explains everything to her, including his extrasensory ability. The woman is startled. When they decide to tell the police to deactivate the bomb and walk out of the coffee shop, they see a thief grab both of their baggage and drive away. The police come and try to help them, but they all hear a massive explosion sound. They tell the police not to report the property stolen, and they leave.\n",
        "Article": "The baggage claim attendant was staring at me. For only a moment Istared back. Then I quickly reached for my baggage check and presentedit to him. His hand hovered over the handle of the little red bag and Iwas ready to yell at him. But then, matching numbers on the tags withhis eyes, his hand grasped the handle of my own suitcase and pushed ittoward me.     Thanks, I said, taking it. I glanced ever so casually toward theremaining bag. One left over, eh?     Yeah. He was so bored I was tempted to tell him what was in it. Buthe was eying me with a well-why-don't-you-get-along? look.     I said, What happens if nobody claims it?     Take it inside. Why?     He was getting too curious. Oh, I just wondered, that's all.     I stepped on my cigarette and walked toward the air terminal entranceand put my suitcase on the stone steps there. A redcap came hurryingover.     Cab?     I shook my head. Just waiting.     Just waiting for somebody to pick up a bomb.     I lit another cigarette and glanced now and then toward the baggageclaim area. The red bag was still there. All sorts of theories ranthrough my head as to why it should still be there, and none satisfiedme.     I should not have been there, that much I knew; I should be with aman named Amos Magaffey on Sixth Street at ten o'clock, discussingsomething very mundane, the matter of a printing order. But what couldI do? If I left the airport, the attendant would eventually take thebag inside and there would be an explosion, and I wouldn't be able tolive with myself.     No. I had to stay to keep the balance wheel stationary until\u2014untilwhat?     A man in tan gabardine, wearing a police cap and badge, walked out ofthe entrance to stand on the stone steps beside me while he put on apair of dark glasses. A member of the airport police detail. I couldtell him. I could take him down to the little red bag and explain thewhole thing. Then it would be his baby and I would be off on my ownbusiness.     But he moved on down the steps, nodded at the redcap, and startedacross the street to the parking area. I could have called to him,Hey, officer, let me tell you about a bomb in a little red bag. ButI didn't. I didn't because I caught a movement at the baggage claimcounter out of the side of my eye.     The attendant had picked up the bag and was walking with it up the rampto the rear of the air terminal. Picking up my own suitcase, I wentinside in time to see him enter through a side door and deposit the bagon the scales at the airline desk and say something to the clerk. Theclerk nodded and moved the bag to the rear room.     I could visualize the balance wheel once again rocking like crazy. Howmany minutes\u2014or seconds\u2014were left? I was sweating when I moved to thecounter, and it wasn't because of the sunshine I'd been soaking in. Ihad to get as close to the bag as I could if I was going to stop theclock again.     Can I help you? the clerk asked.     No. I'm waiting for someone.     I turned my back to him, put down my suitcase, leaned against thecounter and reached out for the wheel. I found I could reach thedevice, but it was far away. When I tried to dampen it, the wheelescaped my grasp.     Do you have my suitcase?     I blinked my eyes open and looked around. The blonde in the plane stoodthere looking very fresh and bright and unconcerned. In her right handshe had a green baggage claim check.     The clerk took it, nodded, and in a moment brought out the overnightcase and set it on the scales. The girl thanked him, picked it up,glanced at me indifferently, and then started for the entrance with it.     Just a moment, I found myself saying, grabbing my bag and hurryingafter her.   <doc-sep> What is it you wish? he barked. I understood in my discussions withthe other ... ah ... civilian there'd be no further need for theseirritating conferences.     I've just learned you're placing more students abroad, Mr. Gulver. Howmany this time?     Two thousand.     And where will they be going?     Croanie. It's all in the application form I've handed in. Your job isto provide transportation.     Will there be any other students embarking this season?     Why ... perhaps. That's Boge's business. Gulver looked at Retief withpursed lips. As a matter of fact, we had in mind dispatching anothertwo thousand to Featherweight.     Another under-populated world\u2014and in the same cluster, I believe,Retief said. Your people must be unusually interested in that regionof space.     If that's all you wanted to know, I'll be on my way. I have matters ofimportance to see to.     After Gulver left, Retief called Miss Furkle in. I'd like to have abreak-out of all the student movements that have been planned under thepresent program, he said. And see if you can get a summary of whatMEDDLE has been shipping lately.     Miss Furkle compressed her lips. If Mr. Magnan were here, I'm surehe wouldn't dream of interfering in the work of other departments.I ... overheard your conversation with the gentleman from the CroanieLegation\u2014     The lists, Miss Furkle.     I'm not accustomed, Miss Furkle said, to intruding in mattersoutside our interest cluster.     That's worse than listening in on phone conversations, eh? But nevermind. I need the information, Miss Furkle.     Loyalty to my Chief\u2014     Loyalty to your pay-check should send you scuttling for the materialI've asked for, Retief said. I'm taking full responsibility. Nowscat.     The buzzer sounded. Retief flipped a key. MUDDLE, Retief speaking....     Arapoulous's brown face appeared on the desk screen.     How-do, Retief. Okay if I come up?     Sure, Hank. I want to talk to you.     In the office, Arapoulous took a chair. Sorry if I'm rushing you,Retief, he said. But have you got anything for me?     Retief waved at the wine bottles. What do you know about Croanie?     Croanie? Not much of a place. Mostly ocean. All right if you likefish, I guess. We import our seafood from there. Nice prawns in monsoontime. Over a foot long.     You on good terms with them?     Sure, I guess so. Course, they're pretty thick with Boge.     So?     Didn't I tell you? Boge was the bunch that tried to take us over herea dozen years back. They'd've made it too, if they hadn't had a lot ofbad luck. Their armor went in the drink, and without armor they're easygame.     Miss Furkle buzzed. I have your lists, she said shortly.     Bring them in, please.   <doc-sep> As if to provide an example, a figure suddenly materialized ontheir side of the bubble. The wolflike dogs bared their fangs. Foran instant, there was only an eerie, distorted, rapidly growingsilhouette, changing from blood-red to black as the boundary of thebubble cross-sectioned the intruding figure. Then they recognized theback of another long-haired warrior and realized that the audience onthe other side of the bubble had probably seen him approaching for sometime.     He bowed to the hooded figure and handed him a small bag.     More atavistic cubs, big and little! Hold still, Cynthia, a new voicecut in.     Hal turned and saw that two cold-eyed girls had been ushered into thecubicle. One was wiping her close-cropped hair with one hand whilemopping a green stain from her friend's back with the other.     Hal nudged Joggy and whispered: Butch!     But Joggy was still hypnotized by the Time Bubble.     Then how is it, Hal, he asked, that light comes out of the bubble,if the people don't? What I mean is, if one of the people walks towardus, he shrinks to a red blot and disappears. Why doesn't the lightcoming our way disappear, too?     Well\u2014you see, Joggy, it isn't real light. It's\u2014     Once more the interpreter helped him out.     The light that comes from the bubble is an isotope. Like atoms ofone element, photons of a single frequency also have isotopes. It'smore than a matter of polarization. One of these isotopes of lighttends to leak futureward through holes in space-time. Most of thelight goes down the vistas visible to the other side of the audience.But one isotope is diverted through the walls of the bubble into theTime Theater. Perhaps, because of the intense darkness of the theater,you haven't realized how dimly lit the scene is. That's because we'regetting only a single isotope of the original light. Incidentally, noisotopes have been discovered that leak pastward, though attempts arebeing made to synthesize them.     Oh, explanations! murmured one of the newly arrived girls. The cubsare always angling for them. Apple-polishers!           I     like this show, a familiar voice announced serenely. They cutanybody yet with those choppers?     Hal looked down beside him. Butch! How did you manage to get in?     I don't see any blood. Where's the bodies?     But how      did     you get in\u2014Butcher?  "

I had the feeling it was allfor me. That's where I was going when you caught up with me.     It had become a very nice day. But the bottom dropped out of it againwhen we reached the lobby.

I indicated a spot beside atelephone booth where it would be out of the way.     She didn't move. She just said, Why?     For God's sake! I took the case. She offered no resistance. I put herbag and mine next to the booth. When I turned around she was standingthere looking at me as if I had gone out of my mind. Her eyes were blueand brown-flecked, very pretty eyes, and my thought at the moment was,I'm glad the bomb didn't go off; these eyes wouldn't be looking at meor anything else right now if it had.     I've got to talk to you. It's very important.     The girl said, Why? I was beginning to think it was the only word sheknew. At the same time I was wondering why anyone would want to killsomeone so lovely.     I'll explain in a moment. Please stand right here while I make atelephone call. I moved toward the phone booth, paused and said, Anddon't ask me why.     She gave me a speculative look.     I must not have seemed a complete idiot because she said, All right,but\u2014     I didn't listen for the rest. I went into the booth, closed the door,pretended to drop a coin and dial a number. But all the time I was inthere, I was reaching out through the glass for the clock. At thisrange it wasn't difficult to stop the balance wheel.     Just the same, when I came out I was wringing wet.     Now will you please tell me what this is all about? she said stiffly.     Gladly. Let me buy you a cup of coffee and I'll explain.     She glanced at the bags. I told her they'd be all right. We followedthe short, fat man into the coffee shop.     Over coffee I explained it all to her, how I had this extrasensoryability, how she was the first person I had ever revealed it to, andhow I had discovered what was in her overnight bag.     During the telling, her untouched coffee grew a skin, her face grewpale, her eyes grew less curious and more troubled. There were tearsthere when I finished. I asked her who put the bomb in her bag.     Joe did, she said in a toneless voice, not looking at me any more butstaring vacantly across the room. Joe put it there. Behind her eyesshe was reliving some recent scene.     Who is Joe?     My husband. I thought she was going to really bawl, but she gotcontrol again. This trip was his idea, my coming down here to visit mysister. Her smile was bleak. I see now why he wanted to put in thosebooks. I'd finished packing and was in the bathroom. He said he'd putin some books we'd both finished reading\u2014for my sister. That's when hemust have put the\u2014put it in there.     I said gently, Why would he want to do a thing like that?     I don't know. She shook her head. I just don't know. And she wasclose to bawling again. Then she recovered and said, I'm not sure Iwant to know. I admired her for saying it. Joe must have been crazy.     It's all right now? she asked.     I nodded. As long as we don't move it.     I told her I didn't know how much more time there was, that I'd beenthinking it over and that the only way out seemed to be to tell theairport policeman. After I explained it to her, the girl\u2014she said hername was Julia Claremont\u2014agreed to tell him she thought there was abomb in her bag, that she had noticed a ticking and had become worriedbecause she knew she hadn't packed a clock. It wasn't good, but itwould have to do.     We've got to get it deactivated, I said, watching the fat man pay forhis coffee and leave. The sooner the better.   <doc-sep> The baggage claim attendant was staring at me. For only a moment Istared back. Then I quickly reached for my baggage check and presentedit to him. His hand hovered over the handle of the little red bag and Iwas ready to yell at him. But then, matching numbers on the tags withhis eyes, his hand grasped the handle of my own suitcase and pushed ittoward me.     Thanks, I said, taking it. I glanced ever so casually toward theremaining bag. One left over, eh?     Yeah. He was so bored I was tempted to tell him what was in it. Buthe was eying me with a well-why-don't-you-get-along? look.     I said, What happens if nobody claims it?     Take it inside. Why?     He was getting too curious. Oh, I just wondered, that's all.     I stepped on my cigarette and walked toward the air terminal entranceand put my suitcase on the stone steps there. A redcap came hurryingover.     Cab?     I shook my head. Just waiting.     Just waiting for somebody to pick up a bomb.     I lit another cigarette and glanced now and then toward the baggageclaim area. The red bag was still there. All sorts of theories ranthrough my head as to why it should still be there, and none satisfiedme.     I should not have been there, that much I knew; I should be with aman named Amos Magaffey on Sixth Street at ten o'clock, discussingsomething very mundane, the matter of a printing order. But what couldI do? If I left the airport, the attendant would eventually take thebag inside and there would be an explosion, and I wouldn't be able tolive with myself.     No. I had to stay to keep the balance wheel stationary until\u2014untilwhat?     A man in tan gabardine, wearing a police cap and badge, walked out ofthe entrance to stand on the stone steps beside me while he put on apair of dark glasses. A member of the airport police detail. I couldtell him. I could take him down to the little red bag and explain thewhole thing. Then it would be his baby and I would be off on my ownbusiness.     But he moved on down the steps, nodded at the redcap, and startedacross the street to the parking area. I could have called to him,Hey, officer, let me tell you about a bomb in a little red bag. ButI didn't. I didn't because I caught a movement at the baggage claimcounter out of the side of my eye.     The attendant had picked up the bag and was walking with it up the rampto the rear of the air terminal. Picking up my own suitcase, I wentinside in time to see him enter through a side door and deposit the bagon the scales at the airline desk and say something to the clerk. Theclerk nodded and moved the bag to the rear room.     I could visualize the balance wheel once again rocking like crazy. Howmany minutes\u2014or seconds\u2014were left? I was sweating when I moved to thecounter, and it wasn't because of the sunshine I'd been soaking in. Ihad to get as close to the bag as I could if I was going to stop theclock again.     Can I help you? the clerk asked.     No. I'm waiting for someone.     I turned my back to him, put down my suitcase, leaned against thecounter and reached out for the wheel. I found I could reach thedevice, but it was far away. When I tried to dampen it, the wheelescaped my grasp.     Do you have my suitcase?     I blinked my eyes open and looked around. The blonde in the plane stoodthere looking very fresh and bright and unconcerned. In her right handshe had a green baggage claim check.     The clerk took it, nodded, and in a moment brought out the overnightcase and set it on the scales. The girl thanked him, picked it up,glanced at me indifferently, and then started for the entrance with it.     Just a moment, I found myself saying, grabbing my bag and hurryingafter her.  "

        "Query": "What is the reason behind the protagonist's hesitation in disclosing their exceptional talent in THE LITTLE RED BAG?",
        "Summary_1": "The protagonist finds out about his extraordinary ability at an early age and quickly finds out that it is better to keep this information to himself. One incident that drove this message home occured in the fourth grade with his teacher, Miss Winters. At the time, the protagonist was sentenced to eat lunch with her as a minor punishment. After the lunch period was over, Miss Winters found herself looking for her favorite mechanical pencil, asking the class if anyone had seen it while casting a suspicious eye at the protagonist. Aiming to maintain his innocence and help out his teacher, the protagonist used his ability to find the pencil - in Miss Winters\u2019 purse all along - and let her know. Instead, he was rewarded with a note sent home. \n\nEver since then, he found it to be safer to keep his ability a secret. Despite his curiosities about other potential extraordinary individuals, he recognizes that revealing any information gained from his ability would only cast suspicion upon himself from the authorities. For example, had the protagonist immediately alerted a flight attendant or the authorities about a bomb in one of the luggages the moment he discovered it on the plane, intrusive questions about how he knew or suspicions about him being the one to plant it were highly likely to arise. \n",
        "Summary_2": "After using his gift in primary school and getting a stinging note for that, the protagonist decides to keep quiet about his ability. Even when he has to deal with a bomb he is still reluctant to share his secret because he thinks that his life would change forever and people would never trust him again since he would be considered a prying man. He doesn\u2019t believe that his gift can be used for anything meaningful, and ruining his life by revealing his ability definitely doesn\u2019t seem sensible to him. \n\n",
        "Summary_3": "The protagonist is reluctant to reveal his extraordinary ability because it will make him look suspicious. He has learned to keep quiet about it in the past because it will only cast disbelief on him. The incident with his fourth-grade teacher\u2019s mechanical pencil only made it seem like he had purposely hidden it in her purse. He has also thought about making money with the ability before, but it is not very useful because he can only feel around objects and guess what they are. Even though the protagonist feels panicked about the bomb, he knows that he cannot outright report it because nobody is aware of his ability. If he does, they will only cast suspicion on him for being the one who initially put it in there. Even when he thinks about calling ahead and convincing the authorities that he can stop the clock, there is no use. The protagonist knows that everybody will see him as a man who cannot be trusted once the secret is out and has prying eyes. ",
        "Summary_4": "The protagonist is reluctant to reveal his extrasensory ability because of his childhood experience. He learns the wisdom of not disclosing his power in the fourth grade when his teacher suspects him as a thief after he tells her where her pencil is. He used to believe that many other people have supernatural abilities like him, but the truth remains questionable. He does not want to reveal his ability because he believes that people will not believe him. Even if people believe him, his life will change, and he will become suspected of a prying person who always peeks at others\u2019 privacy.",

THE LITTLE RED BAG     By JERRY SOHL     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Worlds of If Science Fiction, January 1960.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      About an hour out of San Francisco on the flight to Los Angeles, I madethe discovery. I had finished reading the      Chronicle     , folded and putit beside me, turned and looked out the window, expecting to see theSan Joaquin Valley but finding only a sea of clouds instead. So Ireturned my attention to the inside of the plane, to the overstuffedgray-haired woman asleep beside me, to the backs of heads in seatsbefore me, across the aisle to other heads, and down to the blonde.     I had seen her in the concourse and at the gate, a shapely thing. Nowshe had crossed her legs and I was privileged to view a trim ankle andcalf, and her profile as she stared moodily across the aisle and out awindow where there was nothing to see.     I slid my eyes past her to others. A crossword-puzzle worker, atogetherness-type-magazine reader.     Inventory completed, I went back to looking at the clouds, knowing Ishould be thinking about the printing order I was going to Los Angelesfor, and not wanting to.     So I started going through the purse of the woman next to me. Perhapsthat sounds bad. It wasn't. I'd been doing it for years and nobody evercomplained.     It started when I was a kid, this business of being able to explorethe insides of things like purses and sealed boxes and locked drawersand\u2014well, human beings. But human beings aren't worth the trouble.It's like swimming through spaghetti. And I've got to stay away fromelectric wires. They hurt. Now don't ask me      how     they hurt.     Maybe you think it's fun. For the most part, it really isn't. I alwaysknew what was in Christmas presents before I unwrapped them, andtherefore Christmas was always spoiled for me as a kid. I can't feelthe color of anything, just its consistency. An apple senses about thesame as a potato, except for the core and the stem. I can't even tellif there's writing on a piece of paper. So you see it isn't much. Justthe feel of shapes, the hardnesses and softnesses. But I've learned tobecome pretty good at guessing.     Like this woman next to me. She had a short, cylindrical metal objectin her purse with waxlike stuff inside it\u2014a lipstick. A round, hardobject with dust inside\u2014a compact. Handkerchief, chewing gum, a smallbook, probably an address book, money in a change purse\u2014a few billsand coins. Not much else.     I was a little disappointed. I've run across a gun or two in my time.But I never say anything.   <doc-sep> The baggage claim attendant was staring at me. For only a moment Istared back. Then I quickly reached for my baggage check and presentedit to him. His hand hovered over the handle of the little red bag and Iwas ready to yell at him.

She said she had called her sister and the phone was busyfor a long while.     She was supposed to meet me, and when she wasn't here, I got worried.She said she isn't feeling well and asked me to take a cab. She smileda little. It was a bright, cheery thing. I had the feeling it was allfor me. That's where I was going when you caught up with me.     It had become a very nice day. But the bottom dropped out of it againwhen we reached the lobby.     The two bags weren't there.     I ran to the entrance and nearly collided with the redcap.     See anybody go out of here with a little red bag and an old batteredsuitcase?     Bag? Suitcase? he mumbled. Then he became excited. Why, a man juststepped out of here\u2014 He turned to look down the street. That's him.     The dumpy man I'd seen was walking off; Julia's bag in his right hand,mine in his left. He seemed in no hurry.     Hey! I shouted, starting toward him.     The man turned, took one look at me, and started to run. He cameabreast an old gray, mud-spattered coupe, ran around, opened the doorand threw both bags into the rear seat as he got in.     The car was a hundred feet away and gathering speed by the time Ireached where it had been parked. I watched it for a moment, thenwalked back to the entranceway where Julia was standing with theredcap, who said, That man steal them suitcases?     That he did, I said.     Just then the airport policeman started across the street from theparking lot. Redcap said, Better tell him about it.     The policeman was sympathetic and concerned. He said, We'd better getover to the office.     But we never left the spot because an explosion some blocks distantshattered the air. Julia's hand grasped my arm. Hard.     Jets, the redcap said, eying the sky.     I don't know, the policeman said. Didn't sound much like a jet tome.     We stood there. I could visualize the wreckage of an old gray coupein the middle of a street, but I couldn't visualize the driver. Thatwas all right. I didn't want to see him. I didn't know what Julia wasthinking.     She said, About those bags, and looked at me.     The officer said, Yes, miss?     I\u2014I don't care about mine. I didn't have much of anything in it.     I feel the same way, I said. Would it be all right if we didn'tbother to report it?     Well, the policeman said, I can't      make     you report it.     I'd rather not then, Julia said. She turned to me. I'd like someair. Can't we walk a little?     Sure, I said.     We started down the street, her arm in mine, as the air began to fillwith the distant sounds of sirens.  "

        "Query": "What are the different settings in THE LITTLE RED BAG and why do they play a significant role in the story?",
        "Summary_1": "This story has two settings: first, on an airplane from San Francisco to Los Angeles and second, at the Los Angeles airport in the baggage claim and arrivals terminal. The first setting - on the airplane mid flight - is highly important to the story because it is here that the protagonist discovered the bomb in the luggage. Not only that, he discovers that bomb is on a countdown with 10 minutes remaining before detonation while the flight still has 40 minutes before arrival. It is due to this fact that the protagonist utilizes his time manipulation ability to stop the clock successfully. \n\nIn the second setting, the tensions in this story continue to rise. Despite the protagonist successfully stopping the clock in the air, it appears to continue on the ground. With both the anticipation of watching to see who picks up the little red bag and dodging suspicions from the airport policeman and workers, we can imagine the hectic and panicked energy that sometimes appears in baggage claims. Additionally, an airport is filled with many people arriving and departing, which adds to the pressure the protagonist is facing in dealing with deactivating the bomb before anyone gets hurt. \n",
        "Summary_2": "The first part of the story is happening on a plane that is flying from San Francisco to Los Angeles. When the protagonist finds the bomb in one of the bags in the luggage compartment, the plane is somewhere above the mountain range north of Los Angeles - even in theory, it is impossible to land because there are no airports around this area. He stops the clock mechanism, using his extraordinary ability. After the landing, the story continues in the building of the airport, where the protagonist finds the owner of the bag with the bomb - Julia Claremont. He tells her about the bomb and how he sensed it during the flight. She cries and tells him that her husband put it in her bag after she had finished packing. They go back to the lobby and see that their suitcases got stolen. The protagonist tries to chase the thief, but the man quickly drives off with the bags. When they decide to file a report, something explodes loudly near the airport, and Julia, together with the protagonist, walks away, refusing to report the theft. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The story first begins on a plane from San Francisco to Los Angeles. The protagonist first expects to see San Joaquin Valley, but he is greeted by a sea of clouds instead. He sits next to an old woman on the plane. A little north of Bakersfield, he finds that one of the bags on the plane contains a bomb. It is forty minutes from Burbank to Lockheed Air Terminal, and there would be no place to land the plane any time soon. Once the protagonist gets off the plane, he heads to the baggage claim at the airport for his bag. When Julia gets her bag, he leads her to a telephone booth to make the fake call. Then, they leave their bags in the lobby and go to a coffee shop. The airport policeman is across the street from the parking lot. The setting of the plane is important because it is where the protagonist first discovers the bomb. Without his extraordinary ability to feel around any enclosed object, he would not be able to detect and temporarily stop the bomb\u2019s timer before it was too late. This is also significant because the plane would have exploded had he not found it. The airport is important too because that is where he meets Julia. He would not have figured out who the bag belonged to and the entire story without waiting at the airport. ",
        "Summary_4": "The story's setting is in an ordinary world where no extrasensory ability is found or known. This setting is essential because the protagonist has the extrasensory ability, which allows him to see the insides of things and move some very light objects with his mind. However, since the world does not know the existence of the ability, he cannot tell anyone about it because if he tells people the truth, people either do not believe him or see him as a freak. Furthermore, since he cannot tell anyone his ability, neither can he tell people about what he finds in any bags, like a bomb, because he cannot explain how he knows what is inside of things that do not belong to him. Therefore, this inability to reveal his extrasensory ability drives the story to progress.",

They collided. She got hisright and left jacket pockets. It was much too much for coincidence.The sidewalk was wide enough to allow four people to pass at one time.He should surely have become suspicious when two men engaged in aheated argument came along. In the ensuing contretemps they emptied hisrear pants pockets, got his wristwatch and restored the contents of thehandkerchief pocket. It all went off very smoothly, like a game of putand take\u2014the sole difference being that Humphrey Fownes had no idea hewas playing.     There was an occasional tinkle of falling glass.     It fell on the streets and houses, making small geysers of shiny mist,hitting with a gentle musical sound, like the ephemeral droppings ofa celesta. It was precipitation peculiar to a dome: feather-lightfragments showering harmlessly on the city from time to time. Domeweevils, their metal arms reaching out with molten glass, roamed thehuge casserole, ceaselessly patching and repairing.     Humphrey Fownes strode through the puffs of falling glass stillintrigued by a temperature that was always 59 degrees, by a humiditythat was always 47%, by weather that was always Optimum. It was thisrather than skill that enabled the police to maintain such a tightsurveillance on him, a surveillance that went to the extent of gettinghis fingerprints off the postman's bag, and which photographed, X-rayedand chemically analyzed the contents of his pockets before returningthem. Two blocks away from his home a careless housewife spilled afive-pound bag of flour as he was passing. It was really plaster ofParis. He left his shoe prints, stride measurement, height, weight andhandedness behind.     By the time Fownes reached his front door an entire dossier completewith photographs had been prepared and was being read by two men in anorange patrol car parked down the street.   <doc-sep> I finished my coffee in one gulp and went to pay the bill with her.I asked her why she didn't claim the bag at the same time the otherpeople had.

The man turned, took one look at me, and started to run. He cameabreast an old gray, mud-spattered coupe, ran around, opened the doorand threw both bags into the rear seat as he got in.

I feel the same way, I said. Would it be all right if we didn'tbother to report it?     Well, the policeman said, I can't      make     you report it.     I'd rather not then, Julia said.

        "Query": "How does the protagonist interact with authority figures such as the airport policeman in THE LITTLE RED BAG?",
        "Summary_1": "The protagonist\u2019s relationship with authority figures - like the airport policeman in this story - is a double edged sword. On one hand, it is figures like the policeman who are the right figure to report his suspicions towards. They are the ones equipped with the knowledge and resources on how to deal with the bomb in the little red bag. More importantly, informing them is the right thing to do and would save the lives of everyone else at the airport. On the other hand, however, we can see that the protagonist has revealed that authority figures in the past often choose to cast suspicion upon him rather than appreciate the usefulness of the knowledge that comes about his ability. If the protagonist were to approach the policeman in a suspicious manner or reveal too much information about his know-how of the bomb, it is likely that they will suspect him to be the culprit and probe him on something he is unable to explain, and hence arrest him. The protagonist has to carefully consider the implications of either decision and try to optimize both the safety of others around him and his own. \n\nThe protagonist chooses to inform the policeman of a suspicious baggage situation through the luggage\u2019s owner, Julia Clarmeont, which would deflect any suspicion on himself. However, the bomb detonates before they are able to follow through with it. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Throughout the entire story, the protagonist tries to avoid any interaction with the police because he is afraid that they will either consider him the bomber or force him to reveal his ability, thus, changing his life for the worse. Even when Julia and the protagonist were ready to file a theft report, he quickly left after hearing the explosion. Possibly, he thought that he would be under suspicion and wasn\u2019t sure that the police would believe the real story even after he revealed his secret. ",
        "Summary_3": "The protagonist and the authority figures share a fairly neutral relationship. On the plane, he first speaks to the stewardess by rejecting her food offer. The stewardess also later brings him a cup of coffee and takes the crushed cup away. At the baggage claim, the attendant continues to stare at the protagonist as he stares back. He is bored of his job and confused why the protagonist would ask about bags that are not claimed. He wants to tell the airport policeman that there is a bomb in one of the luggage, but he does not because he sees the clerk begin to move the unclaimed piece of luggage inside. The policeman remains unaware of the bomb. Later, when he and Julia speak to the policeman about a stolen bag, the policeman is sympathetic. As the bomb goes off, the policeman tells them that he cannot make them report the stolen bags after the two of them do not want their pieces of luggage anymore. ",
        "Summary_4": "The protagonist holds the worry about the explosion of the bomb, but he cannot tell the airport authority about it because he cannot explain how he knows it. Meanwhile, the airport authority works as they usually do without knowing the bomb's existence. They can see the protagonist constantly hovering around the place and looking worrisome and anxious. Still, the only thought they have is probably to regard the protagonist as a strange person that needs help. When the protagonist\u2019s baggage is stolen, the policeman comes and asks if he needs help. After hearing the explosive sound, the protagonist tells the policeman he does not want to report the case. The policeman allows him to do so.",

We started down the street, her arm in mine, as the air began to fillwith the distant sounds of sirens.   <doc-sep> The baggage claim attendant was staring at me. For only a moment Istared back. Then I quickly reached for my baggage check and presentedit to him. His hand hovered over the handle of the little red bag and Iwas ready to yell at him. But then, matching numbers on the tags withhis eyes, his hand grasped the handle of my own suitcase and pushed ittoward me.     Thanks, I said, taking it. I glanced ever so casually toward theremaining bag. One left over, eh?     Yeah. He was so bored I was tempted to tell him what was in it. Buthe was eying me with a well-why-don't-you-get-along? look.     I said, What happens if nobody claims it?     Take it inside. Why?     He was getting too curious. Oh, I just wondered, that's all.     I stepped on my cigarette and walked toward the air terminal entranceand put my suitcase on the stone steps there. A redcap came hurryingover.     Cab?     I shook my head. Just waiting.     Just waiting for somebody to pick up a bomb.     I lit another cigarette and glanced now and then toward the baggageclaim area. The red bag was still there. All sorts of theories ranthrough my head as to why it should still be there, and none satisfiedme.     I should not have been there, that much I knew; I should be with aman named Amos Magaffey on Sixth Street at ten o'clock, discussingsomething very mundane, the matter of a printing order. But what couldI do? If I left the airport, the attendant would eventually take thebag inside and there would be an explosion, and I wouldn't be able tolive with myself.     No. I had to stay to keep the balance wheel stationary until\u2014untilwhat?     A man in tan gabardine, wearing a police cap and badge, walked out ofthe entrance to stand on the stone steps beside me while he put on apair of dark glasses. A member of the airport police detail. I couldtell him. I could take him down to the little red bag and explain thewhole thing. Then it would be his baby and I would be off on my ownbusiness.     But he moved on down the steps, nodded at the redcap, and startedacross the street to the parking area. I could have called to him,Hey, officer, let me tell you about a bomb in a little red bag. ButI didn't. I didn't because I caught a movement at the baggage claimcounter out of the side of my eye.     The attendant had picked up the bag and was walking with it up the rampto the rear of the air terminal. Picking up my own suitcase, I wentinside in time to see him enter through a side door and deposit the bagon the scales at the airline desk and say something to the clerk. Theclerk nodded and moved the bag to the rear room.     I could visualize the balance wheel once again rocking like crazy. Howmany minutes\u2014or seconds\u2014were left? I was sweating when I moved to thecounter, and it wasn't because of the sunshine I'd been soaking in. Ihad to get as close to the bag as I could if I was going to stop theclock again.     Can I help you? the clerk asked.     No. I'm waiting for someone.     I turned my back to him, put down my suitcase, leaned against thecounter and reached out for the wheel. I found I could reach thedevice, but it was far away. When I tried to dampen it, the wheelescaped my grasp.     Do you have my suitcase?     I blinked my eyes open and looked around. The blonde in the plane stoodthere looking very fresh and bright and unconcerned. In her right handshe had a green baggage claim check.     The clerk took it, nodded, and in a moment brought out the overnightcase and set it on the scales. The girl thanked him, picked it up,glanced at me indifferently, and then started for the entrance with it.     Just a moment, I found myself saying, grabbing my bag and hurryingafter her.   <doc-sep> At her side and a little ahead of her, I said, Listen to me.     She looked annoyed and increased her stride toward the door.     It's a matter of life or death, I said. I wanted to wrest the bagfrom her and hurl it out through the doorway into the street, but Irestrained myself.     She stopped and stared. I noticed a short, fat man in a rumpledsuitcoat and unpressed pants staring, too. Ignoring him, I said,Please put the bag down. Over there. I indicated a spot beside atelephone booth where it would be out of the way.     She didn't move. She just said, Why?     For God's sake! I took the case. She offered no resistance. I put herbag and mine next to the booth. When I turned around she was standingthere looking at me as if I had gone out of my mind. Her eyes were blueand brown-flecked, very pretty eyes, and my thought at the moment was,I'm glad the bomb didn't go off; these eyes wouldn't be looking at meor anything else right now if it had.     I've got to talk to you. It's very important.     The girl said, Why? I was beginning to think it was the only word sheknew. At the same time I was wondering why anyone would want to killsomeone so lovely.     I'll explain in a moment. Please stand right here while I make atelephone call. I moved toward the phone booth, paused and said, Anddon't ask me why.     She gave me a speculative look.     I must not have seemed a complete idiot because she said, All right,but\u2014     I didn't listen for the rest. I went into the booth, closed the door,pretended to drop a coin and dial a number. But all the time I was inthere, I was reaching out through the glass for the clock. At thisrange it wasn't difficult to stop the balance wheel.     Just the same, when I came out I was wringing wet.     Now will you please tell me what this is all about? she said stiffly.     Gladly. Let me buy you a cup of coffee and I'll explain.     She glanced at the bags. I told her they'd be all right. We followedthe short, fat man into the coffee shop.     Over coffee I explained it all to her, how I had this extrasensoryability, how she was the first person I had ever revealed it to, andhow I had discovered what was in her overnight bag.     During the telling, her untouched coffee grew a skin, her face grewpale, her eyes grew less curious and more troubled. There were tearsthere when I finished. I asked her who put the bomb in her bag.     Joe did, she said in a toneless voice, not looking at me any more butstaring vacantly across the room. Joe put it there. Behind her eyesshe was reliving some recent scene.     Who is Joe?     My husband. I thought she was going to really bawl, but she gotcontrol again. This trip was his idea, my coming down here to visit mysister. Her smile was bleak. I see now why he wanted to put in thosebooks. I'd finished packing and was in the bathroom. He said he'd putin some books we'd both finished reading\u2014for my sister. That's when hemust have put the\u2014put it in there.     I said gently, Why would he want to do a thing like that?     I don't know. She shook her head. I just don't know. And she wasclose to bawling again. Then she recovered and said, I'm not sure Iwant to know. I admired her for saying it. Joe must have been crazy.     It's all right now? she asked.     I nodded. As long as we don't move it.     I told her I didn't know how much more time there was, that I'd beenthinking it over and that the only way out seemed to be to tell theairport policeman. After I explained it to her, the girl\u2014she said hername was Julia Claremont\u2014agreed to tell him she thought there was abomb in her bag, that she had noticed a ticking and had become worriedbecause she knew she hadn't packed a clock. It wasn't good, but itwould have to do.     We've got to get it deactivated, I said, watching the fat man pay forhis coffee and leave. The sooner the better.  "

        "Query": "What is the storyline of The Sense of Wonder?",
        "Summary_1": "The story starts off with the main character, Rikud, watching space from a viewport that is located on what seems to be a spaceship. Rikud is part of a group of men that live on the spaceship under a strict set of unspoken rules. Rikud then connects with other characters named Chuls and Crifer while getting a bath of health-rays, an example of the high technology in the ship. After the stars in the viewport start changing, Rikud doubts the way of living that the men have taken. He starts to doubt the fact that they have a set span of years, and that they have to live separately from the women (even though he doesn't know what women are). When the view of the viewport changes to \u201cgardens\u201d, Rikud begins to question more and more, and ends up finding the machine room for the ship, as well as a control center that has another viewport. Unsuccessfully convincing the others to go outside with him, Rikud becomes enraged and breaks the machine room of the ship. After realizing that Rikud has messed up the buzzers that control the actions of the people, they begin to hurt Rikud and chase him through the ship. Rikud ends up opening the door that leads outside from the control room, and they discover a new world where they can live freely with the women. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Rikud has come to watch the great changeless sweep of space for a week. The steady whining of the world that he has heard for all twenty-five years of his life have grown. Space looks different to him today because the stars are not as bright, and there is more darkness except for one very bright star that has set itself apart. Old Chuls approaches him and chides him for staring at stars when he is almost ready to foster children in five years. Rikud is nervous because no other man has these thoughts about who the Calculator will select as their mate. Chuls says that it is time for his bath in the health-rays, and Rikud goes with him. When they get to the health-ray area, Rikud feels the urge to see the stars again. The machine tells him fifteen minutes under the tub. Crifer, who is in the tube on his left, brings satisfaction to Rikud through his lame foot because it is proof that the world is not perfect. Crifer tells Rikud that he has been reading about astronomy lately in the library and stars. When Rikud tells him that the stars are changing, Crifer offers that variability may contribute. He later goes to see the stars again, observing how they make his eyes hurt and are paler than before. Rikud then sees a new shape appear in the form of a big sphere. He tries to get Chuls to see it too when the old man tells him it is time to eat, but Chuls sees and hears nothing. After a while, Rikud becomes fascinated with the gardens in the viewport. The view does not change for an entire week, and Crifer also agrees that the view looks like a garden. When he brings the conversation back to the stars appearing and disappearing, Crifer once again brings up variable. Rikud believes he has a bigger purpose in life; he decides to investigate the door at the back of the library while Crifer reads another book on astronomy. He sees another door that explains how this ship is a self-sustaining world, but Rikud cannot understand the words. He then has a traumatizing experience about going out to the garden because it is completely foreign to him. Three or four days later, Rikud feels comfortable enough to tell Crifer about what happened. He tries to convince Chuls too and grabs his blouse. Others in the crowd copy Rikud grabbing Chul\u2019s blouse, but a buzzer goes off and it is time for them to retire. Rikud then decides to break the buzzer, and everybody hates him. Nobody wants to go out with him, and they all decide to begin attacking him for breaking the buzzer. He tries to escape them, and all of them end up going into the garden. The story cuts to them realizing how beautiful it is outside, and the women begin to appear from the ship as well. ",
        "Summary_3": "This story follows Rikud who lives aboard a ship that is self-sustaining and separated by men and women. He first encounters a unique feeling when he looks through the viewport and notices that the space around him has changed. The stars in particular, previously speckled and scattered, have now been replaced by a singular bright star. \n\nWhile undergoing his bath in the health rays, Rikud laments his life on the ship. Noting the lack of authority - the closest being the automated buzzer - he ponders the perfectness of life around him and realizes he is assured by Crifer\u2019s limp because it demonstrated that not everything was perfect. When talking to him, Crifer reveals that he has begun reading again in lieu of the normal evening activity of chatting to other ship passengers. In return, Rikud reveals that the stars in the viewport are changing and Crifer suggests that it may be due to variability - a concept newly introduced in his book on astronomy. While Rikud and Crifer contemplate the meaning of variability and the connection between the concepts, Chuls interrupts by denouncing variability as a contradictory term. Once the buzzer sounds again, they all continue with their daily routine. \n\nAs Rikud looks again at the star, he finds that the landscape has changed to reveal a sphere with brown and green, just like the garden aboard the ship. Despite the hesitant acknowledgment and adamant denial from Crifer and Chuls respectively, they are unable to explain why the garden is in the viewpoint. Continuing with his exploration, Rikud enters through a set of doors no man has gone through. As he enters through each door, he receives warnings from the buzzer and encounters stranger noises. By the time he attempts to reach the third, Rikud is overwhelmed with a sense of fear and runs back. In explaining his discovery, Rikud begins to hold Chul\u2019s blouse and sets off a chain of reactions with the other men as they begin to mimic his unfamiliar but exciting activity. However, once the buzzer sounds again, the men forget their behavior. Frustrated with the buzzing, Rikud finds a metal rod and smashes all the machinery on board - destroying the buzzer and the machines that provided the ship with light, food, and water. Disrupted by their routine and lifeline to the buzzer, Crifer and the other men begin to riot against Rikud, chasing and beating him. In running away from them, Rikud finds himself at the third door and while uncertain about the potential of life beyond the door, he chooses to open it to reveal the garden and the blue-white globe. \n\nThrough the door reveals fresh air, plants, and running water. Rikud and the others step out and bask in this strange but comforting new landscape, and as the women on the ship stepped off as well, Rikud noted a sense of contentedness in a world away from the buzzer and the machines.\n",
        "Summary_4": "The story talks about a distant future where people left Earth long ago and now are living on a spaceship that is traveling through space. The ship is divided into two parts: male and female. People of two different sexes meet when they turn 30 after the so-called calculator defines their future partner.  Everyone on the ship lives by the buzzer - a sound that signifies the beginning or the end of any daily activity. They do not understand the concepts of change, world, space, authority, just living with the same schedule. They do not understand sickness since now they can take a bath in the health rays that provide them with immunity. \n\nRikud is a 25-year-old inhabitant who enjoys looking at the viewport that shows the changing stars. Sometimes he chats with Chuls, a 90-year-old fellow inhabitant of the ship, who doesn't show any traits of nonconformity and is satisfied with his regulated schedule. We meet him at the very beginning when he joins Rikud who stands near the viewport gazing at the stars. Together they go to the health rays\u2019 room. While waiting for the procedure to be over, Rikud thinks about different arbitrary notions, like authority, history, human will. In the same room lies Crifer, another inhabitant of the ship. He\u2019s short and has a lame foot which reminds Rikud of the world\u2019s imperfection. Crifer says that he found an interesting book about astronomy during his visit to the reading room. Rikud says that stars may be changing and Crifer claims that the book mentioned their variability, Chuls protests but their conversation ends quickly. Later, Rikud, during his visits to the viewport,  witnesses a rapid change in the stars, their form, location, and even experiences a novel feeling of pain while looking at one of them without breaks. Amazed, Rikud stands there and asks Chuls about the differences in the viewport and in the sound of the engines, which, as Rikud noticed, had become quieter, but the old man gives an unsatisfying answer. Later, apparently after landing, Rikud sees a huge garden in the viewport and this image doesn\u2019t change for a whole week. \n\nWhile visiting the reading room with Crifer, Rikud decides to open the door that he finds there. It leads to a room where he hears a voice saying something about unauthorized visitors. The next room is full of wires, gears, and cogs. The third one has a small viewport showing the same garden from a different side. When no one believes him later, infuriated, Rikud comes back and destroys the wired room, which he suspects to be the buzzer. Now it doesn\u2019t go off and the food mechanism is not working, leaving the ship's inhabitants confused and hungry. They become angry and try to chase Rikud. The sense of danger forces Rikud to open the little viewport from the third room and finally leave the ship. Everybody goes out into the world and finally sees the garden.\n",

Why, doesn't he look wonderful! Scrib,it's amazing! Look at him!     And indeed, Harper was stepping briskly downward, looking spry and fitand years younger. He came across to them actually beaming. It was thefirst pleasant expression they had seen on his face in years.     Well, you old dog! exclaimed Scribney affectionately. So you did itagain!     Harper smirked. Yep, I turned a neat little deal. I bought outHagerty's Enzymes and staffed the plant with the hotel's robots. Gotboth of 'em dirt cheap.

A man!Across millions of miles of space\u2014a man, like the men of the Earth.     Six times before in my life of exploration I had gazed at new realmswithin the approachable parts of our universe, but never before had theliving creatures borne such wonderful resemblance to the human life ofour Earth.     A man!     He might have been creeping on all fours.     He might have been skulking like a lesser animal.     He might have been entirely naked.     He was none of these\u2014and at the very first moment of viewing him Ifelt a kinship toward him. Oh, he was primitive in appearance\u2014but hadmy ancestors not been the same? Was this not a mirror of my own racea million years or so ago? I sensed that my own stream of life hadsomehow crossed with his in ages gone by. How? Who can ever know?

He's a friend.     Split Campbell gave me a look as if to say, Sir, you don't even knowwhat sort of animal he is, actually, much less whether he's friendly ormurderous.     There are some things I can sense on first sight, Campbell. Take myword for it, he's a friend.     I didn't say anything, sir.     Good. Don't. Just get ready.     We're going to go      out     \u2014?     Yes, I said. Orders.     And meet both of them? Split was at the telescope.     Both? I took the instrument from him. Both! Well!     They seem to be coming out of the ground, Split said. I see no signsof habitation, but apparently we've landed on top of an undergroundcity\u2014though I hasten to add that this is only an hypothesis.     One's a male and the other's a female, I said.     Another hypothesis, said Split.     The late evening sunshine gave us a clear view of our two friends.They were fully a mile away. Split was certain they had not seen ourship, and to this conclusion I was in agreement. They had apparentlycome up out of the barren rock hillside to view the sunset. I studiedthem through the telescope while Split checked over equipment for ahike.     The man's walk was unhurried. He moved thoughtfully, one mightguess. His bare chest and legs showed him to be statuesque in mold,cleanly muscled, fine of bone. His skin was almost the color of thecream-colored robe which flowed from his back, whipping lightly inthe breeze. He wore a brilliant red sash about his middle, and thiswas matched by a red headdress that came down over his shoulders as acircular mantle.     The girl stood several yards distant, watching him. This was somesort of ritual, no doubt. He was not concerned with her, but with thesetting sun. Its rays were almost horizontal, knifing through a breakin the distant mountain skyline. He went through some routine motions,his moving arms highlighted by the lemon-colored light of evening.     The girl approached him. Two other persons appeared from somewhere backof her.... Three.... Four.... Five....     Where do they come from? Split had paused in the act of checkingequipment to take his turn at the telescope. If he had not done so, Imight not have made a discovery. The landscape was      moving     .     The long shadows that I had not noticed through the telescope were aprominent part of the picture I saw through the ship's window when Ilooked out across the scene with the naked eye. The shadows were moving.     They were tree shadows. They were moving toward the clearing where thecrowd gathered. And the reason for their movement was that the treesthemselves were moving.     Notice anything? I asked Split.     The crowd is growing. We've certainly landed on top of a city. Hegazed. They're coming from underground.     Looking through the telescope, obviously he didn't catch the view ofthe moving trees.     Notice anything else unusual? I persisted.     Yes. The females\u2014I'm speaking hypothetically\u2014but they      must     befemales\u2014are all wearing puffy white fur ornaments around their elbows.I wonder why?     You haven't noticed the trees?     The females are quite attractive, said Split.     I forgot about the moving trees, then, and took over the telescope.Mobile trees were not new to me. I had seen similar vegetation on otherplanets\u2014sponge-trees\u2014which possessed a sort of muscular quality. Ifthese were similar, they were no doubt feeding along the surface of theslope below the rocky plateau. The people in the clearing beyond paidno attention to them.     I studied the crowd of people. Only the leader wore the brilliant garb.The others were more scantily clothed. All were handsome of build. Thelemon-tinted sunlight glanced off the muscular shoulders of the malesand the soft curves of the females.     Those furry elbow ornaments on the females, I said to Split,they're for protection. The caves they live in must be narrow, sothey pad their elbows.     Why don't they pad their shoulders? They don't have anything on theirshoulders.     Are you complaining?     We became fascinated in watching, from the seclusion of our ship. If wewere to walk out, or make any sounds, we might have interrupted theirmeeting. Here they were in their native ritual of sunset, not knowingthat people from another world watched. The tall leader must be makinga speech. They sat around him in little huddles. He moved his arms incalm, graceful gestures.     They'd better break it up! Split said suddenly. The jungles aremoving in on them.     They're spellbound, I said. They're used to sponge-trees. Didn't youever see moving trees?     Split said sharply, Those trees are marching! They're an army undercover. Look!     I saw, then. The whole line of advancing vegetation was camouflage fora sneak attack. And all those natives sitting around in meeting were asinnocent as a flock of sitting ducks. Split Campbell's voice was edgedwith alarm. Captain! Those worshippers\u2014how can we warn them? Oh-oh!Too late. Look!     All at once the advancing sponge-trees were tossed back over the headsof the savage band concealed within. They were warriors\u2014fifty or moreof them\u2014with painted naked bodies. They dashed forward in a widesemicircle, swinging crude weapons, bent on slaughter.  "

        "Query": "What is the location where the events of The Sense of Wonder take place?",
        "Summary_1": "The story is located in space, inside of a large spaceship. The ship has a viewport that looks outside of the ship, and is where Rikad spends most of his time. The ship also seems to have high tech, showcased in the med room. Here is where the men go to stay healthy by being showered under health rays. The ship also has a library, which is where Crifer and Rikud read about astronomy and stars, and where Rikud started to doubt more and more about their lifestyle. The ship then arrives at a planet, full of lush greenery, making Rikud more and more suspicious of the changing view. After exploring the back of the room Rikud finds a series of rooms. These rooms include both a machinery room that is full of gears and tubes as well as a control room that has a smaller viewport. The story ends in the new planet, after Rikud opened the door that led outside, knowing that they would be able to survive after he compared the new planet to the gardens that the ship had. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story is set on a self-sustaining ship. Rikud starts off observing the space sky from the viewport. Inside of the ship, there is a health-ray bath area; people lie naked under the ray tubes. It is also impossible for people to injure themselves; for example, Rikud was cushioned by something soft when he hurled himself at the wall. There is a library too, but nobody reads anymore so it is covered in dust. There is also a dusty table and a door at the back. Outside of the viewport, a garden soon appears. It is larger than the entire world, with plants that Rikud has never seen before. Later, Rikud confronts Chuls in a room where other people gather as well. There is also a sleeping area for them to rest when the buzzer goes off. The buzzer dictates their entire life. Rikud later goes to a room full of machinery, with cogs and gears that constantly spin. There is also a bright metal rod that he tugs free from the wires that hold it in place. The women\u2019s quarters are located on the ship too, but they are separated from the men. Once they go outside, the air is more fresh than any air Rikud has breathed before. There is also a blue-white globe on the horizon. The water does not flow from machines either, and there are plants everywhere. ",
        "Summary_3": "This story takes place on the inside of a ship that is described to be self-sustaining, with food, water, healthy heat lamps and social interaction all provided and guided by a buzzer. On this ship, the characters are led by a routine in which the buzzer will sound a buzz and the next step in the daily routine will commence. The daily routine occurs in a set number of rooms whereby the ship inhabitants eat, sleep, lay amongst the healthy lamp rays, chat amongst each other after dinner, etc. The only doors on this ship are between the men and women, and for rooms like the library or sleeping quarters - besides the ones that Rikud discovers that leads to the machinery room and the outside world. However, the ship itself is a perfect world, where inhabitants are protected from injury. The ship continues its journey and maintains its automation until the supposed journey ends a thousand years from the occurrence of the story - or until its inhabitants find something better. \n\nThe ship floats amongst space and houses a viewport in which characters like Rikud are able to look outside the ship and into the vastness of space and its stars. By the end of the story, the setting transitions to the outside of the ship with the lush greenery, fresh air and water. \n",
        "Summary_4": "The story is set in the distant future where people live on a big spaceship cruising through space. The ship is divided into two parts: the male and female sections, the readers follow the life of the male character, Rikud, a twenty-five-year-old man who enjoys thinking about life and looking at the viewport where we find him at the beginning of the story. Then together with the other ship inhabitant Chuls, an old man who doesn\u2019t like thought-provoking ideas, Rikud goes to the health rays room where they get the required scheduled dose of immunity, and we also meet another character - Crifer, a short limping man who occasionally likes reading in the reading room. Rikud gets back to the viewport a few times, noticing how the stars change their form and then surprisingly disappear just to be replaced by an image of a garden - this puzzles him. Later, in the reading room with Crifer, Rikud opens a mysterious doof, leading to a room with a voice that prohibits his unauthorized presence. The next room turns out to be full of wires, cogs, and gears - apparently, it\u2019s the buzzer - the sound system that controls the ship\u2019s inhabitants\u2019 daily life. The last room was a tunnel with a small viewport at the end. When no one believes Rikud, he comes back, upset and angry, and breaks the mechanism in the second room, turning off the buzzer and the food system. Hungry and violent, people chase Rikud who runs back to the small viewport door he found and opens it, leaving the craft. Now everybody was in a large garden, apparently, on some new planet their craft landed on. ",
        "Article": "At the end of the corridor, Kane stopped before a blank wall. The sweaton his face glistened dully; his chest rose and fell rapidly. Kane wasa pilot and one of the prerequisites for the job of guiding tons ofmetal between Earth and the Moon was a good set of nerves. Kane excitedeasily, his temper was fiery, but his nerves were like steel.     The end of the line, he grunted.     As though to disprove the statement, a door on his right side openedsoundlessly.     He went through the doorway as if shoved violently by an invisible hand.     The door closed behind him.     Marie threw herself at the door and beat at the metal. Harry!     Verana rushed to her side. Another door on the opposite side of thecorridor opened silently. The door was behind them; they didn't notice.     Before I could warn them, Marie floated across the corridor, throughthe doorway.     Verana and I stared at the darkness beyond the opening, our musclesfrozen by shock.     The door closed behind Marie's screaming, struggling form.     Verana's face was white with fear. Apprehensively, she glanced at theother doors that lined the hall.     I put my arms around her, held her close.     Antigravity machines, force rays, I suggested worriedly.     For several minutes, we remained motionless and silent. I recalled thepreceding events of the day, searched for a sense of normality in them.The Kanes, Miller, Verana and I lived in Lunar City with hundreds ofother people. Mankind had inhabited the Moon for over a year. Meansof recreation were scarce. Many people explored the place to amusethemselves. After supper, we had decided to take a walk. As simple asthat: a walk on the Moon.     We had expected only the familiar craters, chasms and weird rockformations. A twist of fate and here we were: imprisoned in an alienship.     My legs quivered with fatigue, my heart throbbed heavily, Verana'sperfume dizzied me. No, it wasn't a dream. Despite our incrediblesituation, there was no sensation of unreality.   <doc-sep> The officer picked up the dollar bill and fingered it with evidentinterest. He turned it over and studied the printing. United States ofAmerica, he read aloud. What are those?     It's the name of the country I come from, Jeff said carefully.I\u2014uh\u2014got on the wrong train, apparently, and must have come furtherthan I thought. What's the name of this place?     This is Costa, West Goodland, in the Continental Federation. Say, youmust come from an umpty remote part of the world if you don't knowabout this country. His eyes narrowed. Where'd you learn to speakFederal, if you come from so far?     Jeff said helplessly, I can't explain, if you don't know about theUnited States. Listen, can you take me to a bank, or some place wherethey know about foreign exchange?     The policeman scowled. How'd you get into this country, anyway? Yougot immigrate clearance?     An angry muttering started among the bystanders.     The policeman made up his mind. You come with me.     At the police station, Jeff put his elbows dejectedly on the highcounter while the policeman talked to an officer in charge. Some menwhom Jeff took for reporters got up from a table and eased over tolisten.     I don't know whether to charge them with fakemake, bumsy, peekage orlunate, the policeman said as he finished.     His superior gave Jeff a long puzzled stare.     Jeff sighed. I know it sounds impossible, but a man brought me insomething he claimed was a time traveler. You speak the same language Ido\u2014more or less\u2014but everything else is kind of unfamiliar. I belongin the United States, a country in North America. I can't believe I'mso far in the future that the United States has been forgotten.     There ensued a long, confused, inconclusive interrogation.     The man behind the desk asked questions which seemed stupid to Jeff andgot answers which probably seemed stupid to him.     The reporters quizzed Jeff gleefully. Come out, what are youadvertising? they kept asking. Who got you up to this?     The police puzzled over his driver's license and the other cards in hiswallet. They asked repeatedly about the lack of a Work License, whichJeff took to be some sort of union card. Evidently there was gravedoubt that he had any legal right to be in the country.     In the end, Jeff and Ann were locked in separate cells for the night.Jeff groaned and pounded the bars as he thought of his wife, imprisonedand alone in a smelly jail. After hours of pacing the cell, he lay downin the cot and reached automatically for his silver pillbox. Then hehesitated.     In past weeks, his insomnia had grown worse and worse, so that latelyhe had begun taking stronger pills. After a longing glance at thebig red and yellow capsules, he put the box away. Whatever tomorrowbrought, it wouldn't find him slow and drowsy.      IV     He passed a wakeful night. In the early morning, he looked up to see alittle man with a briefcase at his cell door.     Wish joy, Mr. Elliott, the man said coolly. I am one of Mr. Bullen'sbarmen. You know, represent at law? He sent me to arrange your release,if you are ready to be reasonable.     Jeff lay there and put his hands behind his head. I doubt if I'mready. I'm comfortable here. By the way, how did you know where I was?     No problem. When we read in this morning's newspapers about a manclaiming to be a time traveler, we knew.     All right. Now start explaining. Until I understand where I am, Bullenisn't getting me out of here.     The lawyer smiled and sat down. Mr. Kersey told you yesterday\u2014you'vegone back six years. But you'll need some mental gymnastics tounderstand. Time is a dimension, not a stream of events like a moviefilm. A film never changes. Space does\u2014and time does. For example, ifa movie showed a burning house at Sixth and Main, would you expect tofind a house burning whenever you returned to that corner?     You mean to say that if I went back to 1865, I wouldn't find the CivilWar was over and Lincoln had been assassinated?     If you go back to the time you call 1865\u2014which is most easilydone\u2014you will find that the people there know nothing of a Lincoln orthat war.     Jeff looked blank. What are they doing then?     The little man spread his hands. What are the people doing now atSixth and Main? Certainly not the same things they were doing the dayof the fire. We're talking about a dimension, not an event. Don't yougrasp the difference between the two?     Nope. To me, 1865 means the end of the Civil War. How else can youspeak of a point in time except by the events that happened then?     Well, if you go to a place in three-dimensional space\u2014say, a lakein the mountains\u2014how do you identify that place? By looking forlandmarks. It doesn't matter that an eagle is soaring over a mountainpeak. That's only an event. The peak is the landmark. You follow me?     So far. Keep talking.   <doc-sep> She was not only trying to get me to commit nonconformity, but makingheretical remarks besides. I awoke that time and half-expected a Deaconto pop out of the tube and turn his electric club upon me.     And I heard the voice nearly every night.     It hammered away.           What if you do fail? Almost anything would be better than themiserable existence you're leading now!          One morning I even caught myself wondering just how I'd go about thisidea of hers. Wondering what the first step might be.     She seemed to read my thoughts. That night she said,       Consult the cybsin the Govpub office. If you look hard enough and long enough, you'llfind a way.          Now, on this morning of the seventeenth day in the ninth month,I ate my boiled egg slowly and actually toyed with the idea. Ithought of being on productive status again. I had almost lost myfanatical craving to be useful to the State, but I did want to bebusy\u2014desperately. I didn't want to be despised any more. I didn'twant to be lonely. I wanted to reproduce myself.     I made my decision suddenly. Waves of emotion carried me along. I gotup, crossed the room to the directory, and pushbuttoned to find thelocation of the nearest Govpub office.     I didn't know what would happen and almost didn't care.      II     Like most important places, the Govpub Office in Center Four wasunderground. I could have taken a tunnelcar more quickly, but it seemedpleasanter to travel topside. Or maybe I just wanted to put this off abit. Think about it. Compose myself.     At the entrance to the Govpub warren there was a big director cyb, aplate with a speaker and switch. The sign on it said to switch it onand get close to the speaker and I did.     The cyb's mechanical voice\u2014they never seem to get the th soundsright\u2014said, This is Branch Four of the Office of GovernmentPublications. Say, 'Publications,' and/or, 'Information desired,' asthoroughly and concisely as possible. Use approved voice and standardphraseology.     Well, simple enough so far. I had always rather prided myself on myknack for approved voice, those flat, emotionless tones that indicateefficiency. And I would never forget how to speak Statese. I said,Applicant desires all pertinent information relative assignment,change or amendment of State Serial designations, otherwise generallyreferred to as nomenclature.     There was a second's delay while the audio patterns tripped relays andbrought the memory tubes in.     Then the cyb said, Proceed to Numbering and Identity section. Consultalphabetical list and diagram on your left for location of same.     Thanks, I said absent-mindedly.     I started to turn away and the cyb said, Information on tanks ismilitary information and classified. State authorization for\u2014     I switched it off.  "

        "Query": "What role does \"variability\" play in The Sense of Wonder?",
        "Summary_1": "Variability is a big part of the story. The inhabitants of the ship have always lived the same routine, the same life, and when things start to change they don\u2019t know how to react. First, when the view of the ship starts to change, Rikud doesn\u2019t understand what it means, and begins to think about the meaning of change. These thoughts are enhanced when Crifer told him that he had been reading Astronomy, and that stars are variable. When the ship lands on the new planet, and Rikud begins to explore, he starts to think about the variability of doors, and the meaning of going through doors and how it relates to the viewport. In the end, the change from having the buzzers to not knowing how to act is what sparks the violence of the men towards Rikud. This is due to the fact that he changed their routine, and having never experienced it, they don\u2019t know how to react to change. ",
        "Summary_2": "Variability signifies the change to the lifestyle on the self-sustaining ship. When Crifer brings up the variability of the stars, Chuls is quick to refute the idea and says that nothing is variable. In the story, variability exists when Rikuld begins to notice the sweep of space and the stars. While the others are perfectly content with their lives and believe that they will not leave the ship, Rikuld differentiates from the rest. He wants to explore the greater world and does not believe that their only function is to live on the ship, conceive children, and eventually grow to die. The variability that is he believes he has a greater purpose, and this differentiates him from the rest. It also motivates him to see the world that the ship has landed in once the landscape does not change for a week. ",
        "Summary_3": "The concept of variability is significant because it exists in contrast to the world that is presented in the story. The ship, the routine, and the characters that follow the routine are not variable. Everything is premeditated and controlled, with no room for change. However, the changing landscape outside the viewport and Crifer\u2019s base understanding of the astronomy book introduces this idea of variability, which Rikud in particular latches onto as the potential answer for the dissonance he is experiencing. The stars, the sphere, and the garden that they see - could it be due to variability? \n\nAs the story progresses, Rikud begins to better understand the meaning of variability and finds that many concepts around him are in fact variable, like Crifer\u2019s feelings towards him. \n",
        "Summary_4": "The story describes the life of people of the future: they live on a big spaceship with a regulated daily schedule consisting of health ray procedures, eating, and limited free time. No one questions the limits of their world, so no one understands the phenomenon of change as it has never occurred in their lives on the craft. Rikud, a young inhabitant of the ship, analyzes the changing views of the stars and tries to explain them. His friend, Crifer, tells him about the stars\u2019 feature called variability that he read about in an old astronomy book. They both do not really understand this concept, neither don\u2019t they understand change, but Rikud needs to rationalize why stars become brighter and change form. His attempts are also hindered by Chuls, an old man who actively claims that both change and variability are useless terms with no real meaning. When the views change again, and the image of a garden replaces the stars, Rikud is even more puzzled. Crifer mentions the variability of stars again, explaining their disappearance, and Rikud starts thinking about the concept of change. He uses the word variable to label everything that is not functioning normally or is unknown to him, including doors, the rooms he finds near the reading room, and people. The term both serves as a stepping stone to an understanding of changes and as an independent notion that explains the differences in behavior, environment, etc. After all, seeking the explanation of change and variability, Rikud opens the viewport-door and enables the others to step outside and see the garden that their craft landed in.

        "Article": "Most of the cousins gasped as the truth began to percolate through.     I knew from the very beginning, Conrad finished, that I didn'thave to do anything at all. I just had to wait and you would destroyyourselves.     I don't understand, Bartholomew protested, searching the faces of thecousins closest to him. What does he mean, we have never existed?We're here, aren't we? What\u2014     Shut up! Raymond snapped. He turned on Martin. You don't seemsurprised.     The old man grinned. I'm not. I figured it all out years ago.     At first, he had wondered what he should do. Would it be better tothrow them into a futile panic by telling them or to do nothing? Hehad decided on the latter; that was the role they had assigned him\u2014towatch and wait and keep out of things\u2014and that was the role he wouldplay.     You knew all the time and you didn't tell us! Raymond spluttered.After we'd been so good to you, making a gentleman out of you insteadof a criminal.... That's right, he snarled, a criminal! An alcoholic,a thief, a derelict! How do you like that?     Sounds like a rich, full life, Martin said wistfully.     What an exciting existence they must have done him out of! But then, hecouldn't help thinking, he\u2014he and Conrad together, of course\u2014had donethem out of      any     kind of existence. It wasn't his responsibility,though; he had done nothing but let matters take whatever course wasdestined for them. If only he could be sure that it was the bettercourse, perhaps he wouldn't feel that nagging sense of guilt insidehim. Strange\u2014where, in his hermetic life, could he possibly havedeveloped such a queer thing as a conscience?     Then we've wasted all this time, Ninian sobbed, all this energy, allthis money, for nothing!     But you were nothing to begin with, Martin told them. And then,after a pause, he added, I only wish I could be sure there had beensome purpose to this.     He didn't know whether it was approaching death that dimmed his sight,or whether the frightened crowd that pressed around him was growingshadowy.     I wish I could feel that some good had been done in letting you bewiped out of existence, he went on voicing his thoughts. But I knowthat the same thing that happened to your worlds and my world willhappen all over again. To other people, in other times, but again. It'sbound to happen. There isn't any hope for humanity.     One man couldn't really change the course of human history, he toldhimself. Two men, that was\u2014one real, one a shadow.     Conrad came close to the old man's bed. He was almost transparent.     No, he said, there is hope. They didn't know the time transmitterworks two ways. I used it for going into the past only once\u2014just thisonce. But I've gone into the future with it many times. And\u2014 hepressed Martin's hand\u2014believe me, what I did\u2014what      we     did, you andI\u2014serves a purpose. It will change things for the better. Everythingis going to be all right.   <doc-sep> Now Crifer said, I've been reading again, Rikud.     Yes? Almost no one read any more, and the library was heavy with thesmell of dust. Reading represented initiative on the part of Crifer; itmeant that, in the two unoccupied hours before sleep, he went to thelibrary and listened to the reading machine. Everyone else simply satabout and talked. That was the custom. Everyone did it.     But if he wasn't reading himself, Rikud usually went to sleep. All thepeople ever talked about was what they had done during the day, and itwas always the same.     Yes, said Crifer. I found a book about the stars. They're alsocalled astronomy, I think.     This was a new thought to Rikud, and he propped his head up on oneelbow. What did you find out?     That's about all. They're just called astronomy, I think.     Well, where's the book? Rikud would read it tomorrow.     I left it in the library. You can find several of them under'astronomy,' with a cross-reference under 'stars.' They're synonymousterms.     You know, Rikud said, sitting up now, the stars in the viewport arechanging.     Changing? Crifer questioned the fuzzy concept as much as hequestioned what it might mean in this particular case.     Yes, there are less of them, and one is bigger and brighter than theothers.     Astronomy says some stars are variable, Crifer offered, but Rikudknew his lame-footed companion understood the word no better than hedid.     Over on Rikud's right, Chuls began to dress. Variability, he toldthem, is a contradictory term. Nothing is variable. It can't be.     I'm only saying what I read in the book, Crifer protested mildly.     Well, it's wrong. Variability and change are two words withoutmeaning.     People grow old, Rikud suggested.     A buzzer signified that his fifteen minutes under the rays were up, andChuls said, It's almost time for me to eat.     Rikud frowned. Chuls hadn't even seen the connection between the twoconcepts, yet it was so clear. Or was it? He had had it a moment ago,but now it faded, and change and old were just two words.     His own buzzer sounded a moment later, and it was with a strangefeeling of elation that he dressed and made his way back to theviewport. When he passed the door which led to the women's half of theworld, however, he paused. He wanted to open that door and see a woman.He had been told about them and he had seen pictures, and he dimlyremembered his childhood among women. But his feelings had changed;this was different. Again there were inexplicable feelings\u2014strangechannelings of Rikud's energy in new and confusing directions.     He shrugged and reserved the thought for later. He wanted to see thestars again.   <doc-sep> Crifer was tugging at him, trying to pull him away from the door, andsomeone was grabbing at his legs, trying to make him fall. He kickedout and the hands let go, and then he turned the handle and shoved theweight of his body with all his strength against the door.     It opened and he stepped outside into the warmth.     The air was fresh, fresher than any air Rikud had ever breathed. Hewalked around aimlessly, touching the plants and bending down to feelthe floor, and sometimes he looked at the blue-white globe on thehorizon. It was all very beautiful.     Near the ship, water that did not come from a machine gurgled acrossthe land, and Rikud lay down and drank. It was cool and good, and whenhe got up, Crifer and Wilm were outside the world, and some of theothers followed. They stood around for a long time before going to thewater to drink.       Rikud sat down and tore off a piece of a plant, munching on it. It wasgood.     Crifer picked his head up, from the water, his chin wet. Even feelingsare variable. I don't hate you now, Rikud.     Rikud smiled, staring at the ship. People are variable, too, Crifer.That is, if those creatures coming from the ship are people.     They're women, said Crifer.     They were strangely shaped in some ways, and yet in others completelyhuman, and their voices were high, like singing. Rikud found them oddlyexciting. He liked them. He liked the garden, for all its hugeness.With so many people, and especially now with women, he was not afraid.     It was much better than the small world of machinery, buzzer,frightening doors and women by appointment only.     Rikud felt at home.   "

        "Query": "What is the connection between Rikud and Chuls in The Sense of Wonder?",
        "Summary_1": "At the beginning of the story, the relationship between Rikud and Chuls seemed like a mentor-mentee or like a father-son relationship. Rikud was a young forward-thinker, and Chuls was an older man who had already lived a lot and tried to guide Rikud on how he should live. As the story progresses more, Rikud seems to stray from Chuls\u2019 guidance and tries to figure out what to think on his own. When Rikud tries to explain his reasoning, Chuls doesn\u2019t understand because he has lived so much time inside of the ship and its routine that he can\u2019t seem to doubt it. This led to Rikud getting mildly violent at Chuls because he couldn\u2019t understand why Chuls didn\u2019t believe him. ",
        "Summary_2": "Initially, Chuls is very dismissive of Rikud\u2019s ideas. He does not listen to Rikud much, instead telling him to take a health-ray bath and eat. Chuls is content with how he lives, but he does care for Rikud when he tells him to eat. Rikud, on the other hand, does not like that Chuls is content with how he lives his life. He is angry that Chuls is so dismissive of his ideas and thinks that all the other man cares about is eating. When Rikud asks Chuls to come to see the garden, he refuses and thinks about eating again. Rikud is furious and grabs him by the shirt; everybody else copies this action. Although Chuls is not as angry as Crifer when Rikud breaks the machine, he is sad because he does not have a purpose of living by the buzzer\u2019s announcement. ",
        "Summary_3": "The relationship between Rikud and Chuls is antagonistic. Rikud is presented as the wild card who sees the changing star, who begins to question the routine aboard the ship and who ultimately incites new and unfamiliar behaviors and feelings amongst the other men on the ship. On the other hand, Chuls is an old man who follows the rule without question and content with the life he lives. \n\nFor example, when Rikud and Crifer begin to discuss the word \u201cvariability\u201d and the potential of the changing stars being variable, Chuls quickly shuts down this idea by adamantly declaring that the word itself is a contradiction - and that they should go eat. When looking at the changed landscape of the star through the viewport, Rikud and Crifer begin to question why the garden is in the viewport, but Chuls simply says that it is the viewport. Therein lies the tension between these two characters, with Rikud constantly questioning and probing and Chuls remaining steadfast in his routine and knowledge of the world. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Rikud and Chuls are two inhabitants of the same spaceship where people now live while traveling to their new home. Rikud is a young curious man, he thinks about the future and the past and sometimes thinks outside the box. Chuls, on the other hand, is an old man who got used to the same regular daily schedule that everybody lives by. He is not seeking answers and has no urge to understand the world or see anything beyond the walls of the spaceship. When Rikud notices the changes in the viewport he tries to find an explanation and define the term \u2018change\u2019. Bur Chuls is consciously ignoring anything that reminds him of change, he can see the same view, though the stars changed their size and location, hear the same engine sound, though in reality, it became quieter. Rikud even becomes angry for the first time, grabbing Chuls\u2019 blouse when the man doesn\u2019t believe that Rikud found some new rooms with another viewport. Admitting this would mean admitting the reality of change and Chuls can\u2019t do that.  When Rikud breaks the buzzer, the sound mechanism that controls the ship\u2019s inhabitants\u2019 daily life, Chuls cannot realize that eating is possible without it, again showing how dependent he is on the ship\u2019s regulated way of life. ",
        "Article": "A hardly perceptible purple glow pervaded the air in the room of thehealth-rays. Perhaps two score men lay about, naked, under the raytubes. Chuls stripped himself and selected the space under a vacanttube. Rikud, for his part, wanted to get back to the viewport and watchthe one new bright star. He had the distinct notion it was growinglarger every moment. He turned to go, but the door clicked shut and ametallic voice said. Fifteen minutes under the tubes, please.     Rikud muttered to himself and undressed. The world had begun to annoyhim. Now why shouldn't a man be permitted to do what he wanted, whenhe wanted to do it?      There     was a strange thought, and Rikud's brainwhirled once more down the tortuous course of half-formed questions andunsatisfactory answers.     He had even wondered what it was like to get hurt. No one ever gothurt. Once, here in this same ray room, he had had the impulse to hurlhimself head-first against the wall, just to see what would happen.But something soft had cushioned the impact\u2014something which had comeinto being just for the moment and then abruptly passed into non-beingagain, something which was as impalpable as air.     Rikud had been stopped in this action, although there was no realauthority to stop him. This puzzled him, because somehow he felt thatthere should have been authority. A long time ago the reading machinein the library had told him of the elders\u2014a meaningless term\u2014who hadgoverned the world. They told you to do something and you did it, butthat was silly, because now no one told you to do anything. You onlylistened to the buzzer.     And Rikud could remember the rest of what the reading machine had said.There had been a revolt\u2014again a term without any real meaning, a termthat could have no reality outside of the reading machine\u2014and theelders were overthrown. Here Rikud had been lost utterly. The peoplehad decided that they did not know where they were going, or why, andthat it was unfair that the elders alone had this authority. They wereborn and they lived and they died as the elders directed, like littlecogs in a great machine. Much of this Rikud could not understand, buthe knew enough to realize that the reading machine had sided with thepeople against the elders, and it said the people had won.     Now in the health room, Rikud felt a warmth in the rays. Grudgingly, hehad to admit to himself that it was not unpleasant. He could see thelook of easy contentment on Chuls' face as the rays fanned down uponhim, bathing his old body in a forgotten magic which, many generationsbefore Rikud's time, had negated the necessity for a knowledge ofmedicine. But when, in another ten years, Chuls would perish of oldage, the rays would no longer suffice. Nothing would, for Chuls. Rikudoften thought of his own death, still seventy-five years in the future,not without a sense of alarm. Yet old Chuls seemed heedless, with onlya decade to go.     Under the tube at Rikud's left lay Crifer. The man was short and heavythrough the shoulders and chest, and he had a lame foot. Every timeRikud looked at that foot, it was with a sense of satisfaction. True,this was the only case of its kind, the exception to the rule, but itproved the world was not perfect. Rikud was guiltily glad when he sawCrifer limp.     But, if anyone else saw it, he never said a word. Not even Crifer.   <doc-sep>    The Sense of Wonder     By MILTON LESSER     Illustrated by HARRY ROSENBAUM     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from     Galaxy Science Fiction September 1951.     Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that     the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]      When nobody aboard ship remembers where it's     going, how can they tell when it has arrived?      Every day for a week now, Rikud had come to the viewport to watchthe great changeless sweep of space. He could not quite explain thefeelings within him; they were so alien, so unnatural. But ever sincethe engines somewhere in the rear of the world had changed their tone,from the steady whining Rikud had heard all twenty-five years of hislife, to the sullen roar that came to his ears now, the feelings hadgrown.     If anyone else had noticed the change, he failed to mention it. Thisdisturbed Rikud, although he could not tell why. And, because he hadrealized this odd difference in himself, he kept it locked up insidehim.     Today, space looked somehow different. The stars\u2014it was a meaninglessconcept to Rikud, but that was what everyone called the brightpinpoints of light on the black backdrop in the viewport\u2014were notapparent in the speckled profusion Rikud had always known. Instead,there was more of the blackness, and one very bright star set apartby itself in the middle of the viewport.     If he had understood the term, Rikud would have told himself this wasodd. His head ached with the half-born thought. It was\u2014it was\u2014whatwas it?     Someone was clomping up the companionway behind Rikud. He turned andgreeted gray-haired old Chuls.     In five more years, the older man chided, you'll be ready to sirechildren. And all you can do in the meantime is gaze out at the stars.     Rikud knew he should be exercising now, or bathing in the rays of thehealth-lamps. It had never occurred to him that he didn't feel like it;he just didn't, without comprehending.     Chuls' reminder fostered uneasiness. Often Rikud had dreamed of thetime he would be thirty and a father. Whom would the Calculator selectas his mate? The first time this idea had occurred to him, Rikudignored it. But it came again, and each time it left him with a feelinghe could not explain. Why should he think thoughts that no other manhad? Why should he think he was thinking such thoughts, when it alwaysembroiled him in a hopeless, infinite confusion that left him with aheadache?     Chuls said, It is time for my bath in the health-rays. I saw you hereand knew it was your time, too....     His voice trailed off. Rikud knew that something which he could notexplain had entered the elder man's head for a moment, but it haddeparted almost before Chuls knew of its existence.     I'll go with you, Rikud told him.   <doc-sep> Now Crifer said, I've been reading again, Rikud.     Yes? Almost no one read any more, and the library was heavy with thesmell of dust. Reading represented initiative on the part of Crifer; itmeant that, in the two unoccupied hours before sleep, he went to thelibrary and listened to the reading machine. Everyone else simply satabout and talked. That was the custom. Everyone did it.     But if he wasn't reading himself, Rikud usually went to sleep. All thepeople ever talked about was what they had done during the day, and itwas always the same.     Yes, said Crifer. I found a book about the stars. They're alsocalled astronomy, I think.     This was a new thought to Rikud, and he propped his head up on oneelbow. What did you find out?     That's about all. They're just called astronomy, I think.     Well, where's the book? Rikud would read it tomorrow.     I left it in the library. You can find several of them under'astronomy,' with a cross-reference under 'stars.' They're synonymousterms.     You know, Rikud said, sitting up now, the stars in the viewport arechanging.     Changing? Crifer questioned the fuzzy concept as much as hequestioned what it might mean in this particular case.     Yes, there are less of them, and one is bigger and brighter than theothers.     Astronomy says some stars are variable, Crifer offered, but Rikudknew his lame-footed companion understood the word no better than hedid.     Over on Rikud's right, Chuls began to dress. Variability, he toldthem, is a contradictory term. Nothing is variable. It can't be.     I'm only saying what I read in the book, Crifer protested mildly.     Well, it's wrong. Variability and change are two words withoutmeaning.     People grow old, Rikud suggested.     A buzzer signified that his fifteen minutes under the rays were up, andChuls said, It's almost time for me to eat.     Rikud frowned. Chuls hadn't even seen the connection between the twoconcepts, yet it was so clear. Or was it? He had had it a moment ago,but now it faded, and change and old were just two words.     His own buzzer sounded a moment later, and it was with a strangefeeling of elation that he dressed and made his way back to theviewport. When he passed the door which led to the women's half of theworld, however, he paused. He wanted to open that door and see a woman.He had been told about them and he had seen pictures, and he dimlyremembered his childhood among women. But his feelings had changed;this was different. Again there were inexplicable feelings\u2014strangechannelings of Rikud's energy in new and confusing directions.     He shrugged and reserved the thought for later. He wanted to see thestars again.

        "Query": "What is the importance of the viewport in The Sense of Wonder?",
        "Summary_1": "The viewport is one of the most important parts of the story. Rikud goes to the viewport in order to get a break from his routine life inside the ship. The changing stars that he could see through the viewport is what inspired Rikud to think more about the changes going on around him and to explore hhhhhh\bhe ship. Ultimately it is the viewport that showed him the possibility of a new life on the planet. The viewport essentially lead Rikud to breaking the engine room and to opening the door of the ship. ",
        "Summary_2": "The viewport that Rikud looks through initially shows a great changeless sweep of space. He believes that there is a greater purpose for him in the world, even if he has spent his entire life on the ship. There is a bright star that Rikuld sees through it, and it bothers him nonstop. When he looks through the viewport again, he sees that the bright central star has become a blue-tinged globe of light. This is extremely significant because what Rikud is observing is actually the ship\u2019s landing on a new planet. This motivates him to investigate further, and he finds that the scenery has not changed for a week after a garden begins to enter the viewport\u2019s field of vision. The viewport also serves as a reason for Rikud to break the ship\u2019s buzzer announcement system; this stops everybody from living their pre-programmed way of life and to leave the ship for the more mysterious world outside. Without the viewport, Rikud would have never noticed the changes in space and as they eventually land on the planet. ",
        "Summary_3": "The viewport in this story is the only portal in which characters in this story are able to look beyond their perfect, constructed world aboard the ship. It is the only window into what exists outside of the ship, and throughout the story, we can see that it is where change and a variability in landscape is seen. \n\nIt is significant because what Rikud sees through the viewport is what begins to create dissonance in his relationship with the world around him. It is only when he begins to notice the change in the stars, the appearance of a sphere with blue and green, and a bright light that he further questions why the men live on the ship and not outside. Additionally, it is significant because the viewport is one-dimensional in that all information is one-way. Whatever Rikud and the other men see through the viewport can only be explained by them, and so they have no way of knowing if it is true or not. As seen in the story, many times the other men are reluctant to even wonder what it is or simply shrug and move on. \n",
        "Summary_4": "The story talks about our distant future. Humans left Earth long ago and now live on a spaceship that has been traveling through space for centuries. Everyone on the ship lives by the buzzer - a sound that signifies the beginning or the end of any daily activity: eating, sleeping, free time. They do not understand the concepts of change, space, because their life is limited to the rooms of the ship. The main character, Rikud, is a young man who enjoys looking at the viewport - it allows him to see the stars surrounding the ship and the cosmic blackness. He spends some time every day contemplating the view and notices when the stars change in size and location, disappearing from the view. This observation makes him think about variability and change, what these terms mean. When sometime later Rikud sees an unchanging image of a garden instead of cosmos in the viewport, he starts questioning the space he\u2019s so long lived in. His attempt to rationalize this makes him more curious, and soon he finds another viewport that also looks like a door to the outer world. A different angle of view surprises him since he has always thought that there\u2019s only one possible viewpoint on this ship. After days of chaotic thoughts and revelations, after breaking the buzzer and causing the inhabitants\u2019 anger, Rikud finally opens the small viewport and sets foot in the garden, allowing everyone else to leave the ship, too.

Rikud knew that something which he could notexplain had entered the elder man's head for a moment, but it haddeparted almost before Chuls knew of its existence.     I'll go with you, Rikud told him.   <doc-sep> He had long wondered about the door in the back of the library, andnow, as Crifer sat cross-legged on one of the dusty tables, readingmachine and book on astronomy or stars in his lap, Rikud approached thedoor.     What's in here? he demanded.     It's a door, I think, said Crifer.     I know, but what's beyond it?     Beyond it? Oh, you mean      through     the door.     Yes.     Well, Crifer scratched his head, I don't think anyone ever openedit. It's only a door.     I will, said Rikud.     You will what?     Open it. Open the door and look inside.     A long pause. Then, Can you do it?     I think so.     You can't, probably. How can anyone go where no one has been before?There's nothing. It just isn't. It's only a door, Rikud.     No\u2014 Rikud began, but the words faded off into a sharp intake ofbreath. Rikud had turned the knob and pushed. The door opened silently,and Crifer said, Doors are variable, too, I think.     Rikud saw a small room, perhaps half a dozen paces across, at the otherend of which was another door, just like the first. Halfway across,Rikud heard a voice not unlike that of the reading machine.     He missed the beginning, but then:       \u2014therefore, permit no unauthorized persons to go through thisdoor. The machinery in the next room is your protection against therigors of space. A thousand years from now, journey's end, you mayhave discarded it for something better\u2014who knows? But if you havenot, then here is your protection. As nearly as possible, this shipis a perfect, self-sustaining world. It is more than that: it ishuman-sustaining as well. Try to hurt yourself and the ship will notpermit it\u2014within limits, of course. But you can damage the ship, andto avoid any possibility of that, no unauthorized persons are to bepermitted through this door\u2014       Rikud gave the voice up as hopeless. There were too many confusingwords. What in the world was an unauthorized person? More interestingthan that, however, was the second door. Would it lead to anothervoice? Rikud hoped that it wouldn't.     When he opened the door a strange new noise filled his ears, a gentlehumming, punctuated by a      throb-throb-throb     which sounded not unlikethe booming of the engines last week, except that this new sound didn'tblast nearly so loudly against his eardrums. And what met Rikud'seyes\u2014he blinked and looked again, but it was still there\u2014cogs andgears and wheels and nameless things all strange and beautiful becausethey shone with a luster unfamiliar to him.     Odd, Rikud said aloud. Then he thought, Now there's a good word, butno one quite seems to know its meaning.     Odder still was the third door. Rikud suddenly thought there mightexist an endless succession of them, especially when the third oneopened on a bare tunnel which led to yet another door.     Only this one was different. In it Rikud saw the viewport. But how? Theviewport stood on the other end of the world. It did seem smaller, and,although it looked out on the garden, Rikud sensed that the topographywas different. Then the garden extended even farther than he hadthought. It was endless, extending all the way to a ridge of mounds wayoff in the distance.     And this door one could walk through, into the garden. Rikud put hishand on the door, all the while watching the garden through the newviewport. He began to turn the handle.     Then he trembled.     What would he do out in the garden?     He couldn't go alone. He'd die of the strangeness. It was a sillythought; no one ever died of anything until he was a hundred. Rikudcouldn't fathom the rapid thumping of his heart. And Rikud's mouth feltdry; he wanted to swallow, but couldn't.     Slowly, he took his hand off the door lever. He made his way backthrough the tunnel and then through the room of machinery and finallythrough the little room with the confusing voice to Crifer.     By the time he reached the lame-footed man, Rikud was running. He didnot dare once to look back. He stood shaking at Crifer's side, andsweat covered him in a clammy film. He never wanted to look at thegarden again. Not when he knew there was a door through which he couldwalk and then might find himself in the garden.     It was so big.   <doc-sep> Now the vapor had departed, except for a few tenuous whisps. For amoment Rikud thought he could see the gardens rearward in the world.But that was silly. What were the gardens doing in the viewport? Andbesides, Rikud had the distinct feeling that here was something farvaster than the gardens, although all of it existed in the viewportwhich was no wider than the length of his body. The gardens, moreover,did not jump and dance before his eyes the way the viewport gardensdid. Nor did they spin. Nor did the trees grow larger with every jolt.     Rikud sat down hard. He blinked.     The world had come to rest on the garden of the viewport.  "
